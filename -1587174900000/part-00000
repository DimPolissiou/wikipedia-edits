Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

Weicker Jr.]], an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%.

However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.\n\nConnecticut levies a 6.35% state [[sales tax]] on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.<ref name=\"2011Sect6Summary\">{{cite web |title=Summary of Tax Provisions Contained in 2011 Conn.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house.

There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives.

Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house.

There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives.

The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

(PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]].

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

As a result, the joint  Army, Marine Corps and Navy [[Scouts and Raiders|Amphibious Scout and Raider]] School was established in 1942 at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]].<ref name=\"Navy Seals History sealswcc.com\"/> The Scouts and Raiders were formed in September of that year, just nine months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], from the [[Observer Group]], a joint U.S. Army-Marine-Navy unit. \n\n=== Scouts and Raiders ===\nRecognizing the need for a beach reconnaissance force, a select group of Army and Navy personnel assembled at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek|Amphibious Training Base Little Creek]], Virginia on 15 August 1942 to begin Amphibious Scouts and Raiders (joint) training. The Scouts and Raiders mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach, maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing, and guide the assault waves to the landing beach.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/> The unit was led by U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant Lloyd Peddicord as commanding officer, and Navy Ensign John Bell as executive officer. Navy chief petty officers and sailors came from the boat pool at ATB, Solomons, Maryland and Army Raider personnel came from the 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions. They trained at Little Creek until embarking for the North Africa campaign the following November. Operation TORCH was launched in November 1942 off the Atlantic coast of French Morocco in North Africa. <ref>https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-storyseal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii</ref>\n\nThe first group included [[Phil H. Bucklew]], the \"Father of Naval Special Warfare,\" after whom the [[Naval Special Air Force Warfare Center|Naval Special Warfare Center]] building is named. Commissioned in October 1942, this group saw combat in November 1942 during [[Operation Torch]] on the North African Coast. Scouts and Raiders also supported landings in [[Sicily]], [[Salerno]], [[Anzio]], [[Normandy]], and [[southern France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii/ |title=SEAL History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare-WWII |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nA second group of Scouts and Raiders, code-named [[Special Service Unit No. 1]], was established on 7 July 1943, as a joint and [[combined operations]] force. The first mission, in September 1943, was at [[Finschhafen]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Later operations were at [[Gasmata]], [[Battle of Arawe|Arawe]], [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]], and the east and south coasts of [[New Britain]], all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned. The unit, renamed [[7th Amphibious Scouts]], received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, buoy channels, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe third and final Scouts and Raiders organization operated in China. Scouts and Raiders were deployed to fight with the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization|Sino-American Cooperative Organization, or SACO]]. To help bolster the work of SACO, Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for \"Amphibious Raider\" at the Scout and Raider school at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]]. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a \"guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans.\" While most Amphibious Raider forces remained at [[Camp Knox]] in Calcutta, three of the groups saw active service. They conducted a survey of the upper [[Yangtze River]] in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as [[coolies]], conducted a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from [[Shanghai]] to [[Kitchioh]] Wan, near [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Naval Combat Demolition Units ===\n[[File:Naval Combat Demolition Unit 45.jpg|thumb|NCDU 45, CEC Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C.

On 10 November 1942, the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the Wadi Sebou River during [[Operation Torch]] in North Africa. This enabled {{USS|Dallas|DD-199}} to traverse the water and insert [[U.S. Rangers]] who captured the Port Lyautey airdrome.\n\nIn early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the [[Seabee]]'s NTC [[Camp Peary]] dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, led by Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily.<ref name=\"navysealmuseum.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare \u2013 WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>  At that time Lieutenant Commander [[Draper L.

Most of Kauffman's volunteers came from the navy's [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) and enlisted seabees. Training commenced with a gruelling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates.\n\nBy April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], the amphibious landing at [[Normandy]]. On 6 June 1944, under heavy fire, the NCDUs at [[Omaha Beach]] managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at [[Utah Beach]] met less intense enemy fire. They cleared {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=off}} of beach in two hours, another {{convert|900|yd|m|abbr=off}} by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation Overlord, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives. In August 1944,  four NCDUs from Utah Beach plus nine others participated in the landings [[Operation Dragoon]] in southern France.  It was the last amphibious operation in the [[European Theater of Operations]].  With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the UDTs for the Pacific.\n\nThirty NCDUs<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  had been sent to the Pacific prior to Normandy.

Their training started in November 1943 at Camp Pendleton, California, moved to Santa Catalina Island, California in January 1944, and finally moved to the warmer waters of The Bahamas in March 1944.

In the Mediterranean, a fleet of hired Greek wooden fishing vessels\u2014called caiques\u2014covertly supported OSS agents in Albania, Greece, and Yugoslavia. After Italy surrendered, the MU and the San Marco battalion, an elite Italian special operations naval unit, operated against the Germans. In the Far East, the MU operated in conjunction with an Operational Group to attack Japanese forces on the Arakan coast of Burma. They jointly conducted reconnaissance missions on the Japanese-held coast, sometimes penetrating several miles up enemy-controlled rivers.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\">{{cite web |last1=United States Army Special Operations Command |title=Maritime Unit |url=https://www.soc.mil/OSS/maritime-unit.html |website=soc.mil |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe MU developed or used several innovative devices that would later allow for the creation of a special operations combat-diver capability, first in Army Special Forces (Green Berets) and later in US Navy SEAL units. Perhaps the most important invention in the realm of special operations diving was the [[LAR5|Lambertsen Rebreathing Unit]] (LARU) invented by [[Christian Lambertsen|Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen]]. The Lambertsen unit permitted a swimmer to remain underwater for several hours and to approach targets undetected because the LARU did not emit telltale air bubbles. The LARU was later refined, adapted, and the technology used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and NASA. The Army Special Forces Underwater Operations School at Key West, Florida, the home of Special Forces maritime operations, draws its roots from the Maritime Unit.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\"/>\n\nLambertsen began his involvement with the OSS as a medical student offering the use of his technology to the secretive organization in 1942. In 1944 he would commission as an Army Officer and later joint the OSS as an Operational Swimmer. Lambertsen himself led them the OSS Maritime Unit on covert underwater missions to attach explosives to Japanese ships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chace |first1=Dave |title=Dr. Christian Lambertsen: 70 years of influence on the military dive community |url=https://www.army.mil/article/75716/dr_christian_lambertsen_70_years_of_influence_on_the_military_dive_community |website=US Army |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> Dr. Christian Lambersten is remembered today as the \u2018Father of Military Underwater Operations.

VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  The Admiral tasked Lt. T. C. Crist (CEC) to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\">The Water Is Never Cold, James Douglas O'Dell, 2000, Brassey's, 22841 Quicksilver Drive, Dulles, Va. 20166, {{ISBN|1-57488-275-9}}</ref> Lt.

The second wave of [[landing craft]] ran aground [[coral reefs|coral]] because of unexpected shallows due to the [[tide]]s. As a result, Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]] requested the formation of nine [[underwater demolition teams]] for advance landing [[reconnaissance]] and demolition of beach obstructions. Six would be assigned to VAC in the Central Pacific while the other three would go to [[III Amphibious Corps]] in the South Pacific. UDTs 1 & 2 consisted of men Lt.

E.D. Brewster (CEC) UDT 1 and Lt. Crist (CEC) UDT 2.(Lt. Crist was replaced because Admiral Conolly wanted Line Officers with combat experience). The teams wore fatigues with life-vests and were not expected to leave their boats similar to the NCDUs. However, at Kwajalein [[Fort Pierce]] protocol was changed. Admiral Turner ordered daylight reconnaissance and CEC Ens. Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief William Atchison wore swim trunks under their fatigues anticipating they would not be able to get what the Admiral wanted by staying in the boat. They stripped down, spent 45 minutes in the water in broad daylight. When they got out were taken directly to Admiral Turners [[flagship]] to report, still in their trunks.  Admiral Turner concluded that daylight reconnaissance by individual swimmers was the way to get accurate information on coral and underwater obstacles for upcoming landings. This is what he reported to Admiral Nimitz.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoyt |first=Edwin P. |title=SEALs at War |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fDvNvnMrc1QC&pg=PT25&lpg=PT25&dq=seabee+dynamiting+and+demolition+school#v=onepage&q=seabee%20dynamiting%20and%20demolition%20school&f=false |date=15 June 2011 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-57006-2 |page=25 |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> The success of those UDT 1 Seabees not following Fort Pierce protocol rewrote the UDT mission model and training regimen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Orr |title=Brave Men, Dark Waters: The Untold Story of the Navy SEALs |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3c-1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30&dq=Lewis+F+luehrs#v=onepage&q=Lewis%20F%20luehrs&f=false |date=24 June 2014 |publisher=Open Road Media |isbn=978-1-4976-4563-9 |page=30 |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>  Those seabees also created the image of UDTs as the \"naked warriors\". \nAt [[Engebi]] Cmdr.

The actions of UDT 1 were immediately incorporated in the training which made it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce. The first head of training was Seabee Lt. T.C. Crist [[Roi-Namur]]. He was in that position briefly from when UDTs 1 & 2 were decommissioned until he was made Commander of UDT 3.\n\nThe UDT uniform had transitioned from the combat fatigues of the NCDUs to trunks, [[swimfins]], [[diving mask]]s and [[Ka-bar]]s.

Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men. During the \"Forgotten War\" the UDTs fought intensively, beginning to employ demolition expertise gained from WWII and use it for an offensive role. Continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method, the Korean Era UDTs targeted bridges, tunnels, fishing nets and other maritime and coastal targets. They also developed a close working relationship with the [[Republic of Korea]] [[Republic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla|Underwater Demolitions Unit (predecessor to the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla)]], which continues today.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe UDTs refined and developed their commando tactics during the Korean War, through their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal. The UDTs also accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish train tunnels. This was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of Naval forces. Due to the nature of the war the UDTs maintained a low operational profile. Some of the missions include transporting spies into North Korea and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets used to supply the North Korean Army.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nAs part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. The UDTs specialized in a somewhat new mission: Night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges. The UDT men were given the task because, in the words of UDT Lieutenant Ted Fielding, \"We were ready to do what nobody else could do, and what nobody else wanted to do.\" (Ted Fielding was awarded the Silver Star during Korea, and was later promoted to the rank of Captain).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-underwater-demolition-teams-in-the-korean-war/ |title=SEAL History: Underwater Demolition Teams in the Korean War |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing. In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S. minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors. The next day, William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an \"aqualung\" when he dove on {{USS|Pledge|AM-277|6}}. For the remainder of the war, UDTs conducted beach and river reconnaissance, infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea, continued mine sweeping operations, and participated in Operation Fishnet, which devastated the North Koreans' fishing capability.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Birth of Navy SEALs and the Vietnam War ===\n{{Main|Vietnam War}}\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]], aware of the situation in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for [[unconventional warfare]] and [[special operations]] as a measure against [[guerrilla warfare]]. In a speech, to [[United States Congress|Congress]], on 25 May 1961, Kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]]. While his announcement of the government's [[Apollo program|plan to put a man on the moon]] drew most of the attention, in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100&nbsp;million to strengthen U.S. special operations forces and expand American capabilities in unconventional warfare. Some people erroneously credit President Kennedy with creating the Navy SEALs. His announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been under way since Korea.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |title=Genesis of the U.S. Navy's SEa, Air, Land (SEAL) Teams |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222183844/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], recommended the establishment of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s, who had already gained extensive experience in [[commando]] warfare in [[Korean War|Korea]]; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy's amphibious force.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\" />\n\n[[File:Members of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two (SDVT-2).jpg|thumb|Members of [[SDVT-2|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two]] in a [[Dry Deck Shelter]] of the submerged {{USS|Philadelphia|SSN-690|6}}]]\nThe first two teams were formed in January 1962<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/viewVideo.asp?id=17950 |title=Video gallery: Forged by Adversity |date=2 January 2013 |website=United States Navy |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> and stationed on both US coasts: Team One at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]], in San Diego, California and Team Two at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. Formed entirely with personnel from UDTs, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments.<ref name=\"Navy Seals History sealswcc.com\"/> Men of the newly formed SEAL Teams were trained in such unconventional areas as [[hand-to-hand combat]], [[HALO jump|high-altitude parachuting]], [[demolitions]], and foreign languages. The SEALs attended Underwater Demolition Team replacement training and they spent some time training in UDTs. Upon making it to a SEAL team, they would undergo a SEAL Basic Indoctrination (SBI) training class at Camp Kerry in the [[Cuyamaca Peak|Cuyamaca Mountains]]. After SBI training class, they would enter a [[platoon]] and conduct platoon training.\n\nAccording to founding SEAL team member [[Roy Boehm]], the SEALs' first missions were directed against communist Cuba. These consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in prelude to a proposed US amphibious invasion of the island. On at least one occasion Boehm and another SEAL smuggled a CIA agent ashore to take pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside.<ref>{{cite book |title=First SEAL |first1=Ray |last1=Boehm |first2=Charles |last2=Sasser |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=978-0-67153-625-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific Command]] recognized [[Vietnam]] as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces. At the beginning of 1962, the UDTs started [[hydrographic survey]]s and along with other branches of the US Military, the [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) was formed. In March 1962, SEALs were deployed to [[South Vietnam]] as advisors for the purpose of training [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] [[commando]]s in the same methods they were trained themselves.\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] began using SEALs in [[covert operation]]s in early 1963. The SEALs were involved in the CIA sponsored [[Phoenix Program]] where it targeted key North Vietnamese Army personnel and [[Vietcong]] sympathizers for capture and assassination.\n\nThe SEALs were initially deployed in and around [[Da Nang]], training the South Vietnamese in combat diving, demolitions, and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics. As the war continued, the SEALs found themselves positioned in the [[Rung Sat Special Zone]] where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the [[Mekong Delta]] to fulfill [[Brown-water navy|riverine]] operations, fighting on the inland waterways.\n\n[[File:NavySeal1967Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|SEALs on patrol in the [[Mekong Delta]]]]\nCombat with the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] was direct. Unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location, the SEALs operated close to their targets. Into the late 1960s, the SEALs were successful in a new style of warfare, effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions. SEALs brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area. The Viet Cong referred to them as \"the men with green faces,\" due to the [[camouflage]] [[Body painting#Use in military|face paint]] the SEALs wore during combat missions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Point Man |first1=James |last1=Watson |first2=Kevin |last2=Dockery |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Avon Books |isbn=0-380-71986-X}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1966, a small SEAL Team One detachment arrived in Vietnam to conduct direct actions missions. Operating from [[Nh\u00e0 B\u00e8 Base]], near the R\u1eebng S\u00e1c Special Zone, this detachment signaled the beginning of a SEAL presence that would eventually include 8 SEAL platoons in country on a continuing basis.

The SEALs from Team Two started a unique deployment of SEAL team members working alone with South Vietnamese Commandos ([[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]). In 1967, a SEAL unit named Detachment Bravo (Det Bravo) was formed to operate these mixed US and ARVN units, which were called South Vietnamese [[Provincial Reconnaissance Unit]]s (PRUs).\n\n[[File:Presidential Unit Citation SEAL TEAM TWO 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded to SEAL Team TWO for extraordinary heroism in Vietnam from July 1969 to June 1971.]]\n\nBy 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] initiated a Plan of [[Role of United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization, 1969\u20131975|Vietnamization]], which would remove the US from the Vietnam War and return the responsibility of defense back to the South Vietnamese. Conventional forces were being withdrawn; the last SEAL platoon left Vietnam on 7 December 1971, the last SEAL advisor, left Vietnam in March 1973. South Vietnam fell to North Vietnamese communist forces in April 1975. The SEALs were among the highest decorated units for their size in the war, receiving by 1974 one [[Medal of Honor]], two [[Navy Cross]]es, 42 [[Silver star]]s, 402 [[Bronze Star]]s, two [[Legions of Merit]], 352 Commendation Medals, and 51 Navy Achievement Medals<ref name=\"SEAL Combat Manual\">{{Cite book |author= |title=US Navy SEAL Combat Manual |year=1974 |page=xvi |url=https://www.federaljack.com/ebooks/US-Navy-SEAL-Combat-Manual.pdf |access-date=25 January 2019 }}.</ref> Later awards would bring the total to three Medals of Honor and five Navy Crosses.

The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's [[Paul Scoon|Governor-General]] and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On 24 October 1983, twelve operators from SEAL Team Six and four Air Force Combat Control Team members (CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salines, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] [[satellite phone]]. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in [[AC-130]] gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of Marines the following morning.\n\nThe team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems. As soon as the SEALs reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post. After beating back several waves of Grenadian and Cuban troops supported by [[BTR-60]] armoured personnel carriers, the SEALs decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable. They destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces. After the enemy had given up their search the SEALs, some wounded, swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n{{Main|Operation Prime Chance}}\nDuring the closing stages of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] the United States Navy began conducting operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] to protect US-flagged ships from attack by Iranian naval forces. A secret plan was put in place and dubbed [[Operation Prime Chance]]. Navy SEAL Teams 1 and 2 along with several Special Boat Units and EOD techs were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]]. Over the course of the operation SEALs conducted [[VBSS]] (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) missions to counter Iranian mine laying boats. The only loss of life occurred during the take down of the ''[[Iran Ajr]]<!--Not a spelling error, this is the name of a ship-->''. Evidence gathered on the ''Iran Ajr'' by the SEALs later allowed the US Navy to trace the mines that struck {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58}}. This chain of events led to [[Operation Praying Mantis]], the largest US Naval surface engagement since the Second World War.\n\nDuring Operation Desert Shield and Storm, Navy SEALs trained Kuwaiti Special Forces. They set up naval special operations groups in Kuwait, working with the Kuwaiti Navy in exile. Using these new diving, swimming, and combat skills, these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city.\n\n===Panama===\n{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}\n[[File:US Navy 100107-N-0000X-003 Members of Seal Team 4 pose for a group photo before Operation Just Cause.jpg|thumb|Members of SEAL Team 4 immediately before the start of Operation Just Cause]]\nThe United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to the invasion of Panama, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU). DEVGRU fell under Task Force Blue, while Naval Special Warfare Group 2 composed the entirety of Task Force White. Task Force White was tasked with three principal objectives: the destruction of [[Panamanian Defense Forces]] (PDF) naval assets in Balboa Harbor and the destruction of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s private jet at Paitilla Airport (collectively known as [[Operation Nifty Package]]), as well as isolating PDF forces on Flamenco Island.\n\nThe strike on Balboa Harbor by Task Unit Whiskey is notably marked in SEAL history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the Second World War. Prior to the commencement of the invasion four Navy SEALs, Lt Edward S. Coughlin, EN-3 Timothy K. Eppley, ET-1 Randy L. Beausoleil, and PH-2 Chris Dye, swam underwater into the harbor on Draeger LAR-V [[rebreathers]] and attached [[C-4 (explosive)|C4 explosives]] to and destroyed Noriega's personal gunboat the ''Presidente Porras''.\n\nTask Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega's plane there. Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Rangers]]. Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise, the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission. Almost immediately upon landing, the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield. Although Noriega's plane was eventually destroyed, the SEALs suffered four dead and thirteen wounded. Killed were Lt. John Connors, Chief Petty Officer [[Donald L. McFaul|Donald McFaul]], Torpedoman's Mate 2nd Class Issac Rodriguez, and Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Chris Tilghman.\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\n{{main|Gulf War}}\nIn August 1990, SEALs were the first western forces to deploy to the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. They infiltrated the capital city of [[Kuwait]] within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue US embassy staff should they become hostages. SEALs were also the first to capture Iraqi Prisoners of War when they assaulted nine Kuwaiti Oil platforms on 19 January 1991. On 23 February 1991, a seven-man SEAL team launched a mission to trick the Iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on Kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the Kuwaiti coast.

SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of [[Masirah Island|Masirah]] for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs' immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct [[special reconnaissance]] (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Rangers]] also staging on Masirah, the SEALs inserted into Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become [[Camp Rhino]], as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom#Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A)|Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan]] (OEF-A).

It was a [[Black operation|black]] SOF (Special Operations Forces) unit under direct command of [[JSOC]]. It was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was of capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structured around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force teams (Task Force Red) and ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). [[Task Force K-Bar]] was established on 10 October 2001, it was formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, [[3rd Special Forces Group (United States)|3rd SFG]]; the task force was led by SEAL Captain [[Robert Harward]].\n\nThe task force's principal task was to conduct SR and [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] missions in the south of the country.

The AFOs were 45-man reconnaissances units made up of a Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] and supported by [[Intelligence Support Activity|ISA]]'s technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to Task Force Sword. The AFOs conducted covert reconnaissance \u2013 sending small 2 or 3 man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=25-31}}\n\nSEALs were present at the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] in November 2001 alongside their counterparts from the British [[Special Boat Service|SBS]].

Their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids, particularly against HVTs. The Naval Special Operations Task Group was assigned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was built around a core of SEAL Teams 8 and 10, Polish [[GROM]], [[Royal Marines]] from [[40 Commando|40]] and [[42 Commando]] under the command of [[3 Commando Brigade]] and attached [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command|US Psy Ops and civil affairs]] teams. The Naval Task Group was principally tasked with the capture of the port of [[Umm Qasr]], Iraq's only deep-water port; the oil pipeline facilities of the [[Al-Faw Peninsula]]; and the two off-shore platforms the pipelines fed. Once these initial target sets were secured, the Task Group would support conventional forces in the south, conducting reconnaissance and raiding activities. Aviation support was provided by both Marine air of the 15th MEU and [[20th Special Operations Squadron]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=96}}\n\nSeveral days before the beginning of the invasion, two SDV teams were launched from [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]] in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographic reconnaissance]] of the [[KAAOT|Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals]]. After swimming under the terminals and securing their [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle|Mark 8 mod 1s]], the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} On 20 March 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|Navy EOD]] a USAF combat controller and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal whilst GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM operators.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=123}}\n\nThe shore-based pumping stations (known as MMS-Monitoring and Meter Stations) and their pipelines on the Al-Faw Peninsula were [[Battle of Al Faw (2003)|seized by]] 12 SEALS from SEAL Team 3, who were mounted in DPVs. They took off from Kuwait and were inserted under Iraqi anti-aircraft fire by MH-53 helicopters. The target area was 'softened up' by [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] bombs dropped from [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] on Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities. After a brief firefight in which the SEALs killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13, the SEALs secured the MMS and the pipelines, and were relieved by Royal Marines from 40 Commando. The SEALs advised the Marines, helping coordinate [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectres]] fire support onto Iraqi forces. The other shore-based pumping station at Umm Qasr was secured by SEALs and Royal Marines; before they landed, AC-130 Spectres and [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10As]] engaged a nearby [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] installation and a responding Iraqi mechanised unit.

SEALs and [[Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen|Special Boat teams]] helped secure the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr Az Zubyar waterways, which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of Umm Qasr. SEALs from the unit that secured the al-Faw MMS also conducted reconnaissance on the Shat Al Arab waterway, that was later secured by British forces. SEALs were also involved in various VBSS missions with British and Australian forces to seize Iraqi craft carrying seaborne mines.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}}{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=126-127}}\n\nCoalition military planners were concerned that retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by six US Air Force [[Sikorsky MH-53|MH-53J Pave Lows]]; the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw, the SEALs found their DPVs (the SEAL unit at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when they were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2017}} Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and with the exception of a GROM [[soldier]] who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation.

In September 2004, a SEAL sniper element was tasked with establishing an overwatch and surveillance position overlooking [[Haifa Street]], they were inserted by [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] from a unit of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], however they were spotted and engaged by insurgents. The SEALs notified the Bradleys, they drove back, fired on the insurgents and set up a cordon for the SEALs to be extracted, one Bradley was destroyed by a car bomb, there were no casualties and the SEALs were extracted.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=178-179}}\n\nIn the interim between the First Battle of Fallujah and [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], insurgents in [[Fallujah]] knew that the coalition assault was inevitable and under the guidance of the influx of foreign fighters, began to build defensive networks throughout the city-ranging from fortified buildings, trench lines, [[berm]]s, strategically placed [[car bomb]]s and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. In preparations for the second battle, SEALs conducted reconnaissance near the berms and tested out reports that the insurgents were equipped with night-vision equipment, they proved this by throwing an infra-red chemical light into the street which drew small arms fire. SEALs along with the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] and [[MCSOCOM Detachment One|Det One]] and other JSOC elements were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to the 7 November [[D-Day (military term)|D-DAY]] when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. When the offensive on the insurgents in the city began, many of the US Marine companies had SEAL sniper teams attached to them, mainly from SEAL Teams 3, 5 and 10.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=175-178}}\n\nFrom 2005, SEALs were heavily committed to western Iraq in [[Al Anbar Governorate]], [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|AQI]] terrorists who escaped Fallujah had relocated to [[Ramadi]]. A SEAL Task Unit was co-located with the Marines at [[Al Asad Airbase]] and sent elements to Ramadi and [[Habbaniyah]], the SEALs were initially tasked with target development for the Marines and providing sniper overwatch for their patrols. The SEALs were already training an Iraqi Army unit in Habbaniyah, although [[Foreign internal defense|FID]] was their main focus until later that year. A SEAL Task Unit generally comprised two individual SEAL Platoons: each Platoon was made up of seven-man squad elements commanded by a [[junior officer]], three of these Task Units (although a fourth was often added) along with a Special Boat Team detachment and a Headquarters Team (including integral intelligence, targeting and EOD personnel) made up a Naval Special Warfare Squadron. According to [[Dick Couch]], the SEALs began FID with two Iraqi units-the Army Scouts who conducted conventional reconnaissance missions, and the SMP (Special Missions Platoon), a locally formed unit that would later fight alongside the SEALs. Despite several challenges, the SEALs were soon conducted operations with partnered units, particularly in Special Reconnaissance, focusing on the surveillance aspect, whilst conventional US Army or Marines would conduct raids and arrests.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=179-180}} The typical loadout of the SEALs in Ramadi included the M4 carbine, optimised for close quarter battle with a 10-inch barrel equipped with a 6-inch sound suppressor, Surefire flashlight and EOTech sight, short barrel and foregrip and seven magazines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://corpidelite.net/afm/2017/05/a-navy-seal-loadout-in-ramadi/ |title=A Navy SEAL loadout in Ramadi |website=Corpi d'\u00e9lite.net |language=en-US |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi, AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local [[Sheikh]]s and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes, thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality. Al-Qaeda's efforts to install a [[Sharia]]-style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI's downfall-when in the first half of 2006, in the run-up to the [[Battle of Ramadi (2006)|Second Battle of Ramadi]] SEALs, increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division]] which was planning the offensive. SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP, would conduct reconnaissance, surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks; with their own targeting cell, they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders. The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer [[Michael A. Monsoor]] died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight, two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building, a fourth SEAL (only lightly wounded), managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire. A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor (whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV) and the wounded SEALs, Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi, combined with the brutal tactics of AQI, helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative-the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs' militias into the Iraqi Security Forces. These volunteers would serve locally in their communities to defend them against al-Qaeda, a month after the kidnapping and murder of Sheikh Khalid by AQI (which proved to be the tipping point), the Sheikhs signed a declaration agreeing to fight AQI and by the closing of 2006, even former insurgents were joining the local police (later known as the [[Anbar Awakening]]) by the end of the battle, some 1,100 terrorists were killed.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=180-182}}\n\nIn Fallujah, the SEAL Task Unit were also heavily involved in fighting. In one joint operation to capture an AQI leader, they entered the target building and were engaged resulting in an Iraqi Scout being killed and a SEAL severely wounded, two SEALs returned fire and entered the building, both SEALs entered different rooms, in one room the SEAL encountered three insurgents who opened fired at close range, another SEAL across the hallway was struck in the head and killed, the SEAL in the room with the insurgents killed all three.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=182}}\n\nIn September 2009, in a nighttime raid in Fallujah, SEALs captured [[Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi]] (nicknamed the \"Butcher of Fallujah\"), a prominent al-Qaeda terrorist who was the mastermind behind the [[2004 Fallujah ambush]].

The remaining members of the squad are operators (E-4 to E-6) with their specialty skills in ordinance, communications, diving, and medical. The core leadership in the troop and platoon are the commander/OIC and the senior enlisted NCO (Senior Chief/chief).\n\nPlatoon core skills consist of: Sniper, Breacher, Communicator, Maritime/Engineering, Close Air Support, Corpsman, Point-man/Navigator, Primary Driver/Navigator (Rural/Urban/Protective Security), Heavy Weapons Operator, Sensitive Site Exploitation, Air Operations Master, Lead Climber, Lead Diver/Navigator, Interrogator, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Technical Surveillance, and Advanced Special Operations.\n\n[[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], a [[naval base]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], is home to SEAL Teams 2, 4, DEVGRU,  8, 10, and 18.

He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a \"not to interfere\" basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the \"Leap Frogs\" name.<ref name=\"leap-frogs\"/>\n\nThe team was officially commissioned as the U.S. Navy Parachute Team in 1974 by the Chief of Naval Operations and assigned the mission of demonstrating Navy excellence throughout the United States. The East Coast-based \"Chuting Stars\" were disbanded in the 1980s with the \"Leap Frogs\" taking on all official parachute demonstrations within the Navy.\n\nA typical Leap Frogs performance consists of six jumpers leaping out of an aircraft at an altitude of 6,000 feet. After freefalling sometimes using smoke or streamers, the Leap Frogs fly their canopies together to build canopy-relative work formations. After performances, the Leap Frogs make themselves available to the public to answer questions about the Navy and the Naval Special Warfare community, as well as to sign autographs.\n\n==Influence on foreign units==\n[[File:GROM with Navy SEALs 01.jpg|thumb|right|US Navy SEALs and [[JW GROM|GROM]]\u2014Polish naval warfare team members\u2014practicing boarding skills near Gdansk, Poland, 2009]]\nFrom its predecessors, the [[Underwater Demolition Teams]], to its current form, the SEALs have influenced the training and formation of several foreign units.

As a result, the joint  Army, Marine Corps and Navy [[Scouts and Raiders|Amphibious Scout and Raider]] School was established in 1942 at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]].<ref name=\"Navy Seals History sealswcc.com\"/> The Scouts and Raiders were formed in September of that year, just nine months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], from the [[Observer Group]], a joint U.S. Army-Marine-Navy unit. \n\n=== Scouts and Raiders ===\nRecognizing the need for a beach reconnaissance force, a select group of Army and Navy personnel assembled at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek|Amphibious Training Base Little Creek]], Virginia on 15 August 1942 to begin Amphibious Scouts and Raiders (joint) training. The Scouts and Raiders mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach, maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing, and guide the assault waves to the landing beach.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/> The unit was led by U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant Lloyd Peddicord as commanding officer, and Navy Ensign John Bell as executive officer. Navy chief petty officers and sailors came from the boat pool at ATB, Solomons, Maryland and Army Raider personnel came from the 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions. They trained at Little Creek until embarking for the North Africa campaign the following November. Operation TORCH was launched in November 1942 off the Atlantic coast of French Morocco in North Africa. <ref>https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-storyseal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii</ref>\n\nThe first group included [[Phil H. Bucklew]], the \"Father of Naval Special Warfare,\" after whom the [[Naval Special Air Force Warfare Center|Naval Special Warfare Center]] building is named. Commissioned in October 1942, this group saw combat in November 1942 during [[Operation Torch]] on the North African Coast. Scouts and Raiders also supported landings in [[Sicily]], [[Salerno]], [[Anzio]], [[Normandy]], and [[southern France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii/ |title=SEAL History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare-WWII |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nA second group of Scouts and Raiders, code-named [[Special Service Unit No. 1]], was established on 7 July 1943, as a joint and [[combined operations]] force. The first mission, in September 1943, was at [[Finschhafen]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Later operations were at [[Gasmata]], [[Battle of Arawe|Arawe]], [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]], and the east and south coasts of [[New Britain]], all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned. The unit, renamed [[7th Amphibious Scouts]], received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, buoy channels, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe third and final Scouts and Raiders organization operated in China. Scouts and Raiders were deployed to fight with the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization|Sino-American Cooperative Organization, or SACO]]. To help bolster the work of SACO, Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for \"Amphibious Raider\" at the Scout and Raider school at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]]. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a \"guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans.\" While most Amphibious Raider forces remained at [[Camp Knox]] in Calcutta, three of the groups saw active service. They conducted a survey of the upper [[Yangtze River]] in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as [[coolies]], conducted a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from [[Shanghai]] to [[Kitchioh]] Wan, near [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Naval Combat Demolition Units ===\n[[File:Naval Combat Demolition Unit 45.jpg|thumb|NCDU 45, CEC Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C.

On 10 November 1942, the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the Wadi Sebou River during [[Operation Torch]] in North Africa. This enabled {{USS|Dallas|DD-199}} to traverse the water and insert [[U.S. Rangers]] who captured the Port Lyautey airdrome.\n\nIn early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the [[Seabee]]'s NTC [[Camp Peary]] dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, led by Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily.<ref name=\"navysealmuseum.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare \u2013 WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>  At that time Lieutenant Commander [[Draper L.

The first six classes graduated from \"Area E\" at NTC Camp Peary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/NCDU.htm|title=Naval Combat Demolition Units|publisher=specwarnet|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref> LCDR Kauffman's needs quickly out-grew \"Area E\" and on 6 June 1943 he established NCDU training at Fort Pierce. Most of Kauffman's volunteers came from the navy's [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) and enlisted seabees. Training commenced with a gruelling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates.\n\nBy April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], the amphibious landing at [[Normandy]]. On 6 June 1944, under heavy fire, the NCDUs at [[Omaha Beach]] managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at [[Utah Beach]] met less intense enemy fire. They cleared {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=off}} of beach in two hours, another {{convert|900|yd|m|abbr=off}} by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation Overlord, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives. In August 1944,  four NCDUs from Utah Beach plus nine others participated in the landings [[Operation Dragoon]] in southern France.  It was the last amphibious operation in the [[European Theater of Operations]].  With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the UDTs for the Pacific.\n\nThirty NCDUs<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  had been sent to the Pacific prior to Normandy.

Their training started in November 1943 at Camp Pendleton, California, moved to Santa Catalina Island, California in January 1944, and finally moved to the warmer waters of The Bahamas in March 1944. Within the U.S. military, they pioneered flexible [[swimfin]]s and [[diving mask]]s, [[Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit|closed-circuit diving equipment]] (under the direction of Dr. [[Christian J.

In the Mediterranean, a fleet of hired Greek wooden fishing vessels\u2014called caiques\u2014covertly supported OSS agents in Albania, Greece, and Yugoslavia. After Italy surrendered, the MU and the San Marco battalion, an elite Italian special operations naval unit, operated against the Germans. In the Far East, the MU operated in conjunction with an Operational Group to attack Japanese forces on the Arakan coast of Burma. They jointly conducted reconnaissance missions on the Japanese-held coast, sometimes penetrating several miles up enemy-controlled rivers.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\">{{cite web |last1=United States Army Special Operations Command |title=Maritime Unit |url=https://www.soc.mil/OSS/maritime-unit.html |website=soc.mil |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe MU developed or used several innovative devices that would later allow for the creation of a special operations combat-diver capability. First in Army Special Forces (Green Berets) and later in US Navy SEAL units. Perhaps the most important invention in the realm of special operations diving was the [[LAR5|Lambertsen Rebreathing Unit]] (LARU) invented by [[Christian Lambertsen|Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen]]. The Lambertsen unit permitted a swimmer to remain underwater for several hours and to approach targets undetected because the LARU did not emit telltale air bubbles. The LARU was later refined, adapted, and the technology used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and NASA. The Army Special Forces Underwater Operations School at Key West, Florida, the home of Special Forces maritime operations, draws its roots from the Maritime Unit.<ref name=\"Maritime Unit\"/>\n\nLambertsen began his involvement with the OSS as a medical student offering the use of his technology to the secretive organization in 1942. In 1944 he would commission as an Army Officer and later joint the OSS as an Operational Swimmer. Lambertsen himself led them the OSS Maritime Unit on covert underwater missions to attach explosives to Japanese ships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chace |first1=Dave |title=Dr. Christian Lambertsen: 70 years of influence on the military dive community |url=https://www.army.mil/article/75716/dr_christian_lambertsen_70_years_of_influence_on_the_military_dive_community |website=US Army |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> Dr. Christian Lambersten is remembered today as the \u2018Father of Military Underwater Operations.

Rear Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]], commander [[V Amphibious Corps]] had ordered a review to get a grip on the problem.  VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  The Admiral tasked Lt. T. C. Crist (CEC) to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\">The Water Is Never Cold, James Douglas O'Dell, 2000, Brassey's, 22841 Quicksilver Drive, Dulles, Va. 20166, {{ISBN|1-57488-275-9}}</ref> Lt.

The second wave of [[landing craft]] ran aground [[coral reefs|coral]] because of unexpected shallows due to the [[tide]]s. As a result, Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]] requested the formation of nine [[underwater demolition teams]] for advance landing [[reconnaissance]] and demolition of beach obstructions. Six would be assigned to VAC in the Central Pacific while the other three would go to [[III Amphibious Corps]] in the South Pacific. UDTs 1 & 2 consisted of men Lt.

The teams wore fatigues with life-vests and were not expected to leave their boats similar to the NCDUs. However, at Kwajalein [[Fort Pierce]] protocol was changed. Admiral Turner ordered daylight reconnaissance and CEC Ens. Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief William Atchison wore swim trunks under their fatigues anticipating they would not be able to get what the Admiral wanted by staying in the boat. They stripped down, spent 45 minutes in the water in broad daylight. When they got out were taken directly to Admiral Turners [[flagship]] to report, still in their trunks.  Admiral Turner concluded that daylight reconnaissance by individual swimmers was the way to get accurate information on coral and underwater obstacles for upcoming landings.

The actions of UDT 1 were immediately incorporated in the training which made it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce. The first head of training was Seabee Lt. T.C. Crist [[Roi-Namur]]. He was in that position briefly from when UDTs 1 & 2 were decommissioned until he was made Commander of UDT 3.\n\nThe UDT uniform had transitioned from the combat fatigues of the NCDUs to trunks, [[swimfins]], [[diving mask]]s and [[Ka-bar]]s.

Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men. During the \"Forgotten War\" the UDTs fought intensively, beginning to employ demolition expertise gained from WWII and use it for an offensive role. Continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method, the Korean Era UDTs targeted bridges, tunnels, fishing nets and other maritime and coastal targets. They also developed a close working relationship with the [[Republic of Korea]] [[Republic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla|Underwater Demolitions Unit (predecessor to the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla)]], which continues today.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nThe UDTs refined and developed their commando tactics during the Korean War, through their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal. The UDTs also accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish train tunnels. This was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of Naval forces. Due to the nature of the war the UDTs maintained a low operational profile. Some of the missions include transporting spies into North Korea and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets used to supply the North Korean Army.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\nAs part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. The UDTs specialized in a somewhat new mission: Night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges. The UDT men were given the task because, in the words of UDT Lieutenant Ted Fielding, \"We were ready to do what nobody else could do, and what nobody else wanted to do.\" (Ted Fielding was awarded the Silver Star during Korea, and was later promoted to the rank of Captain).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-underwater-demolition-teams-in-the-korean-war/ |title=SEAL History: Underwater Demolition Teams in the Korean War |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing. In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S. minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors. The next day, William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an \"aqualung\" when he dove on {{USS|Pledge|AM-277|6}}. For the remainder of the war, UDTs conducted beach and river reconnaissance, infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea, continued mine sweeping operations, and participated in Operation Fishnet, which devastated the North Koreans' fishing capability.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\"/>\n\n=== Birth of Navy SEALs and the Vietnam War ===\n{{Main|Vietnam War}}\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]], aware of the situation in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for [[unconventional warfare]] and [[special operations]] as a measure against [[guerrilla warfare]]. In a speech, to [[United States Congress|Congress]], on 25 May 1961, Kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]]. While his announcement of the government's [[Apollo program|plan to put a man on the moon]] drew most of the attention, in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100&nbsp;million to strengthen U.S. special operations forces and expand American capabilities in unconventional warfare. Some people erroneously credit President Kennedy with creating the Navy SEALs. His announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been under way since Korea.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |title=Genesis of the U.S. Navy's SEa, Air, Land (SEAL) Teams |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222183844/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], recommended the establishment of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s, who had already gained extensive experience in [[commando]] warfare in [[Korean War|Korea]]; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy's amphibious force.<ref name=\"Navy Seal History\" />\n\n[[File:Members of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two (SDVT-2).jpg|thumb|Members of [[SDVT-2|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two]] in a [[Dry Deck Shelter]] of the submerged {{USS|Philadelphia|SSN-690|6}}]]\nThe first two teams were formed in January 1962<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/viewVideo.asp?id=17950 |title=Video gallery: Forged by Adversity |date=2 January 2013 |website=United States Navy |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> and stationed on both US coasts: Team One at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]], in San Diego, California and Team Two at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. Formed entirely with personnel from UDTs, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments.<ref name=\"Navy Seals History sealswcc.com\"/> Men of the newly formed SEAL Teams were trained in such unconventional areas as [[hand-to-hand combat]], [[HALO jump|high-altitude parachuting]], [[demolitions]], and foreign languages. The SEALs attended Underwater Demolition Team replacement training and they spent some time training in UDTs. Upon making it to a SEAL team, they would undergo a SEAL Basic Indoctrination (SBI) training class at Camp Kerry in the [[Cuyamaca Peak|Cuyamaca Mountains]]. After SBI training class, they would enter a [[platoon]] and conduct platoon training.\n\nAccording to founding SEAL team member [[Roy Boehm]], the SEALs' first missions were directed against communist Cuba. These consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in prelude to a proposed US amphibious invasion of the island. On at least one occasion Boehm and another SEAL smuggled a CIA agent ashore to take pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside.<ref>{{cite book |title=First SEAL |first1=Ray |last1=Boehm |first2=Charles |last2=Sasser |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=978-0-67153-625-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific Command]] recognized [[Vietnam]] as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces. At the beginning of 1962, the UDTs started [[hydrographic survey]]s and along with other branches of the US Military, the [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) was formed. In March 1962, SEALs were deployed to [[South Vietnam]] as advisors for the purpose of training [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] [[commando]]s in the same methods they were trained themselves.\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] began using SEALs in [[covert operation]]s in early 1963. The SEALs were involved in the CIA sponsored [[Phoenix Program]] where it targeted key North Vietnamese Army personnel and [[Vietcong]] sympathizers for capture and assassination.\n\nThe SEALs were initially deployed in and around [[Da Nang]], training the South Vietnamese in combat diving, demolitions, and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics. As the war continued, the SEALs found themselves positioned in the [[Rung Sat Special Zone]] where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the [[Mekong Delta]] to fulfill [[Brown-water navy|riverine]] operations, fighting on the inland waterways.\n\n[[File:NavySeal1967Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|SEALs on patrol in the [[Mekong Delta]]]]\nCombat with the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] was direct. Unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location, the SEALs operated close to their targets. Into the late 1960s, the SEALs were successful in a new style of warfare, effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions. SEALs brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area. The Viet Cong referred to them as \"the men with green faces,\" due to the [[camouflage]] [[Body painting#Use in military|face paint]] the SEALs wore during combat missions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Point Man |first1=James |last1=Watson |first2=Kevin |last2=Dockery |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Avon Books |isbn=0-380-71986-X}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1966, a small SEAL Team One detachment arrived in Vietnam to conduct direct actions missions. Operating from [[Nh\u00e0 B\u00e8 Base]], near the R\u1eebng S\u00e1c Special Zone, this detachment signaled the beginning of a SEAL presence that would eventually include 8 SEAL platoons in country on a continuing basis.

The SEALs from Team Two started a unique deployment of SEAL team members working alone with South Vietnamese Commandos ([[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]). In 1967, a SEAL unit named Detachment Bravo (Det Bravo) was formed to operate these mixed US and ARVN units, which were called South Vietnamese [[Provincial Reconnaissance Unit]]s (PRUs).\n\n[[File:Presidential Unit Citation SEAL TEAM TWO 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded to SEAL Team TWO for extraordinary heroism in Vietnam from July 1969 to June 1971.]]\n\nBy 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] initiated a Plan of [[Role of United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization, 1969\u20131975|Vietnamization]], which would remove the US from the Vietnam War and return the responsibility of defense back to the South Vietnamese. Conventional forces were being withdrawn; the last SEAL platoon left Vietnam on 7 December 1971, the last SEAL advisor, left Vietnam in March 1973. South Vietnam fell to North Vietnamese communist forces in April 1975. The SEALs were among the highest decorated units for their size in the war, receiving by 1974 one [[Medal of Honor]], two [[Navy Cross]]es, 42 [[Silver star]]s, 402 [[Bronze Star]]s, two [[Legions of Merit]], 352 Commendation Medals, and 51 Navy Achievement Medals<ref name=\"SEAL Combat Manual\">{{Cite book |author= |title=US Navy SEAL Combat Manual |year=1974 |page=xvi |url=https://www.federaljack.com/ebooks/US-Navy-SEAL-Combat-Manual.pdf |access-date=25 January 2019 }}.</ref> Later awards would bring the total to three Medals of Honor and five Navy Crosses.

The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's [[Paul Scoon|Governor-General]] and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On 24 October 1983, twelve operators from SEAL Team Six and four Air Force Combat Control Team members (CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salines, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] [[satellite phone]]. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in [[AC-130]] gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of Marines the following morning.\n\nThe team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems. As soon as the SEALs reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post. After beating back several waves of Grenadian and Cuban troops supported by [[BTR-60]] armoured personnel carriers, the SEALs decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable. They destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces. After the enemy had given up their search the SEALs, some wounded, swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n{{Main|Operation Prime Chance}}\nDuring the closing stages of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] the United States Navy began conducting operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] to protect US-flagged ships from attack by Iranian naval forces. A secret plan was put in place and dubbed [[Operation Prime Chance]]. Navy SEAL Teams 1 and 2 along with several Special Boat Units and EOD techs were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]]. Over the course of the operation SEALs conducted [[VBSS]] (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) missions to counter Iranian mine laying boats. The only loss of life occurred during the take down of the ''[[Iran Ajr]]<!--Not a spelling error, this is the name of a ship-->''. Evidence gathered on the ''Iran Ajr'' by the SEALs later allowed the US Navy to trace the mines that struck {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58}}. This chain of events led to [[Operation Praying Mantis]], the largest US Naval surface engagement since the Second World War.\n\nDuring Operation Desert Shield and Storm, Navy SEALs trained Kuwaiti Special Forces. They set up naval special operations groups in Kuwait, working with the Kuwaiti Navy in exile. Using these new diving, swimming, and combat skills, these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city.\n\n===Panama===\n{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}\n[[File:US Navy 100107-N-0000X-003 Members of Seal Team 4 pose for a group photo before Operation Just Cause.jpg|thumb|Members of SEAL Team 4 immediately before the start of Operation Just Cause]]\nThe United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to the invasion of Panama, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU). DEVGRU fell under Task Force Blue, while Naval Special Warfare Group 2 composed the entirety of Task Force White. Task Force White was tasked with three principal objectives: the destruction of [[Panamanian Defense Forces]] (PDF) naval assets in Balboa Harbor and the destruction of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s private jet at Paitilla Airport (collectively known as [[Operation Nifty Package]]), as well as isolating PDF forces on Flamenco Island.\n\nThe strike on Balboa Harbor by Task Unit Whiskey is notably marked in SEAL history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the Second World War. Prior to the commencement of the invasion four Navy SEALs, Lt Edward S. Coughlin, EN-3 Timothy K. Eppley, ET-1 Randy L. Beausoleil, and PH-2 Chris Dye, swam underwater into the harbor on Draeger LAR-V [[rebreathers]] and attached [[C-4 (explosive)|C4 explosives]] to and destroyed Noriega's personal gunboat the ''Presidente Porras''.\n\nTask Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega's plane there. Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Rangers]]. Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise, the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission. Almost immediately upon landing, the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield. Although Noriega's plane was eventually destroyed, the SEALs suffered four dead and thirteen wounded. Killed were Lt. John Connors, Chief Petty Officer [[Donald L. McFaul|Donald McFaul]], Torpedoman's Mate 2nd Class Issac Rodriguez, and Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Chris Tilghman.\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\n{{main|Gulf War}}\nIn August 1990, SEALs were the first western forces to deploy to the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. They infiltrated the capital city of [[Kuwait]] within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue US embassy staff should they become hostages. SEALs were also the first to capture Iraqi Prisoners of War when they assaulted nine Kuwaiti Oil platforms on 19 January 1991. On 23 February 1991, a seven-man SEAL team launched a mission to trick the Iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on Kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the Kuwaiti coast. The mission was a success and Iraqi forces were diverted east away from the true coalition offensive.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} The SEALs were first into Kuwait City in their [[Desert Patrol Vehicle]]s when it was recaptured.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=14}}\n\n===Somalia Intervention===\nOn 6 December 1992, as part of [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]], U.S. Navy SEALs and Special Boat crewmen from Naval Special Warfare Task Unit TRIPOLI began a three-day operation carrying out reconnaissance operations in the vicinity of [[Mogadishu]] airport and harbor; ahead of UNITAFs deployment to the country.

SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of [[Masirah Island|Masirah]] for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs' immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct [[special reconnaissance]] (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Rangers]] also staging on Masirah, the SEALs inserted into Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become [[Camp Rhino]], as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom#Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A)|Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan]] (OEF-A). These early stages of OEF were commanded by a fellow SEAL, [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Albert Calland]].\n\n[[File:US Navy SEALs at Zhawar Kili cave entrance.jpg|thumb|Task Force K-Bar SEALs at one of the entrances to the [[Zhawar Kili]] cave complex]]\nAs part of the CJSOTF (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force) under the command of General [[Tommy Franks]] at [[CENTCOM]] SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Sword, which was established in early October 2001. It was a [[Black operation|black]] SOF (Special Operations Forces) unit under direct command of [[JSOC]]. It was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was of capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structured around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force teams (Task Force Red) and ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). [[Task Force K-Bar]] was established on 10 October 2001, it was formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, [[3rd Special Forces Group (United States)|3rd SFG]]; the task force was led by SEAL Captain [[Robert Harward]].\n\nThe task force's principal task was to conduct SR and [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] missions in the south of the country. Other Coalition SOF-particularly [[Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte|KSK]], [[Joint Task Force 2|JTF2]] and [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] were assigned to the task force. As part of the JIATF-CT (Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism) \u2013 intelligence integration and fusion activity manned by personnel from all Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A) participating units- SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Bowie, they were embedded in the task force in AFOs (Advanced Force Operations). The AFOs were 45-man reconnaissances units made up of a Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] and supported by [[Intelligence Support Activity|ISA]]'s technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to Task Force Sword. The AFOs conducted covert reconnaissance \u2013 sending small 2 or 3 man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=25-31}}\n\nSEALs were present at the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] in November 2001 alongside their counterparts from the British [[Special Boat Service|SBS]]. Chief Petty Officer [[Stephen Bass]] was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for his actions during the battle.\n\nBefore the US Marines landed at [[Camp Rhino]] in November 2001, a SEAL recce team from [[SEAL Team 8]] conducted reconnaissance of the area, they were mistakenly engaged by orbiting [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1W attack helicopters]], but the SEALs managed to get a message through to the Marines before they suffered casualties.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=44}} The SR mission in the region of Camp Rhino lasted for four days, after which two [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team]]s made a nighttime [[HALO jump]] to assist the SEALs in guiding in [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marines]] from the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] who seized control of the area and established a [[Forward operating base]].\n\n====Post-invasion====\n[[File:US Navy SEALs in Khawar Kili.jpg|thumb|left|Task Force K-Bar SEALs searching munitions found in the [[Zhawar Kili]] cave complex]]\nIn January 2002, following the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], another series of caves was discovered in [[Zhawar Kili]], just south of [[Tora Bora]]; airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element, a Norwegian SOF team and [[JTF2]] reconnaissance teams spent some nine days conducting extensive SSE, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they didn't encounter any al-Qaeda fighters.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=49-50 & 77}} Subsequent SEAL operations during the invasion of Afghanistan were conducted within Task Force K-Bar, a joint special operations unit of [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]], [[Air Force Special Operations Command|United States Air Force Special Tactics Teams]], and special operations forces from Norway, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Denmark. Task Force K-Bar conducted combat operations in the massive cave complexes near the city of [[Kandahar]] and surrounding territory, the town of Prata Ghar and hundreds of miles of rough terrain in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of six months Task Force K-Bar killed or captured over 200 Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, and destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of weapons and ordnance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn February 2002, while at Camp Rhino, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] passed on intelligence from a [[Predator drone]] operating in the [[Paktia]] province that [[Taliban]] Mullah [[Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa]] was spotted leaving a building by vehicle convoy. SEALs and Danish [[J\u00e6gerkorpset]] commandos boarded Air Force [[Pave Low]] helicopters and seized Khairkhwa on the road less than two hours later.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=78}} The SEALs continued to perform reconnaissance operations for the Marines until leaving after having spent 45 days on the ground.\n\nIn March 2002, SEALs from DEVGRU, SEAL Team 2, 3 and 8 participated extensively in [[Operation Anaconda]].

Roberts|Neil Roberts]] from DEVGRU,{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=54-69}} was thrown from his helicopter when it took fire from entrenched al Qaeda fighters. Roberts was subsequently killed after engaging and fighting dozens of enemies for almost an hour. Several SEALs were wounded in a rescue attempt and their Air Force Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant [[John A. Chapman|John Chapman]], was killed. Attempts to rescue the stranded SEAL also led to the deaths of several US Army Rangers and an [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force Pararescueman]] acting as a Quick Reaction Force.\n\n[[File:US Navy 050628-N-0000X-005 Navy file photo of SEAL Lt.

Their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids, particularly against HVTs. The Naval Special Operations Task Group was assigned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was built around a core of SEAL Teams 8 and 10, Polish [[GROM]], [[Royal Marines]] from [[40 Commando|40]] and [[42 Commando]] under the command of [[3 Commando Brigade]] and attached [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command|US Psy Ops and civil affairs]] teams. The Naval Task Group was principally tasked with the capture of the port of [[Umm Qasr]], Iraq's only deep-water port; the oil pipeline facilities of the [[Al-Faw Peninsula]]; and the two off-shore platforms the pipelines fed. Once these initial target sets were secured, the Task Group would support conventional forces in the south, conducting reconnaissance and raiding activities. Aviation support was provided by both Marine air of the 15th MEU and [[20th Special Operations Squadron]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=96}}\n\nSeveral days before the beginning of the invasion, two SDV teams were launched from [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]] in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographic reconnaissance]] of the [[KAAOT|Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals]]. After swimming under the terminals and securing their [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle|Mark 8 mod 1s]], the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} On 20 March 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|Navy EOD]] a USAF combat controller and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal whilst GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM operators.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=123}}\n\nThe shore-based pumping stations (known as MMS-Monitoring and Meter Stations) and their pipelines on the Al-Faw Peninsula were [[Battle of Al Faw (2003)|seized by]] 12 SEALS from SEAL Team 3, who were mounted in DPVs. They took off from Kuwait and were inserted under Iraqi anti-aircraft fire by MH-53 helicopters. The target area was 'softened up' by [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] bombs dropped from [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] on Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities. After a brief firefight in which the SEALs killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13, the SEALs secured the MMS and the pipelines, and were relieved by Royal Marines from 40 Commando. The SEALs advised the Marines, helping coordinate [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectres]] fire support onto Iraqi forces. The other shore-based pumping station at Umm Qasr was secured by SEALs and Royal Marines; before they landed, AC-130 Spectres and [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10As]] engaged a nearby [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] installation and a responding Iraqi mechanised unit.

SEALs and [[Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen|Special Boat teams]] helped secure the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr Az Zubyar waterways, which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of Umm Qasr. SEALs from the unit that secured the al-Faw MMS also conducted reconnaissance on the Shat Al Arab waterway, that was later secured by British forces.

In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by six US Air Force [[Sikorsky MH-53|MH-53J Pave Lows]]; the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw, the SEALs found their DPVs (the SEAL unit at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when they were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2017}} Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and with the exception of a GROM [[soldier]] who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation.

In September 2004, a SEAL sniper element was tasked with establishing an overwatch and surveillance position overlooking [[Haifa Street]], they were inserted by [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] from a unit of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], however they were spotted and engaged by insurgents. The SEALs notified the Bradleys, they drove back, fired on the insurgents and set up a cordon for the SEALs to be extracted, one Bradley was destroyed by a car bomb, there were no casualties and the SEALs were extracted.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=178-179}}\n\nIn the interim between the First Battle of Fallujah and [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], insurgents in [[Fallujah]] knew that the coalition assault was inevitable and under the guidance of the influx of foreign fighters, began to build defensive networks throughout the city-ranging from fortified buildings, trench lines, [[berm]]s, strategically placed [[car bomb]]s and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. In preparations for the second battle, SEALs conducted reconnaissance near the berms and tested out reports that the insurgents were equipped with night-vision equipment, they proved this by throwing an infra-red chemical light into the street which drew small arms fire. SEALs along with the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] and [[MCSOCOM Detachment One|Det One]] and other JSOC elements were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to the 7 November [[D-Day (military term)|D-DAY]] when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. When the offensive on the insurgents in the city began, many of the US Marine companies had SEAL sniper teams attached to them, mainly from SEAL Teams 3, 5 and 10.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=175-178}}\n\nFrom 2005, SEALs were heavily committed to western Iraq in [[Al Anbar Governorate]], [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|AQI]] terrorists who escaped Fallujah had relocated to [[Ramadi]]. A SEAL Task Unit was co-located with the Marines at [[Al Asad Airbase]] and sent elements to Ramadi and [[Habbaniyah]], the SEALs were initially tasked with target development for the Marines and providing sniper overwatch for their patrols. The SEALs were already training an Iraqi Army unit in Habbaniyah, although [[Foreign internal defense|FID]] was their main focus until later that year. A SEAL Task Unit generally comprised two individual SEAL Platoons: each Platoon was made up of seven-man squad elements commanded by a [[junior officer]], three of these Task Units (although a fourth was often added) along with a Special Boat Team detachment and a Headquarters Team (including integral intelligence, targeting and EOD personnel) made up a Naval Special Warfare Squadron. According to [[Dick Couch]], the SEALs began FID with two Iraqi units-the Army Scouts who conducted conventional reconnaissance missions, and the SMP (Special Missions Platoon), a locally formed unit that would later fight alongside the SEALs. Despite several challenges, the SEALs were soon conducted operations with partnered units, particularly in Special Reconnaissance, focusing on the surveillance aspect, whilst conventional US Army or Marines would conduct raids and arrests.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=179-180}} The typical loadout of the SEALs in Ramadi included the M4 carbine, optimised for close quarter battle with a 10-inch barrel equipped with a 6-inch sound suppressor, Surefire flashlight and EOTech sight, short barrel and foregrip and seven magazines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://corpidelite.net/afm/2017/05/a-navy-seal-loadout-in-ramadi/ |title=A Navy SEAL loadout in Ramadi |website=Corpi d'\u00e9lite.net |language=en-US |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi, AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local [[Sheikh]]s and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes, thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality. Al-Qaeda's efforts to install a [[Sharia]]-style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI's downfall-when in the first half of 2006, in the run-up to the [[Battle of Ramadi (2006)|Second Battle of Ramadi]] SEALs, increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division]] which was planning the offensive. SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP, would conduct reconnaissance, surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks; with their own targeting cell, they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders. The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer [[Michael A. Monsoor]] died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight, two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building, a fourth SEAL (only lightly wounded), managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire. A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor (whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV) and the wounded SEALs, Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi, combined with the brutal tactics of AQI, helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative-the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs' militias into the Iraqi Security Forces. These volunteers would serve locally in their communities to defend them against al-Qaeda, a month after the kidnapping and murder of Sheikh Khalid by AQI (which proved to be the tipping point), the Sheikhs signed a declaration agreeing to fight AQI and by the closing of 2006, even former insurgents were joining the local police (later known as the [[Anbar Awakening]]) by the end of the battle, some 1,100 terrorists were killed.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=180-182}}\n\nIn Fallujah, the SEAL Task Unit were also heavily involved in fighting. In one joint operation to capture an AQI leader, they entered the target building and were engaged resulting in an Iraqi Scout being killed and a SEAL severely wounded, two SEALs returned fire and entered the building, both SEALs entered different rooms, in one room the SEAL encountered three insurgents who opened fired at close range, another SEAL across the hallway was struck in the head and killed, the SEAL in the room with the insurgents killed all three.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=182}}\n\nIn September 2009, in a nighttime raid in Fallujah, SEALs captured [[Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi]] (nicknamed the \"Butcher of Fallujah\"), a prominent al-Qaeda terrorist who was the mastermind behind the [[2004 Fallujah ambush]]. Al-Isawai made accusations of mistreatment while in custody, and testified in April 2010 at the ensuing [[court-martial|courts-martial]] against three SEALs (all of whom were acquitted).<ref name=RobinsonBook>{{cite book |title=Honor and Betrayal: The Untold Story of the Navy Seals Who Captured the \"Butcher of Fallujah\"\u2014and the Shameful Ordeal They Later Endured |isbn=978-0-30682-309-1 |year=2013 |last=Robinson |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Robinson (author) |publisher=[[Perseus Book Group]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NUQPAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9780306823091}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Navy SEAL not guilty of charges in Iraq |author=CNN Wire Staff |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2016 |website=[[CNN]] |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/04/22/navy.seal.verdict/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Navy SEAL Found Not Guilty of Assaulting a Suspected Terrorist |website=[[Fox News]] |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/06/navy-seal-guilty-assaulting-suspected-terrorist.html |accessdate=28 November 2016 |first=Steve |last=Centanni}}</ref> Iraqi authorities later tried and executed al-Isawi by [[hanging]] at some point before November 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Persecuting Our Heroes |first=Ray V. |last=Hartwell |magazine=[[The American Spectator]] |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2016 |url=https://spectator.org/56777_persecuting-our-heroes/}}</ref>\n\nSEALS remained employed throughout the Iraqi Campaign as Task Units or Task Elements until its close in 2011.\n\n===Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Philippines===\n{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Philippines}}\n\nOEF-P was established in 2002 to conduct long-term partnered operations with both Philippine Army special operations and intelligence units, as well as police units to counter the threat posed by the [[Abu Sayyaf|ASG]] and [[Jemaah Islamiyah|JI]] terrorist groups.

He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a \"not to interfere\" basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the \"Leap Frogs\" name.<ref name=\"leap-frogs\"/>\n\nThe team was officially commissioned as the U.S. Navy Parachute Team in 1974 by the Chief of Naval Operations and assigned the mission of demonstrating Navy excellence throughout the United States. The East Coast-based \"Chuting Stars\" were disbanded in the 1980s with the \"Leap Frogs\" taking on all official parachute demonstrations within the Navy.\n\nA typical Leap Frogs performance consists of six jumpers leaping out of an aircraft at an altitude of 6,000 feet. After freefalling sometimes using smoke or streamers, the Leap Frogs fly their canopies together to build canopy-relative work formations. After performances, the Leap Frogs make themselves available to the public to answer questions about the Navy and the Naval Special Warfare community, as well as to sign autographs.\n\n==Influence on foreign units==\n[[File:GROM with Navy SEALs 01.jpg|thumb|right|US Navy SEALs and [[JW GROM|GROM]]\u2014Polish naval warfare team members\u2014practicing boarding skills near Gdansk, Poland, 2009]]\nFrom its predecessors, the [[Underwater Demolition Teams]], to its current form, the SEALs have influenced the training and formation of several foreign units.
