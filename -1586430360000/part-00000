The T2 is also known as the \"D\u00fcsseldorf transporter\", since it was built in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] from 1967 on. The third series, built from 1996 at [[Ludwigsfelde]], was branded the [[Mercedes-Benz Vario]]. Some T2s were assembled by Mercedes-Benz Espa\u00f1a in their [[Alcobendas]] assembly plant.\n\nFor Argentina, the first T2 product are the L 608 D in 1969 until 1990. In 1989, the new products are the L 710, L 914 and 814 with the LO variant (chassis bus). The production ceased in 1966. The Venezuelan version of the T2 was manufactured in [[Barcelona, Anzo\u00e1tegui|Barcelona]] by the ''Grupo Consorcio 1390 S.A.'' (currently ''[[:de:MMC Automoritz|MMC Automoritz S.A.]]'') as the ''Mercedes-Benz Class L3''. The L3 was built from 1969 up to 1978, when the company was bought by the [[Ford Motor Company]].\n\n==First generation (1967\u20131986)==\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz T 2 (407 D).jpg|thumb|left|T2 407D pre-facelift]]\n[[File:Mercedes t2 facelift sst.jpg|thumb|left|T2 407D post-facelift]]\nIn 1967, the T2 was introduced as a successor to the [[Mercedes-Benz L 319|L 319 / L 406]] series. The vehicle filled the gap between the smaller [[Mercedes-Benz T1]] (or Bremen Transporter) and the heavier trucks, manufactured in [[W\u00f6rth am Main|W\u00f6rth]].\n\nThe T2 was available as a box van, a flat-bed light truck (with single or double cab), or a minibus. From 1977 the chassis was offered, for the mounting of larger box van and bus bodies, in two different widths. In 1981 the T2 received a facelift, the most visible differences were the new [[radiator grille]], which now was a moulding of black plastic. The various T2 versions were popular for a wide range of applications: they were used as delivery vans, light builders' vans or trucks, fire-brigade and rescue support vehicles, post office parcel delivery vans (featuring sliding doors) and for very many other uses. In the early 1970s, T2 was also offered branded as a ''Hanomag-Henschel''. In Brazil and some other South American countries it was built with a turbo system.\n\nProduction of flat-bed trucks of the first generation ended after 19 year construction period, after approximately 450,000 vehicles had been produced, in 1986.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second generation (1986\u20131996)==\n[[File:Former London & Country Mercedes Bus, M461 JPA (8589102641).jpg|thumb|[[Shaftesbury & District]] [[Plaxton Beaver|Plaxton Beaver 1]] bodied Mercedes-Benz 811 in Gillingham, Dorset]]\n[[File:Mercedes T2 (505830881).jpg|thumb|Mercedes-Benz 609D]]\n\nThe second generation of the T2 was introduced in 1986, and was manufactured until 1996.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/5th-july-1986/25/12-a-new-generation T2: a new generation] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' 5 July 1986</ref> It was significantly upgraded, the bonnet having become longer and the design altogether more sharp-edged.

{"title_page": "Otolithic membrane", "text_new": "{{Infobox anatomy\n|Name = Otolithic membrane\n|Latin = membrana statoconiorum\n|Image = \n|Caption = \n}}\nThe '''otolithic membrane''' is a [[fibrous]] structure located in the [[vestibular system]] of the [[inner ear]]. It plays a critical role in the [[brain]]'s interpretation of [[list of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The [[membrane]] serves to determine if the body or the head is tilted, in addition to the [[linear acceleration]] of the body. The linear acceleration could be in the horizontal direction as in a moving car or vertical acceleration such as that felt when an elevator moves up or down.\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Otoliths w CrossSection.jpg|thumb|The utricle (left) is approximately horizontally oriented; the saccule (center) lies approximately vertical. The arrows indicate the local on-directions of the hair cells; and the thick black lines indicate the location of the striola. On the right you see a cross-section through the otolith membrane.]]\nThe otolithic membrane is part of the [[otolith]] organs in the vestibular system. The otolith organs include the [[utricle (ear)|utricle]] and the [[saccule]]. The otolith organs are beds of sensory [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s in the inner ear, specifically small patches of hair cells. Overlying the hair cells and their hair bundles is a [[gelatinous]] layer and above that layer is the otolithic membrane.<ref name=Purves>{{cite book|last=Purves|first=Dale|title=Neuroscience|year=2012|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|isbn=978-0-87893-695-3|pages=307\u2013309}}</ref> The utricle serves to measure horizontal accelerations and the saccule responds to vertical accelerations. The reason for this difference is the orientation of the macula in the two organs. The [[utricular macula]] lie horizontal in the utricle, while the [[saccular macula]] lies vertical in the saccule. Every hair cell in these sensory beds consist of 40-70 [[stereocilia]] and a [[kinocilium]].<ref name=Krstic>{{cite book|last=Krstic|first=Radivoj|title=Human Microscopic Anatomy: An Atlas for Students of Medicine and Biology|year=1997|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-53666-6}}</ref> The sterocilia and kinocilium are embedded in the otolithic membrane and are essential in the function of the otolith organs. The hair cells are deflected by structures called [[otoconia]].\n\n=== Otoconia ===\nOtoconia are crystals of [[calcium carbonate]] and make the otolithic membrane heavier than the structures and fluids surrounding it.<ref name=Purves /> The otoconia are composite crystallites that overlie the macular sensory [[epithelium]] of the gravity receptors of most vertebrates and are required for optimal stimulus input of linear acceleration and gravity.<ref name=\"Lundberg 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Lundberg|first=Y.W.|author2=Zhao, X. |author3=Yamoah, E.N. |title=Assembly of the otoconia complex to the macular sensory epithelium of the vestibule|journal=Brain Research|year=2006|volume=1091|issue=1|pages=47\u201357|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.02.083|pmid=16600187}}</ref> Fishes often have a single large crystal called an otolith, but otoconia from higher vertebrates have numerous crystals, and each apparently single crystal in fact has multiple crystallites that are composed of organic and inorganic components. Ultra-high resolution [[transmission electron microscopy]] of rat otoconia shows that the crystallites are 50-100&nbsp;nm in diameter, have round edges and are highly ordered into laminae.<ref name=\"Lundberg 2006\" /> Biomineralization of otoliths and otoconia results mainly from the release of soluble calcium ions, which is in turn precipitated as calcium carbonate crystals.<ref name=Parmentier>{{cite journal|last=Parmentier|first=E.|author2=Cloots, R. |author3=Warin, R. |author4=Henrist, C. |title=Otolith crystals (in Carapidae): Growth and habit|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|year=2007|volume=159|issue=3|pages=462\u2013473|doi=10.1016/j.jsb.2007.05.006|pmid=17616468|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/14701}}</ref>\n\nThe mechanical coupling of the otoconia to the hair cell sensory sterocilia at the surface of the vestibular sensory epithelium is mediated by two layers of the [[extracellular matrix]], each on with a specific role in the mechanical [[Signal transduction|transduction]] process.<ref name=\"Kachar 1990\">{{cite journal|last=Kachar|first=B.|author2=Parakkal, M. |author3=Fex, J. |title=Structural basis for mechanical transduction in the frog vestibular sensory apparatus: I.

The second layer formed by columnar [[protein filament|filament]]s secures the membrane above the surface of the epithelium.<ref name=\"Kachar 1990\" />\n\n== Evolution ==\nOtolithic membrane structure has been frequently studied in [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] in order to elucidate the differences and to understand how the membrane has evolved in various [[otolith]] organs. Otolithic membranes of utricles in reptiles and amphibians represent thin plates of non-uniform structure, while the otolithic membrane in the saccule resembles a large cobble-stone-like conglomerate of otoconia. In fish, amphibians and reptiles there is also a third otolith organ that is not present in humans, and is called the [[Lagena (anatomy)|lagena]]. The otolithic membrane in the lagena of amphibians is poorly differentiated, but well differentiated in reptiles.

This illusion is felt symmetrically in normal patients, but after vestibular neuroectomy, patients perceive a reduce illusion when the force is directed toward their operated ear.<ref name=\"Curthoys 1990\">{{cite journal|last=Curthoys|first=I.S. |author2=M.J.

One of these techniques is referred to as a [[finite element method]] which divides the membrane into triangles and a computer is used to determine the linear combination of the functions that represent the displacement which solves a complex system of equations.<ref name=\"Twizell 1977\">{{cite journal|last=Twizell|first=E.H.|author2=Curran, D.A.S.|title=A finite model of the otolith membrane|journal=Computers in Biology and Medicine|year=1977|volume=7|issue=2|pages=131\u2013141|doi=10.1016/0010-4825(77)90018-x}}</ref> The finite element method was initially developed for use in fields such as [[mechanical engineering]] and [[civil engineering]] to solve [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]] [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) and has had enormous success. The finite element method opposes another technique for solving PDEs, the [[finite difference method]] and has been shown to be more effective in modeling the otolithic membrane by several studies, but has also been opposed by other researchers.<ref name=\"Twizell 1977\" /> Similar models have even been developed to take into account varying acceleration of gravity to model the effect of the otolithic membrane in environments with changing gravitational effects such as space, the moon and other planets.<ref name=\"Twizell 1980\">{{cite journal|last=Twizell|first=E.H.|title=A variable gravity model of the otolith membrane|journal=Applied Mathematical Modelling|year=1980|volume=4|issue=2|pages=82\u201386|doi=10.1016/0307-904x(80)90110-9}}</ref>\n\n===Finite difference models===\nThe alternative method used for modeling the otolithic membrane is the finite difference method, while the finite element method has advantages in handling complicated geometry, while difference method is more easily implemented. Difference models impose a rectangular grid over the shape of the otolithic membrane and use different boundary [[extrapolate|extrapolation]] schemes applied to boundary conditions. Another method uses an optimization technique to generate a non-uniform grid which conforms to the shape of the membrane, and then generates a grid via general coordinate transformations.<ref name=\"Castillo 1992\">{{cite journal|last=Castillo|first=J.|author2=McDermott, G. |author3=McEachern, M. |author4=Richardson, J. |title=A comparative analysis of numerical techniques applied to a model of the otolithic membrane|journal=Computers & Mathematics with Applications|year=1992|volume=24|issue=7|pages=133\u2013141|doi=10.1016/0898-1221(92)90162-b}}</ref>  The main steps of such models include 1) place a set of points on the membrane (usually modeled as an irregular [[ellipse]], 2) [[Discretization|discretize]] partial differential equations and 3) solve the discrete equations.<ref name=\"Castillo 1994\">{{cite journal|last=Castillo|first=J.|author2=McEachern, M. |author3=Richardson, J. |author4=Steinberg, S. |title=Modeling the otolithic membrane using boundary-fitted coordinates|journal=Applied Mathematical Modelling|year=1994|volume=18|issue=7|pages=391\u2013399|doi=10.1016/0307-904x(94)90225-9}}</ref> There are also several parameters of the otolithic membrane that are important for the modeling process.

In the model, the membrane is treated as a [[Kelvin\u2013Voigt material]], meaning that it has both properties of [[viscosity]] and [[Elasticity coefficient|elasticity]]. For this technique, the process of transformation of information in the chain sensing linear acceleration is taken into account, starting from an external acceleration and ending at hair cell [[depolarization]]. The model shows that a response is dependent on two factors which are the spatial dependence of gel displacement and the spatial distribution of stereocilia height in the hair cell bundle.<ref name=\"Kondrachuk 2002\">{{cite journal|last=Kondrachuk|first=A.V.|title=Models of otolithic membrane-hair cell bundle interaction|journal=Hearing Research|year=2002|volume=166|issue=1\u20132|pages=96\u2013112|doi=10.1016/s0378-5955(02)00302-7}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links ==\n* http://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorders/types-vestibular-disorders/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ear]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePathologies and disorders:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolithic_membrane"}
