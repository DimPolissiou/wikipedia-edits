The university was founded as a response to the increasing number of students at the [[University of Copenhagen]] after [[World War I]]. Classrooms were rented from the Technical College and the teaching corps consisted of one professor of philosophy and four associate professors of Danish, English, German and French. Along with ''Universitets-Samvirket'' (\"The University Association\") which consisted of representatives of Aarhus' businesses, organisations and institutions, the municipality of Aarhus had fought since 1921 to have Denmark's next university located in the city.<ref name=\"au-history\">{{cite web | url = http://www.au.dk/en/about/profile/history/history/ | title = History of The University of Aarhus | accessdate = 2012-07-08 | last = Trefzer | first = Sandra | date = 3 Oct 2011 | publisher = Aarhus University}}</ref><ref name=\"DSD-au\">{{cite web | url = http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Erhverv%2C_karriere_og_ledelse/P%C3%A6dagogik_og_uddannelse/Danske_universiteter/Aarhus_Universitet | title = Aarhus Universitet | accessdate = 2012-07-08 | author = Gyldendal | work = Den Store Danske | publisher = [[Gyldendal]] | language = Danish}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, the municipality of Aarhus gave the university land with a landscape of rolling hills.<ref name=\"DSD-au\" /> The design of the university buildings and 12 ha campus area was assigned to architects [[C. F. M\u00f8ller]], [[Kay Fisker]] and [[Povl Stegmann]], who won the architectural competition in 1931. Construction of the first buildings began a year later, but the campus was developed in stages and is still under development {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Since 1939, [[C. F. M\u00f8ller Architects]] has been responsible for the architectural design of Aarhus University in accordance with the original [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] design key, perhaps best exemplified by the characteristic yellow brick and tile.\n\nThe first buildings was finished in 1933 and housed the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Anatomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/galleri/lokaliteterogbygninger/aarhusuniversitetsfoerstebygning/|title=Aarhus Universitets f\u00f8rste bygning [The first building of Aarhus University] |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> These departments later moved to newer buildings at the campus and the original building complex now house Department of Psychology and Department of Political Science.

In 1941, construction of The Main Building (''Hovedbygningen'') commenced, a complex to house the university aula (assembly hall) and canteen among academic and administrative purposes. The stringent minimalist and uncompromising functionalistic design of the first university buildings from 1933 had stirred some local dissatisfaction and it was decided that The Main Building should possess more traditional romantic and [[Neoclassical architecture|classical architectural]] inspirations - although in agreement with the original architectural plan -, and also make use of more lavish and expensive materials. The Main Building was finished in 1946 and still stands out from the rest of the University campus as somewhat different in its architectural design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/galleri/lokaliteterogbygninger/hovedbygningen/|title=Hovedbygningen (indviet 1946) |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn comparison with the original 4,190m<sup>2</sup> floor space of the first buildings, Aarhus University now holds a floor space of 246,000m<sup>2</sup> in the University Park alone.<ref name=\"Albeck163\" /> A series of buildings outside the main campus adds an additional floor space of 59,000m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"au-history\" />\n\n===Faculties===\n\nFrom 1928, Aarhus University offered courses in languages and philosophy, but the students were unable to finish their studies without going to the University of Copenhagen for their final examinations. By request of the Ministry of Education, the Teachers' Association made a draft of how to conduct the final examinations in the humanistic subjects in Aarhus and in the draft, the Association proposed that the faculty was named the Faculty of Humanities by analogy with the corresponding faculties in [[Uppsala]], [[Lund]] and [[Turku]]. After negotiations between the faculties in Aarhus and Copenhagen, the King declared on 8 May 1935 that the final university examinations could be held at the Faculty of Philosophy in Copenhagen as well as at the Faculty of Humanities in Aarhus. This was the first final examinations Aarhus University was allowed to hold, but on 24 July 1936 the king granted the Faculty of Humanities the right to hold examinations for the [[Cand.mag.|magister]] degree and in 1940 for the [[PhD]].<ref name=\"au-history\" /><ref name=\"Faber74\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=74}}</ref>\n\nAarhus University had offered courses in basic medical subjects from 1933 and on 10 October 1935 the Faculty of Medicine was formally established.<ref name=\"Albeck265\">{{Harvnb|Albeck|1978|p=265}}</ref> The establishment of a Faculty of Medicine in Aarhus was met with some opposition from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Copenhagen.

The Committee approved and by declaration of the king on 5 November 1937, the faculty could hold examinations in economics and law.<ref name=\"Faber95\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=95}}</ref>\n\nCourses had been offered in theology since 1932 at the Faculty of Humanities, but in 1942 the Faculty of Theology was formally established.<ref name=\"DSD-au\" /> Already on 22 June 1928, [[Reverend]] Balslev of Aarhus had proposed that Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus (not yet university) taught basic courses in theology. Though the proposal was greeted by the management, the Faculty of Theology in Copenhagen pointed out that it would take 3 full-time teachers of the [[New Testament]], [[Old Testament]] and [[History of Christianity|ecclesiastical history]], respectively as well as education in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] by the Faculty of Humanities. At this time, Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus did not have the financial means to meet these criteria so the case was shelved for the time being. In April 1931, the case reopened, this time by [[Bishop]] Skat Hoffmeyer who proposed free teaching in the required subjects. The management asked the faculty in Copenhagen if this was acceptable, but because the teaching was free, the faculty saw it as tutoring rather than actual teaching and they neither approved or disproved of such an approach though they did not see it as actual university teaching. The municipality of Aarhus did not aid with funds and the management deemed a request of the state to be futile so they decided to disregard getting the teaching approved and start it anyway under the supervision of Skat Hoffmeyer. On 5 September 1932 Reverend Asmund held the first lecture in theology. This private education in theology continued until the university could hire its own professors in 1938, and in 1942 Aarhus University could at long last establish the Faculty of Theology.<ref name=\"au-history\" /><ref name=\"Faber99105\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|pp=99\u2013105}}</ref>\n\n===The main building and World War II===\n{{See also|Aarhus Air Raid}}\n\n[[File:Buerne mod parken 2.jpg|thumb|The brick [[colonnade]]s]]\nIn 1938, the university management acknowledged it was time to consider an expansion due to lack of space and overcrowding of the auditoriums. The solution was The Main Building (''Hovedbygningen''), containing both rooms and facilities for new academic areas, as well as housing for the general administration, an assembly hall and a canteen. The building was to be organized according to a principle of institutes so that teaching and research took place in certain rooms with their own library and study for the professor.<ref name=\"Faber114\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|pp=114\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Universitet - mindetavle.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial in the main building to honour the ten victims of the 1944 air strike and the two workers killed during construction in 1941.]]\n[[File:Aulaen (klaver).jpg|thumb|Detail from the Aula, with specially designed lamps and furniture.]]\nThe construction of the building took place during the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation of Denmark]] (1940\u201345) in [[World War II]], which affected the process in more than one way. No state funds had been involved in the construction of the first university building and a second building for [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], and a [[high voltage]] laboratory, but because the [[Nazism|Nazis]] were against civil use of materials and work forces, the state contributed to the main building. In 1943, the [[Gestapo]], [[Sicherheitsdienst]], [[Geheime Feldpolizei]] and [[Abwehr]] set up their regional headquarters in the five student halls of residence on campus. Fearing that the same would happen to the new main building, its completion was delayed. C. F. M\u00f8ller later wrote that for once there was plenty of time to work on the details of the building, like patterned brickwork, acoustic screens and furniture.<ref name=\"M\u00f8ller4658\">{{Harvnb|M\u00f8ller|1978|pp=46\u201358}}</ref><ref name=\"Fode103\">{{Harvnb|Fode|2005|p=103}}</ref> Furniture designer [[Aage Windeleff]], designed the furniture specially for the main building, while [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]]'s industrially produced furniture designs are the most commonly used elsewhere on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/web-udstillinger/moebler-ved-aarhus-universitet/|title=M\u00f8bler ved Aarhus Universitet [Furniture at Aarhus University] |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of the Gestapo in Aarhus led to multiple arrests of Danish resistance fighters and [[Danish resistance movement|the resistance movement]] soon realized they needed outside assistance. On 15 October, the leader of the illegal Danish underground army in Jutland, [[Niels Bennike]], sent the following telegram to [[London]]:<ref name=\"Fode103\" />\n[[File:Aula (Aarhus Universitet).jpg|thumb|University Aula]]\n{{quote|\nUndergrunden i Jyland ved at blive revet op af Gestapo.

The stringent minimalist and uncompromising functionalistic design of the first university buildings from 1933 had stirred some local dissatisfaction and it was decided that The Main Building should possess more traditional romantic and [[Neoclassical architecture|classical architectural]] inspirations - although in agreement with the original architectural plan -, and also make use of more lavish and expensive materials. The Main Building was finished in 1946 and still stands out from the rest of the University campus as somewhat different in its architectural design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/galleri/lokaliteterogbygninger/hovedbygningen/|title=Hovedbygningen (indviet 1946) |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn comparison with the original 4,190m<sup>2</sup> floor space of the first buildings, Aarhus University now holds a floor space of 246,000m<sup>2</sup> in the University Park alone.<ref name=\"Albeck163\" /> A series of buildings outside the main campus adds an additional floor space of 59,000m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"au-history\" />\n\n===Faculties===\n\nFrom 1928, Aarhus University offered courses in languages and philosophy, but the students were unable to finish their studies without going to the University of Copenhagen for their final examinations. By request of the Ministry of Education, the Teachers' Association made a draft of how to conduct the final examinations in the humanistic subjects in Aarhus and in the draft, the Association proposed that the faculty was named the Faculty of Humanities by analogy with the corresponding faculties in [[Uppsala]], [[Lund]] and [[Turku]]. After negotiations between the faculties in Aarhus and Copenhagen, the King declared on 8 May 1935 that the final university examinations could be held at the Faculty of Philosophy in Copenhagen as well as at the Faculty of Humanities in Aarhus. This was the first final examinations Aarhus University was allowed to hold, but on 24 July 1936 the king granted the Faculty of Humanities the right to hold examinations for the [[Cand.mag.|magister]] degree and in 1940 for the [[PhD]].<ref name=\"au-history\" /><ref name=\"Faber74\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=74}}</ref>\n\nAarhus University had offered courses in basic medical subjects from 1933 and on 10 October 1935 the Faculty of Medicine was formally established.<ref name=\"Albeck265\">{{Harvnb|Albeck|1978|p=265}}</ref> The establishment of a Faculty of Medicine in Aarhus was met with some opposition from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Copenhagen.

The Committee approved and by declaration of the king on 5 November 1937, the faculty could hold examinations in economics and law.<ref name=\"Faber95\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|p=95}}</ref>\n\nCourses had been offered in theology since 1932 at the Faculty of Humanities, but in 1942 the Faculty of Theology was formally established.<ref name=\"DSD-au\" /> Already on 22 June 1928, [[Reverend]] Balslev of Aarhus had proposed that Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus (not yet university) taught basic courses in theology. Though the proposal was greeted by the management, the Faculty of Theology in Copenhagen pointed out that it would take 3 full-time teachers of the [[New Testament]], [[Old Testament]] and [[History of Christianity|ecclesiastical history]], respectively as well as education in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] by the Faculty of Humanities. At this time, Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus did not have the financial means to meet these criteria so the case was shelved for the time being. In April 1931, the case reopened, this time by [[Bishop]] Skat Hoffmeyer who proposed free teaching in the required subjects. The management asked the faculty in Copenhagen if this was acceptable, but because the teaching was free, the faculty saw it as tutoring rather than actual teaching and they neither approved or disproved of such an approach though they did not see it as actual university teaching. The municipality of Aarhus did not aid with funds and the management deemed a request of the state to be futile so they decided to disregard getting the teaching approved and start it anyway under the supervision of Skat Hoffmeyer. On 5 September 1932 Reverend Asmund held the first lecture in theology. This private education in theology continued until the university could hire its own professors in 1938, and in 1942 Aarhus University could at long last establish the Faculty of Theology.<ref name=\"au-history\" /><ref name=\"Faber99105\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|pp=99\u2013105}}</ref>\n\n===The main building and World War II===\n{{See also|Aarhus Air Raid}}\n\n[[File:Buerne mod parken 2.jpg|thumb|The brick [[colonnade]]s]]\nIn 1938, the university management acknowledged it was time to consider an expansion due to lack of space and overcrowding of the auditoriums. The solution was The Main Building (''Hovedbygningen''), containing both rooms and facilities for new academic areas, as well as housing for the general administration, an assembly hall and a canteen. The building was to be organized according to a principle of institutes so that teaching and research took place in certain rooms with their own library and study for the professor.<ref name=\"Faber114\">{{Harvnb|Faber|1946|pp=114\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aarhus Universitet - mindetavle.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial in the main building to honour the ten victims of the 1944 air strike and the two workers killed during construction in 1941.]]\n[[File:Aulaen (klaver).jpg|thumb|Detail from the Aula, with specially designed lamps and furniture.]]\nThe construction of the building took place during the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation of Denmark]] (1940\u201345) in [[World War II]], which affected the process in more than one way. No state funds had been involved in the construction of the first university building and a second building for [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], and a [[high voltage]] laboratory, but because the [[Nazism|Nazis]] were against civil use of materials and work forces, the state contributed to the main building. In 1943, the [[Gestapo]], [[Sicherheitsdienst]], [[Geheime Feldpolizei]] and [[Abwehr]] set up their regional headquarters in the five student halls of residence on campus. Fearing that the same would happen to the new main building, its completion was delayed. C. F. M\u00f8ller later wrote that for once there was plenty of time to work on the details of the building, like patterned brickwork, acoustic screens and furniture.<ref name=\"M\u00f8ller4658\">{{Harvnb|M\u00f8ller|1978|pp=46\u201358}}</ref><ref name=\"Fode103\">{{Harvnb|Fode|2005|p=103}}</ref> Furniture designer [[Aage Windeleff]], designed the furniture specially for the main building, while [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]]'s industrially produced furniture designs are the most commonly used elsewhere on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/om/profil/historie/showroom/web-udstillinger/moebler-ved-aarhus-universitet/|title=M\u00f8bler ved Aarhus Universitet [Furniture at Aarhus University] |publisher=Aarhus University|language=Danish|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of the Gestapo in Aarhus led to multiple arrests of Danish resistance fighters and [[Danish resistance movement|the resistance movement]] soon realized they needed outside assistance.
