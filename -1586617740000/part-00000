A regional military power in the 18th century, Muscat's influence extended as far as [[East Africa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. As an important port-town in the [[Gulf of Oman]], Muscat attracted foreign tradesmen and settlers such as the Persians and the [[Baloch people|Balochi]]s. Since the ascension of [[Qaboos bin Said]] as [[Sultan]] of Oman in 1970, Muscat has experienced rapid infrastructural development that has led to the growth of a vibrant economy and a multi-ethnic society. Muscat is termed as a [[Global City]].\n\nThe rocky [[Al Hajar Mountains|Western Al Hajar Mountains]] dominate the landscape of Muscat. The city lies on the [[Arabian Sea]] along the Gulf of Oman and is in the proximity of the strategic [[Straits of Hormuz]]. Low-lying white buildings typify most of Muscat's urban landscape, while the [[Mina Qaboos|port-district]] of [[Muttrah]], with its [[corniche]] and harbour, form the north-eastern periphery of the city. Muscat's economy is dominated by trade, petroleum, liquified natural gas and porting.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Ptolemy]]'s ''Map of Arabia'' identifies the territories of ''Cryptus Portus''<ref name=\"Foster 1844, p.231\">Forster (1844), p.231.</ref> and ''Moscha Portus''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.241.</ref> Scholars are divided in opinion on which of the two related to the city of ''Muscat''. Similarly, [[Arrian]]us references ''Omana'' and ''Moscha'' in ''Voyage of Nearchus''. Interpretations of Arrianus' work by [[William Vincent (priest)|William Vincent]] and [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]] conclude that ''Omana'' was a reference to ''Oman'', while ''Moscha'' referred to ''Muscat''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.173.</ref> Similarly, other scholars identify [[Pliny the Elder]]'s reference to ''Amithoscuta'' to be ''Muscat''.<ref name=\"Foster 1844, p.231\"/>\n\nThe origin of the word ''Muscat'' is disputed. Some authors claim that the word has [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origins &ndash; from ''moscha'', meaning an ''inflated hide'' or ''skin''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.173</ref> Other authors claim that the name ''Muscat'' means ''[[Anchorage (shipping)|anchorage]]'' or ''the place of \"letting fall the anchor\"''.<ref>Miles (1997), p.468.</ref> Other derivations include ''muscat'' from [[Old Persian]], meaning ''strong-scented'',<ref>Hailman (2006), p.49.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} or from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], meaning ''falling-place'',<ref>Philips (1966), p.4.</ref> or ''hidden''.<ref>Room (2003), p.246.</ref>\n''Cryptus Portus'' is synonymous with Oman (\"hidden land\"). But \"Ov-man\" (Omman), and the old Sumerian name ''Magan (Maa-kan)'', means sea-people in Arabic. An inhabitant is a ''Muscatter'', ''Muscatian'', ''Muscatite'' or ''Muscatan''.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Muscat, Oman}}\n[[File:Muscat harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Muscat harbour, ca. 1903. Visible in the background is [[Fort Al Jalali]].]]\n[[File:RoyalOperaHouseMuscat 02.JPG|left|thumb|Royal Opera House Muscat]]\n[[File:The Persian problem; an examination of the rival positions of Russia and Great Britain in Persia, with some account of the Persian gulf and the Bagdad railway (1903) (14577292147) (cropped).jpg|thumb|400px|left|A view of Muscat ca. 1902]]\n\nEvidence of communal activity in the area around Muscat dates back to the 6th millennium [[Common Era|BCE]] in Ras al-Hamra, where burial sites of fishermen have been found. The graves appear to be well formed and indicate the existence of burial rituals. South of Muscat, remnants of [[Harappa]]n pottery indicate some level of contact with the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].<ref>Rice (1994), p.255-256</ref> Muscat's notability as a port was acknowledged as early as the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]] by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geographer [[Ptolemy]], who referred to it as ''Cryptus Portus'' (the ''Hidden Port''), and by [[Pliny the Elder]], who called it ''Amithoscuta''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.234.</ref>\n\nThe port fell to a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] invasion in the 3rd century CE, under the rule of [[Shapur I]],<ref>Potter (2002), p.41.</ref> while conversion to Islam occurred during the 7th century. Muscat's importance as a trading port continued to grow in the centuries that followed, under the influence of the [[Azd|Azd dynasty]], a local tribe. The establishment of the First [[Imamate]] in the 9th century CE was the first step in consolidating disparate Omani tribal factions under the banner of an [[Ibadi]] state. However, tribal skirmishes continued, allowing the [[Abbasid]]s of [[Baghdad]] to conquer Oman. The Abbasids occupied the region until the 11th century, when they were driven out by the local Yahmad tribe. Power over Oman shifted from the Yahmad tribe to the [[Azd]]i Nabahinah clan, during whose rule, the people of coastal ports such as Muscat prospered from maritime trade and close alliances with the [[Indian subcontinent]], at the cost of the alienation of the people of the interior of Oman.\n[[File:Qasr Al Alam Royal Palace (4).JPG|thumb|Oman Council building in Muscat]]\nThe [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] admiral [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] sailed to Muscat in 1507, in an attempt to establish trade relations. As he approached the harbor, his ships were fired on. He then decided to conquer Muscat. Most of the city burned to the ground during and after the fighting.\n\nThe Portuguese maintained a hold on Muscat for over a century, despite challenges from [[Persia]] and a bombardment of the town by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1546.<ref>Miles (1997), p.167</ref> The Turks twice captured Muscat from the Portuguese, in the [[Capture of Muscat (1552)]] and 1581\u201388. The election of [[Nasir bin Murshid|Nasir bin Murshid Al-Ya'rubi]] as Imam of Oman in 1624 changed the balance of power again in the region, from the Persians and the Portuguese to local Omanis. On August 16, 1648 the Imam dispatched an army to Muscat, which captured and demolished the high towers of the Portuguese, weakening their grip over the town. Decisively, in 1650, a small but determined body of the Imam's troops attacked the port at night, forcing an eventual Portuguese surrender on January 23, 1650.<ref>Miles (1997), p. 196.</ref> A civil war and repeated incursions by the Persian king [[Nader Shah]] in the 18th century destabilised the region, and further strained relations between the interior and Muscat. This power vacuum in Oman led to the emergence of the [[Al Bu Sa'id Dynasty|Al Bu Sa\u2018id dynasty]], which has ruled Oman ever since.<ref>Miles (1997), p.256.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|width=23em|\"Muscat is a large and very populous town, flanked on both sides with high mountains and the front is close to the water's edge; behind, towards the interior, there is a plain as large as the square of Lisbon, all covered with salt pans.

Muscat and [[Muttrah]] were attacked by tribes from the interior in 1895 and again in 1915.<ref>JE Peterson's Britannica entry (1990), p.6.</ref> A tentative ceasefire was brokered by the [[British East India|British]], which gave the interior more autonomy. However, conflicts among the disparate tribes of the interior, and with the Sultan of [[Muscat and Oman]] continued into the 1950s, and eventually escalated into the [[Dhofar Rebellion]] (1962). The rebellion forced the Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]] to seek the assistance of the British in quelling the uprisings from the interior. The failed assassination attempt of April 26, 1966 on Said bin Taimur led to the further isolation of the Sultan, who had moved his residence from Muscat to [[Salalah]], amidst the civilian armed conflict. On July 23, 1970, [[Qaboos bin Said]], son of the Sultan, staged a bloodless<ref>Long (2007), p.188.</ref> ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in the Salalah palace with the assistance of the British, and took over as ruler.\n[[File:WH1-Effo080a.jpg|thumb|Muscat harbor during [[World War I]]]]\nWith the assistance of the British, Qaboos bin Said put an end to the Dhofar uprising and consolidated disparate tribal territories. He renamed the country the ''[[Sultanate of Oman]]'' (called ''Muscat and Oman'' hitherto), in an attempt to end to the interior's isolation from Muscat. Qaboos enlisted the services of capable Omanis to fill positions in his new government,<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.126.</ref> drawing from such corporations as [[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO). New ministries for social services such as health and education were established. The construction of [[Mina Qaboos]], a new port conceived initially by Sa`id bin Taimur, was developed during the early days of Qaboos' rule. Similarly, a [[Muscat International Airport|new international airport]] was developed in Muscat's [[Seeb]] district. A complex of offices, warehouses, shops and homes transformed the old village of [[Ruwi]] in Muttrah into a commercial district.<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.128</ref> The first five-year development plan in 1976 emphasised infrastructural development of Muscat, which provided new opportunities for trade and tourism in the 1980s\u20131990s, attracting migrants from around the region. On June 6, 2007, [[Cyclone Gonu]] hit Muscat causing extensive damage to property, infrastructure and commercial activity.\n\nEarly photographs of the city and harbor, taken in the early 20th century by German explorer and photographer, [[Hermann Burchardt]], are now held at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref>[http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=626045&bt=europeanaapi View of the city and city walls] in 1904 (Click on photo to enlarge); [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=626041&bt=europeanaapi Muscat's wall and gate].</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[File:Muscat SPOT 1089.jpg|thumb|Muscat by SPOT Satellite]]\n[[File:Road towards Qantab, Muscat.jpg|thumb|Muscat's rugged terrain, with plutonic [[Central Hajar Mountains]] dotting the landscape]]\n\nMuscat is located in northeast Oman.

Several inter-city roads such as Nizwa Road and Al Amrat Road, intersect with Al Sultan Qaboos Road (in [[Rusail]] and [[Ruwi]], respectively). [[Muttrah]], with the Muscat Harbour, [[Corniche]], and [[Mina Qaboos]], is located in the north-eastern coastline of the city, adjacent to the Gulf of Oman. Other coastal districts of Muscat include [[Darsait]], [[Mina Al Fahal]], [[Ras Al Hamar]], [[Al Qurum]] Heights, [[Al Khuwair]], and [[Al Seeb]].

Of the ''wilayats'', Seeb, located in the western section of the governorate, was the most populous (with over 220,000 residents), while Muttrah had the highest number of expatriates (with over 100,000).<ref name=\"Oman Census 2003, p.6\"/> Approximately 71% of the population was within the 15\u201364 age group, with the average Omani age being 23 years.<ref>Oman Census(2003), Data and Other Indicators</ref> About 10% of the population is [[literacy rate|illiterate]], an improvement when compared to the 18% illiteracy rate recorded during the 1993 census. Expatriates accounted for over 60% of the [[labour force]], dominated by males, who accounted for 80% of the city's total labour. A majority of expatriates (34%) engineering-related occupations, while most Omanis worked in engineering, clerical, scientific or technical fields. The [[Royal Army of Oman|defense]] sector was the largest employer for Omanis, while construction, [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade employed the largest number of expatriates.\n\nThe ethnic makeup of Muscat has historically been influenced by people not native to the Arabian Peninsula. [[British Parliament]]ary papers dating back to the 19th century indicate the presence of a significant [[Hindu people|Hindu]] [[Gujarat]]i [[merchant]]s in the city<ref>British Parliamentary Papers (1876), p. 189.</ref> Indeed, four [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Hindu temple|temples]] existed in Muscat ca. 1760.<ref>Kechichian (1995), p. 215.</ref> [[Christianity]] flourished in Oman (B\u0113\u1e6f Maz\u016bn\u0101y\u0113 \"land of the Maganites\"; a name deriving from its Sumerian designation) from the late 4th century to early 5th century. Missionary activity by the [[Assyrian People|Assyrians]] of the [[Church of the East]] resulted in a significant Christian population living in the region, with a bishop being attested by 424 AD under the Metropolitan of Fars and Arabia. The rise of Islam saw the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Arabic-speaking Christian population eventually disappear. It is thought to have been brought back in by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1507.<ref>Fahlbusch (1999), p. 829.</ref> [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]] established a hospital in Muscat in the 19th century.\n\nLike the rest of Oman, [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] is the predominant language of the city.

Several forms of public transport are popular in Oman. Most popular are the \"Baiza\" buses, so named for the lower denomination of the [[Omani rial]], the baiza (an adaptation of the Indian lower denomination [[paisa]]). These are relatively inexpensive and service all major roadways, as well as a wide and loose network of smaller byways in the greater Muscat metropolitan area, opportunistically dropping off and picking up passengers at any location. Less popular and slightly more expensive are large public buses, coloured red and green, whose service is limited to major roadways and point-to-point travel routes between Oman's major cities and towns. Taxis, also colour-coded orange and white, provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baiza buses.\n\nBaiza buses and colour-coded orange-and-white taxis are unmetered, after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of [[negotiation]], although taxi drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. In many countries, one is advised to negotiate a fare with the driver before getting into a taxi. However, in Oman, asking for the fare beforehand often demonstrates a passenger's newness and unfamiliarity with the area. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi. Taxis will also generally take passengers to locations out of the city, including [[Sohar]], [[Buraimi]] and [[Dubai]].\n\nA rail network named [[Oman Rail]] is expected to be completed by 2022.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} This will connect Oman with the GCC countries.\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of Oman}}\n[[File:DhowMuscat.jpg|thumb|The traditional [[Dhow]], an enduring symbol of Oman<ref name=coosoo>{{cite web|title=Culture of Oman\n|url=http://www.omansultanate.com/culture.htm|publisher=Sultanate of Oman}}</ref>]]\n\nOutwardly, Oman shares many of the cultural characteristics of its Arab neighbours, particularly those in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]].<ref name=kcom/> Despite these similarities, important factors make Oman unique in the Middle East.<ref name=kcom/> These result as much from geography and history as from culture and economics.<ref name=kcom>{{cite web|last=Common|first=Richard K.|title=Barriers To Developing 'Leadership' In The Sultanate Of Oman|url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss2/3_Common_pp215-229_jm.pdf|publisher=International Journal of Leadership Studies}}</ref> The relatively recent and artificial nature of the [[state (polity)|state]] in Oman makes it difficult to describe a national culture;<ref name=kcom/> however, sufficient cultural heterogeneity exists within its national boundaries to make Oman distinct from other Arab States of the Persian Gulf.<ref name=kcom/> Oman's cultural diversity is greater than that of its Arab neighbours, given its historical expansion to the Swahili Coast and the Indian Ocean.<ref name=kcom/>\n\nOman has a long tradition of shipbuilding, as maritime travel played a major role in the Omanis' ability to stay in contact with the civilisations of the ancient world.

A regional military power in the 18th century, Muscat's influence extended as far as [[East Africa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. As an important port-town in the [[Gulf of Oman]], Muscat attracted foreign tradesmen and settlers such as the Persians and the [[Baloch people|Balochi]]s. Since the ascension of [[Qaboos bin Said]] as [[Sultan]] of Oman in 1970, Muscat has experienced rapid infrastructural development that has led to the growth of a vibrant economy and a multi-ethnic society. Muscat is termed as a [[Global City]].\n\nThe rocky [[Al Hajar Mountains|Western Al Hajar Mountains]] dominate the landscape of Muscat. The city lies on the [[Arabian Sea]] along the Gulf of Oman and is in the proximity of the strategic [[Straits of Hormuz]]. Low-lying white buildings typify most of Muscat's urban landscape, while the [[Mina Qaboos|port-district]] of [[Muttrah]], with its [[corniche]] and harbour, form the north-eastern periphery of the city. Muscat's economy is dominated by trade, petroleum, liquified natural gas and porting.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Ptolemy]]'s ''Map of Arabia'' identifies the territories of ''Cryptus Portus''<ref name=\"Foster 1844, p.231\">Forster (1844), p.231.</ref> and ''Moscha Portus''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.241.</ref> Scholars are divided in opinion on which of the two related to the city of ''Muscat''. Similarly, [[Arrian]]us references ''Omana'' and ''Moscha'' in ''Voyage of Nearchus''. Interpretations of Arrianus' work by [[William Vincent (priest)|William Vincent]] and [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]] conclude that ''Omana'' was a reference to ''Oman'', while ''Moscha'' referred to ''Muscat''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.173.</ref> Similarly, other scholars identify [[Pliny the Elder]]'s reference to ''Amithoscuta'' to be ''Muscat''.<ref name=\"Foster 1844, p.231\"/>\n\nThe origin of the word ''Muscat'' is disputed. Some authors claim that the word has [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origins &ndash; from ''moscha'', meaning an ''inflated hide'' or ''skin''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.173</ref> Other authors claim that the name ''Muscat'' means ''[[Anchorage (shipping)|anchorage]]'' or ''the place of \"letting fall the anchor\"''.<ref>Miles (1997), p.468.</ref> Other derivations include ''muscat'' from [[Old Persian]], meaning ''strong-scented'',<ref>Hailman (2006), p.49.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} or from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], meaning ''falling-place'',<ref>Philips (1966), p.4.</ref> or ''hidden''.<ref>Room (2003), p.246.</ref>\n''Cryptus Portus'' is synonymous with Oman (\"hidden land\"). But \"Ov-man\" (Omman), and the old Sumerian name ''Magan (Maa-kan)'', means sea-people in Arabic. An inhabitant is a ''Muscatter'', ''Muscatian'', ''Muscatite'' or ''Muscatan''.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Muscat, Oman}}\n[[File:Muscat harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Muscat harbour, ca. 1903.

The graves appear to be well formed and indicate the existence of burial rituals. South of Muscat, remnants of [[Harappa]]n pottery indicate some level of contact with the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].<ref>Rice (1994), p.255-256</ref> Muscat's notability as a port was acknowledged as early as the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]] by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geographer [[Ptolemy]], who referred to it as ''Cryptus Portus'' (the ''Hidden Port''), and by [[Pliny the Elder]], who called it ''Amithoscuta''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.234.</ref>\n\nThe port fell to a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] invasion in the 3rd century CE, under the rule of [[Shapur I]],<ref>Potter (2002), p.41.</ref> while conversion to Islam occurred during the 7th century. Muscat's importance as a trading port continued to grow in the centuries that followed, under the influence of the [[Azd|Azd dynasty]], a local tribe. The establishment of the First [[Imamate]] in the 9th century CE was the first step in consolidating disparate Omani tribal factions under the banner of an [[Ibadi]] state. However, tribal skirmishes continued, allowing the [[Abbasid]]s of [[Baghdad]] to conquer Oman. The Abbasids occupied the region until the 11th century, when they were driven out by the local Yahmad tribe. Power over Oman shifted from the Yahmad tribe to the [[Azd]]i Nabahinah clan, during whose rule, the people of coastal ports such as Muscat prospered from maritime trade and close alliances with the [[Indian subcontinent]], at the cost of the alienation of the people of the interior of Oman.\n[[File:Qasr Al Alam Royal Palace (4).JPG|thumb|Oman Council building in Muscat]]\nThe [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] admiral [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] sailed to Muscat in 1507, in an attempt to establish trade relations. As he approached the harbor, his ships were fired on. He then decided to conquer Muscat. Most of the city burned to the ground during and after the fighting.\n\nThe Portuguese maintained a hold on Muscat for over a century, despite challenges from [[Persia]] and a bombardment of the town by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1546.<ref>Miles (1997), p.167</ref> The Turks twice captured Muscat from the Portuguese, in the [[Capture of Muscat (1552)]] and 1581\u201388. The election of [[Nasir bin Murshid|Nasir bin Murshid Al-Ya'rubi]] as Imam of Oman in 1624 changed the balance of power again in the region, from the Persians and the Portuguese to local Omanis. On August 16, 1648 the Imam dispatched an army to Muscat, which captured and demolished the high towers of the Portuguese, weakening their grip over the town. Decisively, in 1650, a small but determined body of the Imam's troops attacked the port at night, forcing an eventual Portuguese surrender on January 23, 1650.<ref>Miles (1997), p. 196.</ref> A civil war and repeated incursions by the Persian king [[Nader Shah]] in the 18th century destabilised the region, and further strained relations between the interior and Muscat.

Muscat and [[Muttrah]] were attacked by tribes from the interior in 1895 and again in 1915.<ref>JE Peterson's Britannica entry (1990), p.6.</ref> A tentative ceasefire was brokered by the [[British East India|British]], which gave the interior more autonomy. However, conflicts among the disparate tribes of the interior, and with the Sultan of [[Muscat and Oman]] continued into the 1950s, and eventually escalated into the [[Dhofar Rebellion]] (1962). The rebellion forced the Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]] to seek the assistance of the British in quelling the uprisings from the interior. The failed assassination attempt of April 26, 1966 on Said bin Taimur led to the further isolation of the Sultan, who had moved his residence from Muscat to [[Salalah]], amidst the civilian armed conflict. On July 23, 1970, [[Qaboos bin Said]], son of the Sultan, staged a bloodless<ref>Long (2007), p.188.</ref> ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in the Salalah palace with the assistance of the British, and took over as ruler.\n[[File:WH1-Effo080a.jpg|thumb|Muscat harbor during [[World War I]]]]\nWith the assistance of the British, Qaboos bin Said put an end to the Dhofar uprising and consolidated disparate tribal territories. He renamed the country the ''[[Sultanate of Oman]]'' (called ''Muscat and Oman'' hitherto), in an attempt to end to the interior's isolation from Muscat. Qaboos enlisted the services of capable Omanis to fill positions in his new government,<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.126.</ref> drawing from such corporations as [[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO). New ministries for social services such as health and education were established. The construction of [[Mina Qaboos]], a new port conceived initially by Sa`id bin Taimur, was developed during the early days of Qaboos' rule. Similarly, a [[Muscat International Airport|new international airport]] was developed in Muscat's [[Seeb]] district. A complex of offices, warehouses, shops and homes transformed the old village of [[Ruwi]] in Muttrah into a commercial district.<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.128</ref> The first five-year development plan in 1976 emphasised infrastructural development of Muscat, which provided new opportunities for trade and tourism in the 1980s &ndash; 1990s, attracting migrants from around the region.

These include [[Museum of Omani Heritage]], [[National Museum of Oman]], [[Oman Children's Museum]], [[Bait Al Zubair]], [[Oman Oil and Gas Exhibition Centre]], [[Omani French Museum]], [[Sultan's Armed Forces Museum]] and the [[Omani Aquarium and Marine Science and Fisheries Centre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omanet.om/english/tourism/entert/museums.asp?cat=tour&subcat=entert1 |title=Museums |publisher=Omanet.om |access-date=January 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201084319/http://www.omanet.om/english/tourism/entert/museums.asp?cat=tour&subcat=entert1 |archive-date=February 1, 2009 }}</ref> The [[Bait Al Falaj Fort]] played an important role in Muscat's military history.\n\nRecent projects include an [[Royal Opera House Muscat|opera house]] which opened on October 14, 2011.\nOne of the most notable new projects is the Oman National Museum. It is expected to be an architectural jewel along with the [[Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque]]. Visitors are also encouraged{{who|date=April 2019}} to visit [[Old Muscat]] and the Old Palace. The main shopping district is situated in [[Al Qurum]] Commercial Area. However, shopping malls are spread out throughout the city. One of the largest malls in Oman is [[Oman Avenues Mall]], located in [[Ghubra]]. The second largest mall is in [[Seeb]], near the international airport, called [[City Centre Muscat]], housing all major international brands and the largest [[Carrefour]] hypermarket. Two new megamalls opened recently{{when|date=April 2019}} in the Mabela area of Muscat are [[Al Araimi Boulevard]] and [[Mall of Muscat]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Mall of Muscat is also home to [[Oman Aquarium]] and a snow park which will be opened in late 2019.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n   \nThe main [[airport]] is [[Muscat International Airport]] around {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} from the city's business district of Ruwi and 15 to 20&nbsp;km from the main residential localities of Al-Khuwair, Madinat Al Sultan Qaboos, Shati Al-Qurm and Al-Qurm. Muscat is the headquarters for the local [[Oman Air]], which flies to several destinations within the [[Middle East]], the Indian Subcontinent, East Africa and Europe. Other airlines such as [[Qatar Airways]], [[Turkish Airlines]], [[KLM]], [[SriLankan Airlines|SriLankan]], [[Royal Jordanian]], [[British Airways]], [[Pakistan International Airlines|PIA]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Swiss International Air Lines]], [[Kuwait Airways]], [[Air India]] and [[Thai Airways]] also fly through Muscat International Airport.\n[[File:New terminal under construction at Muscat Airport.jpg|left|thumb|[[Muscat International Airport]]]]\n\nThe Muscat area is well serviced by paved roads and [[dual-carriageway]] connects most major cities and towns in the country. \n[[File:Oman-Muscat-Muttrah-21-Marina.JPG|thumb|Mutrah]]\nSince November 2015, Public transportation in Muscat has been revamped with a bus network connecting most important parts of the city with a fleet of modern Mwasalat (earlier Oman National Transport Company (ONTC) buses. \nMwasalat buses procured from VDL of The Netherlands and MAN  of Germany have several hi-tech features, including free Wi-Fi. \n'''Route 1''' (Ruwi-Mabela) serves people travelling major shopping destinations (Oman Avenues Mall, Muscat Grand Mall, Qurum City Centre, Muscat City Centre, Markaz al Bhaja) and Muscat Airport. \n'''Route 2''' (Ruwi-Wadi Kabir) serves the residential and industrial district of [[Wadi Kabir]]. \n'''Route 3''' (Ruwi-Wadi Adei) serves the downmarket residential belt of Wadi Adei. \n'''Route 4''' (Ruwi-Mattrah) serves the tourist destination of Muttrah Corniche, Al Alam Palace, Muttrah Fort, National Museum and Port Sultan Qaboos and churches/temples. \n'''Route 5''' (Ruwi-Amerat) serves the rapidly developing Amerat suburb. \n'''Route 6''' (Ruwi-SQU&KOM) serves the student community of Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) and the office commuters of Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM).\n'''Route 7''' serves the three major malls in Muscat - Al Araimi Boulevard, Mall of Muscat and Markaz al Bhaja and Muscat City Centre. \n'''Route 8''' serves Al Khuwair and Al Mouj Integrated Complex\n'''Route 9''' serves Ansab and Misfah industrial area.\n'''Route 10''' serves Seeb Souq and Mawelah Vegetable Market.\n'''Route 12''' serves Oman Convention and Exhibition, Ghala areas.\n'''Route 14''' serves PDO, Qurm Natural Park, Qurm City Centre, Khoula Hospital.\n'''Routes 1b and 1A''' are special buses to Muscat International Airport.\n\nThere is no rail or metro network in the country. Several forms of public transport are popular in Oman. Most popular are the \"Baiza\" buses, so named for the lower denomination of the [[Omani rial]], the baiza (an adaptation of the Indian lower denomination [[paisa]]). These are relatively inexpensive and service all major roadways, as well as a wide and loose network of smaller byways in the greater Muscat metropolitan area, opportunistically dropping off and picking up passengers at any location. Less popular and slightly more expensive are large public buses, coloured red and green, whose service is limited to major roadways and point-to-point travel routes between Oman's major cities and towns. Taxis, also colour-coded orange and white, provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baiza buses.\n\nBaiza buses and colour-coded orange-and-white taxis are unmetered, after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of [[negotiation]], although taxi drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. In many countries, one is advised to negotiate a fare with the driver before getting into a taxi. However, in Oman, asking for the fare beforehand often demonstrates a passenger's newness and unfamiliarity with the area. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi. Taxis will also generally take passengers to locations out of the city, including [[Sohar]], [[Buraimi]] and [[Dubai]].\n\nA rail network named [[Oman Rail]] is expected to be completed by 2022.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} This will connect Oman with the GCC countries.\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of Oman}}\n[[File:DhowMuscat.jpg|thumb|The traditional [[Dhow]], an enduring symbol of Oman<ref name=coosoo>{{cite web|title=Culture of Oman\n|url=http://www.omansultanate.com/culture.htm|publisher=Sultanate of Oman}}</ref>]]\n\nOutwardly, Oman shares many of the cultural characteristics of its Arab neighbours, particularly those in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]].<ref name=kcom/> Despite these similarities, important factors make Oman unique in the Middle East.<ref name=kcom/> These result as much from geography and history as from culture and economics.<ref name=kcom>{{cite web|last=Common|first=Richard K.|title=Barriers To Developing 'Leadership' In The Sultanate Of Oman|url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss2/3_Common_pp215-229_jm.pdf|publisher=International Journal of Leadership Studies}}</ref> The relatively recent and artificial nature of the [[state (polity)|state]] in Oman makes it difficult to describe a national culture;<ref name=kcom/> however, sufficient cultural heterogeneity exists within its national boundaries to make Oman distinct from other Arab States of the Persian Gulf.<ref name=kcom/> Oman's cultural diversity is greater than that of its Arab neighbours, given its historical expansion to the Swahili Coast and the Indian Ocean.<ref name=kcom/>\n\nOman has a long tradition of shipbuilding, as maritime travel played a major role in the Omanis' ability to stay in contact with the civilisations of the ancient world.

Other related languages include [[Ingush language|Ingush]], which has speakers in the neighbouring [[Ingushetia]], and [[Bats language|Batsbi]], which is the language of the people in the adjoining part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. At various times in their history, Chechens used [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets; as of 2008, the official script is Russian [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].\n\nMost Chechens living in their homeland can understand Ingush with ease. The two languages are not truly mutually intelligible, but it is easy for Chechens to learn how to understand the Ingush language and vice-versa over time after hearing it for a while.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn 1989, 73.4% spoke Russian,<ref>Mikhailov, Valentin. ''Chechnya and Tatarstan''</ref> though this figure has declined due to the wars for a large number of reasons (including the lack of proper education, the refusal to learn the language, and the mass dispersal of the Chechen diaspora due to the war). Chechens in [[Chechen diaspora|the diaspora]] often speak the language of the country they live in (English, French, German, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Polish, [[Georgian language|Georgian]], etc.).\n\n==Origin hypotheses==\n{{main|Vainakh origin hypotheses}}\n{{see also|History of Chechnya#Theories on origins}}\nChechens are a [[Nakh peoples|Nakh people]], and discussion of their origins is intertwined with the discussion of the mysterious origins of Nakh peoples as a whole. The only two surviving (and fairly numerous) Nakh peoples are Chechens and [[Ingush people|Ingush]], but they are thought by some scholars to be the remnants of what was once a larger family of peoples.\n\nThe Nakh languages are a subgroup of [[Northeast Caucasian]], and as such are related to Nakho-Dagestanian family, including the languages of the [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]], [[Dargins]], [[Lezghins]], [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Laks]], etc.\nHowever, this relationship is not a close one: the Nakho-Dagestani family is of comparable or greater time-depth than [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], meaning Chechens are only as linguistically related to Avars or Dargins as the [[French people|French]] are to the Russians or [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nNakh peoples such as Chechens are thought to either be descended from original settlers of the Caucasus (North and/or South)<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |author=Bernice Wuethrich |date=19 May 2000 |title=Peering Into the Past, With Words |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=288 |issue=5469 |pages=1158 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5469/1158.full |doi=10.1126/science.288.5469.1158}}</ref><ref name=berkeley>{{cite web |url=http://ingush.berkeley.edu:7012/ingush_people.html |title=The Ingush (with notes on the Chechen): Background information |accessdate=2007-02-10 |author=Johanna Nichols |date=February 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311090332/http://ingush.berkeley.edu:7012/ingush_people.html |archivedate=March 11, 2008|work=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|author-link=Johanna Nichols }}</ref> or supposedly Nakh-speaking ethnic minorities in the north-eastern regions of the ancient state of [[Urartu]] (whose people also spoke a language that was possibly related to the Nakh languages).<ref name=\"Jaimoukha.

Chechen women.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Chechen women]]\n\nChechens are accustomed to democratic ways, their social structure being firmly based on equality, pluralism and deference to individuality. Chechen society is structured around ''tukkhum'' (unions of [[clan]]s) and about 130 ''[[teip]]'', or clans. The teips are based more on land and one-side lineage than on blood (as [[exogamy]] is prevalent and encouraged), and are bonded together to form the Chechen nation. Teips are further subdivided into ''gar'' (branches), and gars into ''nekye'' ([[patronymic]] families). The Chechen social code is called ''nokhchallah'' (where ''Nokhchuo'' stands for \"Chechen\") and may be loosely translated as \"Chechen character\". The Chechen [[code of honor]] implies moral and ethical behaviour, generosity and the will to safeguard the honor of women. The traditional Chechen saying goes that the members of Chechen society, like its teips, are (ideally) \"free and equal like wolves\".<ref>Jaimoukha. ''Chechens''. Page 83</ref><ref>Gammer, Moshe. ''The Lone Wolf and the Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance of Russian Rule''. London 2006. Page 4</ref>\n\n[[File:Chechense. Match. a wedding match. George Kennan. 1870-1886.jpg|thumb|upright|Five Chechen men dressed in the [[chokha]] male dress of the Caucasus, late 19th century]]\n\nChechens today have a strong sense of nation, which is enforced by the old clan network and ''nokhchalla'' \u2013 the obligation to clan, tukhum, etc. This is often combined with old values transmuted into a modern sense. They are mythically descended from the epic hero, Turpalo-Nokhchuo (\"Chechen Hero\"). There is a strong theme of representing the nation with its [[national animal]], the wolf. Due to their strong dependence on the land, its farms and its forests (and indeed, the national equation with the wolf), Chechens have a strong sense of affection for nature. According to Chechen philosopher [[Apty Bisultanov]], ruining an ant-hill or hunting Caucasian goats during their mating season was considered extremely sinful.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chechen.8m.com/history/bisult_brnfree.html |title=Chechen Republic \u2013 History \u2013 Born to be free |website=Chechen.8m.com |accessdate=2013-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518002148/http://chechen.8m.com/history/bisult_brnfree.html |archivedate=2013-05-18 }}</ref> It is notable that the [[glasnost]] era Chechen independence movement, ''Bart'' (unity) in fact originated as a simple environmentalist organization in the republic's capital of Grozny.<ref>Wood, Tony.

This asserts itself in a number of ways. A large majority of the nation's [[Folk hero|national heroes]] fought for independence (or otherwise, like the legendary Zelimkhan, robbed from the nation deemed the oppressor in order to feed Chechen children in a [[Robin Hood]]-like fashion). A common greeting in the Chechen language, ''marsha oylla'', is literally translated as \"enter in freedom\". The word for freedom also encompasses notions of peace and prosperity.\n\n[[File:Vainakhish Phandar.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[phandar]], a traditional Chechen musical instrument]]\n\nChechens are sometimes referred to as the \"French of the Caucasus\", for a number of reasons (it is notable that the Circassians are the \"English of the Caucasus\", and the Georgians are the \"Italians of the Caucasus\"). This comparison may refer to either political/historical traits, or to personality characteristics. Like the French, who overthrew their age-old monarchy in the [[French Revolution]], the Chechens had [[History of Chechnya#Ichkeria|a similar revolution a century or two earlier]],<ref>Jaimoukha, Amjad. \u2018\u2019The Chechens: A Handbook\u2019\u2019. Page 14</ref> and like the French, they bore the distinction (for a period) of being the only egalitarian society in an area full of monarchic states. Like the French, the Chechens preferred swift, revolutionary (and often violent) methods to realize the change they wished to see \u2013 unlike the Circassians (called the \"English of the Caucasus\" both for their political and personality characteristics) who preferred more gradualist methods.<ref>Manning, Paul. ''[http://www.circassianworld.com/pdf/Paul_Manning.pdf Just Like England: On the Liberal Institutions of the Circassians]'' Circassianworld.com</ref> Chechens were also called \"French\" by early Russian military officers and the French anthropologist [[Ernest Chantre]] who noted their \"happy and witty\" nature.<ref>Carlotta Gall and Thomas de Wall.

Other related languages include [[Ingush language|Ingush]], which has speakers in the neighbouring [[Ingushetia]], and [[Bats language|Batsbi]], which is the language of the people in the adjoining part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. At various times in their history, Chechens used [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets; as of 2008, the official script is Russian [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].\n\nMost Chechens living in their homeland can understand Ingush with ease. The two languages are not truly mutually intelligible, but it is easy for Chechens to learn how to understand the Ingush language and vice-versa over time after hearing it for a while.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn 1989, 73.4% spoke Russian,<ref>Mikhailov, Valentin. ''Chechnya and Tatarstan''</ref> though this figure has declined due to the wars for a large number of reasons (including the lack of proper education, the refusal to learn the language, and the mass dispersal of the Chechen diaspora due to the war). Chechens in [[Chechen diaspora|the diaspora]] often speak the language of the country they live in (English, French, German, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Polish, [[Georgian language|Georgian]], etc.).\n\n==Origin hypotheses==\n{{main|Vainakh origin hypotheses}}\n{{see also|History of Chechnya#Theories on origins}}\nChechens are a [[Nakh peoples|Nakh people]], and discussion of their origins is intertwined with the discussion of the mysterious origins of Nakh peoples as a whole. The only two surviving (and fairly numerous) Nakh peoples are Chechens and [[Ingush people|Ingush]], but they are thought by some scholars to be the remnants of what was once a larger family of peoples.\n\nThe Nakh languages are a subgroup of [[Northeast Caucasian]], and as such are related to Nakho-Dagestanian family, including the languages of the [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]], [[Dargins]], [[Lezghins]], [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Laks]], etc.\nHowever, this relationship is not a close one: the Nakho-Dagestani family is of comparable or greater time-depth than [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], meaning Chechens are only as linguistically related to Avars or Dargins as the [[French people|French]] are to the Russians or [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nNakh peoples such as Chechens are thought to either be descended from original settlers of the Caucasus (North and/or South)<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |author=Bernice Wuethrich |date=19 May 2000 |title=Peering Into the Past, With Words |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=288 |issue=5469 |pages=1158 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5469/1158.full |doi=10.1126/science.288.5469.1158}}</ref><ref name=berkeley>{{cite web |url=http://ingush.berkeley.edu:7012/ingush_people.html |title=The Ingush (with notes on the Chechen): Background information |accessdate=2007-02-10 |author=Johanna Nichols |date=February 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311090332/http://ingush.berkeley.edu:7012/ingush_people.html |archivedate=March 11, 2008|work=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|author-link=Johanna Nichols }}</ref> or supposedly Nakh-speaking ethnic minorities in the north-eastern regions of the ancient state of [[Urartu]] (whose people also spoke a language that was possibly related to the Nakh languages).<ref name=\"Jaimoukha.

Other groups linked Amjad Jaimoukha traces the name Durdzuk to an ancient city north of [[Lake Urmia]], near Nakhichevan (Nakhichevan is thought to be a Nakh placename by some). Other groups attributed to being the ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush include the ''Kists'' (in the Georgian chronicles), ''[[Gargareans]]'' (from the Nakh root ''gergara''; reported by [[Strabo]] to have \"returned\" from the South Caucasus to the North Caucasus, fleeing the wars in the south) and the ''Nakhchmateans'' (Armenian chronicles).\n\n==Genetics==\n{{see|Genetic history of the Caucasus}}\n\nGenetic tests on Chechens, have shown roots mostly in the Caucasus as well as slight connections to and influences from the Middle East as well as Europe.<ref name=\"Nasidze2004\">I.

They partook in numerous rites and rituals, many of them pertaining to farming; these included rain rites, a celebration that occurred on the first day of plowing, as well as the Day of the Thunderer Sela and the Day of the Goddess Tusholi.

Chechen women.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Chechen women]]\n\nChechens are accustomed to democratic ways, their social structure being firmly based on equality, pluralism and deference to individuality. Chechen society is structured around ''tukkhum'' (unions of [[clan]]s) and about 130 ''[[teip]]'', or clans. The teips are based more on land and one-side lineage than on blood (as [[exogamy]] is prevalent and encouraged), and are bonded together to form the Chechen nation. Teips are further subdivided into ''gar'' (branches), and gars into ''nekye'' ([[patronymic]] families). The Chechen social code is called ''nokhchallah'' (where ''Nokhchuo'' stands for \"Chechen\") and may be loosely translated as \"Chechen character\". The Chechen [[code of honor]] implies moral and ethical behaviour, generosity and the will to safeguard the honor of women. The traditional Chechen saying goes that the members of Chechen society, like its teips, are (ideally) \"free and equal like wolves\".<ref>Jaimoukha. ''Chechens''. Page 83</ref><ref>Gammer, Moshe.

This asserts itself in a number of ways. A large majority of the nation's [[Folk hero|national heroes]] fought for independence (or otherwise, like the legendary Zelimkhan, robbed from the nation deemed the oppressor in order to feed Chechen children in a [[Robin Hood]]-like fashion). A common greeting in the Chechen language, ''marsha oylla'', is literally translated as \"enter in freedom\". The word for freedom also encompasses notions of peace and prosperity.\n\n[[File:Vainakhish Phandar.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[phandar]], a traditional Chechen musical instrument]]\n\nChechens are sometimes referred to as the \"French of the Caucasus\", for a number of reasons (it is notable that the Circassians are the \"English of the Caucasus\", and the Georgians are the \"Italians of the Caucasus\"). This comparison may refer to either political/historical traits, or to personality characteristics. Like the French, who overthrew their age-old monarchy in the [[French Revolution]], the Chechens had [[History of Chechnya#Ichkeria|a similar revolution a century or two earlier]],<ref>Jaimoukha, Amjad. \u2018\u2019The Chechens: A Handbook\u2019\u2019. Page 14</ref> and like the French, they bore the distinction (for a period) of being the only egalitarian society in an area full of monarchic states. Like the French, the Chechens preferred swift, revolutionary (and often violent) methods to realize the change they wished to see \u2013 unlike the Circassians (called the \"English of the Caucasus\" both for their political and personality characteristics) who preferred more gradualist methods.<ref>Manning, Paul. ''[http://www.circassianworld.com/pdf/Paul_Manning.pdf Just Like England: On the Liberal Institutions of the Circassians]'' Circassianworld.com</ref> Chechens were also called \"French\" by early Russian military officers and the French anthropologist [[Ernest Chantre]] who noted their \"happy and witty\" nature.<ref>Carlotta Gall and Thomas de Wall.

P. Lovecraft]] to [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' drawing on European folklore of the [[undead]]. [[Victor Halperin]] directed ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (1932), a horror film starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. Here zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician. Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s, with films including ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943) and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959).\n\nA new version of the zombie, inspired by, but distinct from, that described in Haitian folklore, emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the 20th century. This interpretation of the zombie is drawn largely from [[George A.

The \"[[zombie apocalypse]]\" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has since become a staple of modern popular art. After [[zombie film]]s such as ''Dawn of the Dead'' (1978) and [[Michael Jackson]]'s music video ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]'' (1983), the genre waned for some years.\n\nIn the Far East during the late 1990s, the Japanese zombie video games ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[The House of the Dead]]'' led to a resurgence of zombies in popular culture. Additionally, ''The House of the Dead'' introduced a new type of zombie distinct from Romero's slow zombies: the fast-running zombie. These games were followed by a wave of low-budget Asian [[zombie film]]s such as the [[zombie comedy]] ''[[Bio Zombie]]'' (1998) and action film ''[[Versus (2000 film)|Versus]]'' (2000), and then a new wave of Western zombie films in the early 2000s, including films featuring fast-running zombies such as ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (2002), the ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[The House of the Dead|House of the Dead]]'' films, and the 2004 [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|''Dawn of the Dead'' remake]], while the British film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004) was in the zombie comedy subgenre.\n\nThe late 2000s and 2010s saw the humanization and [[:Category:Human-zombie romance in fiction|romanticization of the zombie archetype, with the zombies increasingly portrayed as friends and love interests for humans]].

The film ''Night of the Living Dead'' made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as \"zombies\", describing them instead as \"[[ghoul]]s\" (though ghouls, which derive from Arabic folklore, are demons, not undead). Although George Romero used the term \"ghoul\" in his original scripts, in later interviews he used the term \"zombie\". The word \"zombie\" is used exclusively by Romero in his script for his sequel ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978),<ref>George A. Romero, [http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dawnofthedead.txt ''Dawn of the Dead''] (Working draft 1977), horrorlair.com.</ref> including once in dialog. According to George Romero, film critics were influential in associating the term \"zombie\" to his creatures, and especially the French magazine {{lang|fr|[[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]}}. He eventually accepted this linkage, even though he remained convinced at the time that \"zombies\" corresponded to the undead slaves of Haitian voodoo as depicted in ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' with [[Bela Lugosi]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=o0CFFRkLqrg|title=J'irai loler sur vos tombes \u2013 Romero|time=11m15s<!--|date=2011-09-23-->}}.</ref>\n\n==Folk beliefs==\n===Haitian tradition===\n[[File:Zombie haiti ill artlibre jnl.png|thumb|right|A depiction of a zombie, at twilight, in a field of sugar cane]]\nZombies are featured widely in Haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of [[necromancy]] of a ''[[bokor]]'', a sorcerer or witch. The ''bokor'' is opposed by the ''[[houngan]]'' (priest) and the ''[[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]]'' (priestess) of the formal [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo religion]]. A zombie remains under the control of the ''bokor'' as a personal slave, having no will of its own.\n\nThe Haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie, the \"zombie [[Astral body|astral]]\", which is a part of the human [[soul]]. A ''bokor'' can capture a zombie astral to enhance his spiritual power. A zombie astral can also be sealed inside a specially decorated bottle by a ''bokor'' and sold to a client to bring luck, healing, or business success. It is believed that God eventually will reclaim the zombie's soul, so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity.<ref name = Bottle>McAlister, Elizabeth. \"[http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=div2facpubs A Sorcerer's Bottle: The Visual Art of Magic in Haiti\"].

Each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul (the flesh or the spirit).<ref>Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon & Schuster, p. 186.</ref>\n\nThe zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans and their subsequent experiences in the New World. It was thought that the voodoo deity [[Baron Samedi]] would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa (\"[[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]\"), unless they had offended him in some way, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie. A zombie could also be saved by [[Salt#In religion|feeding them salt]]. English professor [[Amy Wilentz]] has written that the modern concept of Zombies was strongly influenced by [[slavery in Haiti|Haitian slavery]]. Slave drivers on the plantations, who were usually slaves themselves and sometimes voodoo priests, used the fear of zombification to discourage slaves from committing suicide.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilentz |first=Amy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/opinion/a-zombie-is-a-slave-forever.html |title=A Zombie Is a Slave Forever |location=Haiti |work=The New York Times |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wilentz |first=Amy |url=https://amywilentz.com/from-the-newsstands/response-to-i-walked-with-a-zombie/ |title=Response to \"I Walked with a Zombie\" |work=amywilentz.com |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile most scholars have associated the Haitian zombie with African cultures, a connection has also been suggested to the island's indigenous [[Ta\u00edno|Ta\u00edno people]], partly based on an early account of native [[Shamanism|shamanist]] practices written by the Hieronymite monk [[Ram\u00f3n Pan\u00e9]], a companion of [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/panerelacion.html |title=The Relacion of Fray Ramon Pane}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Whitehead |first=Neal L. |title=Of Cannibals and Kings: Primal Anthropology in the Americas |date=2011 |publisher=Penn State Press |pages=39\u201341}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmonds |first1=Ennis B. |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Michelle A. |title=Caribbean Religious History: An Introduction |date=2010 |publisher=NYU Press |page=111}}</ref>\n\nThe Haitian zombie phenomenon first attracted widespread international attention during the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] (1915\u20131934), when a number of [[medical history|case histories]] of purported \"zombies\" began to emerge.

The first, {{lang-fr|coup de poudre}} (\"powder strike\"), includes [[tetrodotoxin]] (TTX), a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] (family Tetraodontidae). The second powder consists of [[Deliriant|deliriant drugs]] such as [[datura]]. Together these powders were said to induce a deathlike state, in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor. Davis also popularized the story of [[Clairvius Narcisse]], who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice. The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders is part of a recently buried child's brain.<ref>Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon & Schuster, pp. 92\u201395.</ref><ref>Davis, Wade (1988), ''Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie'', [[University of North Carolina Press]], pp. 115\u2013116.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/zombies_and_tetrodotoxin/ |author=Terence Hines |title=Zombies and Tetrodotoxin; Follow-up |publisher=Skeptical Inquirer (csicop.org) |volume=32 |issue=3 |date=2008 |accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref>{{verify-inline|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike [[suspended animation]], followed by re-awakening&nbsp;\u2014 typically ''after'' being buried&nbsp;\u2014 into a psychotic state.

In contrast to Romero's classic slow zombies, \"fast zombies\" can run, are more aggressive, and often more intelligent. This type of zombie has origins in 1990s [[Japanese horror]] video games. In 1996, [[Capcom]]'s [[survival horror]] video game ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' featured zombie dogs that run towards the player. Later the same year, [[Sega]]'s [[Arcade game|arcade]] shooter ''[[The House of the Dead (video game)|The House of the Dead]]'' introduced running human zombies, who run towards the player. The running human zombies introduced in ''[[The House of the Dead]]'' video games became the basis for the \"fast zombies\" that became popular in zombie films during the early 21st century, starting with ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (2002), the ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[The House of the Dead|House of the Dead]]'' films, and the 2004 [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|''Dawn of the Dead'' remake]].<ref name=josh/>\n\n[[File:Tor Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tor Johnson]] as a zombie with his victim in the cult movie ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959)]]\n\n==Modern fiction==\n===In film and television===\n{{see also|Zombie film}}\nFilms featuring zombies have been a part of cinema since the 1930s, with ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (directed by [[Victor Halperin]] in 1932) being one of the earliest examples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.best-horror-movies.com/review?name=white-zombie-1932-review |title=White Zombie (1932) Review |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912172727/http://www.best-horror-movies.com/review?name=white-zombie-1932-review |archivedate=12 September 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> With [[George A.

Possible causes for zombie behavior in a modern population can be attributed to viruses, bacteria or other phenomena that reduce the mental capacity of humans, causing them to behave in a very primitive and destructive fashion. <!--\"Pre-industrial\" is correct. \"Post-industrial\" is something completely different; see [[Post-industrial society]].-->\n\n====Subtext====\nThe usual subtext of the zombie apocalypse is that civilization is inherently vulnerable to the unexpected, and that [[Misanthropy|most individuals, if desperate enough, cannot be relied on to comply with the author's ethos]].

[[Victor Halperin]] directed ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (1932), a horror film starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. Here zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician. Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s, with films including ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943) and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959).\n\nA new version of the zombie, inspired by, but distinct from, that described in Haitian folklore, emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the 20th century.

The \"[[zombie apocalypse]]\" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, has since become a staple of modern popular art. After [[zombie film]]s such as ''Dawn of the Dead'' (1978) and [[Michael Jackson]]'s music video ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]'' (1983), the genre waned for some years.\n\nIn the Far East during the late 1990s, the Japanese zombie video games ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[The House of the Dead]]'' led to a resurgence of zombies in popular culture. Additionally, ''The House of the Dead'' introduced a new type of zombie distinct from Romero's slow zombies: the fast-running zombie. These games were followed by a wave of low-budget Asian [[zombie film]]s such as the [[zombie comedy]] ''[[Bio Zombie]]'' (1998) and action film ''[[Versus (2000 film)|Versus]]'' (2000), and then a new wave of Western zombie films in the early 2000s, including films featuring fast-running zombies such as ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (2002), the ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[The House of the Dead|House of the Dead]]'' films, and the 2004 [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|''Dawn of the Dead'' remake]], while the British film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004) was in the zombie comedy subgenre.\n\nThe late 2000s and 2010s saw the humanization and [[:Category:Human-zombie romance in fiction|romanticization of the zombie archetype, with the zombies increasingly portrayed as friends and love interests for humans]].

The film ''Night of the Living Dead'' made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as \"zombies\", describing them instead as \"[[ghoul]]s\" (though ghouls, which derive from Arabic folklore, are demons, not undead). Although George Romero used the term \"ghoul\" in his original scripts, in later interviews he used the term \"zombie\". The word \"zombie\" is used exclusively by Romero in his script for his sequel ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978),<ref>George A. Romero, [http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dawnofthedead.txt ''Dawn of the Dead''] (Working draft 1977), horrorlair.com.</ref> including once in dialog. According to George Romero, film critics were influential in associating the term \"zombie\" to his creatures, and especially the French magazine {{lang|fr|[[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]}}. He eventually accepted this linkage, even though he remained convinced at the time that \"zombies\" corresponded to the undead slaves of Haitian voodoo as depicted in ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' with [[Bela Lugosi]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=o0CFFRkLqrg|title=J'irai loler sur vos tombes \u2013 Romero|time=11m15s<!--|date=2011-09-23-->}}.</ref>\n\n==Folk beliefs==\n===Haitian tradition===\n[[File:Zombie haiti ill artlibre jnl.png|thumb|right|A depiction of a zombie, at twilight, in a field of sugar cane]]\nZombies are featured widely in Haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of [[necromancy]] of a ''[[bokor]]'', a sorcerer or witch. The ''bokor'' is opposed by the ''[[houngan]]'' (priest) and the ''[[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]]'' (priestess) of the formal [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo religion]]. A zombie remains under the control of the ''bokor'' as a personal slave, having no will of its own.\n\nThe Haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie, the \"zombie [[Astral body|astral]]\", which is a part of the human [[soul]]. A ''bokor'' can capture a zombie astral to enhance his spiritual power. A zombie astral can also be sealed inside a specially decorated bottle by a ''bokor'' and sold to a client to bring luck, healing, or business success. It is believed that God eventually will reclaim the zombie's soul, so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity.<ref name = Bottle>McAlister, Elizabeth. \"[http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=div2facpubs A Sorcerer's Bottle: The Visual Art of Magic in Haiti\"].

Each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul (the flesh or the spirit).<ref>Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon & Schuster, p. 186.</ref>\n\nThe zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans and their subsequent experiences in the New World. It was thought that the voodoo deity [[Baron Samedi]] would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa (\"[[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]\"), unless they had offended him in some way, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie.

The first, {{lang-fr|coup de poudre}} (\"powder strike\"), includes [[tetrodotoxin]] (TTX), a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] (family Tetraodontidae). The second powder consists of [[Deliriant|deliriant drugs]] such as [[datura]]. Together these powders were said to induce a deathlike state, in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor. Davis also popularized the story of [[Clairvius Narcisse]], who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice. The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders is part of a recently buried child's brain.<ref>Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon & Schuster, pp. 92\u201395.</ref><ref>Davis, Wade (1988), ''Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie'', [[University of North Carolina Press]], pp. 115\u2013116.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/zombies_and_tetrodotoxin/ |author=Terence Hines |title=Zombies and Tetrodotoxin; Follow-up |publisher=Skeptical Inquirer (csicop.org) |volume=32 |issue=3 |date=2008 |accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref>{{verify-inline|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike [[suspended animation]], followed by re-awakening&nbsp;\u2014 typically ''after'' being buried&nbsp;\u2014 into a psychotic state. The psychosis induced by the drug and [[psychological trauma]] was [[hypothesis]]ed by Davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie, since they \"knew\" that they were dead and had no other role to play in the Haitian society. Societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by Davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state, and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards, exhibiting attitudes of low affect.\n\nDavis's claim has been criticized, particularly the suggestion that Haitian witch doctors can keep \"zombies\" in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = W. | year = 1988 | title = Voodoo Science | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 240 | issue = 4850| pages = 274\u2013277 | doi=10.1126/science.3353722| pmid = 3353722 | bibcode = 1988Sci...240..274B }}</ref> Symptoms of [[Tetrodotoxin poisoning|TTX poisoning]] range from numbness and nausea to paralysis&nbsp;\u2014 particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm&nbsp;\u2014 unconsciousness, and death, but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance.

Victims of zombies may become zombies themselves. This causes the outbreak to become an exponentially growing crisis: the spreading phenomenon swamps normal military and law-enforcement organizations, leading to the panicked collapse of civilized society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain, scavenging for food and supplies in a world reduced to a pre-industrial hostile wilderness. Possible causes for zombie behavior in a modern population can be attributed to viruses, bacteria or other phenomena that reduce the mental capacity of humans, causing them to behave in a very primitive and destructive fashion. <!--\"Pre-industrial\" is correct. \"Post-industrial\" is something completely different; see [[Post-industrial society]].-->\n\n====Subtext====\nThe usual subtext of the zombie apocalypse is that civilization is inherently vulnerable to the unexpected, and that [[Misanthropy|most individuals, if desperate enough, cannot be relied on to comply with the author's ethos]].

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

MacArthur is very open about opposing same-sex marriage, against female pastors, and the social justice movement.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ix_eHfGYuA</ref> He has delivered multiple sermons where he discusses these issues.<ref name=\"gty.org\" />\n\nIn 2012, at The Shepherd's Conference, MacArthur was participating in a word association questionnaire where the moderator gave him the name \"[[Steven Furtick]].\" MacArthur proceeded to argue that Furtick, pastor of [[Elevation Church]], was \"unqualified\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buttel |first1=Cameron |title=Unqualified, Not Unworthy |url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B160509/unqualified-not-unworthy |website=Grace To You |accessdate=25 November 2019 |date=9 May 2016}}</ref> Furtick responded to this comment in his 2016 book ''Unqualified: How God Uses Broken People to Do Big Things''. \n\nIn 2013, after the time of closing for the Annual Conference 'For His sake,' and hosted by pastor Miguel Nunez in the Dominican Republic, pastor MacArthur was asked by one of the attendants, What happens if a christian committed suicide? Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Beth Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Beth Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

This movie is based on ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) by [[Roman Polanski]], with the basic premise being similar to the original, despite changes in the representation of characters and some key plot points.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lsquoManorama-Six-Feet-Underrsquo-on-Rosebowl/article15375965.ece|title= \u2018Manorama Six Feet Under\u2019 on Rosebowl |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> In a cinema-noir style, the makers of ''Manorama Six Feet Under'' acknowledge the inspiration from the original by playing the sequence where [[Jack Nicholson]]'s character gets his nose slashed on the main character's (Satyaveer) television.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/mamta-d/dial-n-for-noir_b_7007042.html|title= Dial N for Noir |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film opens with a narrative about a nondescript town called Lakhot in Rajasthan, India. The narrator is Satyaveer Singh Randhawa ([[Abhay Deol]]), a down-on-his-luck public works engineer. He compares Lakhot \u2013 dry, desolate and despondent \u2013 to the general downturn in his own life. As he returns to his irritable and nagging wife Nimmi and their young son, we learn that Satyaveer has just been implicated in a small bribery scandal at work. Nimmi ([[Gul Panag]]) broods over how she wishes she had married a richer fellow. Satyaveer, an aspiring writer whose only novel Manorama sank without a trace, laments about how he had once wished to be famous but is now resigned to a banal and unremarkable existence.\n\nThey have an unusual visitor that night. A well dressed, affluent woman presents herself as Mrs. P. P. Rathore, the wife of the Irrigation Minister (and former Maharaja, presumably prior to Independence) P. P. Rathore ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]). She says she is a big fan of Satyaveer's novel. Captivated by the ingenuity of the detective Raghu, the principal character of the novel, she hopes to secure Satyaveer's assistance in applying the same ingenuity to procure photographic evidence of her husband's affair. She pays him an advance and leaves.\nSatyaveer accepts the job in spite of Nimmi's reproach. He stealthily stakes out Rathore's manor. He spots another woman visiting Rathore. Rathore rebukes the woman and turns her away. Satyaveer snaps a few pictures of this exchange and hands over the roll to Mrs. Rathore. He also confides in his brother-in-law and best friend, the loutish but generally well-meaning local cop Brij Mohan ([[Vinay Pathak]]). Brij finds this all very fishy and advises Satyaveer to take Nimmi on a short vacation.\nStrange events happen to Satyaveer. He finds out that the woman who hired him is not Mrs. Rathore; the real Mrs. Rathore is an invalid. Late one evening, as Satyaveer returns home after drinks with Brij, he spots the same woman running for her life from people who are out to kill her. She earnestly urges him to remember her real name, Manorama ([[Sarika]]), and that she is 32 years old. The next day's papers report that Manorama committed suicide in connection with her protests against a canal being built through Lakhot. The canal project is sponsored by Rathore.\n\nHe decides to investigate further. He finds out that Manorama was connected with a local children's home and lived with a roommate, Sheetal ([[Raima Sen]]). The roommate is confused and scared. She refuses to talk with Satyaveer. Satyaveer is later set upon by thugs; they turn out to be the same men who chased Manorama on the night of her death, and they want to find out what she told him that night. Satyaveer tells them what was told to him after getting his two fingers broken and his motorbike is stolen. Satyaveer later uncovers that Manorama's death was an accident; she was hit by a truck as she fled her pursuers.\n\nSheetal calls him. She is still scared but somehow warms to him and asks if she can stay with him for a few days. Seeing as Nimmi has returned to Rohtak (her parents\u2019 house) for Diwali, Satyaveer agrees. Sheetal moves in for a little while. Around this time, Satyaveer attends a rally function with Rathore in attendance. He follows Rathore and discovers that Rathore receives regular medication from a doctor for an unknown ailment. He also spots the woman who visited him on the night Satyaveer took the photos.\n\nHe follows the woman and makes contact with her. She lives with the doctor Anil Potdar. She turns out to be Sameera Rathore, the illegitimate daughter of Rathore. She was trying to get Rathore to accept her as a daughter. Satyaveer begins piecing the parts together. However, when Satyaveer visits the doctor, he finds that the doctor and Sameera have both been brutally murdered. There he and Sheetal discuss what to do next and they almost kiss but his wife calls him and he takes her call immediately remembering his marriage. He runs to the children's home where he discovers that Sheetal has actually been dead for around 8\u201310 days.\n\nArriving home, he finds that the woman masquerading as Sheetal is neither surprised nor scared. She blames him for the act she had to up (as Sheetal), and she directs him to meet Rathore. Rathore demands the photos. Satyaveer turns over the photos he had taken. Not surprisingly, Rathore is not the least bit interested in photos of him having an argument with his biological daughter. It turns out that Neetu (the girl pretending to be Sheetal) is a concubine for Rathore. Rathore now openly threatens him and asks that he hand over those photos. Satyaveer returns home. He scans one of the photos he had taken and suddenly finds a clue in it. This clue leads him to what Manorama had said to him on the night she died. The clue was that Manorama from his book died at page 32. He uses the clues to land up in the room of a small hotel in town, where he discovers a shocking set of photos in a packet cached behind the light switchboard.\n\nSatyaveer returns to confront Rathore. He presents the shocking evidence he has found. Rathore was a pedophile (a person who is sexually attracted to children). The children's home was his steady supply of (orphaned) children. The real Sheetal and Manorama, who worked at the orphanage, had realized his wicked activities. They were about to blow his cover and hence he had them silenced. Rathore calmly informs Satyaveer that Satyaveer, smart though he may be, is still a small-town man that may easily be dispensed with. He then has Neetu harass him sexually which makes Satyaveer come out of disgust and he sees the goons dismantling his scooter. Satyaveer then comes back and reveals another fact. The doctor, Anil Potdar and Manorama were siblings. Also, though the doctor knew that Rathore had lung cancer, he kept concealing the fact from him and kept giving him placebos merely to suppress the symptoms of cancer. The doctor and Manorama merely wanted to keep him alive long enough for him to accept Sameera as his daughter and heir. Then, on Rathore's eventual death, the estate would come to Sameera and thus also to the doctor and Manorama. It was now too late since cancer had reached an advanced stage and Rathore had precious little time left to live. Hearing this Rathore's wife laughs with great relief. She commits suicide in the morning.\n\nThe film ends as Satyaveer quietly walks out. He remarks that the only thing that is certain in an unknown world is a known God.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Actor\n!

The choice of [[Gul Panag]] was based on her performance in the critically acclaimed [[Dor (film)|Dor]] (2006). The selection of [[Raima Sen]] was because of her versatility and suitability for most roles. Navdeep not only wanted a good script, but also great actors to work with. The character of Manorama went to [[Sarika]] because she was convinced of the role.\n\nSince most of the movie was shot in [[Jhunjhunu]] district of [[Rajasthan]] during the winter season, the crew encountered trouble with the prevailing extreme cold conditions.
