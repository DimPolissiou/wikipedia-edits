The merger was instigated because CCD had announced they were shutting their doors due to funding issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/canadian-centre-diversity-close-doors|title=Canadian Centre for Diversity to close doors - The Canadian Jewish News|last=Reporter|first=Paul Lungen, Staff|date=2013-09-25|newspaper=The Canadian Jewish News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref> Upon hearing this news, the CIDI and CCD entered into a dialogue about a merger which would provide stable funding and allow the CCD's programs to continue.\n\n=== About the Canadian Centre for Diversity (CCD) ===\nThe '''[[Canadian Centre for Diversity]]''' (originally called the Canadian Council for Christians and Jews.) was founded in 1947 to address issues of antisemitism and promote interfaith dialogue. The mandate expanded in subsequent years to focus on addressing issues related to racism, and religious discrimination in Canadian society. Their primary focus was on providing school programs to educate students on issues related to bullying, bias and discrimination. The CCCJ changed its name in 2008 to the Canadian Centre for Diversity to be more reflective of its broader mandate.\n\nIn September 2013, the board of directors of the CCD announced that it was shutting its doors due to a lack of ongoing funding.

Having worked as a diversity and inclusion practitioner for the better part of a decade - both in Canada and globally as the Deputy Chief Diversity Officer for KPMG International - Bach felt there was a need for an organization that could wrap its arms around the entire diversity conversation and provide some unity and clarity to what had become a very complicated topic.\n\nBach's vision was to create a non-profit organization that would support employers along their diversity and inclusion journey. CIDI officially launched in 2012. By the middle of 2013 CIDI had secured its founding employer partners, had a staff of 5 and was operating in 4 cities across Canada.\n\nMerger talks began between the two organizations at the end of 2013. There was an agreement in principle struck and Bach was named the CEO of CCD to facilitate the merger over the course of 2014.

He studied under famous [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] in [[Jabal 'Amel]], [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]] among many others.  He was known and respected by sunnis in [[Baalabeck]] for this. He was authorized to teach Muslims in the Nouriyah Islamic school according to the [[five schools of thought]].\n<br/>\nHe became a Mujtahid at age 33 after his visits to Iraq. Since [[Ijtihad]] was forbidden and Shi'ism had a history of persecution in the area, especially that shi'ism was still strong among the people as a result of the not-so-long gone [[Hamdanid]] dynasty, some people conspired against him due to petty reasons before being judged in front of the Sultan.\n<br/>\nHe was a widely travelled man, having visited Egypt, Syria, Hijaz, Tihamah, Baitul Muqaddas, Iraq and Constantinople (Istanbul). Always in pursuit of knowledge, he studied from nearly twelve Sunni Ulama of [[fiqh]]. Apart from the proficiency in fiqh, he was well versed in Usool, Philosophy, Irfan, Medicine and Astronomy.\n<br/>\nHe was a man of piety, known for his austere way of life. His students have recorded in his biography that Shaheed maintained his family by selling the woods cut by himself during the nights, and then sat to teach during the day. While in Ba'lbak, he conducted classes in Fiqh according to five schools, i.e. Ja'fari, Hanafi, Shafei, Maliki and Hambali. His ''Sharh al-Lum'ah'' is a part of curriculum in almost every Hawza even today. He studied from [[Muhaqqiq Karaki]] before the later migrated to Iran.\n<br/>\nIn Rajab of 965 A.H.

He is the father-in-law of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] and  cousin of both [[Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr]] and Imam [[Musa as-Sadr]]. His father [[Haydar al-Sadr]] was a well-respected high-ranking Shi'a cleric. His lineage goes back to [[Muhammad]], through the seventh Shia Imam, [[Musa al-Kazim]]. (See [[Sadr (name)|Sadr]] family for more details.)\n<br/>\nHis father died in 1937, leaving the family penniless. In 1945 the family moved to the holy city of [[Najaf]], where al-Sadr would spend the rest of his life. Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr completed his religious teachings at religious seminaries under [[al-Khoei]] and [[Muhsin al-Hakim]] at the age of 25 and began teaching.\n<br/>\nWhile teaching he became a prominent member of the Iraqi Shia community, and was noted for his many writings. His first works were detailed critiques of [[Marxism]] that presented early ideas of an alternative Islamic form of government. Perhaps his most important work was ''[[Iqtisaduna]]'', one of the most important works on [[Islamic economics]]. This work was a critique of both socialism and capitalism. He was subsequently commissioned by the government of [[Kuwait]] to assess how that country's oil wealth could be managed in keeping with Islamic principles. This led to a major work on [[Islamic banking]] that still forms the basis for modern Islamic banks.\n<br/>\nHe also worked with Sayyid [[Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim]] in forming an [[Islamist]] movement in Iraq.  This attracted the attention of the [[Baath Party]], which resulted in numerous imprisonments for the Ayatollah.  He was often subjugated to torture during his imprisonments, but continued his work after being released.\n<br/>\nIn 1977, he was sentenced to life in prison following uprisings in Najaf, but was released two years later due to his immense popularity.  Upon his release however, he was put under house arrest.

He studied under famous [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] in [[Jabal 'Amel]], [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]] among many others.  He was known and respected by sunnis in [[Baalabeck]] for this. He was authorized to teach Muslims in the Nouriyah Islamic school according to the [[five schools of thought]].\n<br/>\nHe became a Mujtahid at age 33 after his visits to Iraq. Since [[Ijtihad]] was forbidden and Shi'ism had a history of persecution in the area, especially that shi'ism was still strong among the people as a result of the not-so-long gone [[Hamdanid]] dynasty, some people conspired against him due to petty reasons before being judged in front of the Sultan.\n<br/>\nHe was a widely travelled man, having visited Egypt, Syria, Hijaz, Tihamah, Baitul Muqaddas, Iraq and Constantinople (Istanbul). Always in pursuit of knowledge, he studied from nearly twelve Sunni Ulama of [[fiqh]]. Apart from the proficiency in fiqh, he was well versed in Usool, Philosophy, Irfan, Medicine and Astronomy.\n<br/>\nHe was a man of piety, known for his austere way of life. His students have recorded in his biography that Shaheed maintained his family by selling the woods cut by himself during the nights, and then sat to teach during the day. While in Ba'lbak, he conducted classes in Fiqh according to five schools, i.e. Ja'fari, Hanafi, Shafei, Maliki and Hambali. His ''Sharh al-Lum'ah'' is a part of curriculum in almost every Hawza even today. He studied from [[Muhaqqiq Karaki]] before the later migrated to Iran.\n<br/>\nIn Rajab of 965 A.H. (1558), he was beheaded on his way to see the sultan and a shrine was built by some Turkmens on the site as they realised his stature. The person that beheaded him was killed by the Sultan orders.\n\n==Shahid al Thalith==\n{{Main article|Qazi Nurullah Shustari }}Qazi Noorullah Shustari (1542 AD-1610/11) is known as Shaheed-e-Salis (third martyr).

He is the father-in-law of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] and  cousin of both [[Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr]] and Imam [[Musa as-Sadr]]. His father [[Haydar al-Sadr]] was a well-respected high-ranking Shi'a cleric. His lineage goes back to [[Muhammad]], through the seventh Shia Imam, [[Musa al-Kazim]]. (See [[Sadr (name)|Sadr]] family for more details.)\n<br/>\nHis father died in 1937, leaving the family penniless. In 1945 the family moved to the holy city of [[Najaf]], where al-Sadr would spend the rest of his life. Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr completed his religious teachings at religious seminaries under [[al-Khoei]] and [[Muhsin al-Hakim]] at the age of 25 and began teaching.\n<br/>\nWhile teaching he became a prominent member of the Iraqi Shia community, and was noted for his many writings. His first works were detailed critiques of [[Marxism]] that presented early ideas of an alternative Islamic form of government. Perhaps his most important work was ''[[Iqtisaduna]]'', one of the most important works on [[Islamic economics]]. This work was a critique of both socialism and capitalism. He was subsequently commissioned by the government of [[Kuwait]] to assess how that country's oil wealth could be managed in keeping with Islamic principles. This led to a major work on [[Islamic banking]] that still forms the basis for modern Islamic banks.\n<br/>\nHe also worked with Sayyid [[Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim]] in forming an [[Islamist]] movement in Iraq.  This attracted the attention of the [[Baath Party]], which resulted in numerous imprisonments for the Ayatollah.  He was often subjugated to torture during his imprisonments, but continued his work after being released.\n<br/>\nIn 1977, he was sentenced to life in prison following uprisings in Najaf, but was released two years later due to his immense popularity.  Upon his release however, he was put under house arrest.  In 1980, after writing in the defense of the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]], Sadr was once again imprisoned, tortured, and executed by the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]].  His sister, [[Amina Sadr bint al-Huda]],  was also imprisoned, tortured, and executed.

The winner was announced, and the crowd waited for the winner to stand up to accept the traditional congratulations before the chairing ceremony, but no winner appeared. It was then announced that Hedd Wyn had been killed the previous month on the battlefield at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in Belgium. These events were portrayed in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''.\n\nIn 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the Eisteddfod was not held, for fear that it would be a bombing target. Instead, the BBC broadcast an Eisteddfod radio programme, and the Chair, Crown and a Literature Medal (as opposed to the usual Prose Medal) were awarded.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/canrif/1940.shtml| title=Lleoliad yr Eisteddfod: Eisteddfod Radio| publisher=BBC| accessdate=16 August 2012|language=cy}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950 a new rule was created that required all competitions to be held in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

The Eisteddfod offers bilingual signage and simultaneous-translation of many events though wireless headphones. There is also a Welsh-learners area called Maes D. These efforts has helped increase takings, and the 2006 Eisteddfod reported a profit of over \u00a3100,000, despite costing \u00a32.8m to stage. The Eisteddfod attracts some 160,000 people annually. The National Eisteddfod in Cardiff (2008) drew record crowds, with over 160,000 visitors attending.\n\nIt was proposed that the [[2018 Cardiff National Eisteddfod|2018 National Eisteddfod in Cardiff]] would use permanent buildings to host events rather than in the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]] site and tents. This was due partially to a lack of suitable land that could be repaired affordably after the festival. It was billed as an \"Eisteddfod with no fence\" in the media and was held at Cardiff Bay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801233456/https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |archivedate=2017-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Eryl Crump |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/hundreds-parade-2018-national-eisteddfod-13235195 |title=Hundreds parade for 2018 National Eisteddfod proclamation |publisher=Daily Post |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Huw |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33813043 |title=National Eisteddfod considers ditching the Maes in 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> The 2019 Eisteddfod in [[Llanrwst]] returned to the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]].\n\n===Attendance===\n(''incomplete'')\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!year\n!total attendance\n!profit/loss\n|-\n| 2002\n| 144,220\n| -\n|-\n| 2003\n| 176,402\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| 147,785\n| -\n|-\n| 2005\n| 157,820\n| -\n|-\n| 2006\n| 155,437\n| +\u00a3100,000\n|-\n|2007\n|154,944<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6944617.stm|title=Traders count cost of Eisteddfod|date=2007-08-13|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n| +\u00a34,324<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-work-pays-4000-profit-2824338|title=Eisteddfod work pays off with \u00a34,000 profit|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2008-07-01|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2008\n| 156,697\n| +\u00a338,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-needs-more-cash-ahead-2791717|title=Eisteddfod needs more cash ahead of Bala event|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2009-04-20|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2009\n| 164,689\n|  +\u00a3145,000<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/national-eisteddfod-wrexham-makes-90k-2680162|title=National Eisteddfod in Wrexham makes \u00a390k loss|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2011-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2010\n| 136,933<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/eisteddfod_2010/8320455.EISTEDDFOD__Festival____raised_valleys____profile___/ |title=EISTEDDFOD: Festival 'raised valleys' profile' |publisher=South Wales Argus |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n|  -\u00a347,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2011\n| 148,892<ref name=\"walesonline1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-eisteddfod-2015-results-friday-9815399 |title=National Eisteddfod 2015: The results from Friday |publisher=Wales Online |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> \n|  -\u00a390,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2012\n| 138,767<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/our_council/Council-Structure/minutes,_agendas_and_reports/reports/scrutiny_ee/2012/12-11-06/national_eisteddfod.aspx |title=National Eisteddfod |publisher=Valeofglamorgan.gov.uk |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n| +\u00a350,000\n|-\n| 2013\n| 153,704<ref name=\"walesonline1\"/> \n| +\u00a376,000\n|-\n| 2014\n|143,502\n| +\u00a390,000\n|-\n|2015\n|150,776\n|<nowiki>+\u00a354,721</nowiki><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfods-iconic-pink-pavilion-10517410|title=National Eisteddfod's iconic pink pavilion to be replaced|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2015-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016\n| 140,229\n| +\u00a36,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfod-2016-cultural-financial-12233637|title=National Eisteddfod 2016 was a 'cultural and financial success'|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2016-11-26|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2017\n| 147,498\n| +\u00a393,200<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-42122512|title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2017-11-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018\n| ~500,000\n| -\u00a3290,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2018-11-24 |work=BBC News|access-date=2019-08-04|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2019\n| 150,000\n| -\u00a3158,982<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=The reason why National Eisteddfod 2019 made loss of more than \u00a3150,000 |date=2019-11-23 |work=North Wales Live|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru, Glynebwy, 1958.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Chairing of the Bard|chairing]] ceremony of the 1958 National Eisteddfod; the victorious poet was [[T.

However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe venue is officially proclaimed a year in advance, at which time the themes and texts for the competitions are published. The organisation for the location will have begun a year or more earlier, and locations are generally known two or three years ahead. The [[Eisteddfod Act]] of 1959 allowed local authorities to give financial support to the event. Traditionally the Eisteddfod venue alternates between north and south Wales; the decision to hold both the 2014 and 2015 Eisteddfodau in South Wales was thus seen as controversial,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> but the decision was later reversed and Montgomeryshire named as host county for 2015.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod/2011/sites/news/pages/eisteddfod_2016.shtml Site for the Eisteddfod until 2016] at BBC Wales, 8 July 2010</ref> Occasionally the Eisteddfod has been held in England, although the last occasion was in 1929.<ref name=\"venues-list\" />\n\nHundreds of tents, pavilions and booths are erected in an open space to create the ''[[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]]'' (field). The space required for this means that it is rare for the Eisteddfod to be in a city or town: instead it is held somewhere with more space. Car parking for day visitors alone requires several large fields, and many people camp on the site for the whole week.\n\nThe festival has a quasi-[[Gorsedd|druidic]] flavour, with the main literary prizes for poetry and prose being awarded in colourful and dramatic ceremonies under the auspices of the [[Gorsedd]] of Bards of the Island of Britain, complete with prominent figures in Welsh cultural life dressed in flowing druidic costumes, flower dances, trumpet fanfares and a symbolic [[cornucopia|Horn of Plenty]]. However, the [[Gorsedd]] is not an ancient institution or a pagan ceremony but rather a romantic creation by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 1790s, which first became a formal part of the Eisteddfod ceremonial in 1819.<ref name=\"museum1\"/> Nevertheless, it is taken very seriously, and an award of a crown or a chair for poetry is a great honour. The [[Chairing of the Bard|Chairing]] and [[Crowning of the Bard|Crowning]] ceremonies are the highlights of the week, and are presided over by the [[Archdruid]]. Other important awards include the {{illm|Prose Medal|cy|Medal Ryddiaith}} (first introduced in 1937).\n\nIf no stone circle is there already, one is created out of [[Gorsedd stones]], usually taken from the local area. These stone circles are icons all across Wales and signify the Eisteddfod having visited a community. As a cost-saving measure, the 2005 Eisteddfod was the first to use a temporary \"fibre-glass stone\" circle for the druidic ceremonies instead of a permanent stone circle. This also has the benefit of bringing the Gorsedd ceremonies onto the ''maes'': previously they were often held many miles away, hidden from most of the public. \n \nAs well as the main pavilion with the main stage, there are other venues through the week. Some are fixtures every year, hosting gigs (Maes B/Llwyfan y Maes/Caffi Maes B). Other fixtures of the ''maes'' are the ''Pabell L\u00ean'' (literature pavilion), the ''Neuadd Ddawns'' (dance hall), the ''Pabell Wyddoniaeth a Thechnoleg'' (science and technology pavilion), ''Maes D'' (learners' pavilion), at least one theatre, ''Y Cwt Drama'' (the drama hut), ''T\u0177 Gwerin'' (folk house), ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' (\"the Art Place\") and hundreds of ''stondinau'' (stands and booths) where groups, societies, councils, charities and shops exhibit and sell. Since 2004, alcohol has been sold on the ''maes''; previously there was a no-alcohol policy.\n\n==Poetry awards==\nThe Eisteddfod's most well-known awards are those for poetry.\n\n===Chairing of the

The winner was announced, and the crowd waited for the winner to stand up to accept the traditional congratulations before the chairing ceremony, but no winner appeared. It was then announced that Hedd Wyn had been killed the previous month on the battlefield at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in Belgium. These events were portrayed in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''.\n\nIn 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the Eisteddfod was not held, for fear that it would be a bombing target. Instead, the BBC broadcast an Eisteddfod radio programme, and the Chair, Crown and a Literature Medal (as opposed to the usual Prose Medal) were awarded.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/canrif/1940.shtml| title=Lleoliad yr Eisteddfod: Eisteddfod Radio| publisher=BBC| accessdate=16 August 2012|language=cy}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950 a new rule was created that required all competitions to be held in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

The Eisteddfod offers bilingual signage and simultaneous-translation of many events though wireless headphones. There is also a Welsh-learners area called Maes D. These efforts has helped increase takings, and the 2006 Eisteddfod reported a profit of over \u00a3100,000, despite costing \u00a32.8m to stage. The Eisteddfod attracts some 160,000 people annually. The National Eisteddfod in Cardiff (2008) drew record crowds, with over 160,000 visitors attending.\n\nIt was proposed that the [[2018 Cardiff National Eisteddfod|2018 National Eisteddfod in Cardiff]] would use permanent buildings to host events rather than in the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]] site and tents. This was due partially to a lack of suitable land that could be repaired affordably after the festival. It was billed as an \"Eisteddfod with no fence\" in the media and was held at Cardiff Bay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801233456/https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |archivedate=2017-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Eryl Crump |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/hundreds-parade-2018-national-eisteddfod-13235195 |title=Hundreds parade for 2018 National Eisteddfod proclamation |publisher=Daily Post |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Huw |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33813043 |title=National Eisteddfod considers ditching the Maes in 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> The 2019 Eisteddfod in [[Llanrwst]] returned to the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]].\n\n===Attendance===\n(''incomplete'')\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!year\n!total attendance\n!profit/loss\n|-\n| 2002\n| 144,220\n| -\n|-\n| 2003\n| 176,402\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| 147,785\n| -\n|-\n| 2005\n| 157,820\n| -\n|-\n| 2006\n| 155,437\n| +\u00a3100,000\n|-\n|2007\n|154,944<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6944617.stm|title=Traders count cost of Eisteddfod|date=2007-08-13|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n| +\u00a34,324<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-work-pays-4000-profit-2824338|title=Eisteddfod work pays off with \u00a34,000 profit|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2008-07-01|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2008\n| 156,697\n| +\u00a338,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/eisteddfod-needs-more-cash-ahead-2791717|title=Eisteddfod needs more cash ahead of Bala event|last=Post|first=North Wales Daily|date=2009-04-20|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2009\n| 164,689\n|  +\u00a3145,000<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/national-eisteddfod-wrexham-makes-90k-2680162|title=National Eisteddfod in Wrexham makes \u00a390k loss|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2011-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2010\n| 136,933<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/eisteddfod_2010/8320455.EISTEDDFOD__Festival____raised_valleys____profile___/ |title=EISTEDDFOD: Festival 'raised valleys' profile' |publisher=South Wales Argus |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n|  -\u00a347,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2011\n| 148,892<ref name=\"walesonline1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-eisteddfod-2015-results-friday-9815399 |title=National Eisteddfod 2015: The results from Friday |publisher=Wales Online |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> \n|  -\u00a390,000<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| 2012\n| 138,767<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/our_council/Council-Structure/minutes,_agendas_and_reports/reports/scrutiny_ee/2012/12-11-06/national_eisteddfod.aspx |title=National Eisteddfod |publisher=Valeofglamorgan.gov.uk |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n| +\u00a350,000\n|-\n| 2013\n| 153,704<ref name=\"walesonline1\"/> \n| +\u00a376,000\n|-\n| 2014\n|143,502\n| +\u00a390,000\n|-\n|2015\n|150,776\n|<nowiki>+\u00a354,721</nowiki><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfods-iconic-pink-pavilion-10517410|title=National Eisteddfod's iconic pink pavilion to be replaced|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2015-11-28|website=northwales|access-date=2019-08-10}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2016\n| 140,229\n| +\u00a36,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/national-eisteddfod-2016-cultural-financial-12233637|title=National Eisteddfod 2016 was a 'cultural and financial success'|last=Crump|first=Eryl|date=2016-11-26|work=northwales|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2017\n| 147,498\n| +\u00a393,200<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-42122512|title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2017-11-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018\n| ~500,000\n| -\u00a3290,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=National Eisteddfod 2019 in Llanrwst|date=2018-11-24 |work=BBC News|access-date=2019-08-04|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2019\n| 150,000\n| -\u00a3158,982<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46327940 |title=The reason why National Eisteddfod 2019 made loss of more than \u00a3150,000 |date=2019-11-23 |work=North Wales Live|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru, Glynebwy, 1958.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Chairing of the Bard|chairing]] ceremony of the 1958 National Eisteddfod; the victorious poet was [[T.

(Mold, 2007)]]\n[[File:Y Lle Celf.JPG|thumb|250px|'[[Y Lle Celf]]' (Blaenau Gwent, 2010)]]\nThe National Eisteddfod is traditionally held in the first week of August, and the competitions are all held in the [[Welsh language]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe venue is officially proclaimed a year in advance, at which time the themes and texts for the competitions are published. The organisation for the location will have begun a year or more earlier, and locations are generally known two or three years ahead. The [[Eisteddfod Act]] of 1959 allowed local authorities to give financial support to the event. Traditionally the Eisteddfod venue alternates between north and south Wales; the decision to hold both the 2014 and 2015 Eisteddfodau in South Wales was thus seen as controversial,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> but the decision was later reversed and Montgomeryshire named as host county for 2015.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod/2011/sites/news/pages/eisteddfod_2016.shtml Site for the Eisteddfod until 2016] at BBC Wales, 8 July 2010</ref> Occasionally the Eisteddfod has been held in England, although the last occasion was in 1929.<ref name=\"venues-list\" />\n\nHundreds of tents, pavilions and booths are erected in an open space to create the ''[[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]]'' (field). The space required for this means that it is rare for the Eisteddfod to be in a city or town: instead it is held somewhere with more space. Car parking for day visitors alone requires several large fields, and many people camp on the site for the whole week.\n\nThe festival has a quasi-[[Gorsedd|druidic]] flavour, with the main literary prizes for poetry and prose being awarded in colourful and dramatic ceremonies under the auspices of the [[Gorsedd]] of Bards of the Island of Britain, complete with prominent figures in Welsh cultural life dressed in flowing druidic costumes, flower dances, trumpet fanfares and a symbolic [[cornucopia|Horn of Plenty]]. However, the [[Gorsedd]] is not an ancient institution or a pagan ceremony but rather a romantic creation by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 1790s, which first became a formal part of the Eisteddfod ceremonial in 1819.<ref name=\"museum1\"/> Nevertheless, it is taken very seriously, and an award of a crown or a chair for poetry is a great honour. The [[Chairing of the Bard|Chairing]] and [[Crowning of the Bard|Crowning]] ceremonies are the highlights of the week, and are presided over by the [[Archdruid]]. Other important awards include the {{illm|Prose Medal|cy|Medal Ryddiaith}} (first introduced in 1937).\n\nIf no stone circle is there already, one is created out of [[Gorsedd stones]], usually taken from the local area. These stone circles are icons all across Wales and signify the Eisteddfod having visited a community. As a cost-saving measure, the 2005 Eisteddfod was the first to use a temporary \"fibre-glass stone\" circle for the druidic ceremonies instead of a permanent stone circle. This also has the benefit of bringing the Gorsedd ceremonies onto the ''maes'': previously they were often held many miles away, hidden from most of the public. \n \nAs well as the main pavilion with the main stage, there are other venues through the week. Some are fixtures every year, hosting gigs (Maes B/Llwyfan y Maes/Caffi Maes B). Other fixtures of the ''maes'' are the ''Pabell L\u00ean'' (literature pavilion), the ''Neuadd Ddawns'' (dance hall), the ''Pabell Wyddoniaeth a Thechnoleg'' (science and technology pavilion), ''Maes D'' (learners' pavilion), at least one theatre, ''Y Cwt Drama'' (the drama hut), ''T\u0177 Gwerin'' (folk house), ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' (\"the Art Place\") and hundreds of ''stondinau'' (stands and booths) where groups, societies, councils, charities and shops exhibit and sell. Since 2004, alcohol has been sold on the ''maes''; previously there was a no-alcohol policy.\n\n==Poetry awards==\nThe Eisteddfod's most well-known awards are those for poetry.\n===Chairing of the

{"title_page": "Concentrated poverty", "text_new": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2019}}\n'''Concentrated poverty''' refers to a [[spatial density]] of socio-economic deprivation. In the US, it is commonly used in fields of policy and scholarship in reference to areas of \"[[Extreme poverty|extreme]]\" or \"high-poverty\" defined by the US census as areas with \"40 percent of the tract population living below the federal poverty threshold.\"<ref>Bureau of the Census. 1970. \u201cLow-Income Areas in Large Cities\u201d. Subject Report. U.S. Department of Commerce: Washington D.C.</ref>  A large body of literature argues that these areas of concentrated poverty place additional burdens on poor families that live within them, beyond what the families' own individual circumstances would dictate.  The research also indicates that areas of concentrated poverty can have wider effects on surrounding neighborhoods that are not classified as \"high-poverty,\" thus limiting overall [[economic potential]] and [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]].<ref>\u201cThe Enduring Challenge of Concentrated Poverty in America: Case Studies from Communities Across the U.S.\u201d, n.d., http://www.frbsf.org/cpreport/</ref>\n\n== History of concentrated poverty in the United States ==\n\nA long-standing issue, concentrated poverty creates distinct social problems, exacerbating individual [[Poverty|impoverishment]] and standing as the grounds of reform movements and studies since the mid-19th century. An analytical conception and measure for concentrated emerged in the United States around the 1970s, sparked by concern for its [[Inner city|inner cities]] following [[deindustrialization]], late-[[List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States#1960|1960s civil unrest]], rapid suburbanization, and subsequent out-migration. Most inner city areas of concentrated poverty contained predominantly minority populations, featuring expansive public housing developments. The Bureau of the Census developed the first definition of \"low-income areas\" as part of its work for the newly-established Office of Economic Opportunity, an organization designed to administer [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson']]<nowiki/>s [[War on poverty|War on Poverty]] programs, part of his [[Great Society]] legislative agenda. Overall, these programs were intended to identify major poverty concentrations within large metropolitan areas. An attribute-based criterion formed the original definition, with [[Census tract|census tracks]] ranked by the following:\n\n# Income\n# Average level of education\n# Number of single-parent households\n# Percentage of low-skilled workers\n# Quality of housing stock\n\nOf these, the lowest quartile were designated \"low income.\" Following the [[1970 United States Census|1970 census]], attribute-based measures were translated to purely statistical ones, defining \"low-income areas\" as census tracks with 20%-39% of inhabitants falling under the poverty line, and labeling areas with 40% or more impoverished inhabitants as \"high\" or \"extreme\" poverty. Calibration of household income statistics most closely approximating the 1960 census lower quartile lead to the adoption of the 20% threshold adopted in 1970. The 40% threshold designating \"high-poverty\" areas was set by doubling the low-income thershold, becoming the common definition of \"concentrated poverty\" in policy and scholarly research.\n\nPaul Jargowsky later developed an alternative measure for concentrated poverty, used more specifically for larger geographical areas. His rate expresses the proportion of all poor individuals in a certain area (e.g., city, metropolitan region, or county) who live in census tracts of high poverty.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A. 1997. Poverty and place: Ghettos, barrios, and the American city. New York: Russell Sage Foundation.</ref> Jargowsky further refined the concept of concentrated poverty to more specifically describe the \"proportion of the poor in some region city or region that resides in high-poverty neighborhoods,\" as opposed to a simple territorial designation of high-poverty neighborhoods.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A. Stunning Progress, Hidden Problems: The Dramatic Decline of Concentrated Poverty in the 1990s. Living Cities Census Series, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Studies. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, May 2003.</ref>\n\n[[William Julius Wilson]]'s book ''[[The Truly Disadvantaged|The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy]]'' was the first major scholarly work utilizing the census measure to study changing spatial trends in poverty, as well as its causes and effects.<ref>Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago.</ref> According to his findings, tracts of concentrated poverty increased dramatically throughout metropolitan areas of the United States during the 1970s, alongside the population of poor people residing within them. These trends related specifically to an African American \"[[underclass]]\" in America's inner cities (see trends below). In this work, Wilson utilizes concentrated poverty as an ''analytic measure'' to gauge the changing spatial organization and intensification of poverty, as a ''territorial category'' to designate an object of analysis, and also as a ''causal factor'' in and of itself, effecting life chances among the poor. All three conceptualizations have since served as the basis for a wide range of social science research, as well as policy interventions and prescriptions.\n\n====Analytic measure====\n\nWilson's study both set the precedent of using the census' 40% threshold and has been adopted as the standard measure for the study of poverty trends and poor neighborhoods. Its standardization is largely credited to the measure's convenience, as opposed to any conceptual justifications, and is employed to compare degrees of poverty concentration between areas, as well as the growth or decline in total number of tracts fitting such qualifications within a given city, region, or country.\n\nBoth the federal definition of poverty and the census definition of concentrated poverty (40% threshold) have received criticism. The overall discussion for both cases has labeled the use of bureaucratic categories intended to facilitate both the routine collection of statistics and public assistance eligibility as unfit for comprehensively capturing urban social structures and strategies. Many criticisms revolve around the [[poverty threshold]], the most prominent including the inability to fully consider the needs of different family types (e.g.: childcare services, health insurance, etc.), the non-cash benefits from public sources, the cash and non-cash resources (or lack thereof) from social and familial networks, and the consideration of regional variations in cost of living expenses.<ref>Madden, J. 1996. \u201cChanges in the Distribution of Poverty Across and Within the U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1979-1989\u201d. Urban Studies 33,9:1581-1600.</ref> Concurrently, the 40% benchmark used by the census and various scholars to define concentrated poverty does not refer to any adequately specific objective or subjective criteria. Jargowsky and Bane (1991) assert \u201c...that the 40 percent criterion came very close to identifying areas that looked like ghettos in terms of their housing conditions\u201d (p.&nbsp;239). They contend that \u201cthe areas selected by the 40 percent criterion corresponded closely with the neighborhoods that city officials and local Census Bureau officials considered ghettos\u201d (p.&nbsp;239). Thus, these scholars argued that although \u201cany fixed cutoff is inherently arbitrary...the 40 percent criterion appropriately identifies most ghetto neighborhoods\u201d (p.&nbsp;239). Here we observe the threshold's justification on the basis of general personal impressions and impressions of city officials rather than any rigorous objective criteria.<ref>Jargowsky, P. and Bane, M. 1991. \u201cGhetto Poverty in the United States, 1970 to 1980\u201d. in The Urban Underclass edited by Christopher Jencks and Paul E. Peterson. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution.</ref>\n\nIn addition to contentious debate regarding the selection of particular percentage thresholds as accurate descriptive measures (i.e. 30% vs. 60% threshold of residents in poverty), other scholars criticized the use of an absolute indicator of poverty concentration as an analytic measure and tool for trend tracking. In one instance, researchers Massey and Eggers contend that a relative, segragation-based indicator is more rigorous and meaningful, claiming that \". . .levels and trends in poverty concentration are best studied with well-established measures of segregation that use complete information on the spatial distribution of income instead of an ad hoc and arbitrary definition of 'poverty neighborhoods' and 'poverty concentration'\"<ref>Bol, Manute. and Eggers, M. 1990. \u201cThe Ecology of Inequality: Minorities and the Concentration of Poverty, 1970-1980\u201d. American Journal of Sociology 95(5): 1156. cited in Wolch, Jennifer and Nathan Sessoms.\"The Changing Face of Concentrated Poverty.\"</ref> Based on a recent growth of working poor populations and emergence of inner-suburban poverty, Jennifer Wolch and Nathan Sessoms have challenged the utility of the traditional 40% threshold concept of concentrated poverty.<ref>Wolch, Jennifer and Nathan Sessoms.\"The Changing Face of Concentrated Poverty.\" http://www.usc.edu/schools/sppd/lusk/research/pdf/wp_2005-1004.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526231749/http://www.usc.edu/schools/sppd/lusk/research/pdf/wp_2005-1004.pdf|date=2011-05-26}}</ref> Their study shows that several areas in [[Southern California]], which meet the 40% threshold, do not demonstrate the characteristics traditionally associated with areas of concentrated poverty, and do not suffer from extreme levels of dysfunction, crime, and blight. Additionally, they are often reasonably clean, safe, well-maintained, and home to several commercial/retail establishments, public facilities, etc. They also argue that the term has become conflated with \"areas of social problems\" and argue that the concept should be unhooked from behavioral definitions and stigma.\n\n====Territorial category====\n\nAreas of concentrated poverty as a territorial category have become both key targets of place-specific policy interventions and the object of analysis for comparative studies within policy research and the [[social science]]s. Its use as a territorial category has also resulted in several critiques, beginning with the question of whether census tracts are good spatial categories for social-scientific analysis. Systematic field observations in various inner city areas reveal that census tracts serve as poor proxies of what residents construe and construct as neighborhoods in their daily routines.<ref>Sanchez-Jankowski, M. 2008. Cracks in the Pavement: Social Change and Resilience in Poor Neighborhoods. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>  Sociologist Loic Wacquant criticized the measure when used to denote or define [[Ghetto|\u201cghettos,\"]] a reference first made by Bane and Jargowsky and William Julius Wilson (see above). Scholars increasingly conflate areas of concentrated poverty and ghettos, something Wacquant claims camouflages the constitutive role of ethnoracial domination in the [[ghetto]] and [[Hyperghettoization|hyperghetto]]. According to Wacquant, this income-based notion of the ghetto is \"ostensibly deracialized\" and largely a product of policy-geared research fearful of the \"strict taboo that weighs on segregation in the political sphere\".<ref>Wacquant, L. 2011. \u201cA Janus-Faced Institution of Ethnoracial Closure: A Sociological Specification of the Ghetto.\u201d Pp. 1-31 in Ray Hutchison and Bruce Haynes (eds.), The Ghetto: Contemporary Global Issues and Controversies, Boulder, Westview, 201.</ref> Massey and Denton similarly question the use of a purely income-based measure to define areas of deprivation, showing strong empirical evidence and theorizing that high levels of racial segregation (defined by an [[index of dissimilarity]] above 60) produce distinct [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] constellations and processes.<ref>Massey, D., and Nancy Denton. 1993.

Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.</ref> Additional questions by Wacquant include why rural communities and suburban tracts are often left out of social science analyses focusing on concentrated poverty.\n\n====Causal factor====\n\nConcentrated poverty is increasingly recognized as a \"causal factor\" in compounding the effects of poverty by isolating residents from networks and resources useful for realizing human potential (explored further in the effects section). William Julius Wilson coined these processes in ''The Truly Disadvantaged'' as \"concentration effects.\" He termed the primary effect \"social isolation\", defined as the lack of contact or sustained interaction with individuals and institutions representing mainstream society. This isolation makes it much more difficult for those looking for jobs to be tied into the job network, also generating behavior not conducive to good work histories. A key in Wilson's idea of social isolation is the linking of behavioral outcomes of the ghetto poor to the structural constraints of the job market and historical discrimination. This contradicts the theory of a \"culture of poverty,\" which stipulated that basic values and attitudes of the ghetto subculture have been internalized, placing a strong emphasis on the autonomous character of these cultural traits once they come into existence.<ref>Lewis, O. 1959. Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty. New York: Basic Books.</ref>\n\nMany scholars have called to question this causal framing. For Wilson, concentrated poverty stood as a link between structural factors and social behaviors produced through the \"concentration effects\" of poverty. Subsequent policy and scholarly research have ignored such causes. According to Agnew, \"one can start out using spatial concepts as shorthand for complex sociological processes but slip easily into substituting the spatial concepts for the more complex argument\".''<ref>Agnew J, 1993, \"Representing space, scale and culture in social science\", in Place/Culture/ Representation Eds J Duncan, D Ley (Routledge, New York) pp 251-271</ref>'' ''Steinberg has claimed that this amounts to misdiagnosing the symptom as the disease, as the structural factors are severed from the spatial outcome, policy prescriptions to address concentrated poverty have shifted from economic policies to encourage full-employment to simply deconcentrating poverty (see section below).<ref>Steinberg, S. (2010). The Myth of Concentrated Poverty. In The Integration Debate: Competing Futures for American Cities. Chester Hartman and Gregory Squires, eds. Pp.228\u2013301. New York: Routledge.</ref> As Goetz observed, \u201cOver time, focus has shifted away from the causes of concentrated poverty toward the behavior of the poor in response to concentrated poverty,\" which ultimately has led to reproducing the \"culture of poverty\" thesis in severing the theory from its structural roots.<ref>Goetz, E. (2003). Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute Press</ref>''\n\n==Causes==\nThis changing spatial distribution of poverty has been attributed to a number of structural factors, primarily in the economic sphere, and occurring since the 1970s.<ref>Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago.</ref> (From William Julius Wilson, ''The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy'').\n\n*[[Racial discrimination]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]]: Blacks were discriminated against far more severely in the early twentieth century than were the new white immigrants. Through restrictive covenants, municipal policies, and federal housing programs, blacks, unlike other immigrant groups, were forced into particular areas inner cities. At the same time blacks were discriminated far more severely than other groups in the labor market making them disproportionately poor and concentrated in low-paying jobs, particularly in the industrial sector. Collectively these forms of racial and spatial discrimination laid the basis for most areas of contemporary concentrated poverty.\n*[[Deindustrialization]]: As mentioned above, because blacks were concentrated in the low-wage sector of the economy due to discrimination and prejudice, they are more adversely affected by impersonal economic shifts in advanced industrial society. Their heavy concentration in the automobile, rubber, steel, and other smokestack industries meant that they were particularly hit hard by deindustrialization occurring in US cities from the 70s onward. In other words, minorities, particularly poor and working-class minorities, are not only adversely affected by periodic recessions, they are also vulnerable to the structural economic changes in the past two decades because of economic cutbacks, plant closings, and relocation of firms to cheaper labor sites in the suburbs.\n*Increasing gap between skilled and unskilled workers: Many of the new jobs that emerged in the post-1970s economy have been disproportionately in the service and knowledge sectors. These sectors are marked by large inequalities in wages, and has lowered the average income of households compared to those that had held better paying industrial jobs in the past (see [[Working Poor]])\n*[[Spatial mismatch]]: With the expansion of the suburbs, economic growth shifted from the inner cities to the suburbs. The inner city poor were largely cut off from taking advantage of these new opportunities due to their spatial distance.\n*[[White flight]]: A large scale migration of wealthier whites from the inner city occurred with the construction of the federal highway system and expansion of federal mortgage programs. These patterns were also driven by increased fears and anxieties of minority populations. This increased the proportion of both poor and black people in urban populations while eroding municipal tax bases, leading toward a downward spiral in the provision of public services as well as job opportunities and economic development.\n*Flight of the black middle class: As the civil rights movement ended racial restrictions on federal housing loans and programs, and opened up limited opportunities for black mobility, many of the better-off blacks in inner cities moved to mixed neighborhoods or satellite suburbs. This increased the proportion of poor within the ghetto and also weakened civic institutions and investment in the local economy.\n*Changes in the age structure: In the years concentrated poverty was increasing so was the proportion of African American youth in central cities. The number of central-city blacks aged fourteen to twenty-four rose by 78% from 1960\u20131970, compared with an increase of only 23% for whites of the same age. This younger demographic balance in minority neighborhoods contributes to rises in crime, out-of-wedlock birth, unemployment, and other factors associated with poverty.\n*Changes in family structure: In 1965, 25% of all black families were headed by women. The proportion surpassed 28% in 1970, reached 40 percent by 1979, registered at 43% in 1984, and 72% by 2010.<ref>http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Rankings.aspx?ind=107</ref> Because poverty is measured at the household level, rather than the individual, such demographic changes inevitably increase the poverty rate. Furthermore, several studies have shown that women, particularly, single-mothers are disproportionately poor to a number of factors (see [[Feminization of poverty|Feminization of Poverty]])\n\n==Effects==\nSeveral recent studies have pointed to the role of \"neighborhood effects\" caused by concentrated poverty. These studies have illustrated that crime and delinquency, education, psychological distress, and various health problems, among many other issues, are affected by neighborhood characteristics, particularly the concentration of poverty. Thresholds, or [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping points]], also prove important.<ref>http://www.huduser.org/portal/periodicals/em/winter11/highlight2.html</ref> In a recent review of research, Galster notes that studies suggest \u201cthat the independent impacts of neighborhood poverty rates in encouraging negative outcomes for individuals like crime, school leaving, and duration of poverty spells appear to be nil unless the neighborhood exceeds about 20 percent poverty, whereupon the externality effects grow rapidly until the neighborhood reaches approximately 40 percent poverty; subsequent increases in the poverty population appear to have no marginal effect.\u201d<ref>George C. Galster, \u201cThe Mechanism(s) of Neighborhood Effects: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications.\u201d Presentation at the ESRC Seminar, St. Andrews University, Scotland, UK, 4\u20135 February 2010.</ref> Housing values and rents show a similar pattern. Using data from the 100 largest U.S. metro areas from 1990 to 2000, Galster ''et al.'' find little relationship between neighborhood poverty rates and decline in neighborhood housing values and rents until poverty exceeds 10 percent, at which point values decline rapidly before becoming shallower at very high poverty levels.<ref>\u201cThe Costs of Concentrated Poverty: Neighborhood Property Markets and the Dynamics of Decline.\u201d In Nicolas P. Retsinas and Eric S. Belsky, eds., Revisiting Rental Housing: Policies, Programs, and Priorities. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 116\u20139.</ref>\n\nOne of the largest studies examining the effects of concentrated poverty was completed by the Pew Economic Mobility Project which tracked 5,000 families since 1968 and found that no other factor, including parents' education, employment, or marital status, was as important as neighborhood poverty in explaining why African-American children were so much more likely to have lower incomes than their parents as adults.<ref>Sharkey, Patrick (2009, July) \u201cNeighborhoods and the Black-White Mobility Gap,\u201d Washington, DC: The Economic Mobility Project, The Pew Charitable Trusts.</ref> Thus, the concentrated poverty rate aims to capture the extent of a possible \u201cdouble burden\u201d imposed on poor families living in extremely poor communities; both being poor and living in a poor community. The study also found negative effects on the better-off children raised in such areas, as well. While initial research failed to isolate the direct effects of \"concentrated poverty\" in and of itself, more recent work has shifted to identifying the mechanisms that matter. Rather than focusing solely on the socio-economic characteristics of neighborhoods, this scholarship to examining the social-interactive and institutional aspects produced through concentrated poverty. Below is an overview of these effects and mechanisms.<ref>Robert J. Sampson, Jeffrey D. Morenoff, and Thomas Gannon-Rowley. 2002. \u201cAssessing \u2018Neighborhood Effects\u2019: Social Processes and New Directions in Research,\u201d Annual Review of Sociology 28: 466.</ref><ref>George C.

Galster, \"The Mechanism(s) of Neighborhood Effects: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications\").\n\n====Social interactive effects====\n\nThis set of mechanisms refers to social processes endogenous to neighborhoods. These processes include:\n* Social contagion: Behaviors, aspirations, and attitudes may be changed by contact with peers who are neighbors. Under certain conditions these changes can take on contagion dynamics that are akin to \u201cepidemics.\u201d\n* Collective socialization: Individuals may be encouraged to conform to local social norms conveyed by neighborhood role models and other social pressures. This socialization effect is characterized by a minimum threshold or critical mass being achieved before a norm can produce noticeable consequences for others in the neighborhood.\n* Social networks: Individuals may be influenced by the interpersonal communication of information and resources of various kinds transmitted through neighbors. These networks can involve either \u201cstrong ties\u201d and/or \u201cweak ties.\u201d\n* Social cohesion and control: The degree of neighborhood social disorder and its converse, \u201ccollective efficacy\" may influence a variety of behaviors and psychological reactions of residents.\n* [[Relative deprivation]]: This mechanism suggests that residents who have achieved some socioeconomic success will be a source of disamenities for their less-well off neighbors. The latter, it is argued, will view the successful with envy and/or will make them perceive their own relative inferiority as a source of dissatisfaction.\n* Parental mediation: The neighborhood may affect (through any of the mechanisms listed under all categories here) parents\u2019 physical and mental health, stress, coping skills, sense of efficacy, behaviors, and material resources. All of these, in turn, may affect the home environment in which children are raised.\n\n====Environmental effects====\n\nEnvironmental mechanisms refer to natural and human-made attributes of the local space that may affect directly the mental and/or physical health of residents without affecting their behaviors. As in the case of social-interactive mechanism, the environmental category can also assume distinct forms:\n* Exposure to violence: If people sense that their property or person is in danger they may suffer psychological and physical responses that may impair their functioning or sensed well-being. These consequences are likely to be even more pronounced if the person has been victimized.\n* Physical surroundings: Decayed physical conditions of the built environment (e.g., deteriorated structures and public infrastructure, litter, graffiti) may impart psychological effects on residents,\n\n====Geographical effects====\n\nGeographic mechanisms refer to aspects of spaces that may affect residents\u2019 life courses yet do not arise within the neighborhood but rather purely because of the neighborhood\u2019s location relative to larger-scale political and economic forces such as:\n* Spatial mismatch: Certain neighborhoods may have little accessibility (in either spatial proximity or as mediated by transportation networks) to job opportunities appropriate to the skills of their residents, thereby restricting their employment opportunities.\n* Public services: Some neighborhoods may be located within local political jurisdictions that offer inferior public services and facilities because of their limited tax base resources, incompetence, corruption, or other operational challenges. These, in turn, may adversely affect the personal development and educational opportunities of residents.\n\n====Institutional effects====\n\nThe last category of mechanisms involves actions by those typically not residing in the given neighborhood who control important institutional resources located there and/or points of interface between neighborhood residents and vital markets:\n* Stigmatization: Neighborhoods may be stigmatized on the basis of public stereotypes held by powerful institutional or private actors about its current residents. In other cases this may occur regardless of the neighborhood\u2019s current population because of its history, environmental or topographical disamenities, style, scale and type of dwellings, or condition of their commercial districts and public spaces. Such stigma may reduce the opportunities and perceptions of residents of stigmatized areas in a variety of ways, such as job opportunities and self-esteem.\n* Local institutional resources: Some neighborhoods may have access to few and/or high-quality private, non-profit, or public institutions and organizations, such as benevolent charities, day care facilities, schools, and medical clinics. The lack of same may adversely affect the personal development opportunities of residents.\n* Local market actors: There may be substantial spatial variations in the prevalence of certain private market actors that may encourage or discourage certain behaviors by neighborhood residents, such as liquor stores, fresh food markets, fast food restaurants, and illegal drug markets.\n\n==Regional examples==\nConcentrated poverty is a global phenomenon, with examples visible in both [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]]. According to the [[Brookings Institution]], post-industrial revolution growth has spread unevenly between and within countries, with many developing countries likely to still have regional examples of extreme poverty.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2019/09/24/the-geography-of-poverty-hotspots/|title=The geography of poverty hotspots|last=Kharas|first=Jennifer L.

Although this analysis does not refer specifically to concentrated poverty, rather more broadly to [[Extreme poverty|''extreme'' poverty]], its conclusions underscore the widespread nature of concentrated poverty, as well as its relationship to extreme poverty and [[Cycle of poverty|poverty cycles]].<ref name=\":02\"/> Despite positive trends in the reduction of global poverty rates, researchers such as [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]]'s Max Roser and Esteban Ortiz-Ospina highlight the deepening divide between socioeconomic classes worldwide, which in turn paints an inaccurate image of the conditions faced by most populations.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/africa/1428639/world-banks-measure-of-poverty-is-flawed/|title=World Bank's optimism about declining global poverty is missing a crucial point|last=Agder|first=Alf Gunvald Nilsen, University of|website=Quartz Africa|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roser|first=Max|last2=Ortiz-Ospina|first2=Esteban|date=2013-05-25|title=Global Extreme Poverty|url=https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty|journal=Our World in Data}}</ref> Instead, regions such as Africa and Asia observe overall economic growth while its poorest populations stagnate.<ref name=\":12\"/> The widespread nature of extreme poverty, as well as trends pointing towards the growth of concentrated poverty, suggest a need to explore this issue through a more global lens. The following are examples of concentrated poverty through the lens of various countries/regions, ranging from developed to developing. While it is not an exhaustive list of examples, the overall goal is to provide information regarding the diverse characteristics of concentrated poverty.\n\n=== American trends ===\n\n====1970 - 1990====\n\nThe number of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods - where the poverty rate was 40% or higher - doubled between 1970 and 1990. It was not until after the release of the 1980 census, however, that trends of poverty concentration were systematically studied, as the 1970 census was the first instance where the 40% measure was employed. Studying these trends, sociologist [[William Julius Wilson]] made the following discoveries regarding the decade of the 1970s:\n\n# Poverty increased dramatically throughout metropolitan areas of the United States.\n# The number of poor people residing within poor metropolitan areas increased\n# The exacerbation of poverty conditions primarily occurred within African-American neighborhoods.[[File:Wagner_Houses.jpg|alt=Wagner Houses|thumb|Robert F. Wagner public housing in [[East Harlem]], [[New York City]].]]\n\nSeveral other scholars later affirmed a dramatic increase in the number of neighborhoods classified as areas of concentrated poverty in the 1970s.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A. 1997. Poverty and place: Ghettos, barrios, and the American city. New York: Russell Sage Foundation.</ref> The increase of neighborhoods classified as areas of \"extreme poverty\" continued into the 1980s, albeit to a lesser extent.<ref>Mincy, Ronald B., and Susan J. Wiener. 1993. The underclass in the 1980s: Changing concepts, constant reality. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute.</ref> The same trends of concentrated poverty observed at the census tract and neighborhood levels were similarly observed at the [[Metropolitan statistical area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) level. Both decades between 1970-1990 saw a increased difference in poverty rates between central cities and their suburbs, reflecting an increasing spatial concentration of MSA poverty within central cities.<ref>Madden, J. 1996. \u201cChanges in the Distribution of Poverty Across and Within the U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1979-1989\u201d. Urban Studies 33,9:1581-1600.</ref> The changing spatial distribution of poverty has been attributed to the following:\n\n* Changes in the labor market due to deindustrialization, leading to a widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers and spatial mismatches between the types of jobs offered in cities and the type of workers residing within them.\n* Declining economic growth (several studies, however, demonstrate a weak or non-existent link between poverty reduction and urban economic growth in neighborhoods with extreme poverty).\n* Relocation of upper- and middle- income residents from cities to suburbs, alongside demographic changes such as the rise in one-parent households and a decrease in labor market participation.\n\nSuch changes were intertwined with [[Segregation in the United States|America's history of ethno-racial segregation]]. Some of its effects include white flight from American cities, leading to a declining tax base to provide city services, and the [[civil rights movement]], allowing better-off blacks to leave inner-city areas. While concentrated poverty between 1970-1990 increased among blacks, Hispanics, and whites, the most dramatic increases were observed among blacks, followed by [[Hispanic]]s, and to a much lesser extent whites.<ref>Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago.</ref>\n\n====1990 - 2000====\n\nIn the 1990s, the number of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined by 24%, or 2.5 million people. The steepest declines in high-poverty neighborhoods occurred in metropolitan areas in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Southern United States|South]], and the overall share of poor people living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined among all racial groups. The decline of the number of high-poverty neighborhoods occurred in rural areas and central cities, while suburbs experienced minimal change.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A. Stunning Progress, Hidden Problems: The Dramatic Decline of Concentrated Poverty in the 1990s. Living Cities Census Series, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Studies. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, May 2003.</ref> Scholars have also recognized qualitative shifts in areas of \"concentrated poverty.\" A study of Southern California's (a state which observed increases in concentrated poverty during the 1990s despite national downward trends) metropolitan areas by Wolch and Sessoms draws attention to the contrast between growing inner-suburban poverty and the original intention of the concentrated poverty statistic. These areas, which qualify as \"extreme poverty\" under the 40% threshold, do not demonstrate the negative social behaviors or physical decay of traditional images that the original statistic was designed to designate. Other scholars argued for an expansion of the definition, challenging Jargowsky's claim of decreasing poverty concentration in the 1990s. Using the relative definition of poverty employed in Europe, based on 50% of the median income in each region, Swanstrom et al. point to an ''increase'' in concentrated poverty throughout most American cities during the 1990s.<ref>Swanstrom, Todd; Rob Ryan; & Katherine M.

This poverty not only affected inner cities, but continued to spread into the suburbs, extending the [[suburbanization]] trend of concentrated poverty first noted in the 1990s. Furthermore, the study indicated that the concentrated poverty rates of 2010 was approaching an all-time high. In metro areas, concentrated poverty grew to 15.1%, a considerable increase from 11.7% between 2005-2009 and nearing the previous record of 16.5% from 1990. Such trend appears to confirm William Julius Wilson's original thesis, which states that extremely poor neighborhoods and their residents are the last to benefit from economic growth and the first to suffer from economic troubles.\n\n=== Concentrated poverty in Brazil ===\n{{See also|Favela}}\n[[File:Favela_-_panoramio.jpg|alt=|thumb|Favela neighborhood on the periphery of an urban area.]]\n{{See also|Income inequality in Brazil}}Despite its ranking as [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|one of the largest economies in the world]], Brazil continues facing deep socioeconomic inequality. According to a 2008 paper by Nathalie Beghin for [[Oxfam International]] employing data from the Institute for Applied Economic Research, 11.5% of its population was categorized as extremely poor, with an overall 30.3% (including the aforementioned 11.5%) classified as \"poor.\"<ref>Beghin, Nathalie. \u201cNotes on Inequality and Poverty in Brazil: Current Situation and Challenges .\u201d Oxfam International, 2008, doi:<nowiki>https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/112516/fp2p-bp-notes-inequality-poverty-brazil-current-140608-en.pdf</nowiki>.</ref> Beghin further states that Brazil's poverty rate is in some cases more than three times higher than that of comparable economies.

In a paper for the journal ''Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development'', researcher Tahire Erman explores the relationship between gecekondu residents and government intervention, revealing the residents' decreasing bargaining power. Primarily, the demographic makeup of gecekondus have led to varying levels of government attention to different neighborhoods. As the years progressed and Turkish politics shifted toward neoliberalism, neighborhoods grew increasingly divided, with the largest ramifications being a loss of collective bargaining power. Consequently, residents are more vulnerable to displacement and face increasing governmental neglect. Overall, gecekondu neighborhoods stand as examples of the negative effects inherent to and generated by concentrated poverty, with residents facing poor living conditions and socioeconomic and political barriers to integration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uzun|first=Bayram|last2=\u00c7ete|first2=Mehmet|last3=Palanc\u0131o\u011flu|first3=H.

Modeled after Chicago's [[Gautreaux Project|Gautreaux program]], which provided housing vouchers to black public housing residents so they could move to more integrated neighborhoods, MTO stands as an examle of \"mobility programs\" aimed at enabling poor families from high-poverty neighborhoods to move into communities featuring decreased poverty levels, such as middle-class neighborhoods.\n\nComparatively, the Gatreuax program exhibited stronger and clearer results than MTO.  The program assigned participants selected from the same pool of callers to random private apartment placements in either suburban or urban locations. Follow-ups several years later revealed different outcomes between suburban and urban participants. Namely, urban participants were more likely to have remained on welfare rolls while their suburban counterparts were very likely to find employment and leave welfare programs. Additionally, children of urban participants were likely to drop out of high school while suburban participants were likely to graduate from high school and proceed towards college. The children of both types of participants began below the average academic level of their peers, however due to the lower amount of participants selected for suburbs, suburban participants' children experience greater individual instruction. In turn, suburban children eventually reached the same level of academic proficiency as their average classmates.\n\nOn the other hand, participants of the MTO progam experienced non-significant changes in employment and educational improvement, with nearly half of all participants moving back or remaining in their original neighborhood. Most participants did not move into suburbs, instead moving more frequently into other nearby urban neighborhoods with lower poverty levels. The program did show significant improvements regarding the fostering of a sense of security among participants, resulting in the reduction of stress, fear, and depression, particularly among women and young girls.<ref>Briggs, Xavier de Souza, Susan J. Popkin, and John Goering. 2010. Moving to Opportunity: The Story of an American Experiment to Fight Ghetto Poverty. Oxford University Press, USA, March 31</ref>\n\nSeveral scholars have questioned both the success and broader ability of such policy interventions as an adequate response to concentrated poverty. Goetz argues that voluntary programs like MTO and Gautreaux, though justifiable on other grounds, will not make a dent in concentrated poverty for two reasons:\n\n# They primarily select families most likely to succeed in their new environments, essentially the \"cream of the crop.\"\n# They do not reach sufficient scales to noticeably affect overall settlement patterns.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/deconcentration.html</ref>\n\nMTO, Gautreaux and other voluntary mobility programs can apply to only a subset of the poor by the political reality of destination communities. Low-poverty areas are not anxious to receive large numbers of poor, public housing families, and there will typically be political backlash if current residents feel that these families are being forced into their neighborhoods, and it was this type of resistance that ended the expansion of the program in 1995. Venkatesh and Celimi point out, dispersal programs incorrectly assume the poor can relocate as easily as the middle class does. In fact, very real resource constraints limit the ability of public housing families to abandon existing support networks, and these constraints limit the attractiveness of dispersal strategies to poor families.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/chicago.html</ref>  Lastly, mobility programs have historically contributed to disadvantages for the current residents of neighborhoods where poor families have been relocated.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/deconcentration.html</ref>\n\n====Hope VI====\n\n[[HOPE VI|Hope VI]] is a federal housing plan designed to revitalize American public housing projects into [[Mixed Income Housing|mixed-income developments]]. In most cases, such projects involve demolishing older high rise buildings composed entirely of extremely low-income residents and constructing higher quality, low-density, housing with various tiers of income earners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fpublic_indian_housing%2Fprograms%2Fph%2Fhope6%2Fabout|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414211403/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fpublic_indian_housing%2Fprograms%2Fph%2Fhope6%2Fabout|archive-date=2012-04-14|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>\n\nWhile Hope VI has successfully de-concentrated public housing sites, it has done little to de-concentrate poverty within poor neighborhoods in general.<ref>Goetz, Edward G. 2003. Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America. Urban Inst Pr, May.</ref> Public housing families who are displaced and relocated typically re-concentrate in other poor neighborhoods nearby. Very rarely do these families relocate to low-poverty suburbs. Over half of families relocated by HOPE VI either move into other public housing or use vouchers to rent units on the private market. Public housing units are more likely to be in low-income neighborhoods. Families using vouchers are also likely to move into low-income areas, as they are more likely to find program-eligible units and landlords willing to rent to them.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/deconcentration.html</ref> Therefore, while HOPE VI has significantly improved the physical quality of several public housing sites and the lives of former residents given units in the new developments, it has come short of addressing the issue of concentrated poverty at large.<ref>http://www.urban.org/publications/411002.html</ref>\n\n= See also =\n\n* [[wikipedia:WikiProject International Development|WikiProject: International Development]]\n* [[Poverty|Main page on poverty]]\n* [[Accumulation by dispossession]]\n* [[Causes of poverty]]\n* [[Poverty trap]]\n* [[Extreme poverty]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Measurements and definitions of poverty]]\n[[Category:Social issues]]\n[[Category:Economic inequality]]\n", "text_old": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2019}}\n'''Concentrated poverty''' refers to a [[spatial density]] of socio-economic deprivation. In the US, it is commonly used in fields of policy and scholarship in reference to areas of \"[[Extreme poverty|extreme]]\" or \"high-poverty\" defined by the US census as areas with \"40 percent of the tract population living below the federal poverty threshold.\"<ref>Bureau of the Census. 1970. \u201cLow-Income Areas in Large Cities\u201d. Subject Report. U.S. Department of Commerce: Washington D.C.</ref>  A large body of literature argues that these areas of concentrated poverty place additional burdens on poor families that live within them, beyond what the families' own individual circumstances would dictate.  The research also indicates that areas of concentrated poverty can have wider effects on surrounding neighborhoods that are not classified as \"high-poverty,\" thus limiting overall [[economic potential]] and [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]].<ref>\u201cThe Enduring Challenge of Concentrated Poverty in America: Case Studies from Communities Across the U.S.\u201d, n.d., http://www.frbsf.org/cpreport/</ref>\n\n== History of concentrated poverty in the United States ==\n\nA long-standing issue, concentrated poverty creates distinct social problems, exacerbating individual [[Poverty|impoverishment]] and standing as the grounds of reform movements and studies since the mid-19th century. An analytical conception and measure for concentrated emerged in the United States around the 1970s, sparked by concern for its [[Inner city|inner cities]] following [[deindustrialization]], late-[[List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States#1960|1960s civil unrest]], rapid suburbanization, and subsequent out-migration. Most inner city areas of concentrated poverty contained predominantly minority populations, featuring expansive public housing developments. The Bureau of the Census developed the first definition of \"low-income areas\" as part of its work for the newly-established Office of Economic Opportunity, an organization designed to administer [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson']]<nowiki/>s [[War on poverty|War on Poverty]] programs, part of his [[Great Society]] legislative agenda. Overall, these programs were intended to identify major poverty concentrations within large metropolitan areas. An attribute-based criterion formed the original definition, with [[Census tract|census tracks]] ranked by the following:\n\n# Income\n# Average level of education\n# Number of single-parent households\n# Percentage of low-skilled workers\n# Quality of housing stock\n\nOf these, the lowest quartile were designated \"low income.\" Following the [[1970 United States Census|1970 census]], attribute-based measures were translated to purely statistical ones, defining \"low-income areas\" as census tracks with 20%-39% of inhabitants falling under the poverty line, and labeling areas with 40% or more impoverished inhabitants as \"high\" or \"extreme\" poverty. Calibration of household income statistics most closely approximating the 1960 census lower quartile lead to the adoption of the 20% threshold adopted in 1970. The 40% threshold designating \"high-poverty\" areas was set by doubling the low-income thershold, becoming the common definition of \"concentrated poverty\" in policy and scholarly research.\n\nPaul Jargowsky later developed an alternative measure for concentrated poverty, used more specifically for larger geographical areas. His rate expresses the proportion of all poor individuals in a certain area (e.g., city, metropolitan region, or county) who live in census tracts of high poverty.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A. 1997. Poverty and place: Ghettos, barrios, and the American city. New York: Russell Sage Foundation.</ref> Jargowsky further refined the concept of concentrated poverty to more specifically describe the \"proportion of the poor in some region city or region that resides in high-poverty neighborhoods,\" as opposed to a simple territorial designation of high-poverty neighborhoods.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A. Stunning Progress, Hidden Problems: The Dramatic Decline of Concentrated Poverty in the 1990s. Living Cities Census Series, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Studies. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, May 2003.</ref>\n\n[[William Julius Wilson]]'s book ''[[The Truly Disadvantaged|The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy]]'' was the first major scholarly work utilizing the census measure to study changing spatial trends in poverty, as well as its causes and effects.<ref>Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago.</ref> According to his findings, tracts of concentrated poverty increased dramatically throughout metropolitan areas of the United States during the 1970s, alongside the population of poor people residing within them. These trends related specifically to an African American \"[[underclass]]\" in America's inner cities (see trends below). In this work, Wilson utilizes concentrated poverty as an ''analytic measure'' to gauge the changing spatial organization and intensification of poverty, as a ''territorial category'' to designate an object of analysis, and also as a ''causal factor'' in and of itself, effecting life chances among the poor. All three conceptualizations have since served as the basis for a wide range of social science research, as well as policy interventions and prescriptions.\n\n====Analytic measure====\n\nWilson's study both set the precedent of using the census' 40% threshold and has been adopted as the standard measure for the study of poverty trends and poor neighborhoods. Its standardization is largely credited to the measure's convenience, as opposed to any conceptual justifications, and is employed to compare degrees of poverty concentration between areas, as well as the growth or decline in total number of tracts fitting such qualifications within a given city, region, or country.\n\nBoth the federal definition of poverty and the census definition of concentrated poverty (40% threshold) have received criticism. The overall discussion for both cases has labeled the use of bureaucratic categories intended to facilitate both the routine collection of statistics and public assistance eligibility as unfit for comprehensively capturing urban social structures and strategies. Many criticisms revolve around the [[poverty threshold]], the most prominent including the inability to fully consider the needs of different family types (e.g.: childcare services, health insurance, etc.), the non-cash benefits from public sources, the cash and non-cash resources (or lack thereof) from social and familial networks, and the consideration of regional variations in cost of living expenses.<ref>Madden, J. 1996. \u201cChanges in the Distribution of Poverty Across and Within the U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1979-1989\u201d. Urban Studies 33,9:1581-1600.</ref> Concurrently, the 40% benchmark used by the census and various scholars to define concentrated poverty does not refer to any adequately specific objective or subjective criteria. Jargowsky and Bane (1991) assert \u201c...that the 40 percent criterion came very close to identifying areas that looked like ghettos in terms of their housing conditions\u201d (p.&nbsp;239). They contend that \u201cthe areas selected by the 40 percent criterion corresponded closely with the neighborhoods that city officials and local Census Bureau officials considered ghettos\u201d (p.&nbsp;239). Thus, these scholars argued that although \u201cany fixed cutoff is inherently arbitrary...the 40 percent criterion appropriately identifies most ghetto neighborhoods\u201d (p.&nbsp;239). Here we observe the threshold's justification on the basis of general personal impressions and impressions of city officials rather than any rigorous objective criteria.<ref>Jargowsky, P. and Bane, M. 1991. \u201cGhetto Poverty in the United States, 1970 to 1980\u201d. in The Urban Underclass edited by Christopher Jencks and Paul E. Peterson. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution.</ref>\n\nIn addition to contentious debate regarding the selection of particular percentage thresholds as accurate descriptive measures (i.e. 30% vs. 60% threshold of residents in poverty), other scholars criticized the use of an absolute indicator of poverty concentration as an analytic measure and tool for trend tracking. In one instance, researchers Massey and Eggers contend that a relative, segragation-based indicator is more rigorous and meaningful, claiming that \". . .levels and trends in poverty concentration are best studied with well-established measures of segregation that use complete information on the spatial distribution of income instead of an ad hoc and arbitrary definition of 'poverty neighborhoods' and 'poverty concentration'\"<ref>Bol, Manute. and Eggers, M. 1990. \u201cThe Ecology of Inequality: Minorities and the Concentration of Poverty, 1970-1980\u201d.

Additionally, they are often reasonably clean, safe, well-maintained, and home to several commercial/retail establishments, public facilities, etc. They also argue that the term has become conflated with \"areas of social problems\" and argue that the concept should be unhooked from behavioral definitions and stigma.\n\n====Territorial category====\n\nAreas of concentrated poverty as a territorial category have become both key targets of place-specific policy interventions and the object of analysis for comparative studies within policy research and the [[social science]]s. Its use as a territorial category has also resulted in several critiques, beginning with the question of whether census tracts are good spatial categories for social-scientific analysis. Systematic field observations in various inner city areas reveal that census tracts serve as poor proxies of what residents construe and construct as neighborhoods in their daily routines.<ref>Sanchez-Jankowski, M. 2008. Cracks in the Pavement: Social Change and Resilience in Poor Neighborhoods. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>  Sociologist Loic Wacquant criticized the measure when used to denote or define [[Ghetto|\u201cghettos,\"]] a reference first made by Bane and Jargowsky and William Julius Wilson (see above). Scholars increasingly conflate areas of concentrated poverty and ghettos, something Wacquant claims camouflages the constitutive role of ethnoracial domination in the [[ghetto]] and [[Hyperghettoization|hyperghetto]]. According to Wacquant, this income-based notion of the ghetto is \"ostensibly deracialized\" and largely a product of policy-geared research fearful of the \"strict taboo that weighs on segregation in the political sphere\".<ref>Wacquant, L. 2011. \u201cA Janus-Faced Institution of Ethnoracial Closure: A Sociological Specification of the Ghetto.\u201d Pp. 1-31 in Ray Hutchison and Bruce Haynes (eds.), The Ghetto: Contemporary Global Issues and Controversies, Boulder, Westview, 201.</ref> Massey and Denton similarly question the use of a purely income-based measure to define areas of deprivation, showing strong empirical evidence and theorizing that high levels of racial segregation (defined by an [[index of dissimilarity]] above 60) produce distinct [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] constellations and processes.<ref>Massey, D., and Nancy Denton. 1993. American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.</ref> Additional questions by Wacquant include why rural communities and suburban tracts are often left out of social science analyses focusing on concentrated poverty.\n\n====Causal factor====\n\nConcentrated poverty is increasingly recognized as a \"causal factor\" in compounding the effects of poverty by isolating residents from networks and resources useful for realizing human potential (explored further in the effects section). William Julius Wilson coined these processes in ''The Truly Disadvantaged'' as \"concentration effects.\" He termed the primary effect \"social isolation\", defined as the lack of contact or sustained interaction with individuals and institutions representing mainstream society. This isolation makes it much more difficult for those looking for jobs to be tied into the job network, also generating behavior not conducive to good work histories. A key in Wilson's idea of social isolation is the linking of behavioral outcomes of the ghetto poor to the structural constraints of the job market and historical discrimination. This contradicts the theory of a \"culture of poverty,\" which stipulated that basic values and attitudes of the ghetto subculture have been internalized, placing a strong emphasis on the autonomous character of these cultural traits once they come into existence.<ref>Lewis, O. 1959. Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty. New York: Basic Books.</ref>\n\nMany scholars have called to question this causal framing. For Wilson, concentrated poverty stood as a link between structural factors and social behaviors produced through the \"concentration effects\" of poverty. Subsequent policy and scholarly research have ignored such causes. According to Agnew, \"one can start out using spatial concepts as shorthand for complex sociological processes but slip easily into substituting the spatial concepts for the more complex argument\".''<ref>Agnew J, 1993, \"Representing space, scale and culture in social science\", in Place/Culture/ Representation Eds J Duncan, D Ley (Routledge, New York) pp 251-271</ref>'' ''Steinberg has claimed that this amounts to misdiagnosing the symptom as the disease, as the structural factors are severed from the spatial outcome, policy prescriptions to address concentrated poverty have shifted from economic policies to encourage full-employment to simply deconcentrating poverty (see section below).<ref>Steinberg, S. (2010). The Myth of Concentrated Poverty. In The Integration Debate: Competing Futures for American Cities. Chester Hartman and Gregory Squires, eds. Pp.228\u2013301. New York: Routledge.</ref> As Goetz observed, \u201cOver time, focus has shifted away from the causes of concentrated poverty toward the behavior of the poor in response to concentrated poverty,\" which ultimately has led to reproducing the \"culture of poverty\" thesis in severing the theory from its structural roots.<ref>Goetz, E. (2003). Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute Press</ref>''\n\n==Causes==\nThis changing spatial distribution of poverty has been attributed to a number of structural factors, primarily in the economic sphere, and occurring since the 1970s.<ref>Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago.</ref> (From William Julius Wilson, ''The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy'').\n\n*[[Racial discrimination]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]]: Blacks were discriminated against far more severely in the early twentieth century than were the new white immigrants. Through restrictive covenants, municipal policies, and federal housing programs, blacks, unlike other immigrant groups, were forced into particular areas inner cities. At the same time blacks were discriminated far more severely than other groups in the labor market making them disproportionately poor and concentrated in low-paying jobs, particularly in the industrial sector. Collectively these forms of racial and spatial discrimination laid the basis for most areas of contemporary concentrated poverty.\n*[[Deindustrialization]]: As mentioned above, because blacks were concentrated in the low-wage sector of the economy due to discrimination and prejudice, they are more adversely affected by impersonal economic shifts in advanced industrial society. Their heavy concentration in the automobile, rubber, steel, and other smokestack industries meant that they were particularly hit hard by deindustrialization occurring in US cities from the 70s onward. In other words, minorities, particularly poor and working-class minorities, are not only adversely affected by periodic recessions, they are also vulnerable to the structural economic changes in the past two decades because of economic cutbacks, plant closings, and relocation of firms to cheaper labor sites in the suburbs.\n*Increasing gap between skilled and unskilled workers: Many of the new jobs that emerged in the post-1970s economy have been disproportionately in the service and knowledge sectors. These sectors are marked by large inequalities in wages, and has lowered the average income of households compared to those that had held better paying industrial jobs in the past (see [[Working Poor]])\n*[[Spatial mismatch]]: With the expansion of the suburbs, economic growth shifted from the inner cities to the suburbs. The inner city poor were largely cut off from taking advantage of these new opportunities due to their spatial distance.\n*[[White flight]]: A large scale migration of wealthier whites from the inner city occurred with the construction of the federal highway system and expansion of federal mortgage programs. These patterns were also driven by increased fears and anxieties of minority populations. This increased the proportion of both poor and black people in urban populations while eroding municipal tax bases, leading toward a downward spiral in the provision of public services as well as job opportunities and economic development.\n*Flight of the black middle class: As the civil rights movement ended racial restrictions on federal housing loans and programs, and opened up limited opportunities for black mobility, many of the better-off blacks in inner cities moved to mixed neighborhoods or satellite suburbs. This increased the proportion of poor within the ghetto and also weakened civic institutions and investment in the local economy.\n*Changes in the age structure: In the years concentrated poverty was increasing so was the proportion of African American youth in central cities. The number of central-city blacks aged fourteen to twenty-four rose by 78% from 1960\u20131970, compared with an increase of only 23% for whites of the same age. This younger demographic balance in minority neighborhoods contributes to rises in crime, out-of-wedlock birth, unemployment, and other factors associated with poverty.\n*Changes in family structure: In 1965, 25% of all black families were headed by women. The proportion surpassed 28% in 1970, reached 40 percent by 1979, registered at 43% in 1984, and 72% by 2010.<ref>http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Rankings.aspx?ind=107</ref> Because poverty is measured at the household level, rather than the individual, such demographic changes inevitably increase the poverty rate. Furthermore, several studies have shown that women, particularly, single-mothers are disproportionately poor to a number of factors (see [[Feminization of poverty|Feminization of Poverty]])\n\n==Effects==\nSeveral recent studies have pointed to the role of \"neighborhood effects\" caused by concentrated poverty. These studies have illustrated that crime and delinquency, education, psychological distress, and various health problems, among many other issues, are affected by neighborhood characteristics, particularly the concentration of poverty. Thresholds, or [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping points]], also prove important.<ref>http://www.huduser.org/portal/periodicals/em/winter11/highlight2.html</ref> In a recent review of research, Galster notes that studies suggest \u201cthat the independent impacts of neighborhood poverty rates in encouraging negative outcomes for individuals like crime, school leaving, and duration of poverty spells appear to be nil unless the neighborhood exceeds about 20 percent poverty, whereupon the externality effects grow rapidly until the neighborhood reaches approximately 40 percent poverty; subsequent increases in the poverty population appear to have no marginal effect.\u201d<ref>George C.

Using data from the 100 largest U.S. metro areas from 1990 to 2000, Galster ''et al.'' find little relationship between neighborhood poverty rates and decline in neighborhood housing values and rents until poverty exceeds 10 percent, at which point values decline rapidly before becoming shallower at very high poverty levels.<ref>\u201cThe Costs of Concentrated Poverty: Neighborhood Property Markets and the Dynamics of Decline.\u201d In Nicolas P. Retsinas and Eric S. Belsky, eds., Revisiting Rental Housing: Policies, Programs, and Priorities. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 116\u20139.</ref>\n\nOne of the largest studies examining the effects of concentrated poverty was completed by the Pew Economic Mobility Project which tracked 5,000 families since 1968 and found that no other factor, including parents' education, employment, or marital status, was as important as neighborhood poverty in explaining why African-American children were so much more likely to have lower incomes than their parents as adults.<ref>Sharkey, Patrick (2009, July) \u201cNeighborhoods and the Black-White Mobility Gap,\u201d Washington, DC: The Economic Mobility Project, The Pew Charitable Trusts.</ref> Thus, the concentrated poverty rate aims to capture the extent of a possible \u201cdouble burden\u201d imposed on poor families living in extremely poor communities; both being poor and living in a poor community. The study also found negative effects on the better-off children raised in such areas, as well. While initial research failed to isolate the direct effects of \"concentrated poverty\" in and of itself, more recent work has shifted to identifying the mechanisms that matter. Rather than focusing solely on the socio-economic characteristics of neighborhoods, this scholarship to examining the social-interactive and institutional aspects produced through concentrated poverty. Below is an overview of these effects and mechanisms.<ref>Robert J. Sampson, Jeffrey D. Morenoff, and Thomas Gannon-Rowley. 2002. \u201cAssessing \u2018Neighborhood Effects\u2019: Social Processes and New Directions in Research,\u201d Annual Review of Sociology 28: 466.</ref><ref>George C.

Galster, \"The Mechanism(s) of Neighborhood Effects: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications\").\n\n====Social interactive effects====\n\nThis set of mechanisms refers to social processes endogenous to neighborhoods. These processes include:\n* Social contagion: Behaviors, aspirations, and attitudes may be changed by contact with peers who are neighbors. Under certain conditions these changes can take on contagion dynamics that are akin to \u201cepidemics.\u201d\n* Collective socialization: Individuals may be encouraged to conform to local social norms conveyed by neighborhood role models and other social pressures. This socialization effect is characterized by a minimum threshold or critical mass being achieved before a norm can produce noticeable consequences for others in the neighborhood.\n* Social networks: Individuals may be influenced by the interpersonal communication of information and resources of various kinds transmitted through neighbors. These networks can involve either \u201cstrong ties\u201d and/or \u201cweak ties.\u201d\n* Social cohesion and control: The degree of neighborhood social disorder and its converse, \u201ccollective efficacy\" may influence a variety of behaviors and psychological reactions of residents.\n* [[Relative deprivation]]: This mechanism suggests that residents who have achieved some socioeconomic success will be a source of disamenities for their less-well off neighbors. The latter, it is argued, will view the successful with envy and/or will make them perceive their own relative inferiority as a source of dissatisfaction.\n* Parental mediation: The neighborhood may affect (through any of the mechanisms listed under all categories here) parents\u2019 physical and mental health, stress, coping skills, sense of efficacy, behaviors, and material resources. All of these, in turn, may affect the home environment in which children are raised.\n\n====Environmental effects====\n\nEnvironmental mechanisms refer to natural and human-made attributes of the local space that may affect directly the mental and/or physical health of residents without affecting their behaviors. As in the case of social-interactive mechanism, the environmental category can also assume distinct forms:\n* Exposure to violence: If people sense that their property or person is in danger they may suffer psychological and physical responses that may impair their functioning or sensed well-being. These consequences are likely to be even more pronounced if the person has been victimized.\n* Physical surroundings: Decayed physical conditions of the built environment (e.g., deteriorated structures and public infrastructure, litter, graffiti) may impart psychological effects on residents,\n\n====Geographical effects====\n\nGeographic mechanisms refer to aspects of spaces that may affect residents\u2019 life courses yet do not arise within the neighborhood but rather purely because of the neighborhood\u2019s location relative to larger-scale political and economic forces such as:\n* Spatial mismatch: Certain neighborhoods may have little accessibility (in either spatial proximity or as mediated by transportation networks) to job opportunities appropriate to the skills of their residents, thereby restricting their employment opportunities.\n* Public services: Some neighborhoods may be located within local political jurisdictions that offer inferior public services and facilities because of their limited tax base resources, incompetence, corruption, or other operational challenges. These, in turn, may adversely affect the personal development and educational opportunities of residents.\n\n====Institutional effects====\n\nThe last category of mechanisms involves actions by those typically not residing in the given neighborhood who control important institutional resources located there and/or points of interface between neighborhood residents and vital markets:\n* Stigmatization: Neighborhoods may be stigmatized on the basis of public stereotypes held by powerful institutional or private actors about its current residents. In other cases this may occur regardless of the neighborhood\u2019s current population because of its history, environmental or topographical disamenities, style, scale and type of dwellings, or condition of their commercial districts and public spaces. Such stigma may reduce the opportunities and perceptions of residents of stigmatized areas in a variety of ways, such as job opportunities and self-esteem.\n* Local institutional resources: Some neighborhoods may have access to few and/or high-quality private, non-profit, or public institutions and organizations, such as benevolent charities, day care facilities, schools, and medical clinics. The lack of same may adversely affect the personal development opportunities of residents.\n* Local market actors: There may be substantial spatial variations in the prevalence of certain private market actors that may encourage or discourage certain behaviors by neighborhood residents, such as liquor stores, fresh food markets, fast food restaurants, and illegal drug markets.\n\n==Regional examples==\nConcentrated poverty is a global phenomenon, with examples visible in both [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]]. According to the [[Brookings Institution]], post-industrial revolution growth has spread unevenly between and within countries, with many developing countries likely to still have regional examples of extreme poverty.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2019/09/24/the-geography-of-poverty-hotspots/|title=The geography of poverty hotspots|last=Kharas|first=Jennifer L.

It was not until after the release of the 1980 census, however, that trends of poverty concentration were systematically studied, as the 1970 census was the first instance where the 40% measure was employed. Studying these trends, sociologist [[William Julius Wilson]] made the following discoveries regarding the decade of the 1970s:\n\n# Poverty increased dramatically throughout metropolitan areas of the United States.\n# The number of poor people residing within poor metropolitan areas increased\n# The exacerbation of poverty conditions primarily occurred within African-American neighborhoods.[[File:Wagner_Houses.jpg|alt=Wagner Houses|thumb|Robert F. Wagner public housing in [[East Harlem]], [[New York City]].]]\n\nSeveral other scholars later affirmed a dramatic increase in the number of neighborhoods classified as areas of concentrated poverty in the 1970s.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A. 1997. Poverty and place: Ghettos, barrios, and the American city. New York: Russell Sage Foundation.</ref> The increase of neighborhoods classified as areas of \"extreme poverty\" continued into the 1980s, albeit to a lesser extent.<ref>Mincy, Ronald B., and Susan J. Wiener. 1993. The underclass in the 1980s: Changing concepts, constant reality. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute.</ref> The same trends of concentrated poverty observed at the census tract and neighborhood levels were similarly observed at the [[Metropolitan statistical area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) level. Both decades between 1970-1990 saw a increased difference in poverty rates between central cities and their suburbs, reflecting an increasing spatial concentration of MSA poverty within central cities.<ref>Madden, J. 1996. \u201cChanges in the Distribution of Poverty Across and Within the U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1979-1989\u201d. Urban Studies 33,9:1581-1600.</ref> The changing spatial distribution of poverty has been attributed to the following:\n\n* Changes in the labor market due to deindustrialization, leading to a widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers and spatial mismatches between the types of jobs offered in cities and the type of workers residing within them.\n* Declining economic growth (several studies, however, demonstrate a weak or non-existent link between poverty reduction and urban economic growth in neighborhoods with extreme poverty).\n* Relocation of upper- and middle- income residents from cities to suburbs, alongside demographic changes such as the rise in one-parent households and a decrease in labor market participation.\n\nSuch changes were intertwined with [[Segregation in the United States|America's history of ethno-racial segregation]]. Some of its effects include white flight from American cities, leading to a declining tax base to provide city services, and the [[civil rights movement]], allowing better-off blacks to leave inner-city areas. While concentrated poverty between 1970-1990 increased among blacks, Hispanics, and whites, the most dramatic increases were observed among blacks, followed by [[Hispanic]]s, and to a much lesser extent whites.<ref>Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago.</ref>\n\n====1990 - 2000====\n\nIn the 1990s, the number of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined by 24%, or 2.5 million people. The steepest declines in high-poverty neighborhoods occurred in metropolitan areas in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Southern United States|South]], and the overall share of poor people living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined among all racial groups. The decline of the number of high-poverty neighborhoods occurred in rural areas and central cities, while suburbs experienced minimal change.<ref>Jargowsky, Paul A.

These areas, which qualify as \"extreme poverty\" under the 40% threshold, do not demonstrate the negative social behaviors or physical decay of traditional images that the original statistic was designed to designate. Other scholars argued for an expansion of the definition, challenging Jargowsky's claim of decreasing poverty concentration in the 1990s. Using the relative definition of poverty employed in Europe, based on 50% of the median income in each region, Swanstrom et al. point to an ''increase'' in concentrated poverty throughout most American cities during the 1990s.<ref>Swanstrom, Todd; Rob Ryan; & Katherine M.

This poverty not only affected inner cities, but continued to spread into the suburbs, extending the [[suburbanization]] trend of concentrated poverty first noted in the 1990s. Furthermore, the study indicated that the concentrated poverty rates of 2010 was approaching an all-time high. In metro areas, concentrated poverty grew to 15.1%, a considerable increase from 11.7% between 2005-2009 and nearing the previous record of 16.5% from 1990. Such trend appears to confirm William Julius Wilson's original thesis, which states that extremely poor neighborhoods and their residents are the last to benefit from economic growth and the first to suffer from economic troubles.\n\n=== Concentrated poverty in Brazil ===\n{{See also|Favela}}\n[[File:Favela_-_panoramio.jpg|alt=|thumb|Favela neighborhood on the periphery of an urban area.]]\n{{See also|Income inequality in Brazil}}Despite its ranking as [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|one of the largest economies in the world]], Brazil continues facing deep socioeconomic inequality. According to a 2008 paper by Nathalie Beghin for [[Oxfam International]] employing data from the Institute for Applied Economic Research, 11.5% of its population was categorized as extremely poor, with an overall 30.3% (including the aforementioned 11.5%) classified as \"poor.\"<ref>Beghin, Nathalie. \u201cNotes on Inequality and Poverty in Brazil: Current Situation and Challenges .\u201d Oxfam International, 2008, doi:<nowiki>https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/112516/fp2p-bp-notes-inequality-poverty-brazil-current-140608-en.pdf</nowiki>.</ref> Beghin further states that Brazil's poverty rate is in some cases more than three times higher than that of comparable economies. Such economic situation in turn confines poor people to areas with large spatial concentrations of poverty, such as the infamous [[Favela]]s, neighborhoods with few access to government services, high crime, and poor living conditions. According to a [[descriptive study]] by Brueckner et al. for the [[Journal of Housing Economics]], significant rural to urban migration in the second half of the 1900s led to unprecedented metropolitan population growth.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Brueckner|first=Jan K.|last2=Mation|first2=Lucas|last3=Nadalin|first3=Vanessa G.|date=2019-06-01|title=Slums in Brazil: Where are they located, who lives in them, and do they 'squeeze' the formal housing market?|journal=Journal of Housing Economics|language=en|volume=44|pages=48\u201360|doi=10.1016/j.jhe.2019.02.003|issn=1051-1377}}</ref> Given the rapid influx of often-poor migrants, as well as insufficient housing, slums developed along the edges of cities.

As more residents settle into urban centers, the concentration of poverty increases while resources become increasingly scarce. Gecekondu residents face additional hardships due to the questionable legality of their housing: as gecekondus are traditionally built through [[Loophole|legal loopholes]], avoiding costs associated with formal land use, residents may encounter a problematic relationship with government entities. In a paper for the journal ''Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development'', researcher Tahire Erman explores the relationship between gecekondu residents and government intervention, revealing the residents' decreasing bargaining power. Primarily, the demographic makeup of gecekondus have led to varying levels of government attention to different neighborhoods. As the years progressed and Turkish politics shifted toward neoliberalism, neighborhoods grew increasingly divided, with the largest ramifications being a loss of collective bargaining power. Consequently, residents are more vulnerable to displacement and face increasing governmental neglect. Overall, gecekondu neighborhoods stand as examples of the negative effects inherent to and generated by concentrated poverty, with residents facing poor living conditions and socioeconomic and political barriers to integration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uzun|first=Bayram|last2=\u00c7ete|first2=Mehmet|last3=Palanc\u0131o\u011flu|first3=H.

Modeled after Chicago's [[Gautreaux Project|Gautreaux program]], which provided housing vouchers to black public housing residents so they could move to more integrated neighborhoods, MTO stands as an examle of \"mobility programs\" aimed at enabling poor families from high-poverty neighborhoods to move into communities featuring decreased poverty levels, such as middle-class neighborhoods.\n\nComparatively, the Gatreuax program exhibited stronger and clearer results than MTO.  The program assigned participants selected from the same pool of callers to random private apartment placements in either suburban or urban locations. Follow-ups several years later revealed different outcomes between suburban and urban participants. Namely, urban participants were more likely to have remained on welfare rolls while their suburban counterparts were very likely to find employment and leave welfare programs. Additionally, children of urban participants were likely to drop out of high school while suburban participants were likely to graduate from high school and proceed towards college. The children of both types of participants began below the average academic level of their peers, however due to the lower amount of participants selected for suburbs, suburban participants' children experience greater individual instruction. In turn, suburban children eventually reached the same level of academic proficiency as their average classmates.\n\nOn the other hand, participants of the the MTO progam experienced non-significant changes in employment and educational improvement, with nearly half of all participants moving back or remaining in their original neighborhood. Most participants did not move into suburbs, instead moving more frequently into other nearby urban neighborhoods with lower poverty levels. The program did show significant improvements regarding the fostering of a sense of security among participants, resulting in the reduction of stress, fear, and depression, particularly among women and young girls.<ref>Briggs, Xavier de Souza, Susan J. Popkin, and John Goering. 2010. Moving to Opportunity: The Story of an American Experiment to Fight Ghetto Poverty. Oxford University Press, USA, March 31</ref>\n\nSeveral scholars have questioned both the success and broader ability of such policy interventions as an adequate response to concentrated poverty. Goetz argues that voluntary programs like MTO and Gautreaux, though justifiable on other grounds, will not make a dent in concentrated poverty for two reasons:\n\n# They primarily select families most likely to succeed in their new environments, essentially the \"cream of the crop.\"\n# They do not reach sufficient scales to noticeably affect overall settlement patterns.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/deconcentration.html</ref>\n\nMTO, Gautreaux and other voluntary mobility programs can apply to only a subset of the poor by the political reality of destination communities. Low-poverty areas are not anxious to receive large numbers of poor, public housing families, and there will typically be political backlash if current residents feel that these families are being forced into their neighborhoods, and it was this type of resistance that ended the expansion of the program in 1995. Venkatesh and Celimi point out, dispersal programs incorrectly assume the poor can relocate as easily as the middle class does. In fact, very real resource constraints limit the ability of public housing families to abandon existing support networks, and these constraints limit the attractiveness of dispersal strategies to poor families.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/chicago.html</ref>  Lastly, mobility programs have historically contributed to disadvantages for the current residents of neighborhoods where poor families have been relocated.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/deconcentration.html</ref>\n\n====Hope VI====\n\n[[HOPE VI|Hope VI]] is a federal housing plan designed to revitalize American public housing projects into [[Mixed Income Housing|mixed-income developments]]. In most cases, such projects involve demolishing older high rise buildings composed entirely of extremely low-income residents and constructing higher quality, low-density, housing with various tiers of income earners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fpublic_indian_housing%2Fprograms%2Fph%2Fhope6%2Fabout|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414211403/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fpublic_indian_housing%2Fprograms%2Fph%2Fhope6%2Fabout|archive-date=2012-04-14|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>\n\nWhile Hope VI has successfully de-concentrated public housing sites, it has done little to de-concentrate poverty within poor neighborhoods in general.<ref>Goetz, Edward G. 2003. Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America. Urban Inst Pr, May.</ref> Public housing families who are displaced and relocated typically re-concentrate in other poor neighborhoods nearby. Very rarely do these families relocate to low-poverty suburbs. Over half of families relocated by HOPE VI either move into other public housing or use vouchers to rent units on the private market. Public housing units are more likely to be in low-income neighborhoods. Families using vouchers are also likely to move into low-income areas, as they are more likely to find program-eligible units and landlords willing to rent to them.<ref>http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/138/deconcentration.html</ref> Therefore, while HOPE VI has significantly improved the physical quality of several public housing sites and the lives of former residents given units in the new developments, it has come short of addressing the issue of concentrated poverty at large.<ref>http://www.urban.org/publications/411002.html</ref>\n\n= See also =\n\n* [[wikipedia:WikiProject International Development|WikiProject: International Development]]\n* [[Poverty|Main page on poverty]]\n* [[Accumulation by dispossession]]\n* [[Causes of poverty]]\n* [[Poverty trap]]\n* [[Extreme poverty]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Measurements and definitions of poverty]]\n[[Category:Social issues]]\n[[Category:Economic inequality]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_poverty"}

Mantises are distributed worldwide in [[Temperate climate|temperate]] and [[Tropics|tropical]] habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name '''praying mantis'''.\n\nThe closest relatives of mantises are the [[termite]]s and [[cockroach]]es ([[Blattodea]]), which are all within the [[superorder]] [[Dictyoptera]]. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects ([[Phasmatodea]]), other elongated insects such as [[grasshopper]]s ([[Orthoptera]]), or other unrelated insects with [[raptorial]] forelegs such as mantisflies ([[Mantispidae]]). Mantises are mostly [[ambush predator]]s, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice [[sexual cannibalism]], eating their mates after copulation.\n\nMantises were considered to have [[Supernatural|supernatural powers]] by early civilizations, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]], and [[Assyria]].

The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing ([[deimatic]]) [[threat display]], some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.<ref name=Prete282 /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yager |first1=D. |last2=May |first2=M. |year=1993 |title=Coming in on a wing and an ear |journal=Natural History |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=28\u201333}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/11/1119_021119_TVbats_2.html |title=Praying Mantis Uses Ultrasonic Hearing to Dodge Bats |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMantises, like [[stick insect]]s, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of [[crypsis]] by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Dea, J.

He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by [[gland]]s in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an [[ootheca]]. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground.<ref name=\"Ene 1964\" /> Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of [[parasitoid wasp]]s.

For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3\u20134 weeks as opposed to 4\u20136 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it [[ecdysis|molts]] its [[exoskeleton]]. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous (\"short-winged\"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4\u20138 weeks, while larger species may live 4\u20136 months.<ref name=\"Prete1999\">{{cite book |editor1=Prete, Fredrick R. |editor2=Wells, Harrington |editor3=Wells, Patrick H. |editor4=Hurd, Lawrence E. |title=The Praying Mantids |contribution=Ecology of Praying Mantids |author=Hurd, I.

Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a [[ganglion]] in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ''[[ad libitum]]'' (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed.

This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females.

The largest family is the [[Mantidae]] (\"mantids\"<!--{{efn|\"Mantid\" was once almost a synonym for Mantodea, given that few species outside the Mantidae were known; that has changed with recent discoveries.}}-->). Mantises are distributed worldwide in [[Temperate climate|temperate]] and [[Tropics|tropical]] habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name '''praying mantis'''.\n\nThe closest relatives of mantises are the [[termite]]s and [[cockroach]]es ([[Blattodea]]), which are all within the [[superorder]] [[Dictyoptera]]. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects ([[Phasmatodea]]), other elongated insects such as [[grasshopper]]s ([[Orthoptera]]), or other unrelated insects with [[raptorial]] forelegs such as mantisflies ([[Mantispidae]]). Mantises are mostly [[ambush predator]]s, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice [[sexual cannibalism]], eating their mates after copulation.\n\nMantises were considered to have [[Supernatural|supernatural powers]] by early civilizations, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]], and [[Assyria]]. A cultural [[trope (literature)|trope]] popular in [[cartoon]]s imagines the female mantis as a ''[[femme fatale]]''. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as [[pet]]s.\n\n== Taxonomy and evolution ==\n{{See also|List of mantis genera and species}}\n\n[[File:Mantis at Marrickville.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Green mantis at backyard in Sydney, 2020]]\n\nOver 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mantodea.speciesfile.org/HomePage.aspx |title=Mantodea Species File Online |first1=Daniel |last1=Otte |first2=Lauren |last2=Spearman |accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> They are predominantly found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas.<ref name=\"Prete1999\" /><ref>{{cite book |editor1=Prete, Fredrick R. |editor2=Wells, Harrington |editor3=Wells, Patrick H. |editor4=Hurd, Lawrence E. |title=The Praying Mantids |contribution=Mantid in Ecological Research |author=Hurd, I.

For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3\u20134 weeks as opposed to 4\u20136 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it [[ecdysis|molts]] its [[exoskeleton]]. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous (\"short-winged\"), particularly in the female sex.

Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a [[ganglion]] in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists.

Located at the junction of the [[Colorado Plateau]], [[Great Basin]], and [[Mojave Desert]] regions, the park has a unique [[geography]] and a variety of [[life zone]]s that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of [[bat]]), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: [[desert]], [[Riparian zone|riparian]], [[woodland]], and [[Pinophyta|coniferous forest]].

Together, these formations represent about 150&nbsp;million years of mostly [[Mesozoic]]-aged [[sedimentation]] in that part of North America. The formations exposed in the Zion area were deposited as [[sediment]] in very different environments:\n* The warm, shallow (sometimes advancing or retreating) [[sea]] of the [[Kaibab Limestone|Kaibab]] and [[Moenkopi formation]]s;\n* [[Stream]]s, [[pond]]s, and [[lake]]s of the [[Chinle Formation|Chinle]], [[Moenave Formation|Moenave]], and [[Kayenta formation]]s;\n* The vast [[desert]] of the Navajo and [[Temple Cap formation]]s; and\n* The dry near-shore environment of the Carmel Formation.\n\n[[File:Kolob Canyons midway through Kolob Canyons Road.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kolob Canyons]] are a set of finger canyons cut into the Kolob Plateau]]\nUplift affected the entire region, known as the [[Colorado Plateau]]s, by slowly raising these formations more than {{convert|10000|ft|m}} higher than where they were deposited.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p461\">{{harvnb|Kiver|1999|p=461}}</ref> This steepened the [[stream gradient]] of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau.\n\nThe faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all [[Cenozoic]]-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, [[lava]] flows and [[cinder cone]]s covered parts of the area.<ref name=\"Harris1997p42\">{{harvnb|Harris|1997|p=42}}</ref>\n\nHigh water volume in wet seasons does most of the [[downcutting]] in the main canyon. These [[flood]] events are responsible for transporting most of the 3&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[short ton|short&nbsp;tons]] (2.7&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[tonne|metric&nbsp;tons]]) of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly.<ref name=\"Harris1997p29\"/> The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its [[tributary|tributaries]] can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in [[waterfall]]s from [[hanging valley]]s where they meet the Virgin.<ref name=\"Harris1997p29\"/> The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.\n\n{| border=\"1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| width=\"14%\" rowspan=\"10\" |\n|+ '''Table of formations exposed in Zion National Park'''<ref>{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www2.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/zion/#geology\n |author      = NPS contributors\n |title       = Geology Fieldnotes: Zion National Park\n |location    = Washington, D.C.\n |publisher   = National Park Service\n |accessdate  = January 1, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211002934/http://www2.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/zion/#geology\n |archivedate = December 11, 2007\n |df          = mdy-all\n}} (public domain text and table)</ref>\n| width=\"14%\" | {{small|'''Rock layer'''}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|'''Appearance'''}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|'''Location'''}}\n| width=\"16%\" | {{small|'''Deposition'''}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|'''Rock type'''}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|'''Photo'''}}\n|-\n| width=\"14%\" | {{small|Dakota Formation}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|Cliffs}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|Top of Horse Ranch Mountain}}\n| width=\"16%\" | {{small|Streams}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|Conglomerate and sandstone}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|'''[[File:Dakota Sandstone.jpg|80px|[[Dakota Sandstone]]]]'''}}\n|-\n| width=\"14%\" | {{small|Carmel Formation}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|Cliffs}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|[[Mount Carmel Junction, Utah|Mount Carmel Junction]]}}\n| width=\"16%\" | {{small|Shallow sea and coastal desert}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|Limestone, sandstone and gypsum}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|'''[[File:Carmel Formation.jpg|80px|[[Carmel Formation]]]]'''}}\n|-\n| width=\"14%\" | {{small|Temple Cap Formation}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|Cliffs}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|Top of West Temple}}\n| width=\"16%\" | {{small|Desert}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|Sandstone}}\n| width=\"36%\" | {{small|'''[[File:Temple Cap Formation atop Navajo Sandstone.jpg|80px|[[Temple Cap Formation]] atop Navajo Sandstone]]'''}}\n|-\n| width=\"14%\" | {{small|Navajo Sandstone}}\n| width=\"17%\" | {{small|Steep cliffs 1,600 to 2,200&nbsp;ft (490 to 670&nbsp;m) thick;

A prominent feature of the {{convert|229|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} park is [[Zion Canyon]], which is {{convert|15|mi|km}} long and up to {{convert|2640|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored [[Navajo Sandstone]] eroded by the North Fork of the [[Virgin River]]. The lowest point in the park is {{convert|3666|ft|m|abbr=on}} at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is {{convert|8726|ft|m|abbr=on}} at [[Horse Ranch Mountain]]. Located at the junction of the [[Colorado Plateau]], [[Great Basin]], and [[Mojave Desert]] regions, the park has a unique [[geography]] and a variety of [[life zone]]s that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of [[bat]]), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: [[desert]], [[Riparian zone|riparian]], [[woodland]], and [[Pinophyta|coniferous forest]]. Zion National Park includes [[mountain]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[butte]]s, [[mesa]]s, [[monolith]]s, [[river]]s, [[slot canyon]]s, and [[natural arch]]es.\n\nHuman habitation of the area started about 8,000&nbsp;years ago with small family groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], one of which was the semi-nomadic [[Basketmaker culture|Basketmaker]] [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]] ({{circa}}&nbsp;300 CE).

The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions.  The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long-duration wildfires \u2013 capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12\u201318 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.\n\nIn 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.\n\nThe demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2\u20134 billion annually on wildfire suppression.\n\n==Suppression==\n{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}\n{{See also|Firefighting}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 733844 Forest fires ravaging near Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|A Russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire]]\nWildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs.

The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[formaldehyde]], as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[silica]]. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.<ref name = niosh-blog/>\n\nFirefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks.

Using [[computational science]], wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including wind speed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and [[Huygens' Principle]] to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.<ref>G.D.

Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemicals]] at close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5\u201310% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants (a combination of particulate matter 3.5 \u00b5m and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehyde) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Reinhardt|first2=T.E.|last3=Quiring|first3=S.J.|last4=Ottmar|first4=R.D.|year=2004|title=A screening-level assessment of the health risks of chronic smoke exposure for wildland firefighters|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=1|issue=5|pages=296\u2013305|doi=10.1080/15459620490442500|pmid=15238338|last1=Booze|first1=T.F.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530185250/https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2017|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.5076}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2001 and 2012, over 200 [[Occupational fatality|fatalities]] occurred among wildland firefighters.

For this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters. CO in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. At high concentrations, it can cause headaches, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma, and even death. However, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia.<ref name=\"oehha.ca.gov\"/>  A recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990\u20132006 found that 21.9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Wildfire Coordinating Group|date=June 2007|title=Wildland firefighter fatalities in the United States 1990\u20132006|publisher=NWCG Safety and Health Working Team|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315081248/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders.

In Canada and northwest China, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and land-conversion burning. In China and in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhihua|last2=Yang|first2=Jian|last3=Chang|first3=Yu|last4=Weisberg|first4=Peter J.|last5=He|first5=Hong S.|date=June 2012|title=Spatial patterns and drivers of fire occurrence and its future trend under climate change in a boreal forest of Northeast China|journal=Global Change Biology|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=2041\u20132056|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02649.x|issn=1354-1013|bibcode=2012GCBio..18.2041L}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=de Rigo|first=Daniele|last2=Libert\u00e0|first2=Giorgio|last3=Houston Durrant|first3=Tracy|last4=Art\u00e9s Vivancos|first4=Tom\u00e0s|last5=San-Miguel-Ayanz|first5=Jes\u00fas|title=Forest fire danger extremes in Europe under climate change: variability and uncertainty|page=71|date=2017|publisher=Publication Office of the European Union|location=Luxembourg|isbn=978-92-79-77046-3|doi=10.2760/13180}}</ref> In the United States and Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities (such as machinery sparks, cast-away cigarette butts, or [[arson]]).<ref name=\"Krock\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|title=The World on Fire|last=Krock|first=Lexi|date=June 2002|publisher=NOVA online \u2013 Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=13 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027041902/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|archivedate=27 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balch|first=Jennifer K.|last2=Bradley|first2=Bethany A.|last3=Abatzoglou|first3=John T.|last4=Nagy|first4=R.

These emissions affect radiation, clouds, and climate on regional and even global scales. Wildfires also emit substantial amounts of volatile and semi-volatile organic materials and nitrogen oxides that form ozone and organic particulate matter. Direct emissions of toxic pollutants can affect first responders and local residents. In addition, the formation of the other pollutants as the air is transported can lead to harmful exposures for populations in regions far away from the wildfires. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/factsheets/csdWildfiresFIREX.pdf|title=The Impact of Wildfires on Climate and Air Quality|last=|first=|date=|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n{{Main|Fire ecology}}\n{{See also|Disturbance (ecology)|Forestry}}\n[[File:Global Fires - August and February 2008.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|alt=Two illustrations of the earth, one above the other.

The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions.  The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long-duration wildfires \u2013 capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12\u201318 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.\n\nIn 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.\n\nThe demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2\u20134 billion annually on wildfire suppression.\n\n==Suppression==\n{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}\n{{See also|Firefighting}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 733844 Forest fires ravaging near Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|A Russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire]]\nWildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs.

A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]] in [[Montana]], USA, thirteen [[smokejumper]]s died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | title = General Technical Report INT-GTR-299 \u2013 Mann Gulch Fire: A Race That Couldn't Be Won | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station | date = May 1993 | last = Rothermel | first = Richard C. | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813122911/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In the Australian [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires]], at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.<ref name=\"homeslost\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|title=Victorian Bushfires|date=13 March 2009|publisher=New South Wales Government|work=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=26 January 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227231203/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|archivedate=27 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Costs of wildfire suppression ===\nIn California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|title=Region 5 \u2013 Land & Resource Management|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-08-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823005834/http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|archivedate=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Wildland firefighting safety ===\n[[File:Wildfire fighter.jpg|thumb|right|Wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw]]\n[[File:Wildland Firefighter.jpg|thumb|Wildland firefighter working a brush fire in [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire|Hopkinton]], New Hampshire]]\nWildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including [[heat stress]], [[fatigue (safety)|fatigue]], [[smoke]] and [[dust]], as well as the risk of other injuries such as [[burn]]s, [[wound|cuts]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|scrapes]], [[animal bites]], and even [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=niosh-blog>{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting Safety and Health|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|work=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=6 August 2012|first=Corey|last=Campbell|author2=Liz Dalsey|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809023909/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|archivedate=9 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Hot Tips from NIOSH\">{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030104/http://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014}}</ref> Between 2000\u20132016, more than 350&nbsp;wildland firefighters died on-duty.<ref name=\"NIOSH Wildland Firefighting default page\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/default.html |title=CDC \u2013 Fighting Wildfires \u2013 NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |date=31 May 2018 |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |language=en-us |access-date=2018-11-27 |quote=Between 2000\u20132016, based on data compiled in the NIOSH Wildland Fire Fighter On-Duty Death Surveillance System from three data sources, over 350 on-duty WFF fatalities occurred.}}</ref>\n\nEspecially in hot weather conditions, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or [[heat stroke]]. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and [[Physical fitness|fitness]], dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome [[personal protective equipment]]. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.<ref name = niosh-blog/>\n\nSmoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland firefighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[formaldehyde]], as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[silica]]. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.<ref name = niosh-blog/>\n\nFirefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Firefighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems.<ref name = niosh-blog/> Other injury hazards wildland firefighters face include slips, trips, falls, burns, scrapes, and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures.<ref name = niosh-blog/>\n\n====Firefighter safety zone guidelines====\nThe U.S. Forest Service publishes guidelines for the minimum distance a firefighter should be from a flame.<ref>[https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2009_butler_b001.pdf | US Forest Service | Efforts To Update Firefighter Safety Zone Guidelines]</ref>\n\n===Fire retardants===\nFire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion.

Using [[computational science]], wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including wind speed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and [[Huygens' Principle]] to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.<ref>G.D.

Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemicals]] at close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5\u201310% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants (a combination of particulate matter 3.5 \u00b5m and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehyde) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10.

They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. &nbsp;Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation.
