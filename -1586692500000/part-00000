The sophons have also blocked all further research into particle physics, thus stopping any further human scientific development of fundamental principles, leaving only recombination and elaboration of existing technologies. Trisolaris orbits three stars and due to the nature of the [[Three-body problem|three body problem]] will eventually fall into one of the stars, thus Trisolaris seeks to colonize Earth for themselves. An invasion fleet has been launched which will arrive at Earth in 400 years.\n\n===Prologue===\nWhile visiting the grave of a colleague, the [[Sociology|sociologist]] Luo Ji runs into Ye Wenjie, the spiritual leader of the Earth Trisolaris Organization. Due to his [[astronomy]] background she suggests to him a new field of Cosmic Sociology, based on two axioms she had been thinking of: survival is the primary need of civilization and civilization continuously grows and expands yet the total matter in the universe remains constant.\n\nMeanwhile Evans in his last communication discovers that despite their advanced technology, the Trisolarans are incapable of [[internal monologue]]. They communicate via transmission of their thoughts directly into the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], visible even at a distance. Thinking is synonymous with speaking to them. This revelation frightens the Trisolarans who cut off all contact with Evans and abandon the ETO.\n\n===Part I: The Wallfacers===\nSince the human mind is the only place the Trisolarans cannot see, the [[United Nations]] selects four men to be \"Wallfacers\", the keepers of plans known only to themselves, who are granted full access to the resources of the UN. In response the Trisolarans revive the remnants of the ETO tasking them with determining the plans of the wallfacers. These ETO agents subsequently become the wallbreakers. Research and development of any means of escape from the solar system is banned due to supporting Defeatism, as well as against the values of humanity due to most of the initial plans solely benefitting the highest socioeconomic strata of humanity.\n\nLuo Ji initially survives being narrowly crushed by a car accident that instead kills an uninterested lover. He is brought to the UN meeting by security forces where he attempts to refuse his Wallfacer status. He is injured shortly afterward by another assassin with a gun, and discovers that his refusal of his wallfacer status is taken to be part of his plan. Resigned to his fate, Luo Ji demands to live in an isolated mansion where he begins a hedonistic life and has the woman of his dreams brought to him, whom he eventually marries.\n\nWallfacer Frederick Tyler embarks on a campaign to create an army of [[Kamikaze|Kamikaze]] fighter pilots to staff a swarm of fighters carrying [[hydrogen bombs]] to attack the fleet. Finding no luck in the Japanese who are disdainful of their history being put to use, nor in a guerilla force in [[Afghanistan]] who have no hatred for Trisolaris due to the guaranteed destruction of the [[United States]] in the war, he orders the implementation of drone control in the fighter craft as well as research into planetary bodies with significant bodies of water.\n\nWallfacer Manuel Rey Diaz, in the meantime, orders research and development into supermassive hydrogen bombs. Due to the scale of the bomb's mechanics merging with the physics of stars, he recruits Astronomers to assist in the development of said bombs, and shortly after develops a severe case of [[heliophobia]].\n\nWallfacer Bill Hines, in the meantime, initiates research into the human brain, with the hope that if a way to boost human intelligence is discovered, humanity might be able to brute force its way past the scientific block placed by the Sophons. He thus orders research into [[Computer architecture|traditional]], [[Quantum computing|quantum]], [[Biomechanical computers|biomechanical]], and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] supercomputers in order to further his research before entering [[hibernation]].\n\nMeanwhile Zhang Beihai a political officer in the [[Chinese Navy]] is tasked with laying down the foundations of Humanity's space force. He is a steadfast Triumphalist, believing that humanity will defeat the Trisolaran fleet. After seeing off his dying father, he develops a long private plan for how humanity will defeat Trisolaris and puts it into action.\n\n===Part II: The Spell===\nFrederick Tyler's plan is revealed by his wallbreaker. His plan was to utilize the [[Swarming (military)|swarm fleet]] to destroy the human fleet, and then transport a significant amount of water to the Trisolaran fleet. With the Trisolaran fleet believing in the sincerity of the swarm [[Treason|turncoats]], they would allow the swarm to approach close enough upon which he would take manual control of the swarm and crash their hydrogen bomb payloads directly into the Trisolaran fleet ships. His plan revealed as well as learning that the Trisolarans have ignored it, he falls into despair, exacerbated by the rest of the world believing the plan's revelation to be part of his secret plan. After a meeting with Luo Ji, he commits suicide to finally be free of his wallfacer status.\n\nManuel Rey Diaz's wallbreaker reveals himself and explains that his heliophobia is a ruse intended to distract from his true focus on the sun. His plan was to slow down the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] with his hydrogen bombs, pushing it into the sun and causing a chain reaction where the sun's surface continuously expands to swallow up more planets in the solar system including Earth, thus denying the planet to the Trisolarans. At a UN meeting to hold him to account he blackmails the wallfacer committee with a biometric watch linked to secreted nuclear bombs within the city. Demanding a revocation of his wallfacer status and free leave to his home country of [[Venezuela]]. Upon arrival in Venezuela it is revealed that the bombs were a bluff, yet despite his escape he is promptly stoned to death by his people for his plan to place them in harm's way.\n\nEventually, the UN kidnaps Luo Ji's wife and child, putting them in hibernation until the Trisolaran fleet arrives as a means of goading him to get to work. It is finally revealed to him that he is the only Human Trisolaris wants dead, and their initial attempts to discreetly kill him implies that whatever fear they have of him is a weapon that can be shared with other humans. He begins his work as a Wallfacer, asking questions about how to transmit the information about the position of a certain star in the [[Milky Way]] to a potential third observer civilization. This causes the Trisolarans to become truly afraid of Luo Ji. So they redouble their efforts to kill him.\n\nResearch into more advanced supercomputers has failed, with only a modest improvement in traditional architecture, but it is enough to allow Bill Hines to image the entire human brain and all its neurons. Through his work, he and his wife Keiko Yamasuki accidentally discover a method of implanting an unbreakable belief into a human. He thus changes his plan to implanting Triumphalism into humanity's armed forces, and enters hibernation along with his wife until the doomsday battle.\n\nZhang Beihai visits a rock collector to purchase [[Meteorite|meteorites]]. Certain propulsion researchers are advocating for [[Reaction engine|medium drives]] in the space force, which require ships to carry 2/3rds of their weight in fuel. Believing that this will severely handicap the human fleet, he assassinates said researchers with bullets made from the meteorites during a space walk photoshoot on a space elevator. Zhang Beihai points out the possibility that Defeatism and Triumphalism might wax and wane in the population over the coming centuries, and a situation might occur where the humanity's armed forces are depleted of any hope before the coming battle. His superiors, to counter this potential scenario, select several political officers including Zhang Beihai to enter hibernation in order to reinforce the future space force with Triumphalist soldiers. The ETO having observed his actions are worried about him. However, Trisolaris is unconcerned with Triumphalism and is much more worried about defeatist humans.\n\nLuo Ji uses the solar amplification technique to send out three images that show the relative position of star 187J3X1 in the universe. He says that it is a \"spell against the planets of star 187J3X1\", which will take one hundred years to be verified. The effects of the spell will be catastrophic, he predicts.\n\nThe Trisolarans' sympathizers on Earth nearly kill Luo Ji with a [[flu]]-like illness [[Ethnic bioweapon|targeted to his genome]] (like a biological [[Stuxnet]]), called the 'bed flu' (pun on [[bird flu]]). Unable to be cured, Luo Ji is put into [[Cryopreservation|hibernation]] to await a future time when a cure can be found. In the meantime, astronomers detect the launching of probes from the Trisolaran fleet to reach Earth 50 years ahead of the main fleet, the haste to reach Earth coinciding with the exact moment that Luo Ji made his announcement to the UN to broadcast the spell against 187J3X1.\n\n===Part III: The Dark Forest===\nAlmost 200 years later, Luo Ji is awakened to discover a drastically changed world. There has been a massive [[ecological collapse]] as a result of the total [[militarization]] of Earth, turning much of the surface into a [[Desertification|desert]] and reducing the human population to 3 billion people. In response, nation states excavated large caverns where hyper-technological [[arcology|arcological]] cities have been established. Earth has 3 fleets of spaceships numbering in the thousands, and independent of Earth, to prevent mixing of the priorities of the Earth Government caring for its civilians and the Fleet government combating Trisolaris. Each ship is a stellar class battleship capable of interstellar travel at 15% light speed and armed with laser weapons, [[Railgun|railguns]], and nuclear bombs. Citing the fleet's strength, humans collectively assume that they can win against the Trisolarans; even with many discussing the potential for future peace talks with the Trisolarans. Luo Ji & Bill Hines are taken to a meeting of Solar Fleet Joint Conference (a descendant of the United Nations, facilitating governance between fleet command and the Earth governments). Citing Frederick Tyler's suicide and the logistical impossibility of Manuel Rey Diaz's plan (not enough [[fissile material]] to achieve the results he envisioned), the wallfacer project is chalked up to early crisis [[hysteria]] and disbanded. There, Hines\u2019s plan is revealed by his own wife, secretly an ETO agent and his wallbreaker. Hines was a Defeatist and an Escapist, and his mental seal, instead of implanting Triumphalist beliefs into human armed forces, instead implanted Defeatism. Several seals were made in secret by himself and given to implanted soldiers, to spread and induct other soldiers into defeatism. Hines had hoped that defeatism operating in secret might develop a way for humanity to escape the solar system and preserve the seed of humanity. This results in a shakeup of fleet command due to the potential of the seal making perfect defeatism sleeper agents. Luo Ji, in the meantime, survives multiple assassination attempts from an ETO created computer virus and has to flee to a surface town with Da Shi, where there is less technology.\n\nWith a Trisolaran probe fast approaching, Zhang Beihai is given the position of acting captain of the flagship ''Natural Selection'' due to the uncertainty of who in the fleet is imprinted by the mental seal. He deserts the Solar System to escape the Trisolarans' incoming fleet, revealing himself to be a secret Defeatist and his mission the entire time being to preserve a seed of humanity. Four other stellar class warships begin pursuit of ''Natural Selection''.\n\nThe Earth Fleet meets the Trisolaran probe in a massive formation of nearly all of Earth's starships. The probe, which appears to be a solid \"droplet\" of a mirror-like substance based on the [[strong interaction]], arrives and activates during its examination to attack the human fleet. The strong interaction force makes the droplet the strongest object in the solar system, and its propulsion system allows it to perform impossible maneuvers such as instant 120\u00b0 course changes at high speed. These two properties allow it to quickly smash through 100 ships per minute as a result of the human fleet grid formation. Ship weapons are useless against it, and ships that attempt to accelerate beyond human safety limits are still caught and destroyed. Only two ships survive the battle due to their crew being prepared for maximum acceleration in case the probe attempted to flee the fleet. The droplet then parks itself in a [[Lagrange point]] between the Earth and the Sun, where it broadcasts a powerful scrambling signal to prevent Earth from using the Sun's amplification mechanism again.\n\nThe surviving ships decide to escape the Solar System and head for nearby stars in hopes of founding civilization once again. However, the humans aboard these ships quickly realize there are only enough supplies for a single ship. The distances between ships hinder sufficient communication to allow for a calm discussion between ships. Thus, in both groups of ships, one crew initiates a [[first strike]] against the others before collecting supplies and resources and continuing their journey.\n\nBack on Earth, Luo Ji and another contemporary, Da Shi, discover that star 187J3X1 has been destroyed, causing the UN to restore Luo Ji's Wallfacer status. Luo Ji explains to Da Shi the implications he derived from Ye Wenjie's two [[Axiom|axioms]] of cosmic civilization: 1. Each civilization's goal is survival; and 2. Resources are finite. Like hunters in a \"[[Fermi paradox#It_is_dangerous_to_communicate|dark forest]]\", a civilization can never be certain of an alien civilization's true intentions. The extreme distances between stars creates an insurmountable \"chain of suspicion\", where any two civilizations cannot communicate well enough to dissipate mistrust, making conflict inevitable. Leaving a primitive civilization alone is not an option due to the exponential progress of technological change, and a civilization you have detected might easily surpass your own technological level in a few centuries and become a threat. If you have detected a civilization, then you have also confirmed that said civilization will eventually be able to detect you. Therefore, it is in every civilization's best interest to [[Fermi_paradox#It_is_the_nature_of_intelligent_life_to_destroy_others|preemptively strike and destroy]] any developing civilization before it can become a threat, but without revealing their own location to the wider universe, thus explaining the [[Fermi paradox]].\n\nForced by the UN's successor organization to work for them, Luo Ji is given a project to track the other probes that will shortly enter the Solar System. Project Snow is intended to create a screen across the Solar System, which, when crossed, will reveal the trajectories of incoming probes. Luo Ji quickly realizes the futility of this project, but throws himself into it anyway.\n\nThree years pass, and Luo Ji falls from favor and descends into [[alcoholism]]. He travels to the grave of Ye Wenjie, the woman who first sent the message to Trisolaris and who told Luo Ji about the axioms of cosmic sociology. He digs his own grave and places a pistol to his heart. He then issues an ultimatum to the Trisolarans: He is wearing a biometric watch as a [[dead-man's switch]], similar to one used by Rey Diaz, and has positioned the bombs of Project Snow such that they can selectively block light from the sun, creating a message that will broadcast to the galaxy the exact coordinates of Trisolaris and, by extension, Earth. The Trisolarans surrender and alter the course of their fleet to bypass the Solar System, cease the blocking of the sun as a transmission source, and agree to teach humanity how to manufacture [[gravitational wave]] transmitters.\n\n===Five Years Later===\nLuo Ji takes his family to visit the newest gravitational wave transmitter supported by [[anti-gravity]]. Humanity has already built two previous gravitational wave transmitters and all are being tasked with transmitting gravitational noise akin to that from natural space objects (neutron stars, black holes, etc.). A sophon unfolds behind them, and he converses with the Trisolaran operator who first transmitted a warning to Earth. They discuss the concept of [[love]], how Luo Ji believed only humans were capable of it and how Trisolarans were capable of it but suppressed it due to the nature of their own solar system. The possibility is brought up that love might exist in other species in the universe and thus their civilizations might have to risk the effort to preserve love in the universe. Luo Ji brings up his hope that eventually a bright sun might illuminate the entire dark forest.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Ye Wenjie (\u53f6\u6587\u6d01) \u2013 Astrophysicist who initiated initial contact between Earth and Trisolaris.

The sophons have also blocked all further research into particle physics, thus stopping any further human scientific development of fundamental principles, leaving only recombination and elaboration of existing technologies. Trisolaris orbits three stars and due to the nature of the [[Three-body problem|three body problem]] will eventually fall into one of the stars, thus Trisolaris seeks to colonize Earth for themselves. An invasion fleet has been launched which will arrive at Earth in 400 years.\n\n===Prologue===\nWhile visiting the grave of a colleague, the [[Sociology|sociologist]] Luo Ji runs into Ye Wenjie, the spiritual leader of the Earth Trisolaris Organization. Due to his [[astronomy]] background she suggests to him a new field of Cosmic Sociology, based on two axioms she had been thinking of: survival is the primary need of civilization and civilization continuously grows and expands yet the total matter in the universe remains constant.\n\nMeanwhile Evans in his last communication discovers that despite their advanced technology, the Trisolarans are incapable of [[internal monologue]]. They communicate via transmission of their thoughts directly into the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], visible even at a distance. Thinking is synonymous with speaking to them. This revelation frightens the Trisolarans who cut off all contact with Evans and abandon the ETO.\n\n===Part I: The Wallfacers===\nSince the human mind is the only place the Trisolarans cannot see, the [[United Nations]] selects four men to be \"Wallfacers\", the keepers of plans known only to themselves, who are granted full access to the resources of the UN. In response the Trisolarans revive the remnants of the ETO tasking them with determining the plans of the wallfacers. These ETO agents subsequently become the wallbreakers. Research and development of any means of escape from the solar system is banned due to supporting Defeatism, as well as against the values of humanity due to most of the initial plans solely benefitting the highest socioeconomic strata of humanity.\n\nLuo Ji initially survives being narrowly crushed by a car accident that instead kills an uninterested lover. He is brought to the UN meeting by security forces where he attempts to refuse his Wallfacer status. He is injured shortly afterward by another assassin with a gun, and discovers that his refusal of his wallfacer status is taken to be part of his plan. Resigned to his fate, Luo Ji demands to live in an isolated mansion where he begins a hedonistic life and has the woman of his dreams brought to him, whom he eventually marries.\n\nWallfacer Frederick Tyler embarks on a campaign to create an army of [[Kamikaze|Kamikaze]] fighter pilots to staff a swarm of fighters carrying [[hydrogen bombs]] to attack the fleet. Finding no luck in the Japanese who are disdainful of their history being put to use, nor in a guerilla force in [[Afghanistan]] who have no hatred for Trisolaris due to the guaranteed destruction of the [[United States]] in the war, he orders the implementation of drone control in the fighter craft as well as research into planetary bodies with significant bodies of water.\n\nWallfacer Manuel Rey Diaz, in the meantime, orders research and development into supermassive hydrogen bombs. Due to the scale of the bomb's mechanics merging with the physics of stars, he recruits Astronomers to assist in the development of said bombs, and shortly after develops a severe case of [[heliophobia]].\n\nWallfacer Bill Hines, in the meantime, initiates research into the human brain, with the hope that if a way to boost human intelligence is discovered, humanity might be able to brute force its way past the scientific block placed by the Sophons. He thus orders research into [[Computer architecture|traditional]], [[Quantum computing|quantum]], [[Biomechanical computers|biomechanical]], and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] supercomputers in order to further his research before entering [[hibernation]].\n\nMeanwhile Zhang Beihai a political officer in the [[Chinese Navy]] is tasked with laying down the foundations of Humanity's space force. He is a steadfast Triumphalist, believing that humanity will defeat the Trisolaran fleet. After seeing off his dying father, he develops a long private plan for how humanity will defeat Trisolaris and puts it into action.\n\n===Part II: The Spell===\nFrederick Tyler's plan is revealed by his wallbreaker. His plan was to utilize the [[Swarming (military)|swarm fleet]] to destroy the human fleet, and then transport a significant amount of water to the Trisolaran fleet. With the Trisolaran fleet believing in the sincerity of the swarm [[Treason|turncoats]], they would allow the swarm to approach close enough upon which he would take manual control of the swarm and crash their hydrogen bomb payloads directly into the Trisolaran fleet ships. His plan revealed as well as learning that the Trisolarans have ignored it, he falls into despair, exacerbated by the rest of the world believing the plan's revelation to be part of his secret plan. After a meeting with Luo Ji, he commits suicide to finally be free of his wallfacer status.\n\nManuel Rey Diaz's wallbreaker reveals himself and explains that his heliophobia is a ruse intended to distract from his true focus on the sun. His plan was to slow down the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] with his hydrogen bombs, pushing it into the sun and causing a chain reaction where the sun's surface continuously expands to swallow up more planets in the solar system including Earth, thus denying the planet to the Trisolarans. At a UN meeting to hold him to account he blackmails the wallfacer committee with a biometric watch linked to secreted nuclear bombs within the city. Demanding a revocation of his wallfacer status and free leave to his home country of [[Venezuela]]. Upon arrival in Venezuela it is revealed that the bombs were a bluff, yet despite his escape he is promptly stoned to death by his people for his plan to place them in harm's way.\n\nEventually, the UN kidnaps Luo Ji's wife and child, putting them in hibernation until the Trisolaran fleet arrives as a means of goading him to get to work. It is finally revealed to him that he is the only Human Trisolaris wants dead, and their initial attempts to discreetly kill him implies that whatever fear they have of him is a weapon that can be shared with other humans. He begins his work as a Wallfacer, asking questions about how to transmit the information about the position of a certain star in the [[Milky Way]] to a potential third observer civilization. This causes the Trisolarans to become truly afraid of Luo Ji. So they redouble their efforts to kill him.\n\nResearch into more advanced supercomputers has failed, with only a modest improvement in traditional architecture, but it is enough to allow Bill Hines to image the entire human brain and all its neurons. Through his work, he and his wife Keiko Yamasuki accidentally discover a method of implanting an unbreakable belief into a human. He thus changes his plan to implanting Triumphalism into humanity's armed forces, and enters hibernation along with his wife until the doomsday battle.\n\nZhang Beihai visits a rock collector to purchase [[Meteorite|meteorites]]. Certain propulsion researchers are advocating for [[Reaction engine|medium drives]] in the space force, which require ships to carry 2/3rds of their weight in fuel. Believing that this will severely handicap the human fleet, he assassinates said researchers with bullets made from the meteorites during a space walk photoshoot on a space elevator. Zhang Beihai points out the possibility that Defeatism and Triumphalism might wax and wane in the population over the coming centuries, and a situation might occur where the humanity's armed forces are depleted of any hope before the coming battle. His superiors, to counter this potential scenario, select several political officers including Zhang Beihai to enter hibernation in order to reinforce the future space force with Triumphalist soldiers. The ETO having observed his actions are worried about him. However, Trisolaris is unconcerned with Triumphalism and is much more worried about defeatist humans.\n\nLuo Ji uses the solar amplification technique to send out three images that show the relative position of star 187J3X1 in the universe. He says that it is a \"spell against the planets of star 187J3X1\", which will take one hundred years to be verified. The effects of the spell will be catastrophic, he predicts.\n\nThe Trisolarans' sympathizers on Earth nearly kill Luo Ji with a [[flu]]-like illness [[Ethnic bioweapon|targeted to his genome]] (like a biological [[Stuxnet]]), called the 'bed flu' (pun on [[bird flu]]). Unable to be cured, Luo Ji is put into [[Cryopreservation|hibernation]] to await a future time when a cure can be found. In the meantime, astronomers detect the launching of probes from the Trisolaran fleet to reach Earth 50 years ahead of the main fleet, the haste to reach Earth coinciding with the exact moment that Luo Ji made his announcement to the UN to broadcast the spell against 187J3X1.\n\n===Part III: The Dark Forest===\nAlmost 200 years later, Luo Ji is awakened to discover a drastically changed world. There has been a massive [[ecological collapse]] as a result of the total [[militarization]] of Earth, turning much of the surface into a [[Desertification|desert]] and reducing the human population to 3 billion people. In response, nation states excavated large caverns where hyper-technological [[arcology|arcological]] cities have been established. Earth has 3 fleets of spaceships numbering in the thousands, and independent of Earth, to prevent mixing of the priorities of the Earth Government caring for its civilians and the Fleet government combating Trisolaris. Each ship is a stellar class battleship capable of interstellar travel at 15% light speed and armed with laser weapons, [[Railgun|railguns]], and nuclear bombs. Citing the fleet's strength, humans collectively assume that they can win against the Trisolarans; even with many discussing the potential for future peace talks with the Trisolarans. Luo Ji & Bill Hines are taken to a meeting of Solar Fleet Joint Conference (a descendant of the United Nations, facilitating governance between fleet command and the Earth governments). Citing Frederick Tyler's suicide and the logistical impossibility of Manuel Rey Diaz's plan (not enough [[fissile material]] to achieve the results he envisioned), the wallfacer project is chalked up to early crisis [[hysteria]] and disbanded. There, Hines\u2019s plan is revealed by his own wife, secretly an ETO agent and his wallbreaker. Hines was a Defeatist and an Escapist, and his mental seal, instead of implanting Triumphalist beliefs into human armed forces, instead implanted Defeatism. Several seals were made in secret by himself and given to implanted soldiers, to spread and induct other soldiers into defeatism. Hines had hoped that defeatism operating in secret might develop a way for humanity to escape the solar system and preserve the seed of humanity. This results in a shakeup of fleet command due to the potential of the seal making perfect defeatism sleeper agents. Luo Ji, in the meantime, survives multiple assassination attempts from an ETO created computer virus and has to flee to a surface town with Da Shi, where there is less technology.\n\nWith a Trisolaran probe fast approaching, Zhang Beihai is given the position of acting captain of the flagship ''Natural Selection'' due to the uncertainty of who in the fleet is imprinted by the mental seal. He deserts the Solar System to escape the Trisolarans' incoming fleet, revealing himself to be a secret Defeatist and his mission the entire time being to preserve a seed of humanity. Four other stellar class warships begin pursuit of ''Natural Selection''.\n\nThe Earth Fleet meets the Trisolaran probe in a massive formation of nearly all of Earth's starships. The probe, which appears to be a solid \"droplet\" of a mirror-like substance based on the [[strong interaction]], arrives and activates during its examination to attack the human fleet. The strong interaction force makes the droplet the strongest object in the solar system, and its propulsion system allows it to perform impossible maneuvers such as instant 120\u00b0 course changes at high speed. These two properties allow it to quickly smash through 100 ships per minute as a result of the human fleet grid formation. Ship weapons are useless against it, and ships that attempt to accelerate beyond human safety limits are still caught and destroyed. Only two ships survive the battle due to their crew being prepared for maximum acceleration in case the probe attempted to flee the fleet. The droplet then parks itself in a [[Lagrange point]] between the Earth and the Sun, where it broadcasts a powerful scrambling signal to prevent Earth from using the Sun's amplification mechanism again.\n\nThe surviving ships decide to escape the Solar System and head for nearby stars in hopes of founding civilization once again. However, the humans aboard these ships quickly realize there are only enough supplies for a single ship. The distances between ships hinder sufficient communication to allow for a calm discussion between ships. Thus, in both groups of ships, one crew initiates a [[first strike]] against the others before collecting supplies and resources and continuing their journey.\n\nBack on Earth, Luo Ji and another contemporary, Da Shi, discover that star 187J3X1 has been destroyed, causing the UN to restore Luo Ji's Wallfacer status. Luo Ji explains to Da Shi the implications he derived from Ye Wenjie's two [[Axiom|axioms]] of cosmic civilization: 1. Each civilization's goal is survival; and 2. Resources are finite. Like hunters in a \"[[Fermi paradox#It_is_dangerous_to_communicate|dark forest]]\", a civilization can never be certain of an alien civilization's true intentions. The extreme distances between stars creates an insurmountable \"chain of suspicion\", where any two civilizations cannot communicate well enough to dissipate mistrust, making conflict inevitable. Leaving a primitive civilization alone is not an option due to the exponential progress of technological change, and a civilization you have detected might easily surpass your own technological level in a few centuries and become a threat. If you have detected a civilization, then you have also confirmed that said civilization will eventually be able to detect you. Therefore, it is in every civilization's best interest to preemptively strike and destroy any developing civilization before it can become a threat, but without revealing their own location to the wider universe, thus explaining the [[Fermi paradox]].\n\nForced by the UN's successor organization to work for them, Luo Ji is given a project to track the other probes that will shortly enter the Solar System. Project Snow is intended to create a screen across the Solar System, which, when crossed, will reveal the trajectories of incoming probes. Luo Ji quickly realizes the futility of this project, but throws himself into it anyway.\n\nThree years pass, and Luo Ji falls from favor and descends into [[alcoholism]]. He travels to the grave of Ye Wenjie, the woman who first sent the message to Trisolaris and who told Luo Ji about the axioms of cosmic sociology. He digs his own grave and places a pistol to his heart. He then issues an ultimatum to the Trisolarans: He is wearing a biometric watch as a [[dead-man's switch]], similar to one used by Rey Diaz, and has positioned the bombs of Project Snow such that they can selectively block light from the sun, creating a message that will broadcast to the galaxy the exact coordinates of Trisolaris and, by extension, Earth. The Trisolarans surrender and alter the course of their fleet to bypass the Solar System, cease the blocking of the sun as a transmission source, and agree to teach humanity how to manufacture [[gravitational wave]] transmitters.\n\n===Five Years Later===\nLuo Ji takes his family to visit the newest gravitational wave transmitter supported by [[anti-gravity]]. Humanity has already built two previous gravitational wave transmitters and all are being tasked with transmitting gravitational noise akin to that from natural space objects (neutron stars, black holes, etc.). A sophon unfolds behind them, and he converses with the Trisolaran operator who first transmitted a warning to Earth. They discuss the concept of [[love]], how Luo Ji believed only humans were capable of it and how Trisolarans were capable of it but suppressed it due to the nature of their own solar system. The possibility is brought up that love might exist in other species in the universe and thus their civilizations might have to risk the effort to preserve love in the universe. Luo Ji brings up his hope that eventually a bright sun might illuminate the entire dark forest.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Ye Wenjie (\u53f6\u6587\u6d01) \u2013 Astrophysicist who initiated initial contact between Earth and Trisolaris.

Construction began in 1910 and took three years, continuing through the [[Waihi miners' strike]] despite attempts to involve the Horahora construction workers in the strike action. When the power station opened in October 1913 it was the largest generating plant in the country with a capacity of {{convert|6.3|MW}}. The power was put to use throughout the mine and [[stamp mill|stamping mill]]s, however under the mining company\u2019s ownership the power station was never utilised to its full capacity.<ref name=\"martin\" />\n\nThe power station was bought by the NZ government in 1919 and it began to supply [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and surrounding farming districts. In 1926 the power station was upgraded, increasing capacity to {{convert|10.3|MW}}. This allowed supply to be extended to include the [[Bay of Plenty]] and [[Auckland]].<ref name=\"martin\" />\n\n== Submerging ==\nIn April 1947 Lake Karapiro was finally formed behind the Karapiro Power Station dam, submerging Horahora.

Construction began in 1910 and took three years, continuing through the [[Waihi miners' strike]] despite attempts to involve the Horahora construction workers in the strike action. When the power station opened in October 1913 it was the largest generating plant in the country with a capacity of {{convert|6.3|MW}}. The power was put to use throughout the mine and [[stamp mill|stamping mill]]s, however under the mining company\u2019s ownership the power station was never utilised to its full capacity.<ref name=\"martin\" />\n\nThe power station was bought by the NZ government in 1919 and it began to supply [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and surrounding farming districts. In 1926 the power station was upgraded, increasing capacity to {{convert|10.3|MW}}. This allowed supply to be extended to include the [[Bay of Plenty]] and [[Auckland]].<ref name=\"martin\" />\n\n== Submerging ==\nIn April 1947 Lake Karapiro was finally formed behind the Karapiro Power Station dam, submerging Horahora. It was kept generating until the last possible day due to power shortages, with the turbines and generator units being left in place. To the amusement of onlookers, two generators continued to rotate and thrash the rising waters, even after the water had almost covered them.<ref name=\"martin\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New Zealand|Water|Renewable energy}}}}\n*[[List of power stations in New Zealand]]\n*[[Electricity sector in New Zealand]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/parliamentary/appendix-to-the-journals-of-the-house-of-representatives/1926/I/1687 1926 photo of power house and nearby housing]\n\n{{Electricity generation in Waikato}}\n{{coord|37|57.133|S|175|39.446|E|scale:10000|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1913]]\n[[Category:Hydroelectric power stations in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Waikato River]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Waikato]]\n[[Category:1913 establishments in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:1910s architecture in New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Brycehughes", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horahora_Power_Station"}
{"title_page": "List of Durham University people", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\nThis is a '''list of people associated with [[Durham University]]''', divided for user convenience into multiple subcategories. This includes [[alumni]], those who have taught there, conducted research there or played a part in its founding. Durham is a [[collegiate university]], so where known and if applicable, they are shown alongside their [[Colleges of Durham University|associated college]]. For reasons of brevity, alumni of [[University College, Durham|University College]], [[St Cuthbert's Society, Durham|St Cuthbert's Society]] and [[Trevelyan College, Durham|Trevelyan College]] are written with the shorter, more informal names of '''Castle''', '''Cuths''' and '''Trevs''' respectively.\n\nNote that college membership was not always compulsory. From [[Epiphany term]] of 1871 the university, as a way of lowering the cost of studying at Durham, began to admit students without the need to join a college or hall \u2013 an innovation that may have been influenced by Oxford's decision to admit non-collegiate students in 1868.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=Matthew Paul |title=Durham University: Last of the Ancient Universities and First of the New (1831-1871) |date=2016 |publisher=Department for Continuing Education, University of Oxford |location=Oxford |page=329 |url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:52d639b8-a555-48ce-8226-af71d19cb346/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=Durham%2BUniversity%2BLast%2Bof%2Bthe%2BAncient%2BUniversities%2Band%2BFirst%2Bof%2Bthe%2BNew%2B%25281831-1871%2529%2B-%2BDeposit%2B-%2BDissemination%2BVersion.pdf&type_of_work=Thesis |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> This change proved popular, and between 1870/71 and 1890/91 the 'Unattached Members' were 28% of entrants.<ref>Andrews, p. 330</ref> Some students who read for higher degrees, like the geologist [[Gillian Foulger]], did not join a college either. Alumni who did not take up membership of a college or society are therefore listed as '''Unattached'''.\n\nA number of Durham alumni have made significant contributions in the fields of government, law, science, academia, business, arts, journalism, religion, and sport. The list has been divided into categories indicating the field of activity in which people have become well known. Alumni who have achieved distinction in more than one field are listed in the field in which it is felt they are most associated, or have been involved in more recently. For example, [[Michael Warrender, 3rd Baron Bruntisfield|Michael Warrender]] ([[Hatfield College, Durham|Hatfield]]), now an investment manager but formerly a [[British Army]] officer, is listed under business people rather than military personnel; while [[Henry Villiers-Stuart]] (Castle), an antiquarian, is listed as under [[#Politicians and civil servants|politicians and civil servants]]. \n\nDurham alumni are active through organizations and events such as the annual reunions, dinners and balls. 67 Durham associations ranging from international to college and sports affiliated groups cater for the more than 109,000 living alumni.<ref name=\"Durham Diff Alumni\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/DARO/TheDurhamDifference.pdf|title=The Durham Difference|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=3 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183326/http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/DARO/TheDurhamDifference.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\n==Academics==\n=== Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] ===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Professor Jas Pal Badyal FRS.jpg|[[Jas Pal Badyal]], Professor of Chemistry\nFile:John Barrow.jpg|[[John D.

This includes [[alumni]], those who have taught there, conducted research there or played a part in its founding. Durham is a [[collegiate university]], so where known and if applicable, they are shown alongside their [[Colleges of Durham University|associated college]]. For reasons of brevity, alumni of [[University College, Durham|University College]], [[St Cuthbert's Society, Durham|St Cuthbert's Society]] and [[Trevelyan College, Durham|Trevelyan College]] are written with the shorter, more informal names of '''Castle''', '''Cuths''' and '''Trevs''' respectively.\n\nNote that college membership was not always compulsory. From [[Epiphany term]] of 1871 the university, as a way of lowering the cost of studying at Durham, began to admit students without the need to join a college or hall \u2013 an innovation that may have been influenced by Oxford's decision to admit non-collegiate students in 1868.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=Matthew Paul |title=Durham University: Last of the Ancient Universities and First of the New (1831-1871) |date=2016 |publisher=Department for Continuing Education, University of Oxford |location=Oxford |page=329 |url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:52d639b8-a555-48ce-8226-af71d19cb346/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=Durham%2BUniversity%2BLast%2Bof%2Bthe%2BAncient%2BUniversities%2Band%2BFirst%2Bof%2Bthe%2BNew%2B%25281831-1871%2529%2B-%2BDeposit%2B-%2BDissemination%2BVersion.pdf&type_of_work=Thesis |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> This change proved popular, and between 1870/71 and 1890/91 the 'Unattached Members' were 28% of entrants.<ref>Andrews, p. 330</ref> Some students who read for higher degrees, like the geologist [[Gillian Foulger]], did not join a college either. Alumni who did not take up membership of a college or society are therefore listed as '''Unattached'''.\n\nA number of Durham alumni have made significant contributions in the fields of government, law, science, academia, business, arts, journalism, religion, and sport. The list has been divided into categories indicating the field of activity in which people have become well known. Alumni who have achieved distinction in more than one field are listed in the field in which it is felt they are most associated, or have been involved in more recently. For example, [[Michael Warrender, 3rd Baron Bruntisfield|Michael Warrender]] ([[Hatfield College, Durham|Hatfield]]), now an investment manager but formerly a [[British Army]] officer, is listed under business people rather than military personnel; while [[Henry Villiers-Stuart]] (Castle), an antiquarian, is listed as under [[#Politicians and civil servants|politicians and civil servants]]. \n\nDurham alumni are active through organizations and events such as the annual reunions, dinners and balls. 67 Durham associations ranging from international to college and sports affiliated groups cater for the more than 109,000 living alumni.<ref name=\"Durham Diff Alumni\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/DARO/TheDurhamDifference.pdf|title=The Durham Difference|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=3 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629183326/http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/DARO/TheDurhamDifference.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\n==Academics==\n=== Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] ===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Professor Jas Pal Badyal FRS.jpg|[[Jas Pal Badyal]], Professor of Chemistry\nFile:John Barrow.jpg|[[John D.

{"title_page": "Robotic process automation", "text_new": "'''Robotic process automation''' (or RPA) is a form of [[business process automation]] technology (sometimes referred to as software robotics; not to be confused with [[robot software]]) based on metaphorical [[software]] robots (bots) or [[artificial intelligence]] (AI)/digital workers.<ref name=\"NewScientistAI\">{{Citation|title=AI interns:Software already taking jobs from humans|publisher=New Scientist|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630151.700-ai-interns-software-already-taking-jobs-from-humans/#.VY2CxPlViko}}</ref>\n\nIn traditional [[workflow]] [[automation]] tools, a [[software developer]] produces a list of actions to automate a task and interface to the back-end system using internal [[application programming interfaces]] (APIs) or dedicated [[scripting language]]. In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.\n\nRPA tools have strong technical similarities to [[graphical user interface testing]] tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by [[programming by demonstration|repeating a set of demonstration actions]] performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving [[email]] containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a [[bookkeeping]] system. \n\n==Historic evolution==\n\nAs a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form of [[screen scraping]], which can be traced back to early forms of malware. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting of [[API]] integration into other enterprise applications, connectors into [[ITSM]] systems, [[terminal services]] and even some types of [[AI]]/[[ML]] services such as [[image recognition]].  It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature, resilient, scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises<ref name=\"HfSThreat\">{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|archivedate=2015-09-21}}</ref> (who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation).\n\n==Deployment==\n\nThe hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in a [[virtual environment]] and not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of [[virtualization]] technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs. The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non-RPA solutions.<ref>[http://www.kpmg-institutes.com/content/dam/kpmg/sharedservicesoutsourcinginstitute/pdf/2015/robotics-improve-legacy-sourcing.pdf]</ref>\n\nThere are however several risks with RPA. Criticism include risks of stifling innovation and creating a more complex maintenance environment of existing software that now needs to consider the use of graphical user interfaces in a way they weren't intended to be used.<ref name=\"mit\">{{cite web |last1=DeBrusk |first1=Chris |title=Five Robotic Process Automation Risks to Avoid |url=https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-robotic-process-automation-risks-to-avoid/ |website=MIT Sloan Management Review |publisher=MIT Sloan Management Review |accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Impact on employment==\n{{See also|Technological unemployment|Automation}}\nAccording to ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', most operations groups adopting RPA have promised their employees that automation would not result in [[layoff]]s.<ref name=\"HBR\">{{Citation|title=What knowledge workers stand to gain from automation|publisher=Harvard Business Review|url=https://hbr.org/2015/06/what-knowledge-workers-stand-to-gain-from-automation}}</ref> Instead, workers have been redeployed to do more interesting work. One academic study highlighted that knowledge workers did not feel threatened by automation: they embraced it and viewed the robots as team-mates.<ref name=\"LSEXchanging\">{{Citation|title=Robotic Process Automation at Xchanging|publisher=London School of Economics|url=http://www.xchanging.com/system/files/dedicated-downloads/robotic-process-automation.pdf}}</ref> The same study highlighted that, rather than resulting in a lower \"headcount\", the technology was deployed in such a way as to achieve more work and greater productivity with the same number of people.\n\nConversely, however, some analysts proffer that RPA represents a threat to the [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO) industry.<ref name=\"GartnerPredicts2014\">{{Citation|title=Gartner Predicts 2014: Business and IT Services Are Facing the End of Outsourcing as We Know It|publisher=Gartner|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2656215/predicts--business-it-services}}</ref> The thesis behind this notion is that RPA will enable enterprises to \"repatriate\" processes from offshore locations into local data centers, with the benefit of this new technology. The effect, if true, will be to create high-value jobs for skilled process designers in onshore locations (and within the associated supply chain of IT hardware, data center management, etc.) but to decrease the available opportunity to low skilled workers offshore. On the other hand, this discussion appears to be healthy ground for debate as another academic study was at pains to counter the so-called \"myth\" that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore.<ref name=\"LSEXchanging\"/>\n\n===Impact on society===\nAcademic studies<ref name=\" OxfordFutureJobs\">{{Citation|title=THE FUTURE OF EMPLOYMENT: HOW SUSCEPTIBLE ARE JOBS TO COMPUTERISATION?|url=http://www.futuretech.ox.ac.uk/news-release-oxford-martin-school-study-shows-nearly-half-us-jobs-could-be-risk-computerisation|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205044724/http://www.futuretech.ox.ac.uk/news-release-oxford-martin-school-study-shows-nearly-half-us-jobs-could-be-risk-computerisation|archivedate=2016-02-05}}</ref><ref name=\"LSERPALikelyOutcomes\">{{Citation|title=Nine likely scenarios arising from the growing use of software robots|publisher=London School of Economics|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/64032/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-Nine%20likely%20scenarios%20arising%20from%20the%20growing%20use%20of%20robots.pdf}}</ref> project that RPA, among other technological trends, is expected to drive a new wave of productivity and efficiency gains in the global labour market.

In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.\n\nRPA tools have strong technical similarities to [[graphical user interface testing]] tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by [[programming by demonstration|repeating a set of demonstration actions]] performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving [[email]] containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a [[bookkeeping]] system. \n\n==Historic evolution==\n\nAs a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form of [[screen scraping]], which can be traced back to early forms of malware. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting of [[API]] integration into other enterprise applications, connectors into [[ITSM]] systems, [[terminal services]] and even some types of [[AI]]/[[ML]] services such as [[image recognition]].  It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature, resilient, scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises<ref name=\"HfSThreat\">{{Citation|title=Robotic Automation Emerges as a Threat to Traditional Low Cost Outsourcing|publisher=HfS Research|url=http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921062911/http://www.hfsresearch.com/Robotic-Automation-as-Threat-to-Traditional-Low-Cost-Outsourcing|archivedate=2015-09-21}}</ref> (who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation).\n\n==Deployment==\n\nThe hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in a [[virtual environment]] and not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of [[virtualization]] technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs. The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non-RPA solutions.<ref>[http://www.kpmg-institutes.com/content/dam/kpmg/sharedservicesoutsourcinginstitute/pdf/2015/robotics-improve-legacy-sourcing.pdf]</ref>\n\nThere are however several risks with RPA.

The effect, if true, will be to create high-value jobs for skilled process designers in onshore locations (and within the associated supply chain of IT hardware, data center management, etc.) but to decrease the available opportunity to low skilled workers offshore.

This means that an actor\u2019s security concerns are primarily generated in their immediate neighborhood. The security of each actor in a region interacts with the security of the other actors. Most security concerns do not travel well over distances, and threats within an actor\u2019s immediate neighborhood are therefore most likely felt the strongest. Due to the way adjacency works there is often intense security interdependence within an RSC, but interaction with outsiders is much less active. As Buzan and W\u00e6ver state: <blockquote>''\u201cSimple physical adjacency tends to generate more security interaction among neighbours than among states located in different areas, a point also emphasised by [[Stephen M. Walt|Walt]] (1987: 276-7) Adjacency is potent for security because many threats travel more easily over short distances than over long ones.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />''</blockquote>The theory is complicated by existence of [[Great power|actors with global security interests and force projection capabilities]]. However, Buzan and W\u00e6ver posit that even the global powers\u2019 security interests are fundamentally regional in nature. Their involvement in regional security issues should be most often seen as them being drawn in by regionally generated matters; not necessarily as great power issues penetrating an RSC, although that can happen as well.\n\nRSCs can be interpreted as systems in and of themselves, as \u201cmicro\u201d systems embedded in a larger, global political system. RSCs contain their own security dynamics, which are in normal circumstances largely independent from global security dynamics. This enables the application of various IR concepts \u2013 such as [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance-of-power]], [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]] and [[Complex interdependence|interdependence]] \u2013 on a regional scale. Further refining the theory are the concepts of regional subcomplexes (essentially RSCs within RSCs) and supercomplexes (essentially the adjoining of neighboring RSCs).\n\nBuzan & W\u00e6ver view security interests as primarily regional in nature. This is in opposition to a view \u2013 predominant during [[Cold War|the Cold War]] \u2013 that sees security politics as largely a reflection of global great power interests. Buzan and W\u00e6ver point to the [[Middle Eastern conflicts|Middle East]] as an example, where the security landscape has seen no effective change despite the ending of the Cold War: <blockquote>''\u201cSecurity features at the level of regions are durable. They are substantially self-contained not in the sense of being totally free-standing, but rather in possessing a security dynamic that would exist even if other actors did not impinge on it. This relative autonomy was revealed by the ending of the Cold War, when enmities such as that between [[Israel]] and [[Syria]], and [[Iraq]] and the [[Gulf Arab states|Gulf Arab States]], easily survived the demise of a superpower rivalry that had supported, but not generated, them.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />''</blockquote>RSCs are conceptually distinct from \u201cregions\u201d. Where as regions \u2013 as used in culture, history or politics \u2013 are discursively formed concepts with varying definitions depending on context, RSCs are strictly theoretical constructs, formed from theory via [[deductive reasoning]]. Therefore, culturally relevant definitions such as \u201c[[Europe#Definition|Europe]]\u201d or \u201c[[Middle East#Territories and regions|Middle-East]]\u201d do not necessarily constitute RSCs; however there is overlap with theoretically defined RSCs and cultural definitions of regions. [[Security: A New Framework for Analysis|Buzan and W\u00e6ver\u2019s view of security as a social construct]] means that things such as culture and history can have significant influence on actors\u2019 perceptions. RSCs are nevertheless solely based on distinct patterns of interaction.\n\n== Place in international relations theory literature ==\nBuzan and W\u00e6ver describe their work as a sort of extension of the monolithic [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealist school of international relations]], \u201cincorporating\u201d it, while also filling in perceived theoretical gaps.

According to RSCT, regional security complexes cannot be identified or understood by merely examining material differences between actors (for example size of armed forces or nuclear arsenal), rather, attention needs to be paid how actors interpret such material facts.\n\nRSCT should not be confused with [[Regionalism (international relations)|regionalism]], a subset of IR from the 1970s concerned mostly with regional integration.

[[Firmware]] is based on [[Enigma (DVB)|Enigma]] 2, which was originally designed for [[Dreambox]] by [[Dream Multimedia]]. All units support [[Conax]] [[conditional access]] (CA) system, with software-emulated [[conditional-access module]]s (CAMs) available for many alternate CA systems. The built-in [[Ethernet]] interface allows networked computers to access the recordings on the internal hard disks and stream live picture from the tuners. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of DVB [[MPEG transport stream]]s on [[Network File System|networked filesystem]]s or broadcast the streams as [[IPTV]] to [[VideoLAN]] and [[XBMC Media Center]] clients. Unlike many PC based [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] systems that use [[free-to-air]] type of DVB receiver cards, the built-in conditional access allows receiving and storing encrypted content.\n\nIn the beginning of September in 2011, [[Dream Multimedia]] obtained a temporary injunction against the Satco Europe GmbH company for using their \"''[[Enigma (DVB)|Enigma]] 2''\" name in an advertising flyer to promote the Linux operating system installed on the Vu+ set-top-boxes, as \"''Enigma\"(2)'' is a [[registered trademark]] name of [[Dream Multimedia|Dream Multimedia GmbH]].<ref>http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/en/temporary-injunction Temporary injunction against Satco Europe</ref>\n\n== Models ==\n<gallery>\nVu+Duo Front.JPG|Vu+ Duo front\nVu+Duo Back.jpg|Vu+ Duo back\nVU+ Duo2 - front.jpg|VU+ Duo2 front\nVU+ Duo2 - back.jpg|VU+ Duo2 back\n</gallery>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Vu+\t\t\t\t\t\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0106.php Ultimo]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0116.php Ultimo 4k]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0107.php Uno]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0115.php Uno 4k]\t\n![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0117.php Uno 4k SE]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vuplus.com/sub/main.php|title=VU Plus|website=vuplus.com|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0109.php Solo]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0105.php Solo2]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0103.php Solo SE]\t!!Solo SE V2\t\t\t\t\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0113.php Solo 4K]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0108.php Duo]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0104.php Duo2]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0119.php Duo 4K]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0102.php Zero]\t!!Zero 4k\n|- \n!

XBMC will not be made available for older Vu+ set-top boxes due to hardware limitations with missing OpenGL graphics acceleration.<ref>http://www.satnigmo.com/2787/xbmc-kodi-vu-coming-soon/ XBMC (Kodi) for Vu+ coming soon!</ref><ref>http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/01/17/linux-based-vu-dvb-set-top-boxes-now-support-xbmckodi/ Linux based Vu+ DVB Set-top Boxes Now Support XBMC/Kodi</ref>\n\n===Open Black Hole===\n\"''Open Black Hole''\" is an open source project for making unofficial third-party OpenPLi based images for newer Vu+ set-top boxes. Using the XBMC4STB software fork of Kodi/XBMC from Vu+, the images are designed as a hybrid integration between Kodi/XBMC media center software and [[Dreambox]]'s Enigma2 PVR software scripts, forked from OpenPLi (based on [[OpenEmbedded]] Linux operating system for [[embedded system]]s), it is as such also fully compatible with PLi plugins and coding infrastructure. The project was first announced on the 25th of May 2015 and is maintained by the ''Black Hole Team'', a team of independent developers of long popular community driven firmware images for Vu+-based set top-boxes, however these Open Black Hole project images are completely separate from the original Black Hole image for Vu+.<ref>http://git.vuplus-community.net/ Open Black Hole git source code repository</ref><ref>https://www.facebook.com/BlackHoleTeam Black Hole Team</ref><ref>http://www.prismcube-community.net PrismCube-Community.Net</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n*[[Dreambox]]\n*[[DBox2]]\n*[[Slingbox]]\n*[[Kodi (software)|Kodi Entertainment System (formerly XBMC Media Center) software]]\n*[[Video4Linux]]\n*[[Smart TV]]\n*[[Unibox]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n=== Official ===\n* [http://vuplus.com/ Vu+ home page]\n\n=== Image ===\n* [https://www.vuplus-community.net Black Hole Image]\n* [https://www.vuplus-community.net Open BlackHole Image]\n* [http://www.openpli.org OpenPli Image]\n* [http://www.vuplus-support.org/wbb4 VTI Image]\n* [http://www.vuplus-support.co.uk VIX Image]\n* [https://www.opena.tv/downloads/16-vu-plus-images/ OpenATV image]\n\n\n{{Linux devices}}\n{{Home theater PC (application software)}}\n\n[[Category:Satellite television]]\n[[Category:Set-top box]]\n[[Category:Television technology]]\n[[Category:Digital video recorders]]\n[[Category:Linux-based devices]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Vu+''' (pronounced VuPlus), is a series of [[Linux]]-powered [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] [[DVB-S|satellite]], [[DVB-T|terrestrial]] [[digital television]] receivers ([[set-top box]]), produced by [[Korea]]n multimedia brand [[Ceru Co., Ltd.]].\n\n== History and description ==\nAll older Vu+ hardware [[set-top box]]es are [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]-powered, newer are all ARM-powered and uses [[Dreambox|Enigma2]] image based software as [[firmware]].\n\nIts [[firmware]] is officially user-upgradable, since it is a Linux-based computer, as opposed to third-party \"patching\" of alternate receivers. [[Firmware]] is based on [[Enigma (DVB)|Enigma]] 2, which was originally designed for [[Dreambox]] by [[Dream Multimedia]]. All units support [[Conax]] [[conditional access]] (CA) system, with software-emulated [[conditional-access module]]s (CAMs) available for many alternate CA systems. The built-in [[Ethernet]] interface allows networked computers to access the recordings on the internal hard disks and stream live picture from the tuners. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of DVB [[MPEG transport stream]]s on [[Network File System|networked filesystem]]s or broadcast the streams as [[IPTV]] to [[VideoLAN]] and [[XBMC Media Center]] clients. Unlike many PC based [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] systems that use [[free-to-air]] type of DVB receiver cards, the built-in conditional access allows receiving and storing encrypted content.\n\nIn the beginning of September in 2011, [[Dream Multimedia]] obtained a temporary injunction against the Satco Europe GmbH company for using their \"''[[Enigma (DVB)|Enigma]] 2''\" name in an advertising flyer to promote the Linux operating system installed on the Vu+ set-top-boxes, as \"''Enigma\"(2)'' is a [[registered trademark]] name of [[Dream Multimedia|Dream Multimedia GmbH]].<ref>http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/en/temporary-injunction Temporary injunction against Satco Europe</ref>\n\n== Models ==\n<gallery>\nVu+Duo Front.JPG|Vu+ Duo front\nVu+Duo Back.jpg|Vu+ Duo back\nVU+ Duo2 - front.jpg|VU+ Duo2 front\nVU+ Duo2 - back.jpg|VU+ Duo2 back\n</gallery>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Vu+\t\t\t\t\t\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0106.php Ultimo]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0116.php Ultimo 4k]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0107.php Uno]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0115.php Uno 4k]\t\n![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0117.php Uno 4k SE]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vuplus.com/sub/main.php|title=VU Plus|website=vuplus.com|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref>\n![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0109.php Solo]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0105.php Solo2]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0103.php Solo SE]\t!!Solo SE V2\t\t\t\t\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0113.php Solo 4K]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0108.php Duo]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0104.php Duo2]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0119.php Duo 4K]\t!![http://vuplus.com/sub/sub0102.php Zero]\t!!Zero 4k\n|- \n!

The project was first announced on the 25th of May 2015 and is maintained by the ''Black Hole Team'', a team of independent developers of long popular community driven firmware images for Vu+-based set top-boxes, however these Open Black Hole project images are completely separate from the original Black Hole image for Vu+.<ref>http://git.vuplus-community.net/ Open Black Hole git source code repository</ref><ref>https://www.facebook.com/BlackHoleTeam Black Hole Team</ref><ref>http://www.prismcube-community.net PrismCube-Community.Net</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n*[[Dreambox]]\n*[[DBox2]]\n*[[Slingbox]]\n*[[Kodi (software)|Kodi Entertainment System (formerly XBMC Media Center) software]]\n*[[Video4Linux]]\n*[[Smart TV]]\n*[[Unibox]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n=== Official ===\n* [http://vuplus.com/ Vu+ home page]\n\n=== Image ===\n* [https://www.vuplus-community.net Black Hole Image]\n* [https://www.vuplus-community.net Open BlackHole Image]\n* [http://www.openpli.org OpenPli Image]\n* [http://www.vuplus-support.org/wbb4 VTI Image]\n* [http://www.vuplus-support.co.uk VIX Image]\n\n{{Linux devices}}\n{{Home theater PC (application software)}}\n\n[[Category:Satellite television]]\n[[Category:Set-top box]]\n[[Category:Television technology]]\n[[Category:Digital video recorders]]\n[[Category:Linux-based devices]]\n", "name_user": "Nunigaia", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eImage", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vu%2B"}

Pick any combination of four numbers plus a percentage point, use it as your story's stardate. For example, 1313.5 is twelve o'clock noon of one day and 1314.5 would be noon of the next day. Each percentage point is roughly equivalent to [[Decimal time|one-tenth of one day]]. The progression of stardates in <u>your</u> script should remain constant but don't worry about whether or not there is a progression from other scripts. Stardates are a mathematical formula which varies depending on location in the galaxy, velocity of travel, and other factors, can vary widely from episode to episode.}}\n\nThe \"percentage point\" mentioned was, in practice, a single decimal.  The official timeline<ref name=okuda_1ed>{{cite book|last=Okuda|first=Mike|authorlink=Michael Okuda|author2=Okuda, Denise|title=Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future|isbn=0-671-79611-9|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1993|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/startrekchronolo00okud}}</ref> places the original series between the years 2265 and 2269, with the second pilot beginning on stardate 1312.4 and the last-produced episode on stardate 5928.5; however, this timeline is based on references in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and had not been developed during the production of the original series. Despite the guideline to \"pick any combination\", the [[List of Star Trek: The Original Series episodes|list of episodes]] shows stardates increasing with time in general, albeit with many instances of a number being lower than in the preceding episode.\n\nThe pilot of ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' takes place on stardate 1207.3, which is stated precisely to be Sunday, May 11, 2256.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Vulcan Hello |series=Star Trek: Discovery |network=CBS |date=September 24, 2017 |season=1}}</ref>\n\n==''The Next Generation'' era==\nStardates were revised from the above description for ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and all the subsequent shows and movies set in the same era. They were described as follows in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation Writer's/Director's Guide'' of March 23, 1987 (p.&nbsp;13):\n\n{{quotation|A stardate is a five-digit number followed by a decimal point and one more digit. Example: \"41254.7.\" The first two digits of the stardate are <u>always</u> \"41.\" The 4 stands for 24th century, the 1 indicates first [[TV season|season]]. The additional three leading digits will progress unevenly during the course of the season from 000 to 999. The digit following the decimal point is generally regarded as a day counter.}}\n\nStardates of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' began with 46379.1, corresponding to the sixth season of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' which was also set in the year 2369. ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' began with stardate 48315.6 (2371), one season after ''TNG'' had finished its seventh and final season. As in ''TNG'', the second digit would increase by one every season, while the initial two digits eventually rolled over from 49 to 50, despite the year 2373 still being in the 24th century. ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' was set around stardate 56844.9, which is so far the highest stardate to have been mentioned in the prime reality of the [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]].\n\n==''Star Trek'' alternate timeline films==\nAccording to [[Roberto Orci]], stardates were revised again for the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film ''Star Trek'']] so that the first four digits correspond to the year, while the remainder was intended to stand for the day of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekmovie.com/2009/02/20/thr-profiles-treks-big-return-w-trailer-details-comments-from-orci-kurtzman/#1551846 |title=THR Profiles Trek\u2019s Big Return w/ Trailer Details + Comments from Orci & Kurtzman |publisher=TrekMovie.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekmovie.com/2009/05/18/orci-kurtzman-to-answer-fan-questions-at-trekmovie-transcript-of-last-weeks-impromptu-qa/#1831160 |title=Orci & Kurtzman To Answer Fan Questions At TrekMovie + Transcript Of Last Week\u2019s \u2018Impromptu\u2019 Q&A |publisher=TrekMovie.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref><ref name=OrciTweet>{{cite web |title= Stardate - standard year ... |url= https://twitter.com/boborci/status/13982542733 |date= May 14, 2010 |author= Orci, Roberto |publisher= Twitter |accessdate= June 27, 2011 |authorlink= Roberto Orci}}</ref> In the first installment of the movie trilogy, Spock makes his log of the destruction of Vulcan on stardate 2258.42, or February 11, 2258.<ref>http://i.imgur.com/Ft2c5bd.png</ref>{{Better source|date=November 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/Ft2c5bd.png|title=Stardate Screenshot}}</ref> ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' begins on stardate 2259.55, or February 24, 2259.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://trekmovie.com/2012/12/14/analysis-of-star-trek-into-darkness-imax-prologue-open-thread-for-prologue-trailer-2/ |title=Analysis Of Star Trek Into Darkness IMAX Extended Preview + Open Thread For Prologue & Trailer #2 |publisher=TrekMovie.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref> ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' begins on stardate 2263.02, or January 2, 2263.\n\n==''Star Trek Online''==\nThe [[MMORPG]] ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' (''STO'') was launched in 2009 and began on stardate 86088.58, in the year 2409.<ref name=STOPWEI1>{{cite web|title=About Start Trek Online|url=http://sto.perfectworld.com/about|work=sto.perfectworld.com|publisher=Perfect World Entertainment Inc.|accessdate=1 February 2014|year=2014|quote=Set in 2409, Star Trek Online exists [...]}}</ref>\n\n==Pronunciation==\nIn the various TV series, four-digit stardates have been read out in groups of two digits as well as digit-by-digit, whereas only the latter pronunciation has been used with five-digit stardates.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family later settled in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> \n\nWhen the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\" /> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the [[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\" />\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson later told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> \n\nThe Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\" /> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\" /> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\" />\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist Diane Barwick met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family later settled in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> \n\nWhen the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\" /> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the [[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\" />\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson later told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist Diane Barwick met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna.
