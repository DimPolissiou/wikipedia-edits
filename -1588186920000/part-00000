{"title_page": "List of commercial video games with available source code", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{about||open source video games|List of open source video games|commercial games which were released as freeware without source code|List of commercial video games released as freeware}}\nThis is a '''list of commercial video games with [[Source-available software|available source code]]'''. The [[source code]] of these commercially developed and distributed [[video game]]s is available to the public or the games' communities.\n\n== Motivation ==\nCommercial video games are typically developed as [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[closed source]] [[software product]]s, with the source code treated as a [[trade secret]] (unlike [[open-source video game]]s). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming [[abandonware|abandoned]].\n\n== Description ==\nIn several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) [[software license]]s to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. [[SourceForge]] or [[GitHub]]), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an [[interpreted language]] such as [[BASIC]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and distributed as raw source code without being [[Compiler|compiled]]; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. In some cases when a game's source code is not available by other means, the game's community \"reconstructs\" source code from compiled [[binary file]]s through time-demanding [[reverse engineering]] techniques. \nSource code availability in whatever form allows the games' communities to study how the game works, make modifications, and provide technical support themselves when the official support has ended, e.g. with [[unofficial patch]]es to fix bugs or [[source port]]s to make the game compatible with new [[Computing platform|platforms]].\n\n== Games with instantly included source code ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!First release\n!Source code release\n!Genre\n!Engine license\n!Content license\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[A Dark Room]]''\n|2013\n|2013\n|[[Online text-based role-playing game]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|Doublespeak Games\n|In July 2013 the [[source code]] of the game was put on [[GitHub]] under [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]] 2.0.<ref>[http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ A Dark Room goes open source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907210142/http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ |date=2015-09-07 }} on doublespeakgames.com (July 3, 2013)</ref> Became commercially successful after the source code release.\n|-\n|''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom]]''\n|1979\n|1979\n|[[Role-playing video game]]\n|public domain\n|Freeware\n|[[Richard Garriott]]\n|[[Richard Garriott]] distributed the [[Applesoft BASIC]] written game originally as source code.

Techniques used to accomplish this are [[Decompiler|decompiling]], [[Disassembler|disassembling]], and [[reverse engineering]] the binary [[executable]]. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but rather a divergent version, as a binary program does not contain all of the information originally carried in the source code. For example, comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional [[Debugging|debug]] information.\n\nUsing the techniques listed above within a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|\"bottom-up\" development methodology]] process, the re-created source-code of a game is able to replicate the behavior of the original game exactly, often being \"clock-cycle accurate\", and/or \"pixel-per-pixel accurate\".  This approach is in contrast to that used by [[game engine recreation]]s, which are often made using a \"top-down\" development methodology, and which can result in duplicating the general features provided by a [[game engine]], but not necessarily an accurate representation of the original game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!Original release\n!Source code reconstructed\n!Genre\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[Albion (video game)|Albion]]''\n|1996\n|2011\n|[[Adventure game]]\n|[[Blue Byte]]\n|In 2011 via [[static recompilation]] from the original [[x86]] binary executable a port for the [[ARM architecture]] of the [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] [[handheld]] was created by fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |title=Albion |date=2011-11-06 |author=M-HT |accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=openpandora.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071307/http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |publisher=repo.openpandora.org |quote=''This is a port of the game's executable for Pandora (using static recompilation/binary translation).'' |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331042620/http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |archivedate=2014-03-31 }}</ref> The community still updates this recompiled version and released also Windows and Linux builds in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/page-4#entry375940 |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-24 |publisher=boards.openpandora.org |quote=''Here is a version for Windows, in case anyone is interested.

The [[source code]] of these commercially developed and distributed [[video game]]s is available to the public or the games' communities.\n\n== Motivation ==\nCommercial video games are typically developed as [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[closed source]] [[software product]]s, with the source code treated as a [[trade secret]] (unlike [[open-source video game]]s). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming [[abandonware|abandoned]].\n\n== Description ==\nIn several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) [[software license]]s to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. [[SourceForge]] or [[GitHub]]), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an [[interpreted language]] such as [[BASIC]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and distributed as raw source code without being [[Compiler|compiled]]; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''.

Techniques used to accomplish this are [[Decompiler|decompiling]], [[Disassembler|disassembling]], and [[reverse engineering]] the binary [[executable]]. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but rather a divergent version, as a binary program does not contain all of the information originally carried in the source code. For example, comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional [[Debugging|debug]] information.\n\nUsing the techniques listed above within a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|\"bottom-up\" development methodology]] process, the re-created source-code of a game is able to replicate the behavior of the original game exactly, often being \"clock-cycle accurate\", and/or \"pixel-per-pixel accurate\".  This approach is in contrast to that used by [[game engine recreation]]s, which are often made using a \"top-down\" development methodology, and which can result in duplicating the general features provided by a [[game engine]], but not necessarily an accurate representation of the original game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!Original release\n!Source code reconstructed\n!Genre\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[Albion (video game)|Albion]]''\n|1996\n|2011\n|[[Adventure game]]\n|[[Blue Byte]]\n|In 2011 via [[static recompilation]] from the original [[x86]] binary executable a port for the [[ARM architecture]] of the [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] [[handheld]] was created by fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |title=Albion |date=2011-11-06 |author=M-HT |accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=openpandora.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071307/http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |publisher=repo.openpandora.org |quote=''This is a port of the game's executable for Pandora (using static recompilation/binary translation).'' |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331042620/http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |archivedate=2014-03-31 }}</ref> The community still updates this recompiled version and released also Windows and Linux builds in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/page-4#entry375940 |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-24 |publisher=boards.openpandora.org |quote=''Here is a version for Windows, in case anyone is interested.

Doug does not want to attend her father [[Arthur Spooner|Arthur's]] wedding to Ava St. Clair ([[Lainie Kazan]]), which takes place in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]]; instead, he stays at home watching ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', and several references to the game show are made, including contestants bidding on a prize, and Doug yelling to the TV that \"the Rice-a-Roni is much cheaper than the Turtle Wax\" and ranting about how \"Ensign Curtis just cost himself a trip to the Showcase Showdown\". However, his best friend [[The King of Queens#Cast and characters|Deacon Palmer]] takes him to Poughkeepsie anyway.\n\nAva St. Clair reveals to Carrie that after a few failed marriages, she now only marries gay men. Ava later learns that Arthur is not gay and promptly leaves the ceremony, without informing Arthur. Carrie attempts to comfort Arthur by telling him, \"She had wanted a companion.\" Arthur refuses to announce that the wedding is off, and proposes to Veronica Olchin, Spence's mother ([[Anne Meara]]) in the men's room. She at first declines, but later accepts. Carrie and Spence are both surprised and against the decision. The ceremony is performed by [[Rabbi]] Feldman ([[Josh Cooke]]), because the original bride Ava was Jewish, although neither Arthur nor Veronica is Jewish. The wedding ends with Arthur smashing a glass with his foot, while everyone cheers, \"[[Mazel tov]]!\".\n\nImmediately afterward, Carrie is notified that the baby she and Doug wanted to adopt is waiting for them in [[Beijing]]. However, Doug does not want to have a baby with her anymore because of her betrayal regarding the apartment. A very pregnant Holly ([[Nicole Sullivan]]) also shows up at the wedding, as does the Heffernans\u2019 neighbor [[Lou Ferrigno]]. At this point, it is also revealed that Holly's husband recently left her. When Lou tries to cheer everyone up with \"Such a Happy Day,\" he is greeted by very unhappy expressions.\n\nDoug, who sits outside in the back of the building where the ceremony is performed, makes an offer to Spence to become his new roommate, since he is divorcing Carrie, but later retracts the offer when Holly tells him her story. Very drunk, he challenges each of them to a wrestling match, but falls asleep while fighting with Holly. When Arthur learns that Doug will not toast him as his best man, he pitches the role to Spence, who turns it down, and ultimately, Deacon is forced to make the toast, though Deacon pleads that he doesn't know him that well.\n\nSpence tries to move back in with Doug's cousin Danny because Arthur will be living with his wife Veronica now. He learns, however, that Danny is uncircumcised.\n\nHolly and Spence begin talking and realize that they both don't have a place to stay, so they decide to get an apartment together. Danny returns without Sandy, and suggests that Spence and he move back in together. Spence accepts, leaving Holly alone without a place to stay.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly points out to Carrie that she shouldn't feel so guilty about keeping the apartment, because Doug let Carrie down many times in the past. Carrie is convinced and tells Doug off.\n\nBoth decide that they want to get the baby for themselves and board the same plane, although Carrie leaves the house first, and Doug has to find his passport, which Deacon finds in the vegetable crisper. Holly met Rabbi Feldman and they hit it off. Holly is going to move in with him and convert to Judaism. Doug later surprises Carrie on board the plane, by greeting her with a gruff \"Hello!\" and showing her his passport in triumph. He also adds that \"Deacon's BLT was delicious, as is my revenge.\"\n\nThey use the long flight to sort out their problems and remain together. After getting baby Ming-Mei from the adoption agency, Carrie finds out that she is pregnant. She is scared about the changes to come, but Doug is optimistic that they will be able to handle it together.\n\nThe episode fast-forwards one year and shows Doug and Carrie with their two small children in their living room not doing so well. Arthur suddenly comes in with a suitcase, announcing that his marriage \"didn't work out. So he moves back in the basement leaving Doug and Carrie speechless.\"\n\nThe episode ends with a three-minute montage of scenes from the show's nine seasons to [[A Million Billion]]'s song \"Milk & Honey\".  As the song concludes, the series ends with a final [[Screenshot|screen shot]]: \"''thanks for the ride...''\". This montage is not included in the version released on Blu-ray or in syndication, instead ending immediately after the living room scene.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Kevin James]]&nbsp;as [[Doug Heffernan]]\n* [[Leah Remini]]&nbsp;as [[Carrie Heffernan]]\n* [[Jerry Stiller]]&nbsp;as [[Arthur Spooner]]\n* [[Victor Williams]]&nbsp;as [[Deacon Palmer]]\n* [[Patton Oswalt]]&nbsp;as [[Spence Olchin]]\n* [[Gary Valentine]]&nbsp;as [[Danny Heffernan]]\n* [[Merrin Dungey]]&nbsp;as [[Kelly Palmer]]\n* [[Nicole Sullivan]]&nbsp;as [[Holly Shumpert]]\n* [[Anne Meara]]&nbsp;as Veronica\n* [[Lou Ferrigno]]&nbsp;as Himself\n* [[Lainie Kazan]]&nbsp;as Ava St. Clair\n* [[Josh Cooke]]&nbsp;as Rabbi Feldman\n* [[Jillian Bach]]&nbsp;as Sandy\n* [[Jackie Flynn]]&nbsp;as Band Leader\n* [[Adam Ferrara]]&nbsp;as Waiter\n* [[Carla Ferrigno]]&nbsp;as Carla\n* [[Shelby Adamowsky]]&nbsp;as Eloise\n* [[Shannon Farrara]]&nbsp;as Shannon\n\n== Original airings by country ==\n\n* USA \u2013 The episode originally aired on [[CBS]] on May 14, 2007.

It was taped March 15, 2007; it originally aired on May 14, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frontier.cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2007/03/king-of-queens-finale.asp|title=Cincinnati Enquirer  - cincinnati.com|website=Cincinnati.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter [[Doug Heffernan|Doug]] learns that his wife [[Carrie Heffernan|Carrie]] has not given up the apartment in Manhattan as she promised, though he quit his job as an IPS driver for a job as a salesperson, which she requested that he do, he is furious. Doug does not want to attend her father [[Arthur Spooner|Arthur's]] wedding to Ava St. Clair ([[Lainie Kazan]]), which takes place in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]]; instead, he stays at home watching ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', and several references to the game show are made, including contestants bidding on a prize, and Doug yelling to the TV that \"the Rice-a-Roni is much cheaper than the Turtle Wax\" and ranting about how \"Ensign Curtis just cost himself a trip to the Showcase Showdown\". However, his best friend [[The King of Queens#Cast and characters|Deacon Palmer]] takes him to Poughkeepsie anyway.\n\nAva St. Clair reveals to Carrie that after a few failed marriages, she now only marries gay men. Ava later learns that Arthur is not gay and promptly leaves the ceremony, without informing Arthur. Carrie attempts to comfort Arthur by telling him, \"She had wanted a companion.\" Arthur refuses to announce that the wedding is off, and proposes to Veronica Olchin, Spence's mother ([[Anne Meara]]) in the men's room. She at first declines, but later accepts. Carrie and Spence are both surprised and against the decision. The ceremony is performed by [[Rabbi]] Feldman ([[Josh Cooke]]), because the original bride Ava was Jewish, although neither Arthur nor Veronica is Jewish. The wedding ends with Arthur smashing a glass with his foot, while everyone cheers, \"[[Mazel tov]]!\".\n\nImmediately afterward, Carrie is notified that the baby she and Doug wanted to adopt is waiting for them in [[Beijing]]. However, Doug does not want to have a baby with her anymore because of her betrayal regarding the apartment. A very pregnant Holly ([[Nicole Sullivan]]) also shows up at the wedding, as does the Heffernans\u2019 neighbor [[Lou Ferrigno]]. At this point, it is also revealed that Holly's husband recently left her. When Lou tries to cheer everyone up with \"Such a Happy Day,\" he is greeted by very unhappy expressions.\n\nDoug, who sits outside in the back of the building where the ceremony is performed, makes an offer to Spence to become his new roommate, since he is divorcing Carrie, but later retracts the offer when Holly tells him her story. Very drunk, he challenges each of them to a wrestling match, but falls asleep while fighting with Holly. When Arthur learns that Doug will not toast him as his best man, he pitches the role to Spence, who turns it down, and ultimately, Deacon is forced to make the toast, though Deacon pleads that he doesn't know him that well.\n\nSpence tries to move back in with Doug's cousin Danny because Arthur will be living with his wife Veronica now. He learns, however, that Danny is uncircumcised.\n\nHolly and Spence begin talking and realize that they both don't have a place to stay, so they decide to get an apartment together. Danny returns without Sandy, and suggests that Spence and he move back in together. Spence accepts, leaving Holly alone without a place to stay.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly points out to Carrie that she shouldn't feel so guilty about keeping the apartment, because Doug let Carrie down many times in the past. Carrie is convinced and tells Doug off.\n\nBoth decide that they want to get the baby for themselves and board the same plane, although Carrie leaves the house first, and Doug has to find his passport, which Deacon finds in the vegetable crisper. Holly met Rabbi Feldman and they hit it off. Holly is going to move in with him and convert to Judaism. Doug later surprises Carrie on board the plane, by greeting her with a gruff \"Hello!\" and showing her his passport in triumph. He also adds that \"Deacon's BLT was delicious, as is my revenge.\"\n\nThey use the long flight to sort out their problems and remain together. After getting baby Ming-Mei from the adoption agency, Carrie finds out that she is pregnant. She is scared about the changes to come, but Doug is optimistic that they will be able to handle it together.\n\nThe episode fast-forwards one year and shows Doug and Carrie with their two small children in their living room not going so well. Arthur suddenly comes in with a suitcase, announcing that his marriage \"didn't work out. So he moves back in the basement leaving Doug and Carrie speechless.\"\n\nThe episode ends with a three-minute montage of scenes from the show's nine seasons to [[A Million Billion]]'s song \"Milk & Honey\".  As the song concludes, the series ends with a final [[Screenshot|screen shot]]: \"''thanks for the ride...''\". This montage is not included in the version released on Blu-ray or in syndication, instead ending immediately after the living room scene.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Kevin James]]&nbsp;as [[Doug Heffernan]]\n* [[Leah Remini]]&nbsp;as [[Carrie Heffernan]]\n* [[Jerry Stiller]]&nbsp;as [[Arthur Spooner]]\n* [[Victor Williams]]&nbsp;as [[Deacon Palmer]]\n* [[Patton Oswalt]]&nbsp;as [[Spence Olchin]]\n* [[Gary Valentine]]&nbsp;as [[Danny Heffernan]]\n* [[Merrin Dungey]]&nbsp;as [[Kelly Palmer]]\n* [[Nicole Sullivan]]&nbsp;as [[Holly Shumpert]]\n* [[Anne Meara]]&nbsp;as Veronica\n* [[Lou Ferrigno]]&nbsp;as Himself\n* [[Lainie Kazan]]&nbsp;as Ava St. Clair\n* [[Josh Cooke]]&nbsp;as Rabbi Feldman\n* [[Jillian Bach]]&nbsp;as Sandy\n* [[Jackie Flynn]]&nbsp;as Band Leader\n* [[Adam Ferrara]]&nbsp;as Waiter\n* [[Carla Ferrigno]]&nbsp;as Carla\n* [[Shelby Adamowsky]]&nbsp;as Eloise\n* [[Shannon Farrara]]&nbsp;as Shannon\n\n== Original airings by country ==\n\n* USA \u2013 The episode originally aired on [[CBS]] on May 14, 2007.
