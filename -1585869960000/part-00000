In addition to the major plates, several smaller plates are recognised. The [[South Bismarck Plate]] is moving southeastward relative to the Pacific Plate (or another microplate) and its northern boundary in the Bismarck Sea is made up of segments that are alternately extensional and sinistral [[transform fault|transform]] in type. At its eastern end, where it runs close to [[New Ireland Province|New Ireland]], this boundary is formed by the Weitin Fault, although it is unclear whether that fault is just one of the structures that carries the plate motion. Depending on assumptions, this part of the boundary accommodates 134\u2013139 mm per year of relative plate motion. The southern boundary of the Bismarck Sea Plate is formed by a convergent boundary where [[oceanic crust]] of the [[Solomon Sea Plate]] is [[subduction|subducting]] northwards along the New Britain Trench, forming the [[New Britain]] [[island arc]]. It is unclear how these two boundaries link together, as the Weitin Fault becomes difficult to trace southeast of New Ireland.<ref name=\"Tregoning_etal_1999\">{{Cite journal |last=Tregoning |first=P. |last2=Jackson |first2=R.J. |last3=McQueen |first3=H. |last4=Lambeck |first4=K. |last5=Stevens |first5=C. |last6=Little |first6=R.P. |last7=Curely |first7=R. |last8=Rosa |first8=R. |year=1999 |title=Motion of the South Bismarck Plate, Papua New Guinea |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=26 |issue=23 |pages=3517\u20133520 |doi=10.1029/1999GL010840}}</ref><ref name=\"Park_&_Mori_2007\">{{Cite journal |last=Park |first=S.-C. |last2=Mori |first2=J. |year=2007 |title=Triggering of earthquakes during the 2000 Papua New Guinea earthquake sequence |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |volume=112 |issue=B3 |doi=10.1029/2006JB004480}}</ref> To the southeast, the New Britain Trench links to the Solomon Islands Trench along which the Solomon Sea Plate subducts beneath the Pacific Plate.<ref name=tsun/>\n\n==Earthquake sequence==\nThe first of the large earthquakes in the sequence occurred at 04:54 on 16 November, and is regarded as the mainshock, although the two later events are unusually large for aftershocks and occurred on different fault systems with different [[focal mechanism]]s. The mainshock had a magnitude in the range {{M|w}} 8.0\u20138.2,<ref name=\"Park_&_Mori_2007\"/><ref name=tsun/> and was mainly [[strike-slip]] in type, although some component of dip-slip has been noted, particularly towards the southeastern end of the rupture. Strike-slip movement was observed along the onshore part of the Weitin Fault on New Ireland, with a maximum displacement of 5 m. A rupture length of about 100\u2013120 km has been estimated for this earthquake.<ref name=\"Tregoning_etal_2005\">{{Cite journal |last=Tregoning |first=P. |last2=Sambridge |first2=M. |last3=McQueen |first3=H. |last4=Toulmin |first4=S. |last5=Nicholson |first5=T. |year=2005 |title=Tectonic interpretation of aftershock relocations in eastern Papua New Guinea using teleseismic data and the arrival pattern method |journal=Geophysical Journal International |volume=160 |issue=3 |pages=1103\u20131111 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.2005.02567.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Park_&_Mori_2007\"/>\n\nThe second large shock in the sequence occurred about three hours after the mainshock, at 07:42 on 16 November. This earthquake had a magnitude in the range {{M|w}} 7.3\u20137.8 and was of [[thrust fault|thrust]] type, most likely caused by rupture of the plate boundary interface in the New Britain Trench subduction zone. An analysis of [[Coulomb stress transfer]] after the mainshock suggest that there was a major increase in static stress along that part of the plate boundary.<ref name=\"Park_&_Mori_2007\"/>\n\nThe final large shock in the sequence occurred on the following day at 21:01 on 17 November. This earthquake had a magnitude in the range {{M|w}} 7.3\u20137.8 and was also of thrust type along another part of the same plate boundary as the second shock. Only a small increase in static stress has been modelled for the combined effects of the earlier two large earthquakes in the sequence.<ref name=\"Park_&_Mori_2007\"/>\n\n==Tsunami==\nSignificant tsunami waves were observed on the islands of Duke of York, Bougainville and Buka (2.5\u20133.0 m) and on the southern coast of New Ireland (3.0 m at [[Lamassa]]). Run-ups of a metre were noted on the [[Trobriand Islands]] and on [[Gizo, Solomon Islands|Gizo]] and [[Noro, Solomon Islands|Noro]] of the [[Solomon Islands]]. The tsunami was also recorded by [[tide gauge]]s on the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]].<ref name=tsun/>\n\nModelling of tsunamis generated by the mainshock and the first large aftershock are consistent with the observed run-ups. The mainshock, despite it's mainly strike-slip nature appears to be the cause of the tsunami observed on New Ireland. The reason that the mainshock generated a tsunami may either be due the change to a more dip-slip type motion at the southeastern end of the rupture or a result of lateral movement on the relatively steep bathymetric slope in that area. The effects on Bougainville match those modelled for the first large aftershock.<ref name=tsun/>\n\n==Damage==\nThe mainshock was associated with widespread damage on Duke of York and in parts of New Ireland and New Britain, particularly from landslides. The triggered tsunami caused further damage on Bougainville, destroying houses and leaving 200 people homeless and at Lamassa  on New Ireland where a hundred homes and a church were destroyed.<ref name=tsun/> Two people died as a result of the mainshock, one on Duke of York and one on New Ireland.<ref name=\"SECED_Newsletter_2001\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.seced.org.uk/images/newsletters/Newsletter%20vol%2015%20no%201.pdf |title=A Summary of Earthquakes in 2000 |last=Galloway |first=D. |last2=Walker |first2=A. |series=SEDED Newsletter Volume 15 No. 1 |orig-year=2001}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of earthquakes in 2000]]\n*[[List of earthquakes in Papua New Guinea]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160812104328/http://iisee.kenken.go.jp/staff/yagi/eq/PNG/ Preliminary Results of Rupture Process for November 16, 2000 New Ireland Region, Papua New Guinea Earthquake]\n*{{EQ-isc-link|1913438}}\n\n{{Earthquakes in 2000}}\n{{Earthquakes in Papua New Guinea}}\n\n[[Category:2000 earthquakes|New Ireland]]\n[[Category:2000 in Papua New Guinea|New Ireland earthquake]]\n[[Category:2000 tsunamis|2000 New Ireland]]\n[[Category:Earthquakes in Papua New Guinea]]\n[[Category:Tsunamis in Papua New Guinea]]\n[[Category:Earthquake clusters, swarms, and sequences]]\n", "text_old": "{{Earthquake\n|title= 2000 New Ireland earthquakes\n|timestamp-A = 2000-11-16 04:54:59\n|timestamp-B = 2000-11-16 07:42:20\n|timestamp-C = 2000-11-17 21:01:59\n|isc-event-A = 1913438\n|isc-event-B = 1838286\n|isc-event-C = 1741952\n|anss-url-A = usp000a3qq\n|anss-url-B = usp000a3sp\n|anss-url-C = usp000a45f\n|local-date = {{Start-date|November 16, 2000}}\n|local-time-A = 14:54:59\n|local-time-B = 17:42:20\n|local-time-C = 07:01:59\n|image=\n|map2 = {{Location map | Papua New Guinea\n| relief = 1\n| AlternativeMap = Papua New Guinea relief location map.jpg\n| label =\n| lat = -3.980\n| long = 152.169\n| mark = Bullseye1.png\n| marksize = 40\n| position = top\n| width = 250\n| float = right\n| caption =}}\n|magnitude-A = {{M|w|8.0}}\n|magnitude-B = {{M|w|7.8}}\n|magnitude-C = {{M|w|7.8}}\n|depth={{convert|33|km|mi|0}}\n|location={{coord|3.980|S|152.169|E|display=inline,title}}\n|countries affected = [[Papua New Guinea]]\n|tsunami = Yes\n|casualties = 2 killed\n}}\n\nThe '''2000 New Ireland earthquakes''' occurred off the coast of [[New Ireland Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]] on November 16 and 17.\n\nThe mainshock was a magnitude 8.0 [[moment magnitude scale|M<sub>w</sub>]]<ref>[http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/2000/eq_001116_b/ Magnitude 8.0 NEW IRELAND REGION, P.N.G.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605054345/http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/2000/eq_001116_b/ |date=2009-06-05 }} [[United States Geological Survey]]</ref> [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] event that occurred on November 16 at 04:54 UTC, and ruptured a section of the [[Transform fault|transform]] boundary between the [[North Bismarck Plate|north]] and [[South Bismarck Plate|south Bismarck plates]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jepsjmo/cd-rom/2001cd-rom/pdf/sn/sn-p012_e.pdf |title=The New Ireland earthquakes of November 16, 2000, and the tsunami generated by the earthquake |access-date=July 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611232152/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jepsjmo/cd-rom/2001cd-rom/pdf/sn/sn-p012_e.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  A 7.8 magnitude<ref>[http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/2000/eq_001116_a/ Magnitude 7.8 NEW IRELAND REGION, P.N.G.] [[United States Geological Survey]]</ref> [[thrust fault|thrust]] earthquake followed at 07:42 UTC with its epicenter 175&nbsp;km south of the first earthquake at the southern end of its rupture zone at {{coord|5.496|S|  151.781|E|display=inline}}.

Audio return channel (ARC) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1.4 standard.<ref name=\"HDMIwebsiteARC\"/> \"Return\" refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent \"upstream\" to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver.<ref name=\"HDMIwebsiteARC\"/> An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial/satellite broadcast, or has a video source built in, sends the audio \"upstream\" to the AV receiver.<ref name=\"HDMIwebsiteARC\"/>\n\nThe HDMI standard was not designed to pass [[closed caption]] data (for example, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]) to the television for decoding.<ref>[[Closed captions#HDTV interoperability issues]]</ref> As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to appear on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a [[DVD]] player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an [[HDTV]] has no way to pass [[Closed captioning|Closed Captioning]] data so that the HDTV can decode it, as there is [[Closed captioning#HDTV interoperability issues|no line 21 VBI]] in that format.\n\n===Communication channels===\nHDMI has three physically separate communication channels, which are the DDC, TMDS and the optional CEC.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a78.1}} HDMI 1.4 added ARC and HEC.<ref name=HDMIwebsiteARC/><ref name=HDMIwebsiteHEC/>\n\n====Display Data Channel (DDC)====\n{{Main|Display Data Channel}}\nThe [[Display Data Channel]] (DDC) is a communication channel based on the [[I\u00b2C]] bus specification. HDMI specifically requires the device implement the [[Display Data Channel#Enhanced Display Data Channel (E-DDC)|Enhanced Display Data Channel]] (E-DDC), which is used by the HDMI source device to read the [[Extended display identification data#Enhanced EDID (E-EDID)|E-EDID]] data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio/video formats it can take.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a7\u00a78.1,CEC-1.2\u2013CEC-1.3}} HDMI requires that the E-DDC implement [[I\u00b2C]] standard mode speed (100&nbsp;[[kbit/s]]) and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed (400&nbsp;kbit/s).<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a74.2.8}}\n\nThe DDC channel is actively used for [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] (HDCP).\n\n====Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS)====\n[[Transition-minimized differential signaling]] (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, audio and auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video Data Period, the pixels of an active video line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a75.1.2}}\n\nBoth HDMI and [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] use TMDS to send 10-bit characters that are encoded using [[8b/10b encoding]] that differs from the original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of [[BCH code|BCH]] ECC parity data for [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|error correction]] and describes the contents of the packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and [[Color depth|Color Depth]] (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for [[deep color]]). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the [[color space]] being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a7\u00a75.2\u20135.3,6.5.3,6.7.2,6.7.3}}\n\n====Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)====\n{{Main|Consumer Electronics Control}}\nConsumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI,<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/5463/pulseeight-usb-cec-adapter-review Pulse-Eight USB CEC Adapter Review]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/143777/the_secret_feature_on_your_hdtv_hdmi_cec.html|title=The Secret Feature on Your HDTV: HDMI CEC|date=March 26, 2008|work=TechHive}}</ref> by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a [[television set]], [[set-top box]], and [[DVD player]] using only the remote control of the TV).

The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165{{nbsp}}MHz (4.95{{nbsp}}[[Gbit/s]] bandwidth per link), the same as DVI. It defines two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96{{nbsp}}Gbit/s of video bandwidth ({{resx|1920|1080}} or {{resx|1920|1200}} at 60{{nbsp}}Hz) and 8-channel [[Linear pulse code modulation|LPCM]]/192&nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]]/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 requires support for RGB video, with optional support for {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device has support for {{YCbCr}} on other interfaces). Color depth of 10{{nbsp}}bpc (30{{nbsp}}bit/px) or 12{{nbsp}}bpc (36{{nbsp}}bit/px) is allowed when using 4:2:2 subsampling, but only 8{{nbsp}}bpc (24{{nbsp}}bit/px) color depth is permitted when using RGB or {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4.

It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120&nbsp;Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would not be required to support {{YCbCr}} output.<ref name=\"HDMI1.2a\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Specification Version 1.2a|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826114318/http://read.pudn.com/downloads72/doc/261979/HDMI_Specification_1.2a.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-26 |url=http://read.pudn.com/downloads72/doc/261979/HDMI_Specification_1.2a.pdf|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|at=\u00a76.2.3}}\n\n'''HDMI 1.2a''' was released on December 14, 2005 and fully specifies [[Consumer Electronics Control|Consumer Electronic Control]] (CEC) features, command sets and CEC compliance tests.<ref name=\"HDMI1.2a\"/>\n\n===Version 1.3===\n\nHDMI 1.3 was released on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] (10.2&nbsp;Gbit/s).<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/><ref name=\"HDMI2006pr\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.twice.com/article/259052-HDMI_1_3_Connections_Due_By_Year_End.php |title=HDMI 1.3 Connections Due By Year End |author=Joseph Palenchar |publisher=TWICE |date=June 19, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110084242/http://www.twice.com/article/259052-HDMI_1_3_Connections_Due_By_Year_End.php |archivedate=November 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16&nbsp;Gbit/s (1920{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}1080 at 120&nbsp;Hz or 2560{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}1440 at 60&nbsp;Hz).

HDMI 2.1 also introduces a new HDMI cable category called ''Ultra High Speed'' (referred to as ''48G'' during development), which certifies cables at the new higher speeds that these formats require. Ultra High Speed HDMI cables are backwards compatible with older HDMI devices, and older cables are compatible with new HDMI 2.1 devices, though the full 48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth is not possible without the new cables.\n\nAdditional features of HDMI 2.1:<ref name=\"HDMI21January2017Anandtech\">{{cite news |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11003/hdmi-21-announced-8kp60-48gbps-cable |title=HDMI 2.1 Announced|author=Anton Shilov |publisher=Anandtech |date=2017-01-05 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref><ref name=\"HDMI21Release\"/>\n\n* Maximum supported resolution is [[10K resolution|10K]] at 120{{nbsp}}Hz\n* Dynamic HDR for specifying HDR metadata on a scene-by-scene or even a frame-by-frame basis\n* [[Display Stream Compression]] (DSC) 1.2 is used for video formats higher than 8K with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling\n* [[High frame rate|High Frame Rate]] (HFR) for 4K, 8K, and 10K, which adds support for refresh rates up to 120{{nbsp}}Hz\n* Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC) for object-based audio formats such as [[Dolby Atmos]] and [[DTS:X]]\n* Enhanced refresh rate features:\n** Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) reduces or eliminates lag, stutter and frame tearing for more fluid motion in games\n** Quick Media Switching (QMS) for movies and video eliminates the delay that can result in blank screens before content begins to be displayed\n** Quick Frame Transport (QFT) reduces latency by bursting individual pictures across the HDMI link as fast as possible when the link's hardware supports more bandwidth than the minimum amount needed for the resolution and frame rate of the content. With QFT, individual pictures arrive earlier and some hardware blocks can be fully powered off for longer periods of time between pictures to reduce heat generation and extend battery life.\n* Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM){{Snd}} When a display device supports the option to either optimize its pixel processing for best latency or best pixel processing, ALLM allows the current HDMI source device to automatically select, based on its better understanding of the nature of its own content, which mode the user would most likely prefer.\n\nVideo formats that require more bandwidth than 18.0 Gbit/s (4K 60{{nbsp}}Hz 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB), such as 4K 60{{nbsp}}Hz 10{{nbsp}}bpc (HDR), 4K 120{{nbsp}}Hz, and 8K 60{{nbsp}}Hz, may require the new \"Ultra High Speed\" or \"Ultra High Speed with Ethernet\" cables.<ref name=\"HDMI21Introduction\" /> HDMI 2.1's other new features are supported with existing HDMI cables.\n\nThe increase in maximum bandwidth is achieved by increasing both the bitrate of the data channels and the number of channels. Previous HDMI versions use three data channels (each operating at up to 6.0{{nbsp}}GHz in HDMI 2.0, or up to 3.4{{nbsp}}GHz in HDMI 1.4), with an additional channel for the TMDS clock signal, which runs at a fraction of the data channel speed (one tenth the speed, or up to 340{{nbsp}}MHz, for signaling rates up to 3.4{{nbsp}}GHz; one fortieth the speed, or up to 150{{nbsp}}MHz, for signaling rates between 3.4 and 6.0{{nbsp}}GHz). HDMI 2.1 doubles the signaling rate of the data channels to 12{{nbsp}}GHz (12{{nbsp}}Gbit/s). The structure of the data has been changed to use a new packet-based format with an embedded clock signal, which allows what was formerly the TMDS clock channel to be used as a fourth data channel instead, increasing the signaling rate across that channel to 12<!--TWELVE IS CORRECT, NOT 1.2-->{{nbsp}}GHz as well. These changes increase the aggregate bandwidth from 18.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (3 \u00d7 6.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s) to 48.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (4 \u00d7 12.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s), a 2.66x improvement in bandwidth. In addition, the data is transmitted more efficiently by using a 16b/18b encoding scheme, which uses a larger percentage of the bandwidth for data rather than DC balancing compared to the 8b/10b scheme used by previous versions (88.{{overline|8}}% compared to 80%). This, in combination with the 2.66x bandwidth, raises the maximum data rate of HDMI 2.1 from 14.4{{nbsp}}Gbit/s to 42.66{{nbsp}}Gbit/s, approximately 2.96x the data rate of HDMI 2.0.<ref name=\"HDTVMagazine_HDMI2.1\">{{cite web|title=HDMI 2.1: The Need For Speed Continues|url=http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/columns/2017/01/hdtv-expert-hdmi-21-the-need-for-speed-continues.php|publisher=HDTV Expert|website=HDTV Magazine, Ltd.|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234916/http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/columns/2017/01/hdtv-expert-hdmi-21-the-need-for-speed-continues.php|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"HDGuru_HDMI2.1\">{{cite web|title=HDMI 2.1 To Bring Robust Home Theater Experience|url=https://hdguru.com/hdmi-2-1-to-bring-robust-home-theater-experience/|website=HD Guru|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth provided by HDMI 2.1 is enough for 8K resolution at approximately 50{{nbsp}}Hz, with 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB or {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 color.

Using {{YCbCr}} with 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in combination with DSC can allow for even higher formats.<ref name=\"HDMI21January2017Anandtech\" />\n\n===Version comparison===\n\nThe \"version\" of a connection depends on the versions of the HDMI ports on the source and sink devices, not on the HDMI cable. The different categories of HDMI cable only affect the bandwidth (maximum resolution / refresh rate) of the connection. Other features such as audio, 3D, chroma subsampling, or variable refresh rate depend only on the versions of the ports, and are not affected by what type of HDMI cable is used. The only exception to this is Ethernet-over-HDMI, which requires an \"HDMI with Ethernet\" cable.\n\nProducts are not required to implement all features of a version to be considered compliant with that version, as most features are optional. For example, displays with HDMI 1.4 ports do not necessarily support the full 340&nbsp;MHz TMDS clock allowed by HDMI&nbsp;1.4; they are commonly limited to lower speeds such as 300&nbsp;MHz (1080p 120&nbsp;Hz) or even as low as 165&nbsp;MHz (1080p 60&nbsp;Hz) at the manufacturer's discretion, but are still considered HDMI 1.4-compliant. Likewise, features like 10&nbsp;bpc (30&nbsp;bit/px) color depth may also not be supported, even if the HDMI version allows it and the display supports it over other interfaces such as DisplayPort.<ref name=\"HDMIhometoys\" />\n\nFeature support will therefore vary from device to device, even within the same HDMI version.\n\n====Main specifications====\n{| {{table}}\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | {{nbsp}}\n! colspan=5 | HDMI Version\n|-\n! style=\"min-width:80px\" | 1.0\u20131.2a || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 1.3\u20131.3a || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 1.4\u20131.4b || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 2.0\u20132.0b || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 2.1\n|-\n| Release Date\n| {{Ubl\n | Dec 2002 (1.0)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.0_pr\">{{cite web|title=High-Definition Multimedia Interface Provides Access to Higher-Quality Digital Content|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20021209.aspx|website=HDMI.org|accessdate=August 25, 2017|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC}}</ref>\n | May 2004 (1.1)\n | Aug 2005 (1.2)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.2_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI LICENSING, LLC ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF HDMI 1.2 SPECIFICATION|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20050823.aspx|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Dec 2005 (1.2a)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.2a_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI LICENSING, LLC ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF HDMI 1.2a SPECIFICATION INCLUDING UPDATED COMPLIANCE TEST SPECIFICATION|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20051227.aspx|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n }}\n| {{Ubl\n | Jun 2006 (1.3)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.3_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI 1.3 DOUBLES BANDWIDTH, DELIVERS BILLIONS OF COLORS FOR HDTVs|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20060622.aspx|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Nov 2006 (1.3a)<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>\n }}\n| {{Ubl\n | Jun 2009 (1.4)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.4_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Licensing, LLC Releases HDMI Specification Version 1.4|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=102|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Mar 2010 (1.4a)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.4a_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Licensing, LLC Releases HDMI Specification Version 1.4a|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=120|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC |date=March 4, 2010|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Oct 2011 (1.4b)\n }}\n| {{Ubl\n | Sep 2013 (2.0)<ref name=\"hdmi_2.0_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Forum Releases Version 2.0 of the HDMI Specification|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=133|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Apr 2015 (2.0a)<ref name=\"hdmi_2.0a_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Forum, Inc.

Audio return channel (ARC) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1.4 standard.<ref name=\"HDMIwebsiteARC\"/> \"Return\" refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent \"upstream\" to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver.<ref name=\"HDMIwebsiteARC\"/> An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial/satellite broadcast, or has a video source built in, sends the audio \"upstream\" to the AV receiver.<ref name=\"HDMIwebsiteARC\"/>\n\nThe HDMI standard was not designed to pass [[closed caption]] data (for example, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]) to the television for decoding.<ref>[[Closed captions#HDTV interoperability issues]]</ref> As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to appear on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a [[DVD]] player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an [[HDTV]] has no way to pass [[Closed captioning|Closed Captioning]] data so that the HDTV can decode it, as there is [[Closed captioning#HDTV interoperability issues|no line 21 VBI]] in that format.\n\n===Communication channels===\nHDMI has three physically separate communication channels, which are the DDC, TMDS and the optional CEC.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a78.1}} HDMI 1.4 added ARC and HEC.<ref name=HDMIwebsiteARC/><ref name=HDMIwebsiteHEC/>\n\n====Display Data Channel (DDC)====\n{{Main|Display Data Channel}}\nThe [[Display Data Channel]] (DDC) is a communication channel based on the [[I\u00b2C]] bus specification. HDMI specifically requires the device implement the [[Display Data Channel#Enhanced Display Data Channel (E-DDC)|Enhanced Display Data Channel]] (E-DDC), which is used by the HDMI source device to read the [[Extended display identification data#Enhanced EDID (E-EDID)|E-EDID]] data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio/video formats it can take.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a7\u00a78.1,CEC-1.2\u2013CEC-1.3}} HDMI requires that the E-DDC implement [[I\u00b2C]] standard mode speed (100&nbsp;[[kbit/s]]) and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed (400&nbsp;kbit/s).<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a74.2.8}}\n\nThe DDC channel is actively used for [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] (HDCP).\n\n====Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS)====\n[[Transition-minimized differential signaling]] (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, audio and auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video Data Period, the pixels of an active video line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a75.1.2}}\n\nBoth HDMI and [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] use TMDS to send 10-bit characters that are encoded using [[8b/10b encoding]] that differs from the original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of [[BCH code|BCH]] ECC parity data for [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|error correction]] and describes the contents of the packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and [[Color depth|Color Depth]] (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for [[deep color]]). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the [[color space]] being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a7\u00a75.2\u20135.3,6.5.3,6.7.2,6.7.3}}\n\n====Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)====\n{{Main|Consumer Electronics Control}}\nConsumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI,<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/5463/pulseeight-usb-cec-adapter-review Pulse-Eight USB CEC Adapter Review]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/143777/the_secret_feature_on_your_hdtv_hdmi_cec.html|title=The Secret Feature on Your HDTV: HDMI CEC|date=March 26, 2008|work=TechHive}}</ref> by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a [[television set]], [[set-top box]], and [[DVD player]] using only the remote control of the TV).

An HDMI source, such as a [[Blu-ray]] player, may require an HDCP-compliant display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display.<ref>{{cite news |title=Digital Content Protection FAQs|publisher=Digital Content Protection, LLC |url=http://www.digital-cp.com/faqs|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref> A further complication is that there is a small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.\n\nAny DVI-to-HDMI adapter can function as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and vice versa).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegeekstreet.com/best-hdmi-splitter/|title=The Best HDMI Splitter|website=The Geek Street|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> Typically, the only limitation is the [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|gender of the adapter's connectors]] and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.\n\nFeatures specific to HDMI, such as remote-control and audio transport, are not available in devices that use legacy DVI-D signalling. However, many devices output HDMI over a DVI connector (e.g., [[Radeon R600|ATI 3000-series]] and [[GeForce 200 Series|NVIDIA GTX 200-series]] video cards),<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=appx.

Exact capabilities beyond basic compatibility vary. Adapters are generally bi-directional.\n\n===Content protection (HDCP)===\n{{Main|High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection}}\nHigh-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a newer form of [[digital rights management]]. Intel created the original technology to make sure that digital content followed the guidelines set by the Digital Content Protection group.\n\nHDMI can use [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] to encrypt the signal if required by the source device. [[Content Scramble System|CSS]], [[Content Protection for Recordable Media|CPRM]] and [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] require the use of HDCP on HDMI when playing back encrypted [[DVD Video]], [[DVD Audio]], [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The [[HDCP Repeater bit]] controls the authentication and switching/distribution of an HDMI signal. According to HDCP Specification 1.2 (beginning with HDMI CTS 1.3a), any system that implements HDCP must do so in a fully compliant manner. HDCP testing that was previously only a requirement for optional tests such as the \"Simplay HD\" testing program is now part of the requirements for HDMI compliance.<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>{{rp|at=\u00a79.2}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Retailer Requires 'Simplay' HDMI Testing |publisher=TWICE |url=http://www.twice.com/article/238949-Retailer_Requires_Simplay_HDMI_Testing.php |date=December 11, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919135551/http://www.twice.com/article/238949-Retailer_Requires_Simplay_HDMI_Testing.php |archivedate=September 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"HDMI20072\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/pdf/2007_11HDMI_ComplianceTestingPolicies.pdf |title=HDMI Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures |publisher=HDMI.org |accessdate=May 4, 2008|format=PDF}}</ref> HDCP accommodates up to 127 connected devices with up to 7 levels, using a combination of sources, sinks and repeaters.<ref name=\"HDCPSummary\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digital-cp.com/files/documents/04A897FD-FEF1-0EEE-CDBB649127F79525/HDCP_deciphered_070808.pdf |title=HDCP deciphered White Paper |publisher=Digital Content Protection |date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=October 23, 2008 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920191718/http://www.digital-cp.com/files/documents/04A897FD-FEF1-0EEE-CDBB649127F79525/HDCP_deciphered_070808.pdf |archivedate=September 20, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> A simple example of this is several HDMI devices connected to an HDMI AV receiver that is connected to an HDMI display.<ref name=\"HDCPSummary\"/>\n\nDevices called HDCP strippers can remove the HDCP information from the video signal so the video can play on non-HDCP-compliant displays,<ref>{{cite web |author=Ryan Block |title=The Clicker: HDCP's Shiny Red Button |work=[[Engadget]] |url=https://www.engadget.com/2005/07/21/the-clicker-hdcps-shiny-red-button/ |date=July 21, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2008}}</ref> though a [[fair use]] and [[non-disclosure]] form must usually be signed with a registering agency before use.\n\n===Connectors===\n[[File:HDMI Connector Types.png|thumb|Connector types for HDMI|upright=1.8]]\n[[File:Mini micro HDMI Stecker by NicoJenner.jpg|alt=A close up image of the end three HDMI plugs: Type D, Type C and Type A.|thumb|HDMI connector plugs (male): Type D (Micro), Type C (Mini), and Type A]]\n[[File:HDMI.socket.png|thumb|alt=An HDMI type A receptacle connector on a device with the words HDMI IN below it.|HDMI type A receptacle]]\nThere are five HDMI connector types.

The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165{{nbsp}}MHz (4.95{{nbsp}}[[Gbit/s]] bandwidth per link), the same as DVI. It defines two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96{{nbsp}}Gbit/s of video bandwidth ({{resx|1920|1080}} or {{resx|1920|1200}} at 60{{nbsp}}Hz) and 8-channel [[Linear pulse code modulation|LPCM]]/192&nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]]/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 requires support for RGB video, with optional support for {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device has support for {{YCbCr}} on other interfaces). Color depth of 10{{nbsp}}bpc (30{{nbsp}}bit/px) or 12{{nbsp}}bpc (36{{nbsp}}bit/px) is allowed when using 4:2:2 subsampling, but only 8{{nbsp}}bpc (24{{nbsp}}bit/px) color depth is permitted when using RGB or {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4. Only the [[Rec. 601]] and [[Rec. 709]] color spaces are supported. HDMI 1.0 allows only specific pre-defined video formats, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and some additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources/sinks must also be capable of sending/receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.<ref name=\"HDMI1.0\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Specification Informational Version 1.0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826113757/https://www.ketos.eu/fs/11a71061-4b14-11e5-ad75-85850ba828cf-meridian-general-info-eng-hdmi-specs.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-26 |url=https://www.ketos.eu/fs/11a71061-4b14-11e5-ad75-85850ba828cf-meridian-general-info-eng-hdmi-specs.pdf|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Version 1.1 ===\nHDMI 1.1 was released on May 20, 2004 and added support for [[DVD-Audio]].\n\n=== Version 1.2 ===\nHDMI 1.2 was released on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on [[Super Audio CD]]s, at up to 8 channels.

It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120&nbsp;Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would not be required to support {{YCbCr}} output.<ref name=\"HDMI1.2a\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Specification Version 1.2a|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826114318/http://read.pudn.com/downloads72/doc/261979/HDMI_Specification_1.2a.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-26 |url=http://read.pudn.com/downloads72/doc/261979/HDMI_Specification_1.2a.pdf|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|at=\u00a76.2.3}}\n\n'''HDMI 1.2a''' was released on December 14, 2005 and fully specifies [[Consumer Electronics Control|Consumer Electronic Control]] (CEC) features, command sets and CEC compliance tests.<ref name=\"HDMI1.2a\"/>\n\n===Version 1.3===\n\nHDMI 1.3 was released on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] (10.2&nbsp;Gbit/s).<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/><ref name=\"HDMI2006pr\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.twice.com/article/259052-HDMI_1_3_Connections_Due_By_Year_End.php |title=HDMI 1.3 Connections Due By Year End |author=Joseph Palenchar |publisher=TWICE |date=June 19, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110084242/http://www.twice.com/article/259052-HDMI_1_3_Connections_Due_By_Year_End.php |archivedate=November 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16&nbsp;Gbit/s (1920{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}1080 at 120&nbsp;Hz or 2560{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}1440 at 60&nbsp;Hz).

With QFT, individual pictures arrive earlier and some hardware blocks can be fully powered off for longer periods of time between pictures to reduce heat generation and extend battery life.\n* Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM){{Snd}} When a display device supports the option to either optimize its pixel processing for best latency or best pixel processing, ALLM allows the current HDMI source device to automatically select, based on its better understanding of the nature of its own content, which mode the user would most likely prefer.\n\nVideo formats that require more bandwidth than 18.0 Gbit/s (4K 60{{nbsp}}Hz 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB), such as 4K 60{{nbsp}}Hz 10{{nbsp}}bpc (HDR), 4K 120{{nbsp}}Hz, and 8K 60{{nbsp}}Hz, may require the new \"Ultra High Speed\" or \"Ultra High Speed with Ethernet\" cables.<ref name=\"HDMI21Introduction\" /> HDMI 2.1's other new features are supported with existing HDMI cables.\n\nThe increase in maximum bandwidth is achieved by increasing both the bitrate of the data channels and the number of channels. Previous HDMI versions use three data channels (each operating at up to 6.0{{nbsp}}GHz in HDMI 2.0, or up to 3.4{{nbsp}}GHz in HDMI 1.4), with an additional channel for the TMDS clock signal, which runs at a fraction of the data channel speed (one tenth the speed, or up to 340{{nbsp}}MHz, for signaling rates up to 3.4{{nbsp}}GHz; one fortieth the speed, or up to 150{{nbsp}}MHz, for signaling rates between 3.4 and 6.0{{nbsp}}GHz). HDMI 2.1 doubles the signaling rate of the data channels to 12{{nbsp}}GHz (12{{nbsp}}Gbit/s). The structure of the data has been changed to use a new packet-based format with an embedded clock signal, which allows what was formerly the TMDS clock channel to be used as a fourth data channel instead, increasing the signaling rate across that channel to 12<!--TWELVE IS CORRECT, NOT 1.2-->{{nbsp}}GHz as well. These changes increase the aggregate bandwidth from 18.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (3 \u00d7 6.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s) to 48.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (4 \u00d7 12.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s), a 2.66x improvement in bandwidth. In addition, the data is transmitted more efficiently by using a 16b/18b encoding scheme, which uses a larger percentage of the bandwidth for data rather than DC balancing compared to the 8b/10b scheme used by previous versions (88.{{overline|8}}% compared to 80%). This, in combination with the 2.66x bandwidth, raises the maximum data rate of HDMI 2.1 from 14.4{{nbsp}}Gbit/s to 42.66{{nbsp}}Gbit/s, approximately 2.96x the data rate of HDMI 2.0.<ref name=\"HDTVMagazine_HDMI2.1\">{{cite web|title=HDMI 2.1: The Need For Speed Continues|url=http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/columns/2017/01/hdtv-expert-hdmi-21-the-need-for-speed-continues.php|publisher=HDTV Expert|website=HDTV Magazine, Ltd.|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234916/http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/columns/2017/01/hdtv-expert-hdmi-21-the-need-for-speed-continues.php|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"HDGuru_HDMI2.1\">{{cite web|title=HDMI 2.1 To Bring Robust Home Theater Experience|url=https://hdguru.com/hdmi-2-1-to-bring-robust-home-theater-experience/|website=HD Guru|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth provided by HDMI 2.1 is enough for 8K resolution at approximately 50{{nbsp}}Hz, with 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB or {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 color. To achieve even higher formats, HDMI 2.1 can use [[Display Stream Compression]] with a compression ratio of up to 3:1. Using DSC, formats up to 8K ({{resx|7680|4320}}) 120{{nbsp}}Hz or 10K ({{resx|10240|4320}}) 100{{nbsp}}Hz at 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB/4:4:4 are possible. Using {{YCbCr}} with 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in combination with DSC can allow for even higher formats.<ref name=\"HDMI21January2017Anandtech\" />\n\n===Version comparison===\n\nThe \"version\" of a connection depends on the versions of the HDMI ports on the source and sink devices, not on the HDMI cable. The different categories of HDMI cable only affect the bandwidth (maximum resolution / refresh rate) of the connection. Other features such as audio, 3D, chroma subsampling, or variable refresh rate depend only on the versions of the ports, and are not affected by what type of HDMI cable is used. The only exception to this is Ethernet-over-HDMI, which requires an \"HDMI with Ethernet\" cable.\n\nProducts are not required to implement all features of a version to be considered compliant with that version, as most features are optional. For example, displays with HDMI 1.4 ports do not necessarily support the full 340&nbsp;MHz TMDS clock allowed by HDMI&nbsp;1.4; they are commonly limited to lower speeds such as 300&nbsp;MHz (1080p 120&nbsp;Hz) or even as low as 165&nbsp;MHz (1080p 60&nbsp;Hz) at the manufacturer's discretion, but are still considered HDMI 1.4-compliant. Likewise, features like 10&nbsp;bpc (30&nbsp;bit/px) color depth may also not be supported, even if the HDMI version allows it and the display supports it over other interfaces such as DisplayPort.<ref name=\"HDMIhometoys\" />\n\nFeature support will therefore vary from device to device, even within the same HDMI version.\n\n====Main specifications====\n{| {{table}}\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | {{nbsp}}\n! colspan=5 | HDMI Version\n|-\n! style=\"min-width:80px\" | 1.0\u20131.2a || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 1.3\u20131.3a || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 1.4\u20131.4b || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 2.0\u20132.0b || style=\"min-width:80px\" | 2.1\n|-\n| Release Date\n| {{Ubl\n | Dec 2002 (1.0)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.0_pr\">{{cite web|title=High-Definition Multimedia Interface Provides Access to Higher-Quality Digital Content|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20021209.aspx|website=HDMI.org|accessdate=August 25, 2017|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC}}</ref>\n | May 2004 (1.1)\n | Aug 2005 (1.2)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.2_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI LICENSING, LLC ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF HDMI 1.2 SPECIFICATION|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20050823.aspx|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Dec 2005 (1.2a)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.2a_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI LICENSING, LLC ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF HDMI 1.2a SPECIFICATION INCLUDING UPDATED COMPLIANCE TEST SPECIFICATION|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20051227.aspx|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n }}\n| {{Ubl\n | Jun 2006 (1.3)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.3_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI 1.3 DOUBLES BANDWIDTH, DELIVERS BILLIONS OF COLORS FOR HDTVs|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20060622.aspx|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Nov 2006 (1.3a)<ref name=\"HDMI1.3a\"/>\n }}\n| {{Ubl\n | Jun 2009 (1.4)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.4_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Licensing, LLC Releases HDMI Specification Version 1.4|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=102|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Mar 2010 (1.4a)<ref name=\"hdmi_1.4a_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Licensing, LLC Releases HDMI Specification Version 1.4a|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=120|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC |date=March 4, 2010|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Oct 2011 (1.4b)\n }}\n| {{Ubl\n | Sep 2013 (2.0)<ref name=\"hdmi_2.0_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Forum Releases Version 2.0 of the HDMI Specification|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=133|website=HDMI.org|publisher=HDMI Licensing, LLC|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n | Apr 2015 (2.0a)<ref name=\"hdmi_2.0a_pr\">{{cite web|title=HDMI Forum, Inc.

USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters that actively convert from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification was published in 2015. USB Type-C chipsets are not required to include Dual-mode transmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters do not work with Type-C sources.\n\nDisplayPort has a royalty rate of US$0.20 per unit (from patents licensed by MPEG LA), while HDMI has an [[#Licensing|annual fee of US$10,000 and a per unit royalty rate of between $0.04 and $0.15]].<ref name=DisplayPortMPEGLicenseMarch2015>{{cite news |title=MPEG LA Introduces License for DisplayPort |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150305006071/en/MPEG-LA-Introduces-License-DisplayPort |date=March 5, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHDMI has a few advantages over DisplayPort, such as ability to carry [[#Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC)]] signals, and electrical compatibility with DVI (though practically limited to single-link DVI rates).<ref name=\"PCMagDisplayPort1.2\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=DisplayPort 1.1a Standard |publisher=VESA.org |url=http://www.displayport.org |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}</ref> Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this;{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} DisplayPort cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters,<ref name=\"DP.org info 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.displayport.org/cables/how-to-choose-a-displayport-cable-and-not-get-a-bad-one|title=How to Choose a DisplayPort Cable, and Not Get a Bad One!|last=|first=|date=|website=displayport.org|publisher=VESA|access-date=}}</ref> however some [[active cable]]s extend the distance to 15 meters at certain resolutions,<ref name=\"Startech 15m info 1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.startech.com/uk/Cables/Audio-Video/DisplayPort/15m-Active-DisplayPort-Cable-M-M~DISPL15MA|title=StarTech{{Snd}} 15m Active DisplayPort Cable{{Snd}} DP to DP M/M|last=|first=|website=StarTech.com|publisher=StarTech|accessdate=2015-12-14}}</ref> and specialist ''optical'' extender solutions exists to extend distances even further by sending the signal over [[fiber optic cable]].<ref name=\"Lindy 200m info 1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lindy.co.uk/audio-video-c2/200m-fibre-optic-displayport-1-2-extender-p8863|title=Lindy{{Snd}} 200m Fibre Optic DisplayPort 1.2 Extender|last=|first=|website=Lindy.com|publisher=Lindy|accessdate=2015-12-14}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with MHL==\n{{Main|Mobile High-Definition Link}}\nMobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an adaptation of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays.<ref name=\"MHLSampling2008\">{{cite news |title=HDMI plugs into cameras, cellphones |publisher=EE Times |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-products/logic-interfaces-products/4101084/HDMI-plugs-into-cameras-cellphones |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613181849/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-products/logic-interfaces-products/4101084/HDMI-plugs-into-cameras-cellphones |archive-date=June 13, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"mhl-synopsys\">{{cite web|author1=Manmeet Walia|title=MHL: The New Mobile-to-TV Protocol|url=https://www.synopsys.com/designware-ip/newsletters/technical-bulletin/mhl-protocol.html|website=Synopsys.com|accessdate=15 February 2017|language=en}}</ref> Unlike [[DVI]], which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or [[dongle]]) is required to convert the signal to HDMI.
