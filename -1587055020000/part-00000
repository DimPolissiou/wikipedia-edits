As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the city had a total population of 45,877 people. Farmington (and surrounding San Juan County) makes up one of the four Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in New Mexico. The [[U.S. Census Bureau]]'s population estimate in 2018 for Farmington was 44,788.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nFarmington is located at the junction of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]], the [[Animas River]], and the La Plata River, and is located on the [[Colorado Plateau]]. Farmington is the largest city of San Juan County, one of the geographically largest counties in the United States covering {{convert|5538|sqmi}}. The [[county seat]] and the other city in San Juan County is [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]]. Farmington serves as the commercial hub for most of northwestern New Mexico and the [[Four Corners]] region of four states. Farmington lies at or near the junction of three important highways: [[U.S. Highway 550]], [[U.S. Highway 64]], and New Mexico Highway 371.\n\nIt is on the [[Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway (New Mexico)|Trails of the Ancients Byway]], one of the designated [[New Mexico Scenic Byways]].<ref name=\"NM TOA\">[http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ Trail of the Ancients.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821002106/http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ |date=August 21, 2014 }} New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved August 14, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe primary industries of San Juan County are the production of petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Major coal mines are the Navajo and San Juan mines, operated by BHP Billiton {{convert|15|to|19|mi|km}} southwest of Farmington. The coal mined from the Navajo and San Juan mines is used entirely for fuel for the nearby [[Four Corners Generating Station]] and San Juan Power Plant to produce [[electric power]].\n\n==History==\nThe area that is now Farmington was settled by [[Ancestral Pueblo people]] in the 7th Century. Ruins can be visited at nearby [[Salmon Ruins]] and at [[Aztec Ruins National Monument|Aztec Ruins]].<ref name=Smith>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Claudia|title=Farmington|url=http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=1317|publisher=New Mexico Office of the State Historian|access-date=2012-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812041910/http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=1317|archive-date=August 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> When the Ancestral Puebloans left the area, the [[Navajo people|Navajos]], [[Jicarilla Apache]]s, and [[Ute people|Utes]] moved into the area. A key part of the region was known in Navajo as ''T\u00f3ta''' which means \"where three rivers meet\".<ref name=Hudnall>{{cite book|last=Hudnall|first=Ken|title=Spritis of the Border IV: The History and Mystery of New Mexico|year=2005|publisher=Omega Press|location=El Paso|author2=Hudnall, Sharon}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Spanish and American mineral prospecting happened in the area, there were few permanent settlements. In 1868, the [[Navajo Nation]] was created, taking up the western half of [[San Juan County, New Mexico|San Juan County]]. Six years later, the U.S. government offered territory in the rest of San Juan County to the [[Jicarilla Apache]] but they refused. As a result, the area was opened for settlement and a number of settlers moved into the region from Southern Colorado.<ref name=Smith /> The area was originally known as \"Junction City\" because of the access to the three rivers.<ref name=Hudnall />\n\nIn 1901 the town was incorporated and named Farmington with a population of 548.<ref name=Smith /> By September 19, 1905, the railroad was finished connecting Farmington to [[Durango, Colorado]], expanding economic and settlement opportunities. It was unusual in that it was a standard gauge railroad that connected to the Denver & Rio Grande Western narrow gauge lines of southwestern Colorado.  The railroad converted the line to narrow gauge in 1923.

Next, he went to [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF)]] in 1972 and captured the [[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]] with [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]]. He then went north to join the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF)]] as a mid-card [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] from 1974 to 1977. He had a (rare for the time) face versus face battle with Pete Sanchez on a [[Madison Square Garden]] undercard. Sullivan also wrestled as a face for promoter Roy Shire's Big Time Wrestling in [[San Francisco]]. Wrestling for [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], Sullivan and partner [[Austin Idol]] challenged [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] for the [[NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship]] in November 1980, during this feud was the angle where the Freebirds flattened all four of Idol's tires to prevent him and Sullivan from wrestling for the titles (though Idol only mentioned a single flat tire). Sullivan also worked in CWF as a face until the early 1980s. His first [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] run was in the [[Continental Wrestling Association|Memphis]] territory where alongside [[The Honky Tonk Man|Wayne Ferris (The Honky Tonk Man)]] and manager [[Jimmy Hart]] he battled the local faces including [[Jerry Lawler]]. He left Memphis for Georgia but again turned heel while in the Georgia territory before returning to Florida again to work for [[Eddie Graham]].\n\n===Championship Wrestling From Florida (1982\u20131987)===\nKnown as the heel \"Boston Battler\", Sullivan's \"The Prince of Darkness\" gimmick started during this time. In CWF he became associated with [[Mark Lewin|\"Maniac\" Mark Lewin (Purple Haze)]], [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]], [[Bob Roop]], [[Winona Littleheart|The Lock]] and [[Luna Vachon]] and others as the Army of Darkness.  His biggest rivals during this time included [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Barry Windham]], and his former partner Mike Graham. Sullivan split his time with [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|International Championship Wrestling]] and brought \"The Prince of Darkness\" gimmick there, along with Lewin and Roop.  He had the Fallen Angel as his valet, who later became known as [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]].  Sullivan was the top heel in ICW when the company first went national and had noted feuds with [[Austin Idol]], [[Superstar Billy Graham]], [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Joe Savoldi]] and [[Blackjack Mulligan]].\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1987\u20131991)===\nSullivan formed [[The Varsity Club]] upon arrival in [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] with [[Mike Rotunda]] and [[Rick Steiner]]. They immediately started feuding with [[Jimmy Garvin]] because Sullivan wanted Garvin's wife [[Patti Williams|Precious]] for himself. This feud lasted a while with Sullivan [[kayfabe]] breaking Garvin's leg at one point. Steiner left the group and was replaced by [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] and [[Dan Spivey]]. They feuded with Dusty Rhodes, [[The Road Warriors]], Rick Steiner and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]]. Sullivan even attacked Gilbert's wife [[Missy Hyatt]]. By late 1989, the Varsity Club was gone, and Sullivan formed ''Slaughterhouse'' with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and [[Buzz Sawyer]] to feud with Rotunda.<ref>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.167)</ref> Sullivan took time off in late 1990 and returned in early 1991 as the manager of [[One Man Gang]], [[Billy Jack Haynes|Black Blood]], and the Angel of Death. They cut [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1les|El Gigante's]] hair and had a brief feud. Sullivan also was the masked Great Wizard briefly to manage [[Kevin Nash|Oz]]. After his contract with WCW expired in August 1991, Sullivan worked in [[Japan]], participating in [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW]] where he wrestled against [[Atsushi Onita]] with [[Ed Farhat]], and later moved on to compete in [[W*ING]].\n\n===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992\u20131994)===\nSullivan was in a feud with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|\"Primetime\" Brian Lee]] where after Lee's matches there would be a miniature tombstone brought to ringside. During this feud he was known as The Master and enlisted the help of [[Bryan Clark|The Nightstalker]] and the Mongolian Mauler to soften up Lee. After Lee defeated Nightstalker, he finally came face to face with The Master who was revealed to be Sullivan after he delivered a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Fireball|fireball]] to the face of Lee and was joined by Nightstalker in busting open Lee on live television. Lee would return and finally get the upper hand on Sullivan in a Singapore Spike match with Sullivan which Lee won after Nightstalker accidentally hit Sullivan with the spike.  Sullivan left SMW shortly after losing a match to [[Ronnie Garvin]] by DQ in March 1994.\n\n===Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993\u20131994)===\nIn early 1993, Sullivan and Woman went to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]], where he teamed with [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]]. The two won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship|ECW Tag Team Championship]] and feuded with [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]]. Sullivan also had a bloody feud with [[Abdullah the Butcher]]. Sullivan left ECW behind and headed to [[World Championship Wrestling]] in spring 1994.\n\n===Return to WCW (1994-2001)===\n====Three Faces of Fear and Dungeon of Doom (1994&ndash;1997)====\n{{main|The Three Faces of Fear|l1=Three Faces of Fear|The Dungeon of Doom|l2=Dungeon of Doom}}\nHe formed a tag team with his [[kayfabe]] brother [[Dave Sullivan (wrestler)|Dave Sullivan]], a [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] character who was being picked on by [[The Nasty Boys]] ([[Jerry Sags]] and [[Brian Knobs]]). He enlisted Cactus Jack's help and beat them for the Tag Team Title.<ref>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 272)</ref> Dave was injured and out of action for a while and Sullivan split with Cactus after losing the titles. Sullivan defeated Cactus in a Loser Leaves WCW match at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]].<ref>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 281)</ref>\n\nDave came back and dressed like his idol, [[Hulk Hogan]]. This infuriated Kevin, who hated Hogan, and they started feuding. Kevin brought in Hogan's best friend, [[Brutus Beefcake|Ed Leslie]], as The Butcher, to help him with his feud against Hogan. He also brought in [[John Tenta|Avalanche]] and called the trio [[The Three Faces of Fear]]. They feuded with Hogan, [[Randy Savage]] and [[Steve Borden|Sting]]. In early 1995, after not being able to end Hogan's career, Avalanche left the group and Sullivan turned on The Butcher.\n\nLater in 1995 Sullivan began hearing the voice of someone calling for him to come find him. Over the course of several weeks, vignettes were shot with Sullivan searching for the man, who eventually became known as [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]]. Once Sullivan found The Master he was rechristened with a new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]], The Taskmaster. The two men immediately started putting together a new group that eventually became known as the Dungeon of Doom. In time, the group grew to include [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]], [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]], [[Ron Reis|The Yeti]], [[William DeMott|Hugh Morrus]], [[Martin Ruane|Loch Ness]], [[One Man Gang]], [[Ray Traylor|Big Bubba Rogers]], and [[Paul Wight|The Giant]]. Sullivan also brought in his former 3 Faces of Fear stablemates, with Avalanche wrestling as The Shark and The Butcher wrestling as The Zodiac. For a very short time, [[Big Van Vader]] also was a member. Managed by Sullivan, four Dungeon of Doom members lost to The Hulkamaniacs in a [[WarGames match]] at September's [[Fall Brawl (1995)|Fall Brawl]]. As a result of Hogan's win over Zodiac, he got to spend five minutes alone with Sullivan. The feud with Hogan continued for much of the remainder of the year and saw the group add [[Jimmy Hart]] as its manager, after he turned on Hogan in October 1995 and cost him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a match with the Giant.\n\nThe Dungeon then feuded with the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], and Sullivan acquired a certain disliking for [[Brian Pillman]]. Once Sullivan sent Pillman packing, the Dungeon and the Horsemen joined forces again to get rid of Hulk Hogan and his friends and formed the unsuccessful Alliance To End Hulkamania.\n\n====Retirement and switch to booking duties (1997&ndash;2001)====\nAfterwards, Sullivan and Horseman [[Chris Benoit]] began a feud much like Sullivan had with Pillman. This feud lasted for over a year however, with Benoit \"stealing\" Woman from Sullivan. Sullivan brought in [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacquelyn]] to help him and also added [[Konnan]] to the Dungeon. Sullivan lost a [[retirement]] match to Benoit at [[Bash at the Beach (1997)|Bash at the Beach]] on July 13, 1997.\n\nThis loss gave him more time to concentrate on his job as booker. Sullivan stayed on as the booker or a member of the WCW booking committee and made a brief on-screen appearance with the reformed Varsity Club of Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner with their cheerleader, [[Kristina Laum|Leia Meow]]. After a couple of months, he was back off television.\n\nIn 2000, after the demotion of Ed Ferrara and Vince Russo (and subsequent departure of the latter), the resulting chaos led to Sullivan's promotion to head booker. This move infuriated a number of WCW wrestlers, given Sullivan's history of professional rivalries with Benoit (Benoit had an affair with Nancy Sullivan and later married her).  Benoit, [[Dean Malenko]], [[Eddie Guerrero]] and [[Perry Saturn]] would quit the night after, immediately signing with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]. Sullivan was fired before WCW's sale in 2001.\n\n=== Independent Promotions (2002&ndash;present) ===\nIn 2003, Sullivan made one surprise appearance in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], as the officiator in the first [[Professional wrestling match types#Clockwork Orange House of Fun match|Clockwork Orange House of Fun match]].\n\nIn late 2003/2004, he worked for the All World Wrestling League/Big Time Wrestling.\n\nIn 2010, Sullivan appeared as one of the main subjects in the feature length documentary film ''Card Subject To Change''.\n\nIn 2012 he started wrestling in the Pacific Northwest with his nephew Dash Venture and Ron Von Hess.  Together they won the AIWF World Six-Man Championship.\n\nOn April 28, 2012 Sullivan made a surprise appearance, initially under a mask, during the Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio match at Extreme Reunion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn March 8, 2013 Sullivan appeared in Nitro, West Virginia where he reunited with Dash Venture Sullivan in his corner as he faced Ron Mathis.\n\nOn July 7, 2013 Sullivan appeared at Supercon in Miami as himself to sign autographs.\n\nHe appears as himself in the opening wrestling sequence of the 2013 film ''Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies'' during APWA Wrestling Pile Driving Drugs II. He wrestled in a tag match teaming with Barbarian and was managed by Don West. They would defeat Beastman and Jock Samson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2240046/|title=Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies|date=28 March 2014|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, Kevin Sullivan began working for promoter Don West with the American Pro Wrestling Alliance and is the current booker for the promotion. Kevin put Don over, passing him the torch, saying that he would be darker than he ever was. Kevin is mentoring him as the manager for The First Family in the APWA with The Barbarian, Ricky Reyes and the Turkana Warrior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/apwawrestling|title=Security Check Required|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2014, Sullivan teamed with Ace Perry and Christian Skyfire to defeat John Wayne Murdoch, Reed Bentley and Tripp Cassidy in the Main Event of an Evolution Pro Wrestling event.<ref>http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=112991 Retrieved June 27</ref> He has also teamed with Ron Von Hess in Washington's SCW Reloaded promotion and serves as his advisor. He refers to Ron as his nephew in promos and Hess still calls him Uncle. They are, as of June 2014, undefeated as a tag team.\n\nHe is podcast host for [[Major League Wrestling|MLW]] Radio. He co-hosted a free show with Mister Saint Laurent called ''MSL & Sullivan'' until early 2018 and continues to host a premium show called ''Kevin Sullivan's Helluva Deal''.\n\nOn July 13, 2019, Sullivan wrestled against [[Brian Pillman Jr.]] in a No Holds Barred match which ended in a no contest at ECCW: Ballroom Brawl XII in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\n===Ring of Honor (2016\u20132017)===\nOn June 24, 2016 Sullivan made a surprise appearance during an Unsanctioned Fight Without Honor match at [[Ring of Honor]]'s [[Best in the World '16]] between [[Steve Corino]] and [[BJ Whitmer]]. Sullivan helped Whitmer win the match by striking Corino's head with his signature golden spike. He then formed an alliance with Whitmer and [[Punisher Martinez|\"Punishment\" Damian Martinez]] in which Whitmer is billed as his second \"son,\" and started terrorizing Corino as his \"first son\" for not letting his evil side out.\n\n==Personal life==\nSullivan was married to Debra Stokes from 1970 to 1984. They have three children.\n\nSullivan married [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy Toffoloni]] in 1985.\n\nIn an example of [[life imitating art]], Sullivan's wife Nancy left him in favor of his rival, [[Chris Benoit]], in 1997. The situation began in late 1996, when Sullivan conceived a storyline angle in [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] where Nancy, who under the ring name Woman was his manager, would leave him for [[Chris Benoit]]. Sullivan insisted that the two should travel together, share hotel rooms and hold hands in public to preserve kayfabe for the general public and to make the affair look real, but the storyline affair between Chris and Nancy became real in early 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metafilter.com/62384/Chris-Benoit-19672007|title=Chris Benoit, 1967-2007|publisher=}}</ref> Nancy ultimately married Benoit in November 2000. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best, and Benoit defeated Sullivan in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|Retirement match]] at [[Bash at the Beach (1997)|Bash at the Beach]] in July 1997. Benoit did, however, admit to having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD ''[[Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story]]'' that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. Sullivan later publicly paid tribute to Chris and Nancy after [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide|their deaths]] in June 2007.\n\nIn April 2006, Sullivan married Samantha Connor. They have a son.\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''[[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]]'''\n:*[[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Central States version)]]

Next, he went to [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF)]] in 1972 and captured the [[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]] with [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]]. He then went north to join the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF)]] as a mid-card [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] from 1974 to 1977. He had a (rare for the time) face versus face battle with Pete Sanchez on a [[Madison Square Garden]] undercard. Sullivan also wrestled as a face for promoter Roy Shire's Big Time Wrestling in [[San Francisco]]. Wrestling for [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], Sullivan and partner [[Austin Idol]] challenged [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] for the [[NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship]] in November 1980, during this feud was the angle where the Freebirds flattened all four of Idol's tires to prevent him and Sullivan from wrestling for the titles (though Idol only mentioned a single flat tire). Sullivan also worked in CWF as a face until the early 1980s. His first [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] run was in the [[Continental Wrestling Association|Memphis]] territory where alongside [[The Honky Tonk Man|Wayne Ferris (The Honky Tonk Man)]] and manager [[Jimmy Hart]] he battled the local faces including [[Jerry Lawler]]. He left Memphis for Georgia but again turned heel while in the Georgia territory before returning to Florida again to work for [[Eddie Graham]].\n\n===Championship Wrestling From Florida (1982\u20131987)===\nKnown as the heel \"Boston Battler\", Sullivan's \"The Prince of Darkness\" gimmick started during this time. In CWF he became associated with [[Mark Lewin|\"Maniac\" Mark Lewin (Purple Haze)]], [[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]], [[Bob Roop]], [[Winona Littleheart|The Lock]] and [[Luna Vachon]] and others as the Army of Darkness.  His biggest rivals during this time included [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Barry Windham]], and his former partner Mike Graham. Sullivan split his time with [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|International Championship Wrestling]] and brought the \"The Prince of Darkness\" gimmick there, along with Lewin and Roop.  He had the Fallen Angel as his valet, who later became known as [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]].  Sullivan was the top heel in ICW when the company first went national and had noted feuds with [[Austin Idol]], [[Superstar Billy Graham]], [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Joe Savoldi]] and [[Blackjack Mulligan]].\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1987\u20131991)===\nSullivan formed [[The Varsity Club]] upon arrival in [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] with [[Mike Rotunda]] and [[Rick Steiner]]. They immediately started feuding with [[Jimmy Garvin]] because Sullivan wanted Garvin's wife [[Patti Williams|Precious]] for himself. This feud lasted a while with Sullivan [[kayfabe]] breaking Garvin's leg at one point. Steiner left the group and was replaced by [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] and [[Dan Spivey]]. They feuded with Dusty Rhodes, [[The Road Warriors]], Rick Steiner and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]]. Sullivan even attacked Gilbert's wife [[Missy Hyatt]]. By late 1989, the Varsity Club was gone, and Sullivan formed ''Slaughterhouse'' with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and [[Buzz Sawyer]] to feud with Rotunda.<ref>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.167)</ref> Sullivan took time off in late 1990 and returned in early 1991 as the manager of [[One Man Gang]], [[Billy Jack Haynes|Black Blood]], and the Angel of Death. They cut [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1les|El Gigante's]] hair and had a brief feud. Sullivan also was the masked Great Wizard briefly to manage [[Kevin Nash|Oz]]. After his contract with WCW expired in August 1991, Sullivan worked in [[Japan]], participating in [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW]] where he wrestled against [[Atsushi Onita]] with [[Ed Farhat]], and later moved on to compete in [[W*ING]].\n\n===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992\u20131994)===\nSullivan was in a feud with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|\"Primetime\" Brian Lee]] where after Lee's matches there would be a miniature tombstone brought to ringside. During this feud he was known as The Master and enlisted the help of [[Bryan Clark|The Nightstalker]] and the Mongolian Mauler to soften up Lee. After Lee defeated Nightstalker, he finally came face to face with The Master who was revealed to be Sullivan after he delivered a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Fireball|fireball]] to the face of Lee and was joined by Nightstalker in busting open Lee on live television. Lee would return and finally get the upper hand on Sullivan in a Singapore Spike match with Sullivan which Lee won after Nightstalker accidentally hit Sullivan with the spike.  Sullivan left SMW shortly after losing a match to [[Ronnie Garvin]] by DQ in March 1994.\n\n===Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993\u20131994)===\nIn early 1993, Sullivan and Woman went to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]], where he teamed with [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]]. The two won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship|ECW Tag Team Championship]] and feuded with [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]]. Sullivan also had a bloody feud with [[Abdullah the Butcher]]. Sullivan left ECW behind and headed to [[World Championship Wrestling]] in spring 1994.\n\n===Return to WCW (1994-2001)===\n====Three Faces of Fear and Dungeon of Doom (1994&ndash;1997)====\n{{main|The Three Faces of Fear|l1=Three Faces of Fear|The Dungeon of Doom|l2=Dungeon of Doom}}\nHe formed a tag team with his [[kayfabe]] brother [[Dave Sullivan (wrestler)|Dave Sullivan]], a [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] character who was being picked on by [[The Nasty Boys]] ([[Jerry Sags]] and [[Brian Knobs]]). He enlisted Cactus Jack's help and beat them for the Tag Team Title.<ref>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 272)</ref> Dave was injured and out of action for a while and Sullivan split with Cactus after losing the titles. Sullivan defeated Cactus in a Loser Leaves WCW match at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]].<ref>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 281)</ref>\n\nDave came back and dressed like his idol, [[Hulk Hogan]]. This infuriated Kevin, who hated Hogan, and they started feuding. Kevin brought in Hogan's best friend, [[Brutus Beefcake|Ed Leslie]], as The Butcher, to help him with his feud against Hogan. He also brought in [[John Tenta|Avalanche]] and called the trio [[The Three Faces of Fear]]. They feuded with Hogan, [[Randy Savage]] and [[Steve Borden|Sting]]. In early 1995, after not being able to end Hogan's career, Avalanche left the group and Sullivan turned on The Butcher.\n\nLater in 1995 Sullivan began hearing the voice of someone calling for him to come find him. Over the course of several weeks, vignettes were shot with Sullivan searching for the man, who eventually became known as [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]]. Once Sullivan found The Master he was rechristened with a new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]], The Taskmaster. The two men immediately started putting together a new group that eventually became known as the Dungeon of Doom. In time, the group grew to include [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]], [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]], [[Ron Reis|The Yeti]], [[William DeMott|Hugh Morrus]], [[Martin Ruane|Loch Ness]], [[One Man Gang]], [[Ray Traylor|Big Bubba Rogers]], and [[Paul Wight|The Giant]]. Sullivan also brought in his former 3 Faces of Fear stablemates, with Avalanche wrestling as The Shark and The Butcher wrestling as The Zodiac. For a very short time, [[Big Van Vader]] also was a member. Managed by Sullivan, four Dungeon of Doom members lost to The Hulkamaniacs in a [[WarGames match]] at September's [[Fall Brawl (1995)|Fall Brawl]]. As a result of Hogan's win over Zodiac, he got to spend five minutes alone with Sullivan. The feud with Hogan continued for much of the remainder of the year and saw the group add [[Jimmy Hart]] as its manager, after he turned on Hogan in October 1995 and cost him the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a match with the Giant.\n\nThe Dungeon then feuded with the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], and Sullivan acquired a certain disliking for [[Brian Pillman]]. Once Sullivan sent Pillman packing, the Dungeon and the Horsemen joined forces again to get rid of Hulk Hogan and his friends and formed the unsuccessful Alliance To End Hulkamania.\n\n====Retirement and switch to booking duties (1997&ndash;2001)====\nAfterwards, Sullivan and Horseman [[Chris Benoit]] began a feud much like Sullivan had with Pillman. This feud lasted for over a year however, with Benoit \"stealing\" Woman from Sullivan. Sullivan brought in [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacquelyn]] to help him and also added [[Konnan]] to the Dungeon. Sullivan lost a [[retirement]] match to Benoit at [[Bash at the Beach (1997)|Bash at the Beach]] on July 13, 1997.\n\nThis loss gave him more time to concentrate on his job as booker. Sullivan stayed on as the booker or a member of the WCW booking committee and made a brief on-screen appearance with the reformed Varsity Club of Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner with their cheerleader, [[Kristina Laum|Leia Meow]]. After a couple of months, he was back off television.\n\nIn 2000, after the demotion of Ed Ferrara and Vince Russo (and subsequent departure of the latter), the resulting chaos led to Sullivan's promotion to head booker. This move infuriated a number of WCW wrestlers, given Sullivan's history of professional rivalries with Benoit (Benoit had an affair with Nancy Sullivan and later married her).  Benoit, [[Dean Malenko]], [[Eddie Guerrero]] and [[Perry Saturn]] would quit the night after, immediately signing with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]. Sullivan was fired before WCW's sale in 2001.\n\n=== Independent Promotions (2002&ndash;present) ===\nIn 2003, Sullivan made one surprise appearance in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], as the officiator in the first [[Professional wrestling match types#Clockwork Orange House of Fun match|Clockwork Orange House of Fun match]].\n\nIn late 2003/2004, he worked for the All World Wrestling League/Big Time Wrestling.\n\nIn 2010, Sullivan appeared as one of the main subjects in the feature length documentary film ''Card Subject To Change''.\n\nIn 2012 he started wrestling in the Pacific Northwest with his nephew Dash Venture and Ron Von Hess.  Together they won the AIWF World Six-Man Championship.\n\nOn April 28, 2012 Sullivan made a surprise appearance, initially under a mask, during the Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio match at Extreme Reunion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn March 8, 2013 Sullivan appeared in Nitro, West Virginia where he reunited with Dash Venture Sullivan in his corner as he faced Ron Mathis.\n\nOn July 7, 2013 Sullivan appeared at Supercon in Miami as himself to sign autographs.\n\nHe appears as himself in the opening wrestling sequence of the 2013 film ''Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies'' during APWA Wrestling Pile Driving Drugs II. He wrestled in a tag match teaming with Barbarian and was managed by Don West. They would defeat Beastman and Jock Samson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2240046/|title=Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies|date=28 March 2014|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2014, Kevin Sullivan began working for promoter Don West with the American Pro Wrestling Alliance and is the current booker for the promotion. Kevin put Don over, passing him the torch, saying that he would be darker than he ever was. Kevin is mentoring him as the manager for The First Family in the APWA with The Barbarian, Ricky Reyes and the Turkana Warrior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/apwawrestling|title=Security Check Required|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2014, Sullivan teamed with Ace Perry and Christian Skyfire to defeat John Wayne Murdoch, Reed Bentley and Tripp Cassidy in the Main Event of an Evolution Pro Wrestling event.<ref>http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=112991 Retrieved June 27</ref> He has also teamed with Ron Von Hess in Washington's SCW Reloaded promotion and serves as his advisor. He refers to Ron as his nephew in promos and Hess still calls him Uncle. They are, as of June 2014, undefeated as a tag team.\n\nHe is podcast host for [[Major League Wrestling|MLW]] Radio. He co-hosted a free show with Mister Saint Laurent called ''MSL & Sullivan'' until early 2018 and continues to host a premium show called ''Kevin Sullivan's Helluva Deal''.\n\nOn July 13, 2019, Sullivan wrestled against [[Brian Pillman Jr.]] in a No Holds Barred match which ended in a no contest at ECCW: Ballroom Brawl XII in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\n===Ring of Honor (2016\u20132017)===\nOn June 24, 2016 Sullivan made a surprise appearance during an Unsanctioned Fight Without Honor match at [[Ring of Honor]]'s [[Best in the World '16]] between [[Steve Corino]] and [[BJ Whitmer]]. Sullivan helped Whitmer win the match by striking Corino's head with his signature golden spike. He then formed an alliance with Whitmer and [[Punisher Martinez|\"Punishment\" Damian Martinez]] in which Whitmer is billed as his second \"son,\" and started terrorizing Corino as his \"first son\" for not letting his evil side out.\n\n==Personal life==\nSullivan was married to Debra Stokes from 1970 to 1984. They have three children.\n\nSullivan married [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy Toffoloni]] in 1985.\n\nIn an example of [[life imitating art]], Sullivan's wife Nancy left him in favor of his rival, [[Chris Benoit]], in 1997. The situation began in late 1996, when Sullivan conceived a storyline angle in [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] where Nancy, who under the ring name Woman was his manager, would leave him for [[Chris Benoit]]. Sullivan insisted that the two should travel together, share hotel rooms and hold hands in public to preserve kayfabe for the general public and to make the affair look real, but the storyline affair between Chris and Nancy became real in early 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metafilter.com/62384/Chris-Benoit-19672007|title=Chris Benoit, 1967-2007|publisher=}}</ref> Nancy ultimately married Benoit in November 2000. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best, and Benoit defeated Sullivan in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|Retirement match]] at [[Bash at the Beach (1997)|Bash at the Beach]] in July 1997. Benoit did, however, admit to having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD ''[[Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story]]'' that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. Sullivan later publicly paid tribute to Chris and Nancy after [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide|their deaths]] in June 2007.\n\nIn April 2006, Sullivan married Samantha Connor. They have a son.\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''[[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]]'''\n:*[[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Central States version)]]
