Actual settlement of the interior of the county was delayed by concerns about hostile American Indians. After their defeat in the [[Blackhawk War]] in 1832, settlement proceeded quickly.\n\nHancock County was formed, on January 13, 1825, out of [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]]. It was named in honor of [[John Hancock]], who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The [[Latter Day Saint movement|movement's founder]] [[Joseph Smith]] was [[Death of Joseph Smith|killed]] in the county seat of Carthage in 1844. Most [[Mormons]] left Hancock County in the 1840s. Today, Latter Day Saints come in increasing numbers to important Latter Day Saint sites in Hancock County, partly for vacation and partly for religious pilgrimage.\n\nThe original courthouse was at Montebello. Montebello no longer exists but was between Nauvoo and Hamilton. In 1833 the state commissioned the formation of the county seat at Carthage, which was centrally located but not well developed. A log cabin was built to serve as the courthouse and served that purpose until 1839 when the second Carthage Courthouse was built. The original log cabin continued to serve as a school and other purposes until 1945 when it was removed.\n\nThe second courthouse cost $3,700 to build and served from 1839 until 1906. It served as a location for [[Stephen A. Douglas]] (October 11, 1858) and [[Abraham Lincoln]] (October 22, 1858) to speak to residents as they were running against each other for the US Senate. In 1906 it was removed to make room for the current courthouse.\n\nThe current courthouse was dedicated October 21, 1908.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|814|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|794|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|21|sqmi}} (2.5%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Carthage, Illinois]]\n|13|32|1.47\n|18|38|1.68\n|29|50|2.86\n|39|62|3.82\n|50|73|4.58\n|60|83|4.38\n|64|87|4.54\n|62|85|3.54\n|54|77|3.99\n|42|66|2.85\n|31|50|3.15\n|19|36|2.28\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0196\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Carthage, Illinois\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Carthage have ranged from a low of {{convert|13|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|87|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-30|\u00b0F}} was recorded in February 1905 and a record high of {{convert|113|\u00b0F}} was recorded in August 1934.

The county is made up of rural towns with many farmers.\n\nHancock County is part of the [[Fort Madison, Iowa|Fort Madison]]-[[Keokuk, Iowa|Keokuk]], [[Iowa|IA]]-IL-[[Missouri|MO]] [[Fort Madison\u2013Keokuk, IA-IL-MO Micropolitan Statistical Area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hancock County Illinois 1825.png|thumb|Hancock County at the time of its creation in 1825]]\n\nHancock County was part of the [[Military Tract of 1812|\"Military Tract\"]] set aside by Congress to reward veterans of the [[War of 1812]]. Actual settlement of the interior of the county was delayed by concerns about hostile American Indians. After their defeat in the [[Blackhawk War]] in 1832, settlement proceeded quickly.\n\nHancock County was formed, on January 13, 1825, out of [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]]. It was named in honor of [[John Hancock]], who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=148}}</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the 1840s Hancock had one of Illinois' most populous cities: [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], which was then headquarters for the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]. The [[Latter Day Saint movement|movement's founder]] [[Joseph Smith]] was [[Death of Joseph Smith|killed]] in the county seat of Carthage in 1844. Most [[Mormons]] left Hancock County in the 1840s. Today, Latter Day Saints come in increasing numbers to important Latter Day Saint sites in Hancock County, partly for vacation and partly for religious pilgrimage.\n\nThe original courthouse was at Montebello. Montebello no longer exists but was between Nauvoo and Hamilton. In 1833 the state commissioned the formation of the county seat at Carthage, which was centrally located but not well developed. A log cabin was built to serve as the courthouse and served that purpose until 1839 when the second Carthage Courthouse was built.

He progressed to assistant manager to [[Frank Taylor (footballer born 1916)|Frank Taylor]] and took his position in June 1960. He set about staving off the threat of relegation before bringing back club legend [[Stanley Matthews]] in an effort to rekindle the club's supporter base. It worked well and he had enough money to bring in a number of established veterans as Stoke took the [[Football League Second Division]] title in [[1962\u201363 Stoke City F.C. season|1962\u201363]] and reached the [[1964 Football League Cup Final]], losing out to Leicester City.\n\nMore fine signings followed as Stoke enjoyed great success at the beginning of the 1970s reaching two FA Cup semi-finals, playing in the [[UEFA Cup]] twice and winning their first major trophy, the [[Football League Cup]] in [[1972 Football League Cup Final|1972]]. Stoke then nearly won the First Division in [[1974\u201375 Stoke City F.C. season|1974\u201375]] but after the Butler Street Stand roof fell off in a strong storm at the [[Victoria Ground]] Stoke had to sell their best players to cover the repair costs and a despondent Waddington quit in March 1977 with Stoke heading for relegation. He later had a two-year spell at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] before becoming associate director of Stoke in 1991 until his death in 1994.\n\n==Playing career==\n[[Manchester]] born Waddington was an amateur with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] before joining [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] just after the end of [[World War II]]. He played at Wing half for the \"Alex\" playing in seven seasons in the [[Football League Third Division North]] making 193 appearances scoring eight goals.<ref name=\"The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City\"/> During the war he served with the Royal Navy.\n\n==Managerial career==\nHe joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] as a coach in 1952 and did well enough to be promoted to assistant manager to [[Frank Taylor (footballer born 1916)|Frank Taylor]] and when Taylor was sacked in 1960 Waddington was given his position.

He progressed to assistant manager to [[Frank Taylor (footballer born 1916)|Frank Taylor]] and took his position in June 1960. He set about staving off the threat of relegation before bringing back club legend [[Stanley Matthews]] in an effort to rekindle the club's supporter base. It worked well and he had enough money to bring in a number of established veterans as Stoke took the [[Football League Second Division]] title in [[1962\u201363 Stoke City F.C. season|1962\u201363]] and reached the [[1964 Football League Cup Final]], losing out to Leicester City.\n\nMore fine signings followed as Stoke enjoyed great success at the beginning of the 1970s reaching two FA Cup semi-finals, playing in the [[UEFA Cup]] twice and winning their first major trophy, the [[Football League Cup]] in [[1972 Football League Cup Final|1972]]. Stoke then nearly won the First Division in [[1974\u201375 Stoke City F.C. season|1974\u201375]] but after the Butler Street Stand roof fell off in a strong storm at the [[Victoria Ground]] Stoke had to sell their best players to cover the repair costs and a despondent Waddington quit in March 1977 with Stoke heading for relegation.
