Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\nSarah Lind reports the study of Gertoux and say that \"G. maintains a website with excerpts at divinename.net.\": G\u00e9rard Gertoux. 2002.

Un Nom Encens (L\u2019Harmattan, 1999). G. follows Maimonides\u2019 teaching that that YHWH \u201cis read as it is written,\u201d i.e., yehua, in the same way that yhwdh is vocalized yehuda\u2014applying the (coincidentally correct) Masoretic vowels. G. first considers biblical treatment of \u201cthe name\u201d: the power of the name; to know God\u2019s name; Jesus, Satan, the controversy over the name; and \u201cthe name read distinctly\u201d (reconstruction of the reading).

Gilligan states: \"because God is wondrous and mighty\u2014an object of awe\u2014the name of God would also be wondrous and mighty, intended to be spoken or sung with reverence. In a biblical culture, the name of God would express God\u2019s majesty and power\" and adds: \"to put it in other terms, a biblical name (in a sense) was an alter ego; it represented the person. To know someone\u2019s name was to know who and what the person was: not only his or her character or qualities, but especially his or her power, role, or function\u2014what the individual was empowered to do. To be without a name was to be worthless, of no importance.\"<ref name=Gilligan/>\n\n==== Some comments of his thesis ====\nE. J. Revell (Professor emeritus at the [[University of Toronto]]) claim: I was very interested to read the copy of your work which you sent me. Before reading your study, had no particular opinion on the pronunciation of the name of God. As a student in the 50\u2019s, I was told that scholars have determined that \u201cYahweh\u201d was the ancient pronunciation. I did not find the argument wellgrounded, but the view was held almost as an article of faith by my instructors, and I had no superior argument, so I ignored the problem. I have occasionally thought about it since, but I have not acquired any information that you have not noticed in your study.

Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\nSarah Lind reports the study of Gertoux and say that \"G. maintains a website with excerpts at divinename.net.\": G\u00e9rard Gertoux. 2002.

As a student in the 50\u2019s, I was told that scholars have determined that \u201cYahweh\u201d was the ancient pronunciation. I did not find the argument wellgrounded, but the view was held almost as an article of faith by my instructors, and I had no superior argument, so I ignored the problem. I have occasionally thought about it since, but I have not acquired any information that you have not noticed in your study.

According to [[Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet|Hoare]], his mother was Jane, daughter of Thomas Biflete, but according to [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]], \"a Stafford nearly allied to Sir Edward Stafford\", through whom he was recommended to [[Sir Charles Cornwallis]], ambassador to the court of [[Philip III of Spain]], becoming a member of his suite and acting as English agent on the latter's recall, from 1609 to 1611.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1612 he was appointed English consul at [[Seville]].<ref name=\"hunneyball\">{{cite web|last1=Hunneyball|first1=Paul|title=COTTINGTON, Sir Francis, 1st Bt.

His Spanish experience rendered him useful to [[James I of England|King James]], and his bias in favour of Spain was always marked. He seemed to have promoted the Spanish policy from the first, and pressed on [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, conde de Gondomar]], the Spanish ambassador, the proposal for the Spanish in opposition to the [[Henrietta Maria of France|French]] marriage for Prince Charles (later King Charles I).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1616 he went as ambassador to Spain, transferring in 1618 the proposal of mediation by James I in the dispute with [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref name=\"hunneyball\"/>\n\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Lord Cottington.jpg|thumb|left|Francis Cottington was created Baron Cottington of Hanworth in [[Middlesex]] in 1631.]]\n\nAfter his return he was appointed secretary to Prince Charles in October 1622, and was [[knight]]ed and made a [[baronet]] in 1623.<ref name=Cockayne>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092524374#page/n241/mode/2up  George Edward Cokayne ''Complete Baronetage, Volume 1'' 1900]</ref> He strongly disapproved of the prince's expedition to Spain, as an adventure likely to upset the whole policy of marriage and alliance, but was overruled and chosen to accompany him.

The duke's assassination, however, enabled him to return.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe was a Roman Catholic at least at heart, becoming a member of that communion in 1623, returning to [[Protestantism]], and again declaring himself a Roman Catholic in 1636, and supporting the cause of the Roman Catholics in England.<ref>{{cite web |title=COTTINGTON, Sir Francis, 1st Bt.

On 10 July 1631 he was created Baron Cottington of Hanworth in [[Middlesex]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn March 1635 he was appointed master of the [[Court of Wards and Liveries]], and his exactions in this office added greatly to the unpopularity of the government. He was also appointed a commissioner for the [[Treasury]], together with [[William Laud]], and a fierce rivalry sprang up between the two men. However, in their personal encounters Cottington nearly always had the advantage, because he practised great reserve and possessed great powers of self-command, an extraordinary talent for dissembling, and a fund of humour. Laud completely lacked these qualities, and although really possessing much greater influence with Charles, he was often embarrassed and sometimes exposed to ridicule by his opponent.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe aim of Cottington's ambition was the place of lord treasurer, but Laud finally triumphed and secured it for his own nominee, [[William Juxon|Bishop Juxon]], when Cottington became \"no more a leader but meddled with his particular duties only.\"<ref>Strafford's ''Letters'', ii. 52</ref> He continued, however, to take a large share in public business and served on the committees for foreign, [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[Scotland|Scottish]] affairs. In the last, appointed in July 1638, he supported the war, and in May 1640, after the dismissal of the [[Short Parliament]], he declared it his opinion that at such a crisis the king might levy money without the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. His attempts to get funds from the [[City of London]] were unsuccessful, and he had recourse instead to a speculation in [[black pepper|pepper]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:LordCottington.jpg|thumb|Francis Cottington's title became extinct at his death because all his children predeceased him.]]\n\nHe had been appointed constable of the [[Tower of London|Tower]], and he now prepared the fortress for a [[siege]]. In the trial of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] in 1641, Cottington denied on oath that he had heard him use the incriminating words about \"reducing this kingdom\". When the parliamentary opposition became too strong to be any longer defied, Cottington, as one of those who had chiefly incurred their hostility, hastened to retire from the administration, giving up the court of wards in May 1641 and the chancellorship of the exchequer in January 1642.<ref name=\"hunneyball\"/> He rejoined the king in 1643, took part in the proceedings of the [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]], and was made [[Lord High Treasurer|lord treasurer]] on 3 October 1643. He signed the surrender of Oxford in July 1646, and being excepted from the indemnity retired abroad.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Career decline and death==\n\nHe joined Prince Charles at [[the Hague]] in 1648, and became one of his counsellors. In 1649, together with [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], Cottington went on a mission to Spain to obtain help for the royal cause, having an interview with [[Cardinal Mazarin]] at [[Paris]] on the way. They met, however, with an extremely ill reception, and Cottington found he had completely lost his popularity at the Spanish court, one cause being his shortcomings and waverings in the matter of religion. He  announced his intention of remaining in Spain and of keeping faithful to Roman Catholicism, and took up his residence at [[Valladolid]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Granger|first1=James|title=A Biographical History of England|date=1824|publisher=Baynes|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyengland02granuoft/page/273 273]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyengland02granuoft|quote=Francis Cottington.}}</ref> where he was maintained by the [[Jesuit]]s. He died there on 19 June 1652, his body being subsequently buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Cottington|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/francis-cottington|publisher=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe had amassed a large fortune and built two magnificent houses at [[Hanworth]] near [[Heathrow]] and [[Fonthill Gifford|Fonthill]] near [[Tisbury, Wiltshire|Tisbury]], [[Salisbury]].

His Spanish experience rendered him useful to [[James I of England|King James]], and his bias in favour of Spain was always marked. He seemed to have promoted the Spanish policy from the first, and pressed on [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, conde de Gondomar]], the Spanish ambassador, the proposal for the Spanish in opposition to the [[Henrietta Maria of France|French]] marriage for Prince Charles (later King Charles I).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1616 he went as ambassador to Spain, transferring in 1618 the proposal of mediation by James I in the dispute with [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref name=\"hunneyball\"/>\n\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Lord Cottington.jpg|thumb|left|Francis Cottington was created Baron Cottington of Hanworth in [[Middlesex]] in 1631.]]\n\nAfter his return he was appointed secretary to Prince Charles in October 1622, and was [[knight]]ed and made a [[baronet]] in 1623.<ref name=Cockayne>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092524374#page/n241/mode/2up  George Edward Cokayne ''Complete Baronetage, Volume 1'' 1900]</ref> He strongly disapproved of the prince's expedition to Spain, as an adventure likely to upset the whole policy of marriage and alliance, but was overruled and chosen to accompany him.

On 10 July 1631 he was created Baron Cottington of Hanworth in [[Middlesex]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn March 1635 he was appointed master of the [[Court of Wards and Liveries]], and his exactions in this office added greatly to the unpopularity of the government. He was also appointed a commissioner for the [[Treasury]], together with [[William Laud]], and a fierce rivalry sprang up between the two men. However, in their personal encounters Cottington nearly always had the advantage, because he practised great reserve and possessed great powers of self-command, an extraordinary talent for dissembling, and a fund of humour. Laud completely lacked these qualities, and although really possessing much greater influence with Charles, he was often embarrassed and sometimes exposed to ridicule by his opponent.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe aim of Cottington's ambition was the place of lord treasurer, but Laud finally triumphed and secured it for his own nominee, [[William Juxon|Bishop Juxon]], when Cottington became \"no more a leader but meddled with his particular duties only.\"<ref>Strafford's ''Letters'', ii. 52</ref> He continued, however, to take a large share in public business and served on the committees for foreign, [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[Scotland|Scottish]] affairs. In the last, appointed in July 1638, he supported the war, and in May 1640, after the dismissal of the [[Short Parliament]], he declared it his opinion that at such a crisis the king might levy money without the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. His attempts to get funds from the [[City of London]] were unsuccessful, and he had recourse instead to a speculation in [[black pepper|pepper]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:LordCottington.jpg|thumb|Francis Cottington's title became extinct at his death because all his children predeceased him.]]\n\nHe had been appointed constable of the [[Tower of London|Tower]], and he now prepared the fortress for a [[siege]]. In the trial of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Strafford]] in 1641, Cottington denied on oath that he had heard him use the incriminating words about \"reducing this kingdom\". When the parliamentary opposition became too strong to be any longer defied, Cottington, as one of those who had chiefly incurred their hostility, hastened to retire from the administration, giving up the court of wards in May 1641 and the chancellorship of the exchequer in January 1642.<ref name=\"hunneyball\"/> He rejoined the king in 1643, took part in the proceedings of the [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]], and was made [[Lord High Treasurer|lord treasurer]] on 3 October 1643.

In 1649, together with [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], Cottington went on a mission to Spain to obtain help for the royal cause, having an interview with [[Cardinal Mazarin]] at [[Paris]] on the way. They met, however, with an extremely ill reception, and Cottington found he had completely lost his popularity at the Spanish court, one cause being his shortcomings and waverings in the matter of religion.

The freeway passes north of La Crosse and south of [[Onalaska, Wisconsin|Onalaska]] as it heads towards [[Tomah, Wisconsin|Tomah]]. Once there, it joins [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|I-94]].  The two Interstates [[concurrency (road)|run concurrently]] for the next {{convert|91.76|mi|km}} to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. The highway collects [[Interstate 39]], {{convert|63|mi|km}} southeast of Tomah (near [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]]).  This concurrency of about {{convert|30|mi|km}} is one of only two three-route concurrency of the [[Interstate Highway System]] existence, the other being in [[Milwaukee]]. I-39 continues along I-90 for the remaining {{convert|78|mi|km}} in Wisconsin.\n\nI-94 breaks away eastward toward [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] at what is commonly known as the Badger Interchange, where the three Interstates meet with [[Wisconsin Highway 30|WIS 30]].  The remaining routes continue south to [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]] and [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] before exiting the state.\n{{-}}\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref

She is an eccentric fashion designer renowned for designing the costumes of several famous superheroes, having worked particularly closely with [[Bob Parr (The Incredibles)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Elastigirl]] (Bob and Helen Parr), with whom she has maintained a strong friendship. When the couple resumes their superheroic careers after fifteen years, Edna is summoned out of retirement to aid both characters, first by equipping Mr. Incredible with a new costume and then by restoring Elastigirl's confidence in herself as a superheroine.\n\nEdna was created by screenwriter and director [[Brad Bird]] to explain how ''The Incredibles''<nowiki/>' superheroes obtain their costumes, a topic he believes is rarely explored in superhero films convincingly. Bird also decided to voice the character himself after several actresses originally considered for the role failed to replicate Edna's unique accent. The director understood that, in addition to fashion expertise, the character would also need to demonstrate proficiency in science, engineering and technology in order to create costumes capable of withstanding the trials of superheroic activities, and ultimately conceived her as a short, confident character of both German and Japanese descent based on these countries' reputations as small yet powerful nations. Inspired by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] from the ''[[James Bond (franchise)|James Bond]]'' franchise, Edna is widely believed to have been based primarily on costume designer [[Edith Head]], although there continues to be constant speculation as to which celebrities inspired Edna, particularly ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor-in-chief [[Anna Wintour]] and actress [[Linda Hunt]].\n\nDespite having only supporting roles in both films, Edna has since established herself as ''The Incredibles''{{'}} [[breakout character]] due to her popularity among fans. While film critics agree that Edna is a [[Scene stealer|scene-stealer]], particularly praising her humor and dialogue, Bird has also been lauded for his voice acting, earning an [[Annie Award]] for [[Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production|Voice Acting in a Feature Production]] for his performance as the character. Edna has been recognized as one of Pixar's greatest characters by several prominent media publications.\n\n==Development==\n===Creation and voice===\n[[File:Brad bird cropped

The director recalled being surprised by Midler's height when he first met her \"Because ... she absolutely dominates the screen. And it just struck me how much personality was in this small body.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In terms of animation, Bird wanted all of the film's characters to move differently from each other, providing Edna with a very confident walk to represent the fact that she has \"never experienced doubt in her life.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> The animators found the fact that Bird provided the character's voice himself to be very helpful as he would often act out the way in which the character acts and behaves himself, which helped in further defining the animator's vision of Edna.<ref name=\":38\" /> According to Bird, Edna, despite her petite stature, is the only non-superhero in ''The Incredibles'' capable of making superheroes feel uncomfortable.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite

beautiful, it doesn\u2019t have to be pretty,\u201d and opting to envision Edna's outfits \"more as abstract sculpture\" as opposed to forms of clothing.<ref name=\":44\" /> In order to design costumes for a fictional character who also happens to be a designer in her own film, Imagire drew upon lessons she had learned while attending [[art school]], describing Edna's style as \"very to the

\"Their [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] is oftentimes different.\u201d<ref name=\":45\" /> Similarly, Imagire agreed that fashion designers such as Kawakubo, Ishioka and Abe \"always looked really comfortable in contrast to what they were creating for their models\", a contrast that she wanted to incorporate into the character.<ref name=\":45\" /> Recalling that Edna dislikes models, the artist envisioned that the character would instead design her own clothing to serve as \"a vehicle to celebrate superheroes and her powers.\"<ref name=\":45\" /> Inspired by Italian fashion designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], Marsigliese created a \"classic, [[Mid-century modern|mid-century]] inspired silhouette\" for Edna's costumes that were also bold and dramatic as though Edna herself had designed them, then rearranging the designs to ultimately give them a more surreal, specific appearance.<ref name=\":45\" /> Dubbing the character a \"woman of the now\", Marsigliese explained that, like Schiaparelli, Edna is \"completely ahead of her time\" despite living in the 1950s; \"she used a lot of surrealist elements, a lot of fun surprises, and that was very inspiring for me.\u201d<ref

She is an eccentric fashion designer renowned for designing the costumes of several famous superheroes, having worked particularly closely with [[Bob Parr (The Incredibles)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Elastigirl]] (Bob and Helen Parr), with whom she has maintained a strong friendship. When the couple resumes their superheroic careers after fifteen years, Edna is summoned out of retirement to aid both characters, first by equipping Mr. Incredible with a new costume and then by restoring Elastigirl's confidence in herself as a superheroine.\n\nEdna was created by screenwriter and director [[Brad Bird]] to explain how ''The Incredibles''<nowiki/>' superheroes obtain their costumes, a topic he believes is rarely explored in superhero films convincingly. Bird also decided to voice the character himself after several actresses originally considered for the role failed to replicate Edna's unique accent. The director understood that, in addition to fashion expertise, the character would also need to demonstrate proficiency in science, engineering and technology in order to create costumes capable of withstanding the trials of superheroic activities, and ultimately conceived her as a short, confident character of both German and Japanese descent based on these countries' reputations as small yet powerful nations. Inspired by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] from the ''[[James Bond (franchise)|James Bond]]'' franchise, Edna is widely believed to have been based primarily on costume designer [[Edith Head]], although there continues to be constant speculation as to which celebrities inspired Edna, particularly ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor-in-chief [[Anna Wintour]] and actress [[Linda Hunt]].\n\nDespite having only supporting roles in both films, Edna has since established herself as ''The Incredibles''{{'}} [[breakout character]] due to her popularity among fans. While film critics agree that Edna is a [[Scene stealer|scene-stealer]], particularly praising her humor and dialogue, Bird has also been lauded for his voice acting, earning an [[Annie Award]] for [[Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production|Voice Acting in a Feature Production]] for his performance as the character.

The director recalled being surprised by Midler's height when he first met her \"Because ... she absolutely dominates the screen. And it just struck me how much personality was in this small body.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> In terms of animation, Bird wanted all of the film's characters to move differently from each other, providing Edna with a very confident walk to represent the fact that she has \"never experienced doubt in her life.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> The animators found the fact that Bird provided the character's voice himself to be very helpful as he would often act out the way in which the character acts and behaves himself, which helped in further defining the animator's vision of Edna.<ref name=\":38\" /> According to Bird, Edna, despite her petite stature, is the only non-superhero in ''The Incredibles'' capable of making superheroes feel uncomfortable.<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite

beautiful, it doesn\u2019t have to be pretty,\u201d and opting to envision Edna's outfits \"more as abstract sculpture\" as opposed to forms of clothing.<ref name=\":44\" /> In order to design costumes for a fictional character who also happens to be a designer in her own film, Imagire drew upon lessons she had learned while attending [[art school]], describing Edna's style as \"very to the

character\" nonetheless, during which she drew inspiration from Edna's appearance and wardrobe in the first film, from her dress to the interior of her house.<ref name=\":46\" /> Although she was aware that Edna enjoys being dramatic, she acknowledge that \"fashion designers don\u2019t necessarily design things that they would wear on their person, they design for their models\", meaning, \"Their [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] is oftentimes different.\u201d<ref name=\":45\" /> Similarly, Imagire agreed that fashion designers such as Kawakubo, Ishioka and Abe \"always looked really comfortable in contrast to what they were creating for their models\", a contrast that she wanted to incorporate into the character.<ref name=\":45\" /> Recalling that Edna dislikes models, the artist envisioned that the character would instead design her own clothing to serve as \"a vehicle to celebrate superheroes and her powers.\"<ref name=\":45\" /> Inspired by Italian fashion designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], Marsigliese created a \"classic, [[Mid-century modern|mid-century]] inspired silhouette\" for Edna's costumes that were also bold and dramatic as though Edna herself had designed them, then rearranging the designs to ultimately give them a more surreal, specific appearance.<ref name=\":45\" /> Dubbing the character a \"woman of the now\", Marsigliese explained that, like Schiaparelli, Edna is \"completely ahead of her time\" despite living in the 1950s; \"she used a lot of surrealist elements, a lot of fun surprises, and that was very inspiring for me.\u201d<ref

Rhea, Uranus and Gaia devised a plan to save the last of them, Zeus. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in a cavern on the island of [[Crete]], and gave Cronus a stone wrapped in [[swaddling]] clothes, which he promptly swallowed; Rhea hid her infant son Zeus in a cave on [[Mount Ida]]. Her attendants, the warrior-like [[Korybantes|Kouretes]] and [[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyls]], acted as a bodyguard for the infant Zeus, helping to conceal his whereabouts from his father.\n\nIn some accounts, by the will of Rhea a golden dog guarded a goat which offered her udder and gave nourishment to the infant Zeus. Later on, Zeus changed the goat into an immortal among the stars while the golden dog that guarded the sacred spot in Crete was stolen by [[Pandareus]].''<ref name=\":0\" />''\n\n==Cult==\n\nRhea had \"no strong local cult or identifiable activity under her control\".<ref name=\"autogenerated171\">Roller, Lynn E., ''In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele,'' University of California Press, 1999. p. 171.</ref> She was originally worshiped on the island of [[Crete]], identified in mythology as the site of Zeus' infancy and upbringing. Her cults employed rhythmic, raucous chants and dances, accompanied by the [[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanon]] (a wide, handheld drum), to provoke a religious ecstasy. Her priests impersonated her mythical attendants, the Curetes and Dactyls, with a clashing of bronze shields and cymbals.<ref name=\"autogenerated171\" />\n\nThe tympanon's use in Rhea's rites may have been the source for its use in [[Cybele]]'s \u2013 in historical times, the resemblances between the two goddesses were so marked that some Greeks regarded Cybele as their own Rhea, who had deserted her original home on Mount Ida in Crete and fled to Mount Ida in the wilds of Phrygia to escape Cronus.<ref>Roller, Lynn E., ''In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele,'' University of California Press, 1999. p. 171.

For her ''[[temenos]]'' they wrought an image of the goddess, a ''[[xoanon]]'', from a vine-stump. There \"they called upon the mother of Dindymon, mistress of all, the dweller in Phrygia, and with her [[Dactyl (mythology)|Titias]] and [[Dactyl (mythology)|Kyllenos]] who alone of the many [[Dactyl (mythology)|Cretan Daktyls of Ida]] are called 'guiders of destiny' and 'those who sit beside the Idaean Mother'.\" They leapt and danced in their armour: \"For this reason the Phrygians still worship Rhea with tambourines and drums\".<ref>(Apollonius of Rhodes), Richard Hunter, tr., 1993.

Rhea, Uranus and Gaia devised a plan to save the last of them, Zeus. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in a cavern on the island of [[Crete]], and gave Cronus a stone wrapped in [[swaddling]] clothes, which he promptly swallowed; Rhea hid her infant son Zeus in a cave on [[Mount Ida]]. Her attendants, the warrior-like [[Korybantes|Kouretes]] and [[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyls]], acted as a bodyguard for the infant Zeus, helping to conceal his whereabouts from his father.\n\nIn some accounts, by the will of Rhea a golden dog guarded a goat which offered her udder and gave nourishment to the infant Zeus. Later on, Zeus changed the goat into an immortal among the stars while the golden dog that guarded the sacred spot in Crete was stolen by [[Pandareus]].''<ref name=\":0\" />''\n\n==Cult==\n\nRhea had \"no strong local cult or identifiable activity under her control\".<ref name=\"autogenerated171\">Roller, Lynn E., ''In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele,'' University of California Press, 1999. p. 171.</ref> She was originally worshiped on the island of [[Crete]], identified in mythology as the site of Zeus' infancy and upbringing. Her cults employed rhythmic, raucous chants and dances, accompanied by the [[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanon]] (a wide, handheld drum), to provoke a religious ecstasy. Her priests impersonated her mythical attendants, the Curetes and Dactyls, with a clashing of bronze shields and cymbals.<ref name=\"autogenerated171\" />\n\nThe tympanon's use in Rhea's rites may have been the source for its use in [[Cybele]]'s \u2013 in historical times, the resemblances between the two goddesses were so marked that some Greeks regarded Cybele as their own Rhea, who had deserted her original home on Mount Ida in Crete and fled to Mount Ida in the wilds of Phrygia to escape Cronus.<ref>Roller, Lynn E., ''In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele,'' University of California Press, 1999. p. 171.

For her ''[[temenos]]'' they wrought an image of the goddess, a ''[[xoanon]]'', from a vine-stump.
