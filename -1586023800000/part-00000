The name also marks the historic '''Tosa Maidan route''' into the Kashmir Valley from the [[Poonch River|Poonch Valley]]. In fact, the original name of Tosa Maidan appears to have been \"Tosa Marg\".<ref>{{citation |editor-last=Begley |editor-first=Wayne Edison |title=The Shah Jahan nama of 'Inayat Khan: An abridged history of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, compiled by his royal librarian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_BtAAAAMAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pp=127\u2013128}}: \"In that vale resembling Paradise, there are besides several summer retreats such as no other region can boast of. One is called the Godi Marg, another the Tosa Marg; and the profusion of flowers and plants in both those places is so great that you can pluck at least 100 different kinds of blossoms off a single parterre.\"</ref> [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and the Sikh monarch [[Ranjit Singh]] attempted to invade the Kashmir Valley via this route.\n\n== The Meadow ==\nTosa Maidan is a valley full of meadows surrounded by Pir Panchal ranges. 3 miles in length and 1.5 miles in breadth, it is 53 km distant from Srinagar. it is known as the king of meadows. Tosa Maidan is in khag tehsil of Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir. Tosa Maidan is not only famous as a pasture but also for its historical background. Bounded by dense forests, it is situated about 10 kms from Khag in the mountains of the Himalayan range. After crossing the upper mountain reaches of Drang, Zakhora and other small villages, one reaches the pasture of Tosa Maidan. It is said that Tosa Maidan is one of those pastures which the shepherds of other neighbouring countries also used to visit in ancient times. The Mughals used to go to Poonch using this route. It is said that they had constructed a seven-storeyed building \u2013 Dam-Dam \u2013 here. \n\nTosa Maidan is the largest pasture in its surrounding areas, 3 miles in length and 1.5 miles in width. Sky-touching [[Cedrus deodara|deodars]] fence this pasture presenting a view of a green carpet in summer. During the summer, the camps of the Gujjar community and shepherds with their grazing sheep in the pastures present a riveting picture. Also, the fragrance of wild flowers refreshes the whole environment.\n\n== The route ==\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|33.86|74.41}}   <!-- Map center -->\n| float = right\n| zoom = 10\n|

Another route is from [[Srinagar]] Gulmarg road,the route starts from Srinagar to [[Magam]], Magam to Khag via [[Aripanthan]] total distance about 50 km. Tosa Maidan gateway starts from the Drang village (going out from the Kashmir valley). After crossing the Tosa Maidain meadow, it ascends gently to an elevation of 13,000 ft at the top of [[Pir Panjal range]]. At the top of the Pir Panjal range, there are a number of passes leading to the Poonch Valley. The most often used pass is called Chinamarg Gali, once known as the '''Tosa Maidan pass''',{{sfnp|Mason, Routes in the Western Himalaya|1929|p=33}} near the Danam Sar lake.<ref name=\"Ahmad\" /><ref> [https://mapcarta.com/15210742 Chinamarg] and [https://mapcarta.com/15210906 Danam Sar], mapcarta.com</ref> It provides a steep descent into the [[Loran Valley]], passing by the village of Sultanpathri.{{sfnp|De Bourbel, Routes in Jammu and Kashmir |1897|pp=114\u2013115}}\nAt the southwest is another pass called Pathri ki Gali, near the Pam Sar lake (which is also the source of the main stream feeding the Sukhnag river).<ref name=\"Ahmad\">{{cite journal |last1=Ahmad |first1=Shabir |last2=Alam |first2=Akhtar |last3=Ahmad |first3=Bashir |last4=Bhat |first4=M.I. |last5=Sultan Bhat |first5=M. |title=Geomorphic evidence of unrecognized Balapur fault segment in the southwest Kashmir basin of northwest Himalayas |journal=Geomorphology |volume=250 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.09.006 |at=p.&nbsp;170, figure 13}}</ref><ref>[https://mapcarta.com/15210866 Pathri ki Gali] and [https://mapcarta.com/15210866 Pam Sar], mapcarta.com</ref> This provides a gentler descent into another branch of the Loran Valley, which meets up with the first route near the village of Loran. Both the branches of Loran streams feed the [[Mandi River]].{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on maps|1899|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nTo the north of Chinamrag Gali is another pass Jamianwali Gali, which descends into the Gagri Valley. This pass provides a longer route to Poonch.\n\n== History ==\nThe Tosa Maidan route into the Kashmir Valley was of high importance during the [[Lohara dynasty]] of Srinagar (1003\u20131320 CE), as is evident from its repeated mention in the last two Books of Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]''. {{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|pp=79\u201380}} The ruling house of the Lohara state, based in the Loran valley, took over the reigns of Kashmir after the death of its king Kshemagupta, who had married a Lohara princess. [[Samgramaraja]] was the first full-fledged ruler of the dynasty. During his rule, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] attempted to invade Kashmir via the Tosa Maidan route, once in 1003 and another time in 1021. In both the instances, he was blocked by the Lohara fort (''Loharkot'') that guarded the route. Mahmud was unable to conquer the fort itself. In the second instance, he also suffered a disruption of  communications due to a heavy snowfall. Historian Mohibbul Hasan states that this was the first serious reverse suffered by Mahmud in India.{{sfnp|Hasan, Kashmir under the Sultans|1959}}\n\n[[M. A. Stein]] states that, even before the time of Lohara dynasty, the route must have been quite important. It provided the shortest route between Srinagar and Poonch as well as access to the western Punjab areas between the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] and [[Indus River|Indus]] rivers, which were under the control of Kashmir until medieval times. The route was also the \"easiest and safest route in that direction\", since it provided easy ascent from the Kashir Valley and was well-guarded by the Loharkot fort.{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|p=80}} [[Al Beruni]] stated that brisk trade was carried out along this route.{{sfnp|Ganjoo, Kashmir: History and Politics|1998|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nThe importance of the route declined after the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]], during which the [[Pir Panjal Pass]] was developed as an Imperial Road, and the Afghan [[Durrani Empire|Durrani rule]], during which the Jhelum Valley cart-road was developed.{{sfnp|Hasan, Kashmir under the Sultans|1959|p=24}}{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|pp=66\u201367}} Even so, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] attempted two invasion Kashmir via the Tosa Maidan route in 1814 and 1819. The first time, his army was divided into two forces, one attacking the [[Pir Panjal Pass]] and the other the Tosa Maidan meadow. At the meadow, Ranjit Singh was blocked by the Durrani defences. He also suffered difficulty of maintaining supplies and was forced to retreat.{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|p=81}} Later in 1819, all the Sikh forces were concentrated on Tosa Maidan and conquered the Durrani forces.<ref>* {{citation |last=Gupta |first=Hari Ram |title=History of the Sikhs: The Sikh lion of Lahore, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, 1799-1839 |url=https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheSikhsVol.VTheSikhLionOfLahoremaharajaRanjitSingh |year=1991 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |pp=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\n=== Partition and war ===\n[[File:Relief of Poonch (Op Easy).png|thumb|right|Operation Easy, Poonch link-up]]\n\nSoon after the [[Partition of India]], the Muslims of the western tehsils of Poonch (especially the [[Bagh District|Bagh]] and [[Sudhnoti District|Sudhnoti]] tehsils) [[1947 Poonch rebellion|rebelled]] against the Hindu Maharaja of the princely state [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]. On 22 October 1947, raiders from Pakistan joined the rebels, leading to the [[First Kashmir War]]. The State Forces garrison at Poonch is said to have been besieged. The majority of the Tosa Maidan route up to the Pir Panjal range is likely to have come under the control of the rebels.\n\nAfter India sent its armed forces to defend the state following the Maharaja's accession, the Poonch garrison was maintained by air dropping supplies. Towards the end of 1948, the Indian Army's [[Operation Easy]] dispatched forces from [[Rajouri]] and [[Uri, Jammu and Kashmir|Uri]] to link up at Poonch and establish a line of defence along Uri\u2013Poonch-Nowshera line. After this was accomplished, the State Forces from the garrison fanned out in the area east of the line, clearing it of hostile forces. The Tosa Maidan route was thus secured.<ref>{{citation |last=Gulati |first=M.

In fact, the original name of Tosa Maidan appears to have been \"Tosa Marg\".<ref>{{citation |editor-last=Begley |editor-first=Wayne Edison |title=The Shah Jahan nama of 'Inayat Khan: An abridged history of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, compiled by his royal librarian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n_BtAAAAMAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pp=127\u2013128}}: \"In that vale resembling Paradise, there are besides several summer retreats such as no other region can boast of.

Tosa Maidan is in khag tehsil of Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir. Tosa Maidan is not only famous as a pasture but also for its historical background. Bounded by dense forests, it is situated about 10 kms from Khag in the mountains of the Himalayan range. After crossing the upper mountain reaches of Drang, Zakhora and other small villages, one reaches the pasture of Tosa Maidan. It is said that Tosa Maidan is one of those pastures which the shepherds of other neighbouring countries also used to visit in ancient times. The Mughals used to go to Poonch using this route. It is said that they had constructed a seven-storeyed building \u2013 Dam-Dam \u2013 here. \n\nTosa Maidan is the largest pasture in its surrounding areas, 3 miles in length and 1.5 miles in width. Sky-touching [[Cedrus deodara|deodars]] fence this pasture presenting a view of a green carpet in summer. During the summer, the camps of the Gujjar community and shepherds with their grazing sheep in the pastures present a riveting picture. Also, the fragrance of wild flowers refreshes the whole environment.\n\n== The route ==\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|33.86|74.41}}   <!-- Map center -->\n| float = right\n| zoom = 10\n|

Another route is from Srinagar Gulmarg road,the route starts from Srinagar to Magam, Magam to Khag via Aripanthan total distance about 50 km. Tosa Maidan gateway starts from the Drang village (going out from the Kashmir valley). After crossing the Tosa Maidain meadow, it ascends gently to an elevation of 13,000 ft at the top of [[Pir Panjal range]]. At the top of the Pir Panjal range, there are a number of passes leading to the Poonch Valley. The most often used pass is called Chinamarg Gali, once known as the '''Tosa Maidan pass''',{{sfnp|Mason, Routes in the Western Himalaya|1929|p=33}} near the Danam Sar lake.<ref name=\"Ahmad\" /><ref> [https://mapcarta.com/15210742 Chinamarg] and [https://mapcarta.com/15210906 Danam Sar], mapcarta.com</ref> It provides a steep descent into the [[Loran Valley]], passing by the village of Sultanpathri.{{sfnp|De Bourbel, Routes in Jammu and Kashmir |1897|pp=114\u2013115}}\nAt the southwest is another pass called Pathri ki Gali, near the Pam Sar lake (which is also the source of the main stream feeding the Sukhnag river).<ref name=\"Ahmad\">{{cite journal |last1=Ahmad |first1=Shabir |last2=Alam |first2=Akhtar |last3=Ahmad |first3=Bashir |last4=Bhat |first4=M.I. |last5=Sultan Bhat |first5=M. |title=Geomorphic evidence of unrecognized Balapur fault segment in the southwest Kashmir basin of northwest Himalayas |journal=Geomorphology |volume=250 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.09.006 |at=p.&nbsp;170, figure 13}}</ref><ref>[https://mapcarta.com/15210866 Pathri ki Gali] and [https://mapcarta.com/15210866 Pam Sar], mapcarta.com</ref> This provides a gentler descent into another branch of the Loran Valley, which meets up with the first route near the village of Loran. Both the branches of Loran streams feed the [[Mandi River]].{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on maps|1899|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nTo the north of Chinamrag Gali is another pass Jamianwali Gali, which descends into the Gagri Valley. This pass provides a longer route to Poonch.\n\n== History ==\nThe Tosa Maidan route into the Kashmir Valley was of high importance during the [[Lohara dynasty]] of Srinagar (1003\u20131320 CE), as is evident from its repeated mention in the last two Books of Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]''. {{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|pp=79\u201380}} The ruling house of the Lohara state, based in the Loran valley, took over the reigns of Kashmir after the death of its king Kshemagupta, who had married a Lohara princess. [[Samgramaraja]] was the first full-fledged ruler of the dynasty. During his rule, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] attempted to invade Kashmir via the Tosa Maidan route, once in 1003 and another time in 1021. In both the instances, he was blocked by the Lohara fort (''Loharkot'') that guarded the route. Mahmud was unable to conquer the fort itself. In the second instance, he also suffered a disruption of  communications due to a heavy snowfall. Historian Mohibbul Hasan states that this was the first serious reverse suffered by Mahmud in India.{{sfnp|Hasan, Kashmir under the Sultans|1959}}\n\n[[M. A. Stein]] states that, even before the time of Lohara dynasty, the route must have been quite important. It provided the shortest route between Srinagar and Poonch as well as access to the western Punjab areas between the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] and [[Indus River|Indus]] rivers, which were under the control of Kashmir until medieval times. The route was also the \"easiest and safest route in that direction\", since it provided easy ascent from the Kashir Valley and was well-guarded by the Loharkot fort.{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|p=80}} [[Al Beruni]] stated that brisk trade was carried out along this route.{{sfnp|Ganjoo, Kashmir: History and Politics|1998|pp=65\u201366}}\n\nThe importance of the route declined after the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]], during which the [[Pir Panjal Pass]] was developed as an Imperial Road, and the Afghan [[Durrani Empire|Durrani rule]], during which the Jhelum Valley cart-road was developed.{{sfnp|Hasan, Kashmir under the Sultans|1959|p=24}}{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|pp=66\u201367}} Even so, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] attempted two invasion Kashmir via the Tosa Maidan route in 1814 and 1819. The first time, his army was divided into two forces, one attacking the [[Pir Panjal Pass]] and the other the Tosa Maidan meadow. At the meadow, Ranjit Singh was blocked by the Durrani defences. He also suffered difficulty of maintaining supplies and was forced to retreat.{{sfnp|Stein, Memoir on Maps|1899|p=81}} Later in 1819, all the Sikh forces were concentrated on Tosa Maidan and conquered the Durrani forces.<ref>* {{citation |last=Gupta |first=Hari Ram |title=History of the Sikhs: The Sikh lion of Lahore, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, 1799-1839 |url=https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheSikhsVol.VTheSikhLionOfLahoremaharajaRanjitSingh |year=1991 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |pp=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\n=== Partition and war ===\n[[File:Relief of Poonch (Op Easy).png|thumb|right|Operation Easy, Poonch link-up]]\n\nSoon after the [[Partition of India]], the Muslims of the western tehsils of Poonch (especially the [[Bagh District|Bagh]] and [[Sudhnoti District|Sudhnoti]] tehsils) [[1947 Poonch rebellion|rebelled]] against the Hindu Maharaja of the princely state [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]. On 22 October 1947, raiders from Pakistan joined the rebels, leading to the [[First Kashmir War]]. The State Forces garrison at Poonch is said to have been besieged. The majority of the Tosa Maidan route up to the Pir Panjal range is likely to have come under the control of the rebels.\n\nAfter India sent its armed forces to defend the state following the Maharaja's accession, the Poonch garrison was maintained by air dropping supplies. Towards the end of 1948, the Indian Army's [[Operation Easy]] dispatched forces from [[Rajouri]] and [[Uri, Jammu and Kashmir|Uri]] to link up at Poonch and establish a line of defence along Uri\u2013Poonch-Nowshera line. After this was accomplished, the State Forces from the garrison fanned out in the area east of the line, clearing it of hostile forces. The Tosa Maidan route was thus secured.<ref>{{citation |last=Gulati |first=M.

After a period of [[beta testing]], it was officially released to new and existing users in the Netherlands on November 9, 2006, as a pilot market. Development of the beta was finished in April 2007, Windows Live Hotmail was released to new registrations on May 7, 2007, as the 260 million MSN Hotmail accounts worldwide gained access to the new system. The old MSN Hotmail interface was accessible only by users who registered before the Windows Live Hotmail release date and had not chosen to update to the new service.

Users can also perform edits to any received Office documents, and directly reply to the sender with the edited version of the document. In addition, users may also send up to 25 GB of Office documents (up to 50 MB each) using Outlook.com by uploading these documents onto OneDrive, and share these documents with other users for viewing or collaboration.

Users may also set up custom message rules based on the sender's or recipient's information, the subject of the email, or [[Email attachment|attachments to the email]].

It uses Ajax technology which enables users to view, add and [[drag-and-drop]] calendar events from one date to another without reloading the page, and features daily, weekly, monthly and agenda view modes. It also features a to-do list function for users to keep track of their tasks to be completed.\n\nCalendar events are stored online and can be viewed from any location. Multiple calendars can be created and shared, allowing different levels of permissions for each user.\n\n===People===\nOutlook's contacts management service was originally known as Windows Live Contacts and before that, Windows Live People. It provides users with access to their contacts' profiles and information, allowing them to share different information with different groups of people. Besides an address book, People also provides integrated services with social media, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = People app help - Windows Help|url = http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/people-app-faq|accessdate = 2015-08-28}}</ref> The service was rebranded to its current name in 2012, introducing a new interface based on the Metro design language that had already been introduced with Outlook.com.\n\nContacts are automatically updated in real-time, and the service allows for the removal of duplicated contact entries when imported with [[Profile (Microsoft service)|Profile]]. Users can also set limits on what parts of their contact details can be seen by others.\n\n===Tasks===\nTasks is task management component of Outlook.com introduced during the transition to the Office 365-based infrastructure.\n\n===Office for the web integration===\n[[File:Outlook apps shortcuts.png|thumb|The shortcut panel, which links various Microsoft online services, including Outlook.com]]\nOutlook.com integrates with [[Office Online|Office for the web]] to allow viewing and editing of [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] documents that are attached to the email messages. Users can directly open attached Office documents within the [[web browser]], and save them into their [[OneDrive]]. Users can also perform edits to any received Office documents, and directly reply to the sender with the edited version of the document. In addition, users may also send up to 25 GB of Office documents (up to 50 MB each) using Outlook.com by uploading these documents onto OneDrive, and share these documents with other users for viewing or collaboration. Users can also save emails to [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nguyen|first1=Vu Anh|title=Save emails directly to OneNote with Outlook.com|url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/save-emails-directly-onenote-outlook-com|accessdate=14 December 2015|work=WinBeta|date=24 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Skype integration===\nA preview version of [[Skype]] for Outlook.com started rolling out in the UK on April 30, 2013.

Once a \"sweep\" is performed, the user may choose to configure Outlook.com to remember the sweep settings and perform the same move or delete actions for any future emails. Users may also set up custom message rules based on the sender's or recipient's information, the subject of the email, or [[Email attachment|attachments to the email]]. There is also an option to delete/move messages that are older than a specified number of days, or only keep the latest message from a sender.\n\n===Quick views and one-click filters===\nQuick views allow users to filter all emails (in all folders) by document attachments, photo attachments, flagged messages, or shipping updates. One-click filters allow users to filter the inbox (or specific folder) based on whether or not the email message is unread, from the People service list, group mailing lists, or from a social networking website. Categories appear under quick views for ease of access.\n\n===Aliases===\nUsers can create additional, unique email addresses, called ''aliases'', for their Microsoft account. As of April 17, 2013, users can sign in with any alias and create up to 10 aliases per year for a total of up to 10 addresses. For a given account, all aliases uses the same inbox, [[contact list]], and account settings\u2014including password\u2014as the primary address.

A hairdresser by trade, he'd relocated his family from his native [[Derry]] in [[Northern Ireland]] because of the high unemployment there after the [[World War II|war]]. She was five when her parents were advised by their doctor to return to Derry because of the [[Great Smog|London smog]], and the harmful effect it had on some of their children. (London had not yet benefited from the [[Clean Air Act 1956]].) Their new home was on Derry's [[Creggan, Derry|Creggan housing estate]] where they stayed until 1967, when they moved to the newly built Rossville Flats complex<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=rossville+street+northern+ireland&countryCode=GB#map=54.99681,-7.32551%7c19%7c256&be=24327342%7cNorth&bd=useful_information&loc=GB:54.99681:-7.32551:17%7crossville%20street%20northern%20ireland%7cRossville%20Street%20(B527),%20Londonderry,%20County%20Londonderry,%20Northern%20Ireland,%20BT48%209 |title=\u2013 Rossville Street today, where the flats once stood opposite Glenfada Park |website=Multimap.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> in the [[Bogside]], an area overlooked by the historic city walls.\n\nHer parents were musical \u2013 her father played the trumpet in his own dance band, The Imperial All Stars, and her mother was their guest pianist. They had seven children in all: three sons and four daughters, including their third-born child Grace who died at eight months\nfrom a [[Anaphylaxis|penicillin allergy]]. Fifth-born and youngest daughter Rosemary won the first talent contest she entered - an all-aged event at St Columb's Hall when she was six. During her childhood she was taught to play the piano and violin, taught herself to play the acoustic guitar, sang in the school choir, and at one point, after years of ballet practice, considered becoming a ballet teacher. She took part in many more music and dance contests. In 1965, the now solo Rosemary Brown took part in a local talent contest at the Embassy Ballroom, where she won first prize \u2013 a chance to record a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]]. Tony Johnston, a headmaster and part-time promoter who sponsored the competition, took her under his wing while she continued with her studies at [[Thornhill College]], the Roman Catholic grammar school for girls she joined in 1963.\n\nAfter gaining seven good grades in her [[General Certificate of Education|GCE O-level]] exams, [[Rex Records (1965)|Rex Records]] (Decca) in Dublin received her demo and manager Michael Geoghegan signed her up. Her debut single was \"Sixteen\", written by Tony Johnston, while the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], \"Little Girl Blue\", was her own composition. It came out on 17 November 1967, but failed to take off, though local TV and radio began to show an interest in her. It was at this time that she adopted the professional name of \"Dana\", which had been her school nickname. Now studying [[A-level]] music and English, she became popular in Dublin's cabaret and folk clubs at weekends, and was crowned Queen of Cabaret at [[Clontarf Castle]] in 1968. Rex Records' secretary Phil Mitton suggested she audition for the Irish National Song Contest, due to take place in February 1969 \u2013 a victory would see her represent Ireland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. With mixed feelings due to nerves she made it through to the final in Dublin where she sang \"Look Around\" by Michael Reade, later released as her fourth single. Shown live on Irish television, Scallon came second to [[Muriel Day]] and \"Wages of Love\", also written by Reade.\n\n==1970s \u2013 Eurovision victory and pop career==\nIn December 1969 Tom McGrath, producer of the Irish National Song Contest, invited Scallon to try again next year, feeling that one of the entered songs, the ballad \"All Kinds of Everything\", would suit her. Her second attempt to win the Irish contest was a success. Then on Saturday 21 March 1970, the eighteen-year-old schoolgirl performed the song at the Eurovision finals held in the [[Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre]], before an estimated viewing audience of two hundred million. Perched on a stool while wearing an embroidered white mini-dress, she was the last of twelve contestants to perform that night. After the voting had finished she was declared the winner with 32 points, beating the favourite, UK's [[Mary Hopkin]], with 26 and Germany's [[Katja Ebstein]] with 12. Spain's [[Julio Iglesias]] came equal fourth with [[Guy Bonnet]] of France and [[Henri D\u00e8s]] of Switzerland. This was [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland's first of a record seven successes in the contest]].\n\nThe winning song was composed by two Dublin [[compositor (typesetting)|printworkers]], Derry Lindsay and Jackie Smith. The single was produced by Ray Horricks and arranged by [[Phil Coulter]]. Released on 14 March, it shot to #1 in the [[Irish singles chart]] before the contest began and stayed there for nine weeks. It also spent two weeks at the top of the [[UK singles chart]] on [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1970s|18 and 25 April]]. It was also successful in Australia, Austria, Germany, Israel, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. The song went on to sell more than two million units.\n\nScallon's debut album ''All Kinds of Everything'', recorded at [[Decca Studios]] in West Hampstead, London, on the weekend of 25 April 1970, was released in June and included four tracks co-written by the singer, as well as a new recording of the album's title track. Her follow-up single was issued in September, but [[Jerry Lordan]]'s \"I Will Follow You\" failed to chart. The song that put an end to her [[one-hit wonder]] status was found on the album ''Barry Ryan 3''. \"Who Put the Lights Out\", written by [[Paul Ryan (singer)|Paul Ryan]] for his twin brother, was offered to her by their stepfather [[Marion Ryan|Harold Davison]], the business partner of her agent Dick Katz. Her version, cut with [[Barry Ryan (singer)|Barry Ryan]]'s producer Bill Landis, proved a strong comeback vehicle reaching #5 in Ireland. In the UK it became a #14 hit on 13 March 1971. There then followed three years of unsuccessful singles broken only by the Irish chart showing of \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\", a #4 hit in December 1973. This lack of success caused her agent to recommend she join the former head of [[Bell Records]] Dick Leahy on his new label, [[GTO Records]].\n\nShe debuted on GTO with \"Please Tell Him That I Said Hello\", written by Mike Shepstone and Peter Dibbens. Within a month of its release in October 1974 it was #7 in Ireland. It took until the new year before making its UK chart debut in January. Boosted by ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performances on 6 February and 13 March, it climbed to #8 on 15 March 1975. This UK success gave the track a resurgence of popularity in Ireland where it rose to #7 again, this time in February. She also recorded a German version of the song. \"Spiel nicht mit mir und meinem Gl\u00fcck\" was a #27 hit in that country the same year. Scallon made a number of foreign singles, such as \"Wenn ein M\u00e4dchen verliebt ist\" (German, 1971), \"Tu Me Dis I Love You\" (French, 1975), and a Japanese version of \"It's Gonna be a Cold Cold Christmas\" in 1976.\n\nHer next single, \"Are You Still Mad at Me\", a [[Geoff Stephens]]/[[Roger Greenaway]] composition, missed the chart. They then wrote another song for her. \"It's Gonna be a Cold Cold Christmas\" was released four weeks prior to Christmas and gave her her second-highest UK chart position when it reached #4 on 27 December 1975. In Ireland it made #3, and the following year #12. At the end of the year Scallon collected two awards \u2013 Best Female Singer in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] from the ''[[NME]]'', and Best Female Singer from the ''[[TV Times]]''. The success continued into 1976, with a cover of [[Eric Carmen]]'s \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" becoming a UK #31 hit on 13 March. In September however, while promoting her new single, \"Fairytale\", she lost her voice. Her left vocal cord, which had been [[cauterize]]d the year before, required urgent surgery to remove what turned out to be a non-malignant growth, as well as a small part of the cord itself. This caused some newspapers to report on the possibility that she might never sing again. Despite her inability to fully promote \"Fairytale\", a disco number written by Paul Greedus and produced by [[Barry Blue]], it became a UK #13 hit on Christmas Day, and was also her biggest international success since \"All Kinds of Everything\". But having failed to regain her singing voice after the operation, she contacted Florence Wiese Norberg, a respected singing teacher. With her help she resumed live performances with a week-long engagement at Caesar's Palace in Luton in December 1977.\n\nBarry Blue started work on her fifth album soon after finishing work on [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]'s [[Central Heating (Heatwave album)|second album]], released in April 1978. Her final session at Utopia Studios in London ended two weeks before her wedding day in October. Issued in April 1979, ''The Girl is Back'' was the first LP she made that contained no [[cover versions]], and the track that rocked the most, \"Something's Cookin' in the Kitchen\" by Dave Jordan, became its only UK hit single, reaching #44 on 14 April. A disappointing result after a marketing campaign that included a new look for Scallon, a music video, life-size posters in major cities, and retailers receiving bonus [[flexi disc]]s. In Ireland it made #22. The album's title track was also released, followed by \"I Can't Get Over Getting Over You\", which she sang live on ''Top of the Pops'' in October, her final appearance on the show. The sad and reflective track \"Thieves of Paris\", written by Barry Blue and [[Lynsey de Paul]], has been rated one of the stand out tracks on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macaenese5354.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html |title=\u9676\u9189\u7684\u516d\u4e03\u5341\u5e74\u4ee3\u60c5\u61f7: January 2011 |website=Macaenese5354.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}</ref> They also wrote her 1972 single, \"Crossword Puzzle\", a #2 hit in Thailand.\n\nA new phase in her career began after [[Pope John Paul II]] came to Ireland in September 1979, inspiring her to write with her husband the Irish chart-topper, \"Totus Tuus\".\n\nOutside her chart career, Scallon had remained a popular personality since her 1970 Eurovision win. She had played the part of a [[Irish traveller|tinker]] girl in ''[[Flight of the Doves]]'' (1971), a children's adventure film starring [[Ron Moody]] and [[Jack Wild]] and directed by [[Ralph Nelson]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067104/ imdb.com \u2013 ''Flight of the Doves'']</ref> She also performed in summer seasons at resorts and seasonal pantomimes as well as performing at venues such as the [[Royal Albert Hall]], the [[Royal Festival Hall]] and a week of sell-out shows at the [[London Palladium]]. Scallon also performed extensively in cabaret venues and was voted Top Female Vocalist at the National Club Acts Awards in 1979. [[BBC Television]] gave her two shows of her own: a series of ''[[A Day with Dana]]'' in 1974 and four series of ''Wake Up Sunday'' in 1979. For [[BBC Radio]] she presented a series of ''I Believe in Music'' in 1977.\n\n==1980s \u2013 Catholic music==\nHaving scored an Irish number one in January 1980 with the song that was based on the Pope's motto: [[Totus Tuus]], Latin for Totally Yours, the much larger American Christian market became a possible outlet for her music. Not long after returning home from a promotional visit to the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] conference in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], opened by [[Jimmy Carter|US President Jimmy Carter]], she was contacted by award-winning songwriter [[Kurt Kaiser]], vice president of [[Word Records]]. He invited her back to the USA where she was offered a recording contract. Meanwhile, [[Warwick Records (United Kingdom)|Warwick Records]] issued ''Everything is Beautiful'' in late 1980. Recorded in September at Pye Studios in London, the LP subtitled ''20 Inspirational Songs'' was advertised on TV and became her biggest-selling album in the UK, reaching #43 in the chart on 10 January 1981. It was followed later that year by ''Totally Yours'', her first Christian album for Word Records; the songs \"Praise the Lord\", \"The Soft Rain\" and \"Totus Tuus\" were credited to \"Dana and Damien Scallon\". As was \"Little Baby (Grace's Song)\", written while she was pregnant with their first child.\n\nShe was soon back in the studios again to make ''Magic'' in 1982, a pop album for Lite Records made at [[Morgan Studios]] and Maison Rouge Studios in London. It included four songs by her younger brothers John and Gerald Brown, as well as the single \"I Feel Love Comin' On\", written by [[Barry White]], which peaked at #66 in the UK on 22 May. Collaborating with her younger brothers they wrote the official Northern Ireland [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] song \"Yer Man\", and she recorded it with the full [[1982 FIFA World Cup squads|squad]] before they headed to Spain for the finals. Following this, her second album for Word was completed; ''Let There Be Love'' contained up-tempo Christian pop, jazz, ballads, and an old Irish hymn sung in Gaelic called [[Ag Criost an Siol]].\n\nScallon starred in a [[London's West End|West End]] production of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', staged at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] during the 1983 Christmas and New Year pantomime season. The venues first panto broke box-office records and was extended into February. She played ''Snow White'' for over fourteen years, each time in a different city, beginning the run at the [[Hull New Theatre|New Theatre]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in 1982.\n\nA tour of America took place in 1984 to promote her two Word albums. Appearances were made in concert halls, churches, colleges and also on TV and radio.\n\nAfter fifteen years in show business [[Hodder and Stoughton]] published ''Dana \u2013 An Autobiography'' in 1985. It told the story of her childhood, married life and music career, as well as her growing devotion to God. At the same time as her book launch came the release of her fifties tribute album ''If I Give My Heart to You'', featuring her last UK chart entry \"Little Things Mean a Lot\", #92 on 13 July 1985. In Ireland in made #27, as did the album's title track.\n\nDue to work commitments in 1979, she wasn't in the country when Pope John Paul II became [[Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland|the first pope ever to visit Ireland]]. But she eventually saw him in 1987 at the Superdome in [[New Orleans]], having been invited there to perform \"Totus Tuus\" before a gathering of 80,000 or more. After her performance the [[pontiff]] made his way to the stage to personally thank her for writing the song.\n\n==1990s \u2013 Politics==\nSoon after completing a concert tour of England in early 1990, she took her family to [[Florida]] for an [[Easter]] holiday. Her break was interrupted by a request to fly to [[Irondale, Alabama]] and make a guest appearance at [[Eternal Word Television Network]]'s (EWTN) tenth anniversary show. Afterwards, the network's founder [[Mother Angelica]] enquired if her ex-hotelier husband would like to work there, setting up a retreat centre to look after the hundreds of visitors the network attracted each day. Then mid holiday she sang at a Rosary Rally in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], and was asked to write a theme song for the [[Rosary]]. The result was ''The Rosary'', an album released with [[Heart Beat Records]] in 1991 that has amassed over a million sales around the world.\n\nBy August 1991 the Scallons were living in [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], close to EWTN's headquarters where Damien now worked. Thoughts of winding down her career were dashed when her husband was asked if his wife would like to work there, presenting a music programme. ''Say Yes'' became the first TV series she made for them. Three more followed: ''We Are One Body'', ''Backstage'' and ''Dana and friends''. With this exposure she became a popular Catholic music singer, appearing at conferences and public gatherings across America. [[Heart Beat Records]], the US Catholic music label, issued a number of her music and prayer albums.\n\nTo help celebrate the sixth [[World Youth Day]] event held in [[Cherry Creek State Park]], Denver in 1993, she was invited to sing in the presence of Pope John Paul II the theme song for the occasion, \"We Are One Body\", a song she composed herself. She also sang at the World Youth Day celebrations held in [[Paris]] in 1997, Toronto in 2002 and Sydney in 2008.\n\nIn June 1997, she received a letter from the Christian Community Centre in Ireland suggesting she run for the [[President of Ireland|Irish presidency]]. Having no interest in politics at the time, and never having heard of that organisation, she threw the \"incredible\" proposal in the bin. But they persisted and similar mail arrived from other people. Then the media got involved. She eventually agreed to seek nomination as a candidate in the [[1997 Irish presidential election]], standing as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] under the name Dana Rosemary Scallon. Her campaign was based on the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] and her belief that it could only be amended with the agreement of the Irish people by public ballot. She later became the first-ever presidential candidate to secure a nomination solely from County and City Councils, rather than from members of the [[Oireachtas]]. Polling day was 31 October, and Scallon received 175,458 of the first-preference votes (13.8%), coming third to [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]'s candidate and eventual winner [[Mary McAleese]]. Before returning to America she told reporters: \"I may not be a president, but I ''am'' a [[precedent]].\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/terry-prone-with-mary-on-for-the-aras-the-contest-really-hots-up-2658423.html |title=With Mary on for the Aras the contest really hots up |work=[[Evening Herald]] |author=Terry Prone |date=26 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nShe was granted US citizenship in 1999, requiring her to swear an [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|oath]] renouncing allegiance to any other state.<ref name=\"Dana denies US passport deception\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1007/president.html |title=Dana denies US passport deception |publisher=RT\u00c9 |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Sheehan\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/this-is-a-bid-to-discredit-me-i-wont-be-broken-2907429.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130218015034/http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/this-is-a-bid-to-discredit-me-i-wont-be-broken-2907429.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 February 2013 |title=This is a bid to discredit me -- I won't be broken |work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)]] |author=Maeve Sheehan |date=16 October 2011 }}</ref> That same year she again stood as an independent, this time winning a seat in the [[European Parliament]], representing Connacht\u2013Ulster.

Scallon also had public disagreements at the time with the Catholic hierarchy (notably with Cardinal [[Desmond Connell]]), the latter wishing instead to negotiate a consensus solution.<ref name=\"rte.ie\"/>\n\nAs an independent she unsuccessfully contested a seat in [[Galway West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Galway West]] in the 2002 Irish general election, scoring just 3.5% of the first preference vote.

Tony Johnston, a headmaster and part-time promoter who sponsored the competition, took her under his wing while she continued with her studies at [[Thornhill College]], the Roman Catholic grammar school for girls she joined in 1963.\n\nAfter gaining seven good grades in her [[General Certificate of Education|GCE O-level]] exams, [[Rex Records (1965)|Rex Records]] (Decca) in Dublin received her demo and manager Michael Geoghegan signed her up. Her debut single was \"Sixteen\", written by Tony Johnston, while the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], \"Little Girl Blue\", was her own composition. It came out on 17 November 1967, but failed to take off, though local TV and radio began to show an interest in her. It was at this time that she adopted the professional name of \"Dana\", which had been her school nickname. Now studying [[A-level]] music and English, she became popular in Dublin's cabaret and folk clubs at weekends, and was crowned Queen of Cabaret at [[Clontarf Castle]] in 1968. Rex Records' secretary Phil Mitton suggested she audition for the Irish National Song Contest, due to take place in February 1969 \u2013 a victory would see her represent Ireland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. With mixed feelings due to nerves she made it through to the final in Dublin where she sang \"Look Around\" by Michael Reade, later released as her fourth single. Shown live on Irish television, Scallon came second to [[Muriel Day]] and \"Wages of Love\", also written by Reade.\n\n==1970s \u2013 Eurovision victory and pop career==\nIn December 1969 Tom McGrath, producer of the Irish National Song Contest, invited Scallon to try again next year, feeling that one of the entered songs, the ballad \"All Kinds of Everything\", would suit her. Her second attempt to win the Irish contest was a success. Then on Saturday 21 March 1970, the eighteen-year-old schoolgirl performed the song at the Eurovision finals held in the [[Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre]], before an estimated viewing audience of two hundred million. Perched on a stool while wearing an embroidered white mini-dress, she was the last of twelve contestants to perform that night. After the voting had finished she was declared the winner with 32 points, beating the favourite, UK's [[Mary Hopkin]], with 26 and Germany's [[Katja Ebstein]] with 12. Spain's [[Julio Iglesias]] came equal fourth with [[Guy Bonnet]] of France and [[Henri D\u00e8s]] of Switzerland. This was [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland's first of a record seven successes in the contest]].\n\nThe winning song was composed by two Dublin [[compositor (typesetting)|printworkers]], Derry Lindsay and Jackie Smith. The single was produced by Ray Horricks and arranged by [[Phil Coulter]]. Released on 14 March, it shot to #1 in the [[Irish singles chart]] before the contest began and stayed there for nine weeks. It also spent two weeks at the top of the [[UK singles chart]] on [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1970s|18 and 25 April]]. It was also successful in Australia, Austria, Germany, Israel, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. The song went on to sell more than two million units.\n\nScallon's debut album ''All Kinds of Everything'', recorded at [[Decca Studios]] in West Hampstead, London, on the weekend of 25 April 1970, was released in June and included four tracks co-written by the singer, as well as a new recording of the album's title track. Her follow-up single was issued in September, but [[Jerry Lordan]]'s \"I Will Follow You\" failed to chart. The song that put an end to her [[one-hit wonder]] status was found on the album ''Barry Ryan 3''. \"Who Put the Lights Out\", written by [[Paul Ryan (singer)|Paul Ryan]] for his twin brother, was offered to her by their stepfather [[Marion Ryan|Harold Davison]], the business partner of her agent Dick Katz. Her version, cut with [[Barry Ryan (singer)|Barry Ryan]]'s producer Bill Landis, proved a strong comeback vehicle reaching #5 in Ireland. In the UK it became a #14 hit on 13 March 1971. There then followed three years of unsuccessful singles broken only by the Irish chart showing of \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\", a #4 hit in December 1973. This lack of success caused her agent to recommend she join the former head of [[Bell Records]] Dick Leahy on his new label, [[GTO Records]].\n\nShe debuted on GTO with \"Please Tell Him That I Said Hello\", written by Mike Shepstone and Peter Dibbens. Within a month of its release in October 1974 it was #7 in Ireland. It took until the new year before making its UK chart debut in January. Boosted by ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performances on 6 February and 13 March, it climbed to #8 on 15 March 1975. This UK success gave the track a resurgence of popularity in Ireland where it rose to #7 again, this time in February. She also recorded a German version of the song. \"Spiel nicht mit mir und meinem Gl\u00fcck\" was a #27 hit in that country the same year. Scallon made a number of foreign singles, such as \"Wenn ein M\u00e4dchen verliebt ist\" (German, 1971), \"Tu Me Dis I Love You\" (French, 1975), and a Japanese version of \"It's Gonna be a Cold Cold Christmas\" in 1976.\n\nHer next single, \"Are You Still Mad at Me\", a [[Geoff Stephens]]/[[Roger Greenaway]] composition, missed the chart. They then wrote another song for her. \"It's Gonna be a Cold Cold Christmas\" was released four weeks prior to Christmas and gave her her second-highest UK chart position when it reached #4 on 27 December 1975. In Ireland it made #3, and the following year #12. At the end of the year Scallon collected two awards \u2013 Best Female Singer in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] from the ''[[NME]]'', and Best Female Singer from the ''[[TV Times]]''. The success continued into 1976, with a cover of [[Eric Carmen]]'s \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" becoming a UK #31 hit on 13 March. In September however, while promoting her new single, \"Fairytale\", she lost her voice. Her left vocal cord, which had been [[cauterize]]d the year before, required urgent surgery to remove what turned out to be a non-malignant growth, as well as a small part of the cord itself. This caused some newspapers to report on the possibility that she might never sing again. Despite her inability to fully promote \"Fairytale\", a disco number written by Paul Greedus and produced by [[Barry Blue]], it became a UK #13 hit on Christmas Day, and was also her biggest international success since \"All Kinds of Everything\". But having failed to regain her singing voice after the operation, she contacted Florence Wiese Norberg, a respected singing teacher. With her help she resumed live performances with a week-long engagement at Caesar's Palace in Luton in December 1977.\n\nBarry Blue started work on her fifth album soon after finishing work on [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]'s [[Central Heating (Heatwave album)|second album]], released in April 1978. Her final session at Utopia Studios in London ended two weeks before her wedding day in October. Issued in April 1979, ''The Girl is Back'' was the first LP she made that contained no [[cover versions]], and the track that rocked the most, \"Something's Cookin' in the Kitchen\" by Dave Jordan, became its only UK hit single, reaching #44 on 14 April. A disappointing result after a marketing campaign that included a new look for Scallon, a music video, life-size posters in major cities, and retailers receiving bonus [[flexi disc]]s. In Ireland it made #22. The album's title track was also released, followed by \"I Can't Get Over Getting Over You\", which she sang live on ''Top of the Pops'' in October, her final appearance on the show. The sad and reflective track \"Thieves of Paris\", written by Barry Blue and [[Lynsey de Paul]], has been rated one of the stand out tracks on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macaenese5354.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html |title=\u9676\u9189\u7684\u516d\u4e03\u5341\u5e74\u4ee3\u60c5\u61f7: January 2011 |website=Macaenese5354.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}</ref> They also wrote her 1972 single, \"Crossword Puzzle\", a #2 hit in Thailand.\n\nA new phase in her career began after [[Pope John Paul II]] came to Ireland in September 1979, inspiring her to write with her husband the Irish chart-topper, \"Totus Tuus\".\n\nOutside her chart career, Scallon had remained a popular personality since her 1970 Eurovision win. She had played the part of a [[Irish traveller|tinker]] girl in ''[[Flight of the Doves]]'' (1971), a children's adventure film starring [[Ron Moody]] and [[Jack Wild]] and directed by [[Ralph Nelson]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067104/ imdb.com \u2013 ''Flight of the Doves'']</ref> She also performed in summer seasons at resorts and seasonal pantomimes as well as performing at venues such as the [[Royal Albert Hall]], the [[Royal Festival Hall]] and a week of sell-out shows at the [[London Palladium]]. Scallon also performed extensively in cabaret venues and was voted Top Female Vocalist at the National Club Acts Awards in 1979. [[BBC Television]] gave her two shows of her own: a series of ''[[A Day with Dana]]'' in 1974 and four series of ''Wake Up Sunday'' in 1979. For [[BBC Radio]] she presented a series of ''I Believe in Music'' in 1977.\n\n==1980s \u2013 Catholic music==\nHaving scored an Irish number one in January 1980 with the song that was based on the Pope's motto: [[Totus Tuus]], Latin for Totally Yours, the much larger American Christian market became a possible outlet for her music. Not long after returning home from a promotional visit to the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] conference in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], opened by [[Jimmy Carter|US President Jimmy Carter]], she was contacted by award-winning songwriter [[Kurt Kaiser]], vice president of [[Word Records]]. He invited her back to the USA where she was offered a recording contract. Meanwhile, [[Warwick Records (United Kingdom)|Warwick Records]] issued ''Everything is Beautiful'' in late 1980. Recorded in September at Pye Studios in London, the LP subtitled ''20 Inspirational Songs'' was advertised on TV and became her biggest-selling album in the UK, reaching #43 in the chart on 10 January 1981. It was followed later that year by ''Totally Yours'', her first Christian album for Word Records; the songs \"Praise the Lord\", \"The Soft Rain\" and \"Totus Tuus\" were credited to \"Dana and Damien Scallon\". As was \"Little Baby (Grace's Song)\", written while she was pregnant with their first child.\n\nShe was soon back in the studios again to make ''Magic'' in 1982, a pop album for Lite Records made at [[Morgan Studios]] and Maison Rouge Studios in London. It included four songs by her younger brothers John and Gerald Brown, as well as the single \"I Feel Love Comin' On\", written by [[Barry White]], which peaked at #66 in the UK on 22 May. Collaborating with her younger brothers they wrote the official Northern Ireland [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] song \"Yer Man\", and she recorded it with the full [[1982 FIFA World Cup squads|squad]] before they headed to Spain for the finals. Following this, her second album for Word was completed; ''Let There Be Love'' contained up-tempo Christian pop, jazz, ballads, and an old Irish hymn sung in Gaelic called [[Ag Criost an Siol]].\n\nScallon starred in a [[London's West End|West End]] production of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', staged at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] during the 1983 Christmas and New Year pantomime season. The venues first panto broke box-office records and was extended into February. She played ''Snow White'' for over fourteen years, each time in a different city, beginning the run at the [[Hull New Theatre|New Theatre]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in 1982.\n\nA tour of America took place in 1984 to promote her two Word albums. Appearances were made in concert halls, churches, colleges and also on TV and radio.\n\nAfter fifteen years in show business [[Hodder and Stoughton]] published ''Dana \u2013 An Autobiography'' in 1985. It told the story of her childhood, married life and music career, as well as her growing devotion to God. At the same time as her book launch came the release of her fifties tribute album ''If I Give My Heart to You'', featuring her last UK chart entry \"Little Things Mean a Lot\", #92 on 13 July 1985. In Ireland in made #27, as did the album's title track.\n\nDue to work commitments in 1979, she wasn't in the country when Pope John Paul II became [[Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland|the first pope ever to visit Ireland]]. But she eventually saw him in 1987 at the Superdome in [[New Orleans]], having been invited there to perform \"Totus Tuus\" before a gathering of 80,000 or more. After her performance the [[pontiff]] made his way to the stage to personally thank her for writing the song.\n\n==1990s \u2013 Politics==\nSoon after completing a concert tour of England in early 1990, she took her family to [[Florida]] for an [[Easter]] holiday. Her break was interrupted by a request to fly to [[Irondale, Alabama]] and make a guest appearance at [[Eternal Word Television Network]]'s (EWTN) tenth anniversary show. Afterwards, the network's founder [[Mother Angelica]] enquired if her ex-hotelier husband would like to work there, setting up a retreat centre to look after the hundreds of visitors the network attracted each day. Then mid holiday she sang at a Rosary Rally in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], and was asked to write a theme song for the [[Rosary]]. The result was ''The Rosary'', an album released with [[Heart Beat Records]] in 1991 that has amassed over a million sales around the world.\n\nBy August 1991 the Scallons were living in [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], close to EWTN's headquarters where Damien now worked. Thoughts of winding down her career were dashed when her husband was asked if his wife would like to work there, presenting a music programme. ''Say Yes'' became the first TV series she made for them. Three more followed: ''We Are One Body'', ''Backstage'' and ''Dana and friends''. With this exposure she became a popular Catholic music singer, appearing at conferences and public gatherings across America. [[Heart Beat Records]], the US Catholic music label, issued a number of her music and prayer albums.\n\nTo help celebrate the sixth [[World Youth Day]] event held in [[Cherry Creek State Park]], Denver in 1993, she was invited to sing in the presence of Pope John Paul II the theme song for the occasion, \"We Are One Body\", a song she composed herself. She also sang at the World Youth Day celebrations held in [[Paris]] in 1997, Toronto in 2002 and Sydney in 2008.\n\nIn June 1997, she received a letter from the Christian Community Centre in Ireland suggesting she run for the [[President of Ireland|Irish presidency]]. Having no interest in politics at the time, and never having heard of that organisation, she threw the \"incredible\" proposal in the bin. But they persisted and similar mail arrived from other people. Then the media got involved. She eventually agreed to seek nomination as a candidate in the [[1997 Irish presidential election]], standing as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] under the name Dana Rosemary Scallon. Her campaign was based on the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] and her belief that it could only be amended with the agreement of the Irish people by public ballot. She later became the first-ever presidential candidate to secure a nomination solely from County and City Councils, rather than from members of the [[Oireachtas]]. Polling day was 31 October, and Scallon received 175,458 of the first-preference votes (13.8%), coming third to [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]'s candidate and eventual winner [[Mary McAleese]]. Before returning to America she told reporters: \"I may not be a president, but I ''am'' a [[precedent]].\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/terry-prone-with-mary-on-for-the-aras-the-contest-really-hots-up-2658423.html |title=With Mary on for the Aras the contest really hots up |work=[[Evening Herald]] |author=Terry Prone |date=26 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nShe was granted US citizenship in 1999, requiring her to swear an [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|oath]] renouncing allegiance to any other state.<ref name=\"Dana denies US passport deception\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1007/president.html |title=Dana denies US passport deception |publisher=RT\u00c9 |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Sheehan\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/this-is-a-bid-to-discredit-me-i-wont-be-broken-2907429.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130218015034/http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/this-is-a-bid-to-discredit-me-i-wont-be-broken-2907429.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 February 2013 |title=This is a bid to discredit me -- I won't be broken |work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)]] |author=Maeve Sheehan |date=16 October 2011 }}</ref> That same year she again stood as an independent, this time winning a seat in the [[European Parliament]], representing Connacht\u2013Ulster.

Scallon is opposed to abortion in all cases, In 2013 she said \"there is no legal or constitutional obligation for politicians to legislate for the deliberate killing of an unborn child and there is no medical evidence to support this radical change to how we treat our mothers and their children and the taking of an innocent and defenceless human life can never be justified\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/dana-calls-for-referendum-on-abortion-law-1.1456045|title=Dana calls for referendum on abortion law|website=irishtimes.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref> She was also vocal for her opposition to [[divorce]] and same sex marriage, along with a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] line on the [[European Union|EU]].

Scallon also had public disagreements at the time with the Catholic hierarchy (notably with Cardinal [[Desmond Connell]]), the latter wishing instead to negotiate a consensus solution.<ref name=\"rte.ie\"/>\n\nAs an independent she unsuccessfully contested a seat in [[Galway West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Galway West]] in the 2002 Irish general election, scoring just 3.5% of the first preference vote. In June 2004, Scallon lost her European Parliament seat, taking 13.5% of the vote. Later that year she failed to secure a nomination to the office of President of Ireland against the uncontested incumbent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=4459 |title=Dana election results at Elections Ireland |website=Electionsireland.org |date= |accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nReturning to the world of entertainment in 2005, she spent seven weeks on the RT\u00c9 television series ''The Afternoon Show'', where she did a fitness routine with a trainer and lost fifteen pounds in weight in time for her eldest daughter's wedding. In 2006, she and dancer Ronan McCormack were paired together in the RT\u00c9 dance series ''[[Celebrity Jigs 'n' Reels]]''. They made it to the final show and came second.

She additionally has the knack of befriending most of the women whom she should consider her rivals for Makoto's affections (Makoto's colleague Makie Sugiyama is a notable exception). Yura is also a big fan of [[undead]]-themed [[horror movie]]s. When she was in high school, she was a member of the Tennis club.\n\n:She is voiced by Yumi Ichihara (radio drama) and [[Tomoko Kawakami]] (OVA), and portrayed by Chika Inada (TV series), Nana Nanaumi (web series) and Y\u016bri Morishita (films).\n\n;{{nihongo|Rika Kawada|\u6cb3\u7530 \u68a8\u9999|Kawada Rika}}\n:Yura's 20-year-old sister. Sexually experienced and rather promiscuous (to the point where, early in the series, she keeps a boyfriend and three \"sex friends\"&nbsp;&ndash; in addition to miscellaneous flings), she constantly teases and goads both Makoto and Yura into improving their \"night life\". At first in an on-and-off relationship with her \"number-one boyfriend\", Taku Yamada, for most of the series, she eventually decides to settle down, even marrying the son of Makoto's boss Katori,<ref>''Futari Ecchi'' 46</ref> though their matrimony rapidly disintegrates soon afterwards following personal differences.<ref>''Futari Ecchi'' 48</ref>\n\n:She is voiced by [[Fumie Kusachi]] (radio drama) and Naoko Takano (OVA), and portrayed by Ayaka Tomoda (web series) and Miyuki Yokoyama (films).\n\n;{{nihongo|Akira Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u660e|Onoda Akira}}\n:Makoto's older brother. A 29-year-old [[lawyer]]. He is very nosy and frequently pesters Makoto about his sex life and fancies himself as Makoto's tutor on the topic of pleasuring the wife. In order to appease his own sex drive, he frequently visits [[brothel]]s.\n\n:He is portrayed by [[Yuichi Tsuchiya]] (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Jun Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u6df3|Onoda Jun}}\n:Makoto's 17-year-old sister. Initially she has a rather romantic look on a relationship, and her quest for true love lets her drift through a number of affairs before she finally finds happiness with her first boyfriend, Yosuke.\n\n:She is portrayed by Natsumi Kamata (web series) and Kirara Asuka (2nd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Sanae Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u65e9\u82d7|Onoda Sanae}}\n:Makoto's sister-in-law and Akira's 27-year-old wife. She is annoyed at Akira's habit of patronizing brothels.\n\n:She is portrayed by Sasa Handa (web series) and [[Rika Kawamura]] (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Mamoru Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u5b88|Onoda Mamoru}}\n:Makoto's father. A 52-year-old company officer. He is overly sensitive about his sex life, and far too protective of his youngest child, Jun.\n\n:He is portrayed by Bengaru (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Akiko Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u660e\u5b50|Onoda Akiko}}\n:Makoto's mother. A 54-year-old housewife. Akiko proves to be more liberal (and encouraging) than her husband is when it comes to the topic of her sex life.\n\n:She is portrayed by [[Motoko Sasaki]] (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Hideki Kawada|\u6cb3\u7530 \u79c0\u6a39|Kawada Hideki}}\n:Yura's father. A 49-year-old [[camera operator]]. He has a liking for cats and dogs, and raises a large number of them. He is also a fan of the [[Hanshin Tigers]]. While not as active as his daughters, he still enjoys a fulfilling sexual relationship with his wife Chiharu.\n   \n;{{nihongo|Chiharu Kawada|\u6cb3\u7530 \u5343\u6625|Kawada Chiharu}}\n:Yura's mother. A 47-year-old with a youthful appearance and a tender personality. Like her husband, she is a cat/dog aficionado. She frequently suffers from [[Low back pain|lumbago]].\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Omiya|\u5927\u5bae \u674f\u5b50|\u014cmiya Ky\u014dko}}\n:Makoto's second cousin and an [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] and [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]]. At the request of Makoto's mother, she moved in next door to the Onodas to encourage them to reproduce. A very dominant personality, she was still a virgin at age thirty, but she finally does get settled down with Koichiro Matsuzaki.\n\n:She is portrayed by Momoko Tani (3rd film).\n\n; {{nihongo|Taku Yamada|\u5c71\u7530 \u62d3|Yamada Taku}}\n:Rika's \"number-one boyfriend\", who is a rather self-centered sexist. And just like Rika, he is not very concerned about having more than one relationship, although he does react jealously when he finds her involved with other men. Eventually, however, Rika dumps him, settles down, divorces and rekindles their relationship.\n\n:He is voiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]] (OVA) and portrayed by Yukio (web series).\n\n;{{nihongo|Yosuke Inoue|\u4e95\u4e0a \u6d0b\u52a9|Inoue Y\u014dsuke}}\n:Jun's first and current boyfriend; also her former classmate and now fellow student. Jun had her first time with him, but due to their then differing views of a relationship they broke apart for a couple of years before finding each other again. They have since moved together and are exploring (and deepening) their feelings for each other.\n\n:He is portrayed by [[Rakuto Tochihara]] (web series).\n\n==Style and theme==\nThere are many scenes in the series that look like they are actually happening but are then revealed to be the [[sexual fantasies]] of Makoto or another character. This means there are many scenes of Makoto having sex with other characters, while in truth he only has sex with Yura.\n\nOne of the [[fetishes]] explored in the series is [[cosplay]].\n\nThough most of the early chapters focus on Makoto and Yura's relationship, it later deviates to other characters' love/sex lives, covering more events to teach the readers with.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{Main|List of Futari Ecchi chapters}}\n\nWritten and illustrated by [[Katsu Aki]], ''Futari Ecchi'' has been serialized biweekly in ''[[Young Animal (magazine)|Young Animal]]'' since January 1997.

The series follows a newlywed couple in their mid-twenties, both virgins when they married, and chronicles their sexual explorations. The manga combines erotic elements with factual and informative statistics. Its title ''Futari Ecchi'' (\"two person [[ecchi]]\") is a play on a slang term for [[masturbation]], ''hitori ecchi'' (\"single person ecchi\").

He was introduced to Yura through an [[omiai]]. He is very critical of his own sexual abilities, but that does not hinder him from having sexual fantasies with any pretty girl in his vicinity (ultimately, though, he stays faithful to Yura). Nevertheless, after his marriage he attracts the attention of a lot of female admirers. In addition to his inexperience, Makoto suffers from [[premature ejaculation]].<ref name=\"Volume1\" />\n\n:He is voiced by [[Mitsuo Iwata]] (radio drama) and [[Y\u016bji Ueda]] (OVA), and portrayed by S\u014d Yamanaka (TV series), Shinnosuke Fukushima (web series), [[Riki Miura]] (1st film) and Hikaru Okada (2nd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Yura Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u512a\u826f|Onoda Y\u016bra}}\n:Makoto's wife. Also 25 years old.  Makoto is the first man she has ever kissed or had sex with.<ref name=\"Volume1\" /> She is loving, but extremely na\u00efve on sexual matters and too shy to try something new by herself (even through the series she is fully determined to overcome her limitations and be a better lover to Makoto), as well as insecure about her looks; she is unaware how beautiful and charming she is. She is also the target of attention by many men (although their behavior is&nbsp;&ndash; compared to the women who adore her husband&nbsp;&ndash; mostly passive longing). She additionally has the knack of befriending most of the women whom she should consider her rivals for Makoto's affections (Makoto's colleague Makie Sugiyama is a notable exception). Yura is also a big fan of [[undead]]-themed [[horror movie]]s. When she was in high school, she was a member of the Tennis club.\n\n:She is voiced by Yumi Ichihara (radio drama) and [[Tomoko Kawakami]] (OVA), and portrayed by Chika Inada (TV series), Nana Nanaumi (web series) and Y\u016bri Morishita (films).\n\n;{{nihongo|Rika Kawada|\u6cb3\u7530 \u68a8\u9999|Kawada Rika}}\n:Yura's 20-year-old sister. Sexually experienced and rather promiscuous (to the point where, early in the series, she keeps a boyfriend and three \"sex friends\"&nbsp;&ndash; in addition to miscellaneous flings), she constantly teases and goads both Makoto and Yura into improving their \"night life\". At first in an on-and-off relationship with her \"number-one boyfriend\", Taku Yamada, for most of the series, she eventually decides to settle down, even marrying the son of Makoto's boss Katori,<ref>''Futari Ecchi'' 46</ref> though their matrimony rapidly disintegrates soon afterwards following personal differences.<ref>''Futari Ecchi'' 48</ref>\n\n:She is voiced by [[Fumie Kusachi]] (radio drama) and Naoko Takano (OVA), and portrayed by Ayaka Tomoda (web series) and Miyuki Yokoyama (films).\n\n;{{nihongo|Akira Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u660e|Onoda Akira}}\n:Makoto's older brother. A 29-year-old [[lawyer]]. He is very nosy and frequently pesters Makoto about his sex life and fancies himself as Makoto's tutor on the topic of pleasuring the wife. In order to appease his own sex drive, he frequently visits [[brothel]]s.\n\n:He is portrayed by [[Yuichi Tsuchiya]] (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Jun Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u6df3|Onoda Jun}}\n:Makoto's 17-year-old sister. Initially she has a rather romantic look on a relationship, and her quest for true love lets her drift through a number of affairs before she finally finds happiness with her first boyfriend, Yosuke.\n\n:She is portrayed by Natsumi Kamata (web series) and Kirara Asuka (2nd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Sanae Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u65e9\u82d7|Onoda Sanae}}\n:Makoto's sister-in-law and Akira's 27-year-old wife. She is annoyed at Akira's habit of patronizing brothels.\n\n:She is portrayed by Sasa Handa (web series) and [[Rika Kawamura]] (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Mamoru Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u5b88|Onoda Mamoru}}\n:Makoto's father. A 52-year-old company officer. He is overly sensitive about his sex life, and far too protective of his youngest child, Jun.\n\n:He is portrayed by Bengaru (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Akiko Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u660e\u5b50|Onoda Akiko}}\n:Makoto's mother. A 54-year-old housewife. Akiko proves to be more liberal (and encouraging) than her husband is when it comes to the topic of her sex life.\n\n:She is portrayed by [[Motoko Sasaki]] (3rd film).\n\n;{{nihongo|Hideki Kawada|\u6cb3\u7530 \u79c0\u6a39|Kawada Hideki}}\n:Yura's father. A 49-year-old [[camera operator]]. He has a liking for cats and dogs, and raises a large number of them. He is also a fan of the [[Hanshin Tigers]]. While not as active as his daughters, he still enjoys a fulfilling sexual relationship with his wife Chiharu.\n   \n;{{nihongo|Chiharu Kawada|\u6cb3\u7530 \u5343\u6625|Kawada Chiharu}}\n:Yura's mother. A 47-year-old with a youthful appearance and a tender personality. Like her husband, she is a cat/dog aficionado. She frequently suffers from [[Low back pain|lumbago]].\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Omiya|\u5927\u5bae \u674f\u5b50|\u014cmiya Ky\u014dko}}\n:Makoto's second cousin and an [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] and [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]]. At the request of Makoto's mother, she moved in next door to the Onodas to encourage them to reproduce. A very dominant personality, she was still a virgin at age thirty, but she finally does get settled down with Koichiro Matsuzaki.\n\n:She is portrayed by Momoko Tani (3rd film).\n\n; {{nihongo|Taku Yamada|\u5c71\u7530 \u62d3|Yamada Taku}}\n:Rika's \"number-one boyfriend\", who is a rather self-centered sexist. And just like Rika, he is not very concerned about having more than one relationship, although he does react jealously when he finds her involved with other men. Eventually, however, Rika dumps him, settles down, divorces and rekindles their relationship.\n\n:He is voiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]] (OVA) and portrayed by Yukio (web series).\n\n;{{nihongo|Yosuke Inoue|\u4e95\u4e0a \u6d0b\u52a9|Inoue Y\u014dsuke}}\n:Jun's first and current boyfriend; also her former classmate and now fellow student. Jun had her first time with him, but due to their then differing views of a relationship they broke apart for a couple of years before finding each other again. They have since moved together and are exploring (and deepening) their feelings for each other.\n\n:He is portrayed by [[Rakuto Tochihara]] (web series).\n\n==Style and theme==\nThere are many scenes in the series that look like they are actually happening but are then revealed to be the [[sexual fantasies]] of Makoto or another character. This means there are many scenes of Makoto having sex with other characters, while in truth he only has sex with Yura.\n\nOne of the [[fetishes]] explored in the series is [[cosplay]].\n\nThough most of the early chapters focus on Makoto and Yura's relationship, it later deviates to other characters' love/sex lives, covering more events to teach the readers with.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{Main|List of Futari Ecchi chapters}}\n\nWritten and illustrated by [[Katsu Aki]], ''Futari Ecchi'' has been serialized biweekly in ''[[Young Animal (magazine)|Young Animal]]'' since January 1997.

The [[larva]]e, which hatch in three to 10 days, move about on the skin, [[ecdysis|moult]] into a [[nymph (biology)|nymphal]] stage, and then mature into adult mites. The adult mites live three to four weeks in the host's skin.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nThe action of the mites moving within the skin and on the skin itself produces an intense itch that may resemble an [[allergic reaction]] in appearance. A delayed [[Type IV hypersensitivity]] reaction to the mites, their eggs, or scybala (packets of feces) occurs approximately 30 days after infestation. The presence of the eggs produces a massive allergic response that, in turn, produces more itching. Individuals who already are sensitized from a prior infestation can develop symptoms within hours.\n\n''[[Sarcoptes]]'' is a genus of skin parasites, and part of the larger family of mites collectively known as \"scab mites\". They are also related to the scab mite ''Psoroptes'', also a mite that infests the skin of domestic animals. Sarcoptic mange affects domestic animals and similar infestations in domestic fowls causes the disease known as \"scaly leg\". The effects of ''S. scabiei'' are the most well-known, causing \"scabies\", or \"the itch\". The adult female mite, having been fertilized, burrows into the skin (usually at the hands or wrists, but other parts of the body may also be affected), and lays its eggs.\n\nThe burrowing is carried out using the mouth parts and special cutting surfaces on the front legs. While these are being used, the mite anchors itself with suckers on its feet. Eggs are laid in small numbers as the mite burrows, and, as these hatch, six-legged larvae climb out on to the skin and search for hair follicles, where they feed and moult (discard old cuticles to grow). In the hair follicles, the larvae show the first nymphal stages, with eight legs.\n\nIn the nymphal stages, the creature feeds and moults, and if male, gives rise to the adult. In the case of females, another moult occurs before adulthood. The female has more moults than a male, so takes longer\u201417 days compared to 9 to 11 days for a male\u2014to reach adulthood. The female is about twice the size of the male.\n\nAlthough the life-cycle is only about two weeks, individual patients are seldom found to have more than about a dozen mites on them. Even so, this number can cause agonising itching, especially at night, and severe damage to the skin often comes as a result of scratching, in particular by the introduction of infective bacteria, which may lead to [[impetigo]] or [[eczema]].\n[[File:Sarcoptes scabiei 1.ogv|thumb|200px |alt=Video of the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. | Video of the ''S. scabiei'' mite]]\n[[File:Sarcoptes scabiei.ogv|thumb|200px |alt=Video of the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. | Video of the ''S. scabiei'' mite]]\n\nThe eggs are laid by the female at a rate of about two to three eggs a day for about two months.

After three to four days, the larvae molt, turning into eight-legged nymphs. This form molts a second time into slightly larger nymphs, before a final molt into adult mites. Adult mites then mate when the male penetrates the molting pouch of the female. Mating occurs only once, as that one event leaves the female fertile for the rest of her life (one to two months).

{"title_page": "Copper in health", "text_new": "[[Image:Copper metabolism.png|thumb|Normal absorption and distribution of copper. Cu = copper, CP = [[ceruloplasmin]], green = ATP7B carrying copper.]]\n[[Copper]] is an essential [[trace element]] that is vital to the health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]]). In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport.\n\nCopper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing. Copper also helps to neutralize \"[[free-radical]]s\", which can cause severe damage to cells.\n\nCopper's essentiality was first discovered in 1928, when it was demonstrated that rats fed a copper-deficient milk diet were unable to produce sufficient red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hart |first1=E.

J. 2001. Copper metabolism and requirements in the pregnant mother, her fetus, and children. New York: International Copper Association{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its [[liver]] during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-10_12|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion.

Much attention has focused on the potential consequences of copper toxicity in normal and potentially susceptible populations. Potentially susceptible subpopulations include [[hemodialysis]] patients and individuals with chronic liver disease. Recently, concern was expressed about the potential sensitivity to liver disease of individuals who are [[heterozygote]] carriers of Wilson disease genetic defects (i.e., those having one normal and one mutated Wilson copper ATPase gene) but who do not have the disease (which requires defects in both relevant genes).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=George J. |title=Editorial: Is heterozygosity for a Wilson's disease gene defect an important underlying cause of infantile and childhood copper toxicosis syndromes? |journal=The Journal of Trace Elements in Experimental Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2000 |pages=249\u201354 |doi=10.1002/1520-670X(2000)13:3<249::AID-JTRA1>3.0.CO;2-L |hdl=2027.42/35050 }}</ref> However, to date, no data are available that either support or refute this hypothesis.\n\n===Acute exposures===\nIn case reports of humans intentionally or accidentally ingesting high concentrations of copper salts (doses usually not known but reported to be 20\u201370&nbsp;grams of copper), a progression of symptoms was observed including abdominal pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea, [[tachycardia]], respiratory difficulty, [[hemolytic anemia]], [[hematuria]], massive gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, and death.\n\nEpisodes of acute gastrointestinal upset following single or repeated ingestion of drinking water containing elevated levels of copper (generally above 3\u20136&nbsp;mg/L) are characterized by nausea, vomiting, and stomach irritation. These symptoms resolve when copper in the drinking water source is reduced.\n\nThree experimental studies were conducted that demonstrate a threshold for acute gastrointestinal upset of approximately

The most reliable indicator of excess copper status is liver copper concentration. However, measurement of this endpoint in humans is intrusive and not generally conducted except in cases of suspected copper poisoning. Increased serum copper or ceruolplasmin levels are not reliably associated with copper toxicity as elevations in concentrations can be induced by inflammation, infection, disease, malignancies, pregnancy, and other biological stressors. Levels of copper-containing enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and diaminase oxidase, vary not only in response to copper state but also in response to a variety of other physiological and biochemical factors and therefore are inconsistent markers of excess copper status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=David B |title=Copper intake and assessment of copper status |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=67 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=1041S\u20131045S |year=1998 |pmid=9587149 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/67.5.1041S }}</ref>\n\nA new candidate biomarker for copper excess as well as deficiency has emerged in recent years.

In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-10_12|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion. These symptoms abate when the high copper food source is no longer ingested.\n\nIn 1996, the International Program on Chemical Safety, a World Health Organization-associated agency, stated \"there is greater risk of health effects from deficiency of copper intake than from excess copper intake.\" This conclusion was confirmed in recent multi-route exposure surveys.<ref name=\"Steven S 2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Georgopoulos |first1=Panos G |last2=Wang |first2=Sheng Wei |last3=Georgopoulos |first3=Ioannis G |last4=Yonone-Lioy |first4=Mary Jean |last5=Lioy |first5=Paul J |title=Assessment of human exposure to copper: A case study using the NHEXAS database |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397\u2013409 |year=2006 |pmid=16249795 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500462 }}</ref>\n\nThe health conditions of non-genetic copper deficiency and copper excess are described below.\n\n===Copper deficiency===\nThere are conflicting reports on the extent of deficiency in the U.S. One review indicates approximately 25% of adolescents, adults, and people over 65, do not meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for copper.<ref name=pmid17454552/> Another source states less common: a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 1.11 and 1.54&nbsp;mg/day, respectively.

In 2015 his friends and colleagues launched the New Palmyra Project to bring that dream to life. Since then, many of the most famous structures in Palmyra have been modeled, and some life-size models built of structures that were destroyed in the [[Syrian Civil War]].\n\nAs of 2017, most of the buildings and statues captured by the New Palmyra Project have been completely destroyed by ISIL.\n\n=== Writing and art ===\nKhartabil wrote hundreds of letters while in prison, including some while he was in a high-security military prison, where writing was prohibited. He also produced some paintings and poetry.

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n!

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n!

With the formula C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>9</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>9</sub>, it consists of two corannulene units connected through a single C-C bond. The molecule's stereochemistry consists of two chiral elements: the asymmetry of a singly substituted corannulenyl, and the helical twist about the central bond. In the neutral state, bicorannulenyl exists as 12 conformers, which intercovert through multiple bowl-inversions and bond-rotations.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/jo800359z| pmid = 18505292| year = 2008| last1 = Eisenberg | first1 = D.| last2 = Filatov | first2 = A.| last3 = Jackson | first3 = E.| last4 = Rabinovitz | first4 = M.| last5 = Petrukhina | first5 = M.| last6 = Scott | first6 = L.| last7 = Shenhar | first7 = R.| title = Bicorannulenyl: stereochemistry of a C40H18 biaryl composed of two chiral bowls| volume = 73| issue = 16| pages = 6073\u20136078| journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry | bibcode = 2007JOCh...72.1134P}}</ref> \nWhen bicorannulenyl is reduced to a dianion with potassium metal, the central bond assumes significant double-bond character.
