She was built at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania and [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 7 December 1943 (the second anniversary of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor raid]]), sponsored by the wife of Governor [[Walter Goodland]] of Wisconsin.\n\nDuring her career, ''Wisconsin'' served in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], where she shelled [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[fortifications]] and screened United States [[aircraft carrier]]s as they conducted [[airstrike|air raids]] against enemy positions. During the [[Korean War]], ''Wisconsin'' shelled [[North Korea]]n targets in support of [[United Nations]] and [[South Korea]]n ground operations, after which she was [[ship decommissioning|decommissioned]]. She was reactivated on 1 August 1986; after a  modernization program, she participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in January and February 1991.\n\n''Wisconsin'' was last decommissioned in September 1991 after a total of 14 years of active service in the fleet, and having earned a total of six [[service star|battle stars]] for service in World War II and Korea, as well as a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for service during the January/February 1991 [[Gulf War]]. She currently functions as a museum ship operated by [[Nauticus, The National Maritime Center]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. ''Wisconsin'' was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) 17 March 2006, and was donated for permanent use as a [[museum ship]]. On 15 April 2010, the City of Norfolk officially took over ownership of the ship.<ref name=\"Ship\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.wavy.com/dpp/military/City-to-take-ownership-of-USS-Wisconsin-Friday \n |title=City to take ownership of USS Wisconsin \n |date=14 April 2010 \n |accessdate=15 April 2010 \n |agency=Associated Press \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416025639/http://www.wavy.com/dpp/military/City-to-take-ownership-of-USS-Wisconsin-Friday \n |archivedate=16 April 2010 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n{{Main|Iowa-class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}\n\n''Wisconsin'' was one of the \"[[fast battleship]]\" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]].

As a part of that movement, the planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of [[Mindoro]], south of [[Luzon]]. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the [[South China Sea]]. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, ''Wisconsin'' was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at [[Manila]] to soften up Japanese positions.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 18 December, the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force\u2013seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 [[destroyer]]s\u2013during their attempt to refuel at sea.

On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers, {{USS|Hull|DD-350|2}}, {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|2}}, and {{USS|Spence|DD-512|2}}, capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.<ref name=\"PT\"/> Approximately 790 men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured.

Bypassing the southern beaches, American amphibious forces went ashore at [[Lingayen Gulf]], the scene of initial Japanese assaults to take Luzon nearly three years before.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'', armed with heavy anti-aircraft batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during air strikes against [[Taiwan|Formosa]], Luzon, and the [[Nansei Shoto]] to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3\u201322 January 1945, included a thrust into the South China Sea, in the hope that major units of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] could be drawn into battle.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin''{{'}}s carrier group launched air strikes between [[Saigon]] and [[Camranh Bay]], [[French Indochina]], on 12 January, resulting in severe losses for the enemy. TF 38's warplanes sank 41 ships and heavily damaged docks, storage areas, and aircraft facilities. Formosa, already struck on 3\u20134 January, was raided again on 9 January 15 January, and 21 January. Throughout January ''Wisconsin'' shielded the carriers as they conducted air raids at Hong Kong, [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Hainan Island]], the Canton [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], the Hong Kong Naval Station, and [[Okinawa]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Service with 5th Fleet, Admiral Spruance===\n''Wisconsin'' was assigned to the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] when Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet. She moved northward with the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area. On 16 February, the task force approached the Japanese coast under cover of adverse weather conditions and achieved complete tactical surprise. As a result, ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground. Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, also suffered drastically, as did hangars and aircraft installations.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' and the task force moved to [[Iwo Jima]] on 17 February to provide direct support for the landings slated to take place on 19 February. They revisited Tokyo on 25 February and hit the island of [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachino]] off the coast of [[Honsh\u016b]] the next day, resulting in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin''{{'}}s task force stood out of [[Ulithi]] on 14 March bound for Japan. The mission of that group was to eliminate airborne resistance from the Japanese homeland to American forces off Okinawa. Enemy fleet units at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and [[Kobe]], on southern Honsh\u016b, reeled under the impact of the explosive blows delivered by TF 58's airmen. On 18\u201319 March, from a point {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], TF 58 hit enemy airfields on that island; unfortunately, allied anti-aircraft fire on 19 March failed to stop an attack on the carrier {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}}. That afternoon, ''Wisconsin'' and the task force retired from Ky\u016bsh\u016b, screening the blazing and battered flattop, and shooting down 48 attackers.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 24 March, ''Wisconsin'' trained her {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns on targets ashore on [[Okinawa]]. Together with the other battleships of the task force, she pounded Japanese positions and installations in preparation for the landings. Japanese resistance, while fierce, was doomed to failure by dwindling numbers of aircraft and trained pilots.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[Image:WWII Wisconsin.JPG|thumb|left|''Wisconsin'' escorting USS ''Essex''-class aircraft carriers in the Pacific Ocean during [[World War II]]. The tail crane was used to recover reconnaissance planes launched by ''Wisconsin''.]]\n\nWhile TF 58's planes were dealing with {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and her escorts, enemy aircraft attacked the American surface units. Combat air patrols (CAP) shot down 15 enemy planes, and ships' gunfire shot down another three, but not before one ''[[kamikaze]]'' attack penetrated the CAP and screen to crash on the flight deck of the fleet carrier {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}. On 11 April, the Japanese renewed their ''kamikaze'' attacks; and only drastic maneuvers and heavy barrages of gunfire saved the task force. Combat air patrols shot down 17 planes, and ships' gunfire shot down 12. The next day, 151 enemy aircraft attacked TF 58, but ''Wisconsin'', together with other units of the screens for the vital carriers, kept the ''kamikaze'' pilots at bay and destroyed them before they could reach their targets. Over the days that ensued, Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks managed to crash into three carriers\u2014{{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2}} and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}\u2014on successive days.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBy 4 June, a typhoon was swirling through the Fleet. ''Wisconsin'' rode out the storm unscathed, but three cruisers, two carriers, and a destroyer suffered serious damage. Offensive operations were resumed on 8 June with a final aerial assault on Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Japanese aerial response was virtually nonexistent; 29 planes were located and destroyed. On that day, one of ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s [[floatplane]]s landed and rescued a downed pilot from the carrier {{USS|Shangri-La|CV-38|2}}.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Bombardment of Japan===\n{{see also|Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II}}\n\n''Wisconsin'' ultimately put into [[Leyte Gulf]] and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft on the ground and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, due in large part to a weak Japanese response to their presence.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 16 July, ''Wisconsin'' fired her {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns at the [[steel mill]]s and [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] at [[Muroran]], Hokkaido. Two days later, she wrecked industrial facilities in the [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi Miro]] area, on the coast of Honsh\u016b-, northeast of Tokyo itself. During that bombardment, British battleships of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] contributed their heavy shellfire. By that point in the war, Allied warships such as ''Wisconsin'' were able to shell the Japanese homeland almost at will.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nTF 38's planes subsequently blasted the Japanese naval base at [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], and put the former fleet flagship [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] out of action, one of the two remaining Japanese battleships. Throughout July and into August, Admiral Halsey's airmen visited destruction upon the Japanese, the last instance being against Tokyo on 13 August. Two days later, the Japanese surrendered, ending World War II.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'', as part of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on 5 September, three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}. During ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s brief career in World War II, she had steamed {{convert|105831|mi|km|abbr=on}} since commissioning; had shot down three enemy planes; had claimed assists on four occasions; and had fueled her screening destroyers on some 250 occasions.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Post World War II (1945\u20131950)===\nShifting subsequently to [[Okinawa]], the battleship embarked homeward-bound GIs on 22 September 1945, as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet]] staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on 23 September, ''Wisconsin'' reached [[Pearl Harbor]] on 4 October, remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the west coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached San Francisco on 15 October.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nHeading for the east coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, ''Wisconsin'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] from 11\u201313 January and reached [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] on 18 January. Following a cruise south to [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], Cuba, the battleship entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer months, ''Wisconsin'' sailed for South American waters.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOver the weeks that ensued, the battleship visited [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile, from 1\u20136 November; [[Callao]], Peru, from 9\u201313 November; [[Balboa, Canal Zone]], from 16\u201320 November; and [[La Guaira, Venezuela]], from 22\u201326 November, before returning to Norfolk on 2 December 1946.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' spent nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], and saw visits conducted at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne.

She departed Hampton Roads on 25 August and participated in the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] exercise [[Operation Mainbrace]], which was held out of Greenock, Scotland. After her return to Norfolk, ''Wisconsin'' underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. ''Wisconsin'' remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises. After a month of routine maintenance ''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on 9 September 1953, bound for the Far East.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nSailing via the [[Panama Canal]] to Japan, ''Wisconsin'' relieved {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}} as 7th Fleet flagship on 12 October. During the months that followed, ''Wisconsin'' visited the Japanese ports of [[Kobe]], [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo Navy Yard]], [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], [[Otaru]], and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. She spent Christmas at Hong Kong and was ultimately relieved of flagship duties on 1 April 1954 and returned to the United States soon thereafter, reaching Norfolk, via Long Beach and the Panama Canal, on 4 May.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nEntering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 June, ''Wisconsin'' underwent a brief overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on 12 July. After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the ship returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly thereafter, ''Wisconsin'' participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for Commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, ''Wisconsin'' took part in Operation Springboard, during which time she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, upon returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another midshipman's cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh; [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]; and Guant\u00e1namo Bay before returning to the United States.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nUpon completion of a major overhaul at the [[New York Naval Shipyard]], ''Wisconsin'' headed south for refresher training in the [[Caribbean Sea]], later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added [[Tampico, Mexico]], and [[Cartagena, Colombia]], to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk on the last day of March 1955 for local operations.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/> On 19 October, while operating in the [[East River]] in New York Harbor, ''Wisconsin'' was accidentally grounded.

''Wisconsin'' remained in the Persian Gulf after the cease-fire took effect, and returned home on 28 March 1991.

The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, ''Wisconsin'' was decommissioned on 30 September 1991 after 14 total years of active service, and joined the [[Reserve Fleet]] at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]].  She was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) on 12 January 1995, then on 15 October 1996, she was moved to the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]], and on 12 February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register. On 7 December 2000, the battleship was towed from Portsmouth, Virginia and berthed adjacent to [[Nauticus, The National Maritime Center]] in Norfolk. On 16 April 2001 the battleship's weather decks were opened to the public by the [[Hampton Roads Naval Museum]], a U.S. Navy museum charged with ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s interpretation and public visitation.

As a part of that movement, the planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of [[Mindoro]], south of [[Luzon]]. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the [[South China Sea]]. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, ''Wisconsin'' was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at [[Manila]] to soften up Japanese positions.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 18 December, the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force\u2013seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 [[destroyer]]s\u2013during their attempt to refuel at sea.

On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers, {{USS|Hull|DD-350|2}}, {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|2}}, and {{USS|Spence|DD-512|2}}, capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.<ref name=\"PT\"/> Approximately 790 men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured.

Bypassing the southern beaches, American amphibious forces went ashore at [[Lingayen Gulf]], the scene of initial Japanese assaults to take Luzon nearly three years before.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'', armed with heavy anti-aircraft batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during air strikes against [[Taiwan|Formosa]], Luzon, and the [[Nansei Shoto]] to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3\u201322 January 1945, included a thrust into the South China Sea, in the hope that major units of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] could be drawn into battle.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin''{{'}}s carrier group launched air strikes between [[Saigon]] and [[Camranh Bay]], [[French Indochina]], on 12 January, resulting in severe losses for the enemy. TF 38's warplanes sank 41 ships and heavily damaged docks, storage areas, and aircraft facilities. Formosa, already struck on 3\u20134 January, was raided again on 9 January 15 January, and 21 January. Throughout January ''Wisconsin'' shielded the carriers as they conducted air raids at Hong Kong, [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Hainan Island]], the Canton [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], the Hong Kong Naval Station, and [[Okinawa]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Service with 5th Fleet, Admiral Spruance===\n''Wisconsin'' was assigned to the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] when Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet. She moved northward with the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area. On 16 February, the task force approached the Japanese coast under cover of adverse weather conditions and achieved complete tactical surprise. As a result, ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground. Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, also suffered drastically, as did hangars and aircraft installations.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' and the task force moved to [[Iwo Jima]] on 17 February to provide direct support for the landings slated to take place on 19 February. They revisited Tokyo on 25 February and hit the island of [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachino]] off the coast of [[Honsh\u016b]] the next day, resulting in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin''{{'}}s task force stood out of [[Ulithi]] on 14 March bound for Japan. The mission of that group was to eliminate airborne resistance from the Japanese homeland to American forces off Okinawa. Enemy fleet units at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and [[Kobe]], on southern Honsh\u016b, reeled under the impact of the explosive blows delivered by TF 58's airmen. On 18\u201319 March, from a point {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], TF 58 hit enemy airfields on that island; unfortunately, allied anti-aircraft fire on 19 March failed to stop an attack on the carrier {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}}. That afternoon, ''Wisconsin'' and the task force retired from Ky\u016bsh\u016b, screening the blazing and battered flattop, and shooting down 48 attackers.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 24 March, ''Wisconsin'' trained her {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns on targets ashore on [[Okinawa]]. Together with the other battleships of the task force, she pounded Japanese positions and installations in preparation for the landings. Japanese resistance, while fierce, was doomed to failure by dwindling numbers of aircraft and trained pilots.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[Image:WWII Wisconsin.JPG|thumb|left|''Wisconsin'' escorting USS ''Essex''-class aircraft carriers in the Pacific Ocean during [[World War II]]. The tail crane was used to recover reconnaissance planes launched by ''Wisconsin''.]]\n\nWhile TF 58's planes were dealing with {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and her escorts, enemy aircraft attacked the American surface units. Combat air patrols (CAP) shot down 15 enemy planes, and ships' gunfire shot down another three, but not before one ''[[kamikaze]]'' attack penetrated the CAP and screen to crash on the flight deck of the fleet carrier {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}. On 11 April, the Japanese renewed their ''kamikaze'' attacks; and only drastic maneuvers and heavy barrages of gunfire saved the task force. Combat air patrols shot down 17 planes, and ships' gunfire shot down 12. The next day, 151 enemy aircraft attacked TF 58, but ''Wisconsin'', together with other units of the screens for the vital carriers, kept the ''kamikaze'' pilots at bay and destroyed them before they could reach their targets. Over the days that ensued, Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks managed to crash into three carriers\u2014{{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|2}} and {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}\u2014on successive days.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nBy 4 June, a typhoon was swirling through the Fleet. ''Wisconsin'' rode out the storm unscathed, but three cruisers, two carriers, and a destroyer suffered serious damage. Offensive operations were resumed on 8 June with a final aerial assault on Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Japanese aerial response was virtually nonexistent; 29 planes were located and destroyed. On that day, one of ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s [[floatplane]]s landed and rescued a downed pilot from the carrier {{USS|Shangri-La|CV-38|2}}.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Bombardment of Japan===\n{{see also|Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II}}\n\n''Wisconsin'' ultimately put into [[Leyte Gulf]] and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft on the ground and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. ''Wisconsin'' and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, due in large part to a weak Japanese response to their presence.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 16 July, ''Wisconsin'' fired her {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns at the [[steel mill]]s and [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] at [[Muroran]], Hokkaido. Two days later, she wrecked industrial facilities in the [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi Miro]] area, on the coast of Honsh\u016b-, northeast of Tokyo itself. During that bombardment, British battleships of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] contributed their heavy shellfire. By that point in the war, Allied warships such as ''Wisconsin'' were able to shell the Japanese homeland almost at will.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nTF 38's planes subsequently blasted the Japanese naval base at [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], and put the former fleet flagship [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']] out of action, one of the two remaining Japanese battleships. Throughout July and into August, Admiral Halsey's airmen visited destruction upon the Japanese, the last instance being against Tokyo on 13 August. Two days later, the Japanese surrendered, ending World War II.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'', as part of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on 5 September, three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}. During ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s brief career in World War II, she had steamed {{convert|105831|mi|km|abbr=on}} since commissioning; had shot down three enemy planes; had claimed assists on four occasions; and had fueled her screening destroyers on some 250 occasions.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n===Post World War II (1945\u20131950)===\nShifting subsequently to [[Okinawa]], the battleship embarked homeward-bound GIs on 22 September 1945, as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet]] staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on 23 September, ''Wisconsin'' reached [[Pearl Harbor]] on 4 October, remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the west coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached San Francisco on 15 October.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nHeading for the east coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, ''Wisconsin'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] from 11\u201313 January and reached [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] on 18 January. Following a cruise south to [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], Cuba, the battleship entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer months, ''Wisconsin'' sailed for South American waters.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOver the weeks that ensued, the battleship visited [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile, from 1\u20136 November; [[Callao]], Peru, from 9\u201313 November; [[Balboa, Canal Zone]], from 16\u201320 November; and [[La Guaira, Venezuela]], from 22\u201326 November, before returning to Norfolk on 2 December 1946.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' spent nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], and saw visits conducted at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July 1947, ''Wisconsin'' took [[United States Naval Academy]] midshipmen on cruises to northern European waters.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nIn January 1948, ''Wisconsin'' reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk for inactivation. Placed out of commission, in reserve on 1 July, ''Wisconsin'' was assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n==The Korean War (1950\u20131952)==\n[[Image:Wisconsin (BB-64), USS Saint Paul (CA-73) and USS Buck (DD-761) underway off Korea on 22 February 1952 (80-G-440021).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Buck|DD-761|2}}, ''Wisconsin'', and {{USS|Saint Paul|CA-73|2}} steam in close formation during operations off the Korean coast, 1952]]\n\nHer sojourn in \"mothballs\", however, was comparatively brief, due to the [[North Korea]]n [[Korean War|invasion of]] [[South Korea]] in late June 1950. ''Wisconsin'' was recommissioned on 3 March 1951 with Captain Thomas Burrowes in command.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/> After shakedown training, the revitalized battleship conducted two midshipmen training cruises, taking the officers-to-be to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Lisbon, Portugal]]; [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Nova Scotia; New York City; and [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], Cuba, before she returned to Norfolk. While leaving New York, ''Wisconsin'' was accidentally grounded on mud flats in New York Harbor, but was freed on 23 August 1951 with no damage to the ship.<ref name=\"Accident\">{{cite web | title = USS Wisconsin (BB 64) | url = http://www.navysite.de/bb/bb64.htm |publisher=Unofficial US Navy Site |accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n''Wisconsin'' departed Norfolk on 25 October, bound for the Pacific. She transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 29 October and reached [[Yokosuka, Japan]], on 21 November. There, she relieved {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}} as [[flagship]] for Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, Commander, [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]].<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 26 November, with Vice Admiral Martin and Rear Admiral F.P. Denebrink, Commander, Service Force, Pacific, embarked, ''Wisconsin'' departed Yokosuka for Korean waters to support the fast carrier operations of TF 77. She left the company of the carrier force on 2 December and, screened by the destroyer {{USS|Wiltsie|DD-716|2}}, provided gunfire support for the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK) Corps in the [[Kasong]]-[[Kosong]] area. After disembarking Admiral Denebrink on 3 December at [[Gangneung|Kangnung]], the battleship resumed station on the Korean \"bombline\", providing gunfire support for the American 1st Marine Division. ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s shelling accounted for a tank, two gun emplacements, and a building.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/> She continued her gunfire support task for the 1st Marine Division and 1st ROK Corps through 6 December, accounting for enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and troop concentrations.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/> On one occasion during that time, the battleship received a request for call-fire support and provided three star-shells for the 1st ROK Corps, illuminating an enemy attack that was consequently repulsed with considerable enemy casualties.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nAfter being relieved on the gunline by the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Saint Paul|CA-73|2}} on 6 December, ''Wisconsin'' briefly retired from gunfire support duties. She resumed them, however, in the Kasong-Kosong area on 11 December screened by the destroyer {{USS|Twining|DD-540|2}}. The following day, 12 December, saw the [[helicopter]] embarkation on ''Wisconsin'' of Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, Commander, Battleship Division 2 (BatDiv 2), as part of his inspection trip in the Far East.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' continued her naval gunfire support duties on the \"bombline,\" shelling enemy bunkers, command posts, artillery positions, and trench systems through 14 December. She departed the \"bombline\" on that day to render special gunfire support duties in the [[Kojo, North Korea|Kojo]] area shelling coastal targets in support of United Nations (UN) troops ashore. That same day, ''Wisconsin'' returned to the Kasong-Kosong area. On 15 December, she disembarked Admiral Thurber by helicopter. The next day, ''Wisconsin'' departed Korean waters, heading for [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]] to rearm.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nReturning to the combat zone on 17 December, ''Wisconsin'' embarked United States Senator [[Homer S. Ferguson|Homer Ferguson]] of [[Michigan]] on 18 December. That day, the battleship supported the 11th ROK invasion with night illumination fire that enabled the ROK troops to repulse a North Korean assault with heavy enemy casualties.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/><ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/> Departing the \"bombline\" on 19 December, the battleship transferred Ferguson by helicopter to the carrier {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|2}}.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 20 December, ''Wisconsin'' participated in a coordinated air-surface bombardment of [[Wonsan]] to neutralize pre-selected targets in its area. The ship shifted its bombardment station to the western end of Wonsan harbor, hitting boats and small craft in the inner swept channel with her 5-inch (127mm) guns during the afternoon and helping forestall attempts to assault the friendly-held islands nearby. ''Wisconsin'' then made an anti-boat sweep to the north, firing her 5-inch batteries on suspected boat concentrations. She then provided gunfire support to UN troops operating at the \"bombline\" until 22 December, when she rejoined the carrier task force.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n[[Image:Wisconsin in Korea.JPG|thumb|left|''Wisconsin'' shells North Korean targets during the Korean War]]\n\nOn 28 December, Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]], on a Korean tour over the Christmas holidays, helicoptered aboard the ship to celebrate Mass for the Catholic members of the crew. He left as he came, off [[Pohang]]. On New Year's Eve day ''Wisconsin'' put into Yokosuka.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' departed that port on 8 January 1952 and returned to Korean waters. She reached [[Pusan]] the following day and entertained the [[President of South Korea]], [[Syngman Rhee]], and his wife, on 10 January. The couple received full military honors as they came on board, which Rhee reciprocated by awarding Vice Admiral Martin the ROK Order of the Military Merit.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/><ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' returned to the \"bombline\" on 11 January, and over the ensuing days delivered heavy gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division and the 1st ROK Corps. As before, her primary targets were command posts, shelters, bunkers, troop concentrations and mortar positions. As before, she stood ready to deliver call-fire support as needed, shelling enemy troops in the open on 14 January at the request of the ROK 1st Corps.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nRearming once more at Sasebo, she shortly joined TF 77 off the coast of Korea and resumed support at the \"bombline\" on 23 January. Three days later, she shifted again to the Kojo region, to participate in a coordinated air and gun strike. That same day, the battleship returned to the \"bombline\" and shelled the command post and communications center for the 15th North Korean Division during call-fire missions for the 1st Marine Division.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/><ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/>\n\nReturning to Wonsan at the end of January, ''Wisconsin'' bombarded enemy guns at [[Hodo Pando]] before she was rearmed at Sasebo. The battleship rejoined TF 77 on 2 February, and the next day blasted railway buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard while conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nOn 26 February, ''Wisconsin'' arrived at Pusan where Vice Admiral Shon, the ROK Chief of Naval Operations; United States Ambassador J.J. Muccio; and Rear Admiral Scott-Montcrief, [[Royal Navy]], Commander, Task Group 95.12 (TG 95.12), visited the battleship. Departing that South Korean port the following day, ''Wisconsin'' reached Yokosuka on 2 March, and a week later she shifted to Sasebo to prepare to return to Korean waters.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\n''Wisconsin'' arrived off [[Kimchaek|Songjin]], Korea on 15 March and concentrated her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, when one of four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40&nbsp;mm mount; although little material damage resulted, three men were injured.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/><ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/> ''Wisconsin'' subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406&nbsp;mm) salvo before continuing her mission.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/><ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/> After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nRelieved as flagship of the 7th Fleet on 1 April by sister ship {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}, ''Wisconsin'' departed Yokosuka, bound for the United States. En route home, she touched briefly at [[Guam]], where she took part in the successful test of the Navy's largest floating dry-dock on 4\u20135 April, the first ever to accommodate an {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|2}}.

She departed Hampton Roads on 25 August and participated in the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] exercise [[Operation Mainbrace]], which was held out of Greenock, Scotland. After her return to Norfolk, ''Wisconsin'' underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. ''Wisconsin'' remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises.

After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the ship returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly thereafter, ''Wisconsin'' participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for Commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, ''Wisconsin'' took part in Operation Springboard, during which time she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

Using an [[RQ-2 Pioneer|Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] ([[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]) as a spotter in combat for the first time, ''Wisconsin'' pounded an Iraqi communications compound on 7 February. Her main guns lobbed 24 shells on Iraqi artillery sites, missile facilities, and electronic warfare sites along the coast. That evening she targeted naval sites with her {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns, firing 50 rounds which severely damaged or sunk 15 Iraqi boats, and destroyed several piers at the Khawr al-Mufattah [[marina]].<ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/> In response to calls for fire support from US and coalition forces, ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s turrets boomed again on 9 February, blasting bunkers and artillery sites, and shelling Iraqi troop positions near [[Khafji]] after the Iraqis were ousted from the city by Saudi and [[Qatar]]i armor.<ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/> On 21 February, one of ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s UAVs observed several trucks resupplying an Iraqi command post; in response, ''Wisconsin'' trained her {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns on the complex, leveling or heavily damaging 10 of the buildings.<ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/> ''Wisconsin'' and ''Missouri'' alternated positions on the gun line, using their {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns to destroy enemy targets and soften defenses along the Kuwait coastline for a possible [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]].<ref name=\"USS Wisconsin\"/><ref name=\"Desert Storm\"/>\n\n[[Image:Pioneer RPV on USS Wisconsin (BB-64).jpg|thumb|left|A technician moves a [[RQ-2 Pioneer|Pioneer RPV]] across the fantail of ''Wisconsin''.]]\n\nOn the night of 23 February, ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' turned their big guns on Kuwait's [[Faylaka Island]] to support the US-led coalition ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a [[feint|diversionary assault]] aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion.<ref name=\"Desert Storm\"/> As part of this attack, ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after ''Missouri'' completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, ''Wisconsin'', while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns. As ''Wisconsin''{{'}}s drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would know that they were once again being targeted by a battleship.<ref name=\"Drone\"/> Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer's distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of ''Missouri''{{'}}s artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] by waving makeshift [[white flag]]s, an action dutifully noted aboard ''Wisconsin''.

After the death of [[Herbert Chapman]] in January 1934, Joe Shaw had been designated as [[caretaker]], but in the summer [[George Allison]] became full-time manager. \nIn his debut season, he guided Arsenal to their third consecutive league title, with Arsenal finishing four points ahead of [[Sunderland]] and winning it at [[Middlesbrough]]. The [[Charity Shield]] was won at Highbury with a 4-0 victory over [[Manchester City]], but the [[FA Cup]] run was ended by [[Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-finals. During the season Arsenal had their highest ever [[Highbury]] attendance, with 73,295 witnessing a goalless draw against title rivals Sunderland. [[Ted Drake]] was top scorer with a club-record 42 goals from 41 league matches, thus topping the league scoring charts. In all competitions he made five more starts and scored two more goals. \nThis season, Arsenal won 8-0 twice, against [[Leicester City]] and [[Middlesbrough]], 7-0 against [[Wolves|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], 8-1 against [[Liverpool]] and 6-0 at rivals [[Tottenham]]. <ref> https://www.arsenal.com/history/herbert-chapman/arsenal-clinch-a-hat-trick-of-titles</ref>\n\n==Results==\n''Arsenal's

At New River Head, in those days set in the fields of rural Clerkenwell and, importantly, at a higher altitude than the city, a circular reservoir, known as the Round Pond, collected the water. From here it was fed into a network of wooden mains which conveyed water to the cisterns of London. Besides the Round Pond was a single building, known as the Water House. From these beginnings a larger complex gradually developed, with further ponds and buildings covering an area of some {{convert|7|acre}} and bounded by what were to become the streets of Rosebery Avenue, Hardwick Street, Amwell Street and Myddelton Passage.<ref name=bho>{{cite web |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol47/pp165-184 |title=New River Head |work=British History Online |publisher=Institute of Historical Research/University of London |year=2008 |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1708, a new Upper Pond was constructed on higher ground where [[Claremont Square]] lies today, in order to give a better head of pressure to server more distant areas around the [[West End of London]]. Initially water was pumped to this from the Round Pond by [[windmill]] and [[horse gin]], but in 1768 a [[steam engine]] designed by [[John Smeaton]] was brought into use. In 1785, a [[Boulton & Watt]] engine was added, and over the years replacement engines were installed. These were all housed in the Engine House, on the north-west of the site. In 1820, the New River Company moved its offices, which until then had been located in the [[City of London]], into an enlarged Water House at New River Head, beginning an association of the site with the administration of London's water supply that was to last some 170 years.<ref name=bho/>\n\n[[File:Former Water Board HQ, New River Head - geograph.org.uk - 397025.jpg|thumb|right|Frontage of the water board offices]]\nBetween 1915 and 1920, the Metropolitan Water Board, as successor to the New River Company, constructed a substantial new head office building on the Rosebery Avenue side of the site and across the, by now redundant, Round Pond. This building incorporated a reconstruction of the historical late seventeenth-century ''Oak Room'' from the Water House, which was also demolished as part of the same development. Between 1936 and 1938, the water board added a new water testing laboratory to the site. In 1946, the London end of the New River was truncated to [[Stoke Newington]] with the water being fed into the East Reservoir there, thus removing the operational usage of the site. However the head office and laboratory buildings continued in use by the Metropolitan Water Board and its successor, the Thames Water Authority.<ref name=bho/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://shelford.org/walks/newriver.pdf |title=The New River Path \u2013 a walk linking Hertford with Islington |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964\u20136, the Charles Allen House, a seven-storey block of staff flats, was added to the north-west corner of the site. Following the [[privatisation]] of the Thames Water Authority in 1989, the head office of Thames Water plc was relocated to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], along with the laboratory facilities. However in the same timescales an operational function returned to the site, with the creation of a shaft and pumping station for the [[Thames Water Ring Main|London Water Ring Main]] on the Amwell Street side of the site.<ref name=bho/>\n\nFollowing the relocation of Thames Water, the head office building and laboratory buidings were converted to apartments, as was the Remus building, a former water meter testing building dating from 1922-4. The ''Oak Room'' still remains within the former office building. Two new apartments blocks, the Nautilus building and the Hydra building were added. The old Engine House still exists, and now houses equipment for the Ring Main pumping station.<ref name=bho/><ref name=luo>{{cite web |url=https://lookup.london/new-river-head/ |title=New River Head: History Behind These Islington Flats |work= Look Up London |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Clerkenwell]]\n[[Category:London water infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Thames Water]]\n[[Category:Water supply and sanitation in London]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat-inline}}\n* [https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol47/pp165-184 Article on the history of New River Head from British History Online]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox historic site\n| name = New River Head\n| native_name = \n| native_language = \n| image = Metropolitan Water Board - Borough of Islington - London - August 11th 2014 - 3.jpg\n| caption = Former Water Board offices and gardens at New River Head\n| type = \n| locmapin = \n| coordinates = {{Coord|51|31|42.298|N|0|6|27.572|W|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| location= [[Clerkenwell]],<br/>[[London Borough of Islington]],<br/>London, United Kingdom\n}}\n'''New River Head''' is a historic site located adjacent to [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] on [[Rosebery Avenue]] in the [[Clerkenwell]] area of London, England.

At New River Head, in those days set in the fields of rural Clerkenwell and, importantly, at a higher altitude than the city, a circular reservoir, known as the Round Pond, collected the water. From here it was fed into a network of wooden mains which conveyed water to the cisterns of London. Besides the Round Pond was a single building, known as the Water House. From these beginnings a larger complex gradually developed, with further ponds and buildings covering an area of some {{convert|7|acre}} and bounded by what were to become the streets of Rosebery Avenue, Hardwick Street, Amwell Street and Myddelton Passage.<ref name=bho>{{cite web |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol47/pp165-184 |title=New River Head |work=British History Online |publisher=Institute of Historical Research/University of London |year=2008 |accessdate=27 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1708, a new Upper Pond was constructed on higher ground where [[Claremont Square]] lies today, in order to give a better head of pressure to server more distant areas around the [[West End of London]]. Initially water was pumped to this from the Round Pond by [[windmill]] and [[horse gin]], but in 1768 a [[steam engine]] designed by [[John Smeaton]] was brought into use. In 1785, a [[Boulton & Watt]] engine was added, and over the years replacement engines were installed. These were all housed in the Engine House, on the north-west of the site. In 1820, the New River Company moved its offices, which until then had been located in the [[City of London]], into an enlarged Water House at New River Head, beginning an association of the site with the administration of London's water supply that was to last some 170 years.<ref name=bho/>\n\n[[File:Former Water Board HQ, New River Head - geograph.org.uk - 397025.jpg|thumb|right|Frontage of the water board offices]]\nBetween 1915 and 1920, the Metropolitan Water Board, as successor to the New River Company, constructed a substantial new head office building on the Rosebery Avenue side of the site and across the, by now redundant, Round Pond. This building incorporated a reconstruction of the historical late seventeenth-century ''Oak Room'' from the Water House, which was also demolished as part of the same development. Between 1936 and 1938, the water board added a new water testing laboratory to the site. In 1946, the London end of the New River was truncated to [[Stoke Newington]] with the water being fed into the East Reservoir there, thus removing the operational usage of the site. However the head office and laboratory buildings continued in use by the Metropolitan Water Board and its successor, the Thames Water Authority.<ref name=bho/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://shelford.org/walks/newriver.pdf |title=The New River Path \u2013 a walk linking Hertford with Islington |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964\u20136, the Charles Allen House, a seven-storey block of staff flats, was added to the north-west corner of the site. Following the [[privatisation]] of the Thames Water Authority in 1989, the head office of Thames Water plc was relocated to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], along with the laboratory facilities. However in the same timescales an operational function returned to the site, with the creation of a shaft and pumping station for the [[Thames Water Ring Main|London Water Ring Main]] on the Amwell Street side of the site.<ref name=bho/>\n\nFollowing the relocation of Thames Water, the head office building and laboratory buidings were converted to apartments, as was the Remus building, a former water meter testing building dating from 1922-4. The ''Oak Room'' still remains within the former office building. Two new apartments blocks, the Nautilus building and the Hydra building were added. The old Engine House still exists, and now houses equipment for the Ring Main pumping station.<ref name=bho/><ref name=luo>{{cite web |url=https://lookup.london/new-river-head/ |title=New River Head: History Behind These Islington Flats |work= Look Up London |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Clerkenwell]]\n[[Category:London water infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Thames Water]]\n[[Category:Water supply and sanitation in London]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat-inline}}\n* [https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol47/pp165-184 Article on the history of New River Head from British History Online]\n", "name_user": "Chris j wood", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_River_Head"}

It was introduced late in the 1953 model year, and produced through 1962. It is commonly referred to as the \"solid-axle\" generation, as the independent rear suspension did not appear until the 1963 Sting Ray. The Corvette was rushed into production for its debut model year to capitalize on the enthusiastic public reaction to the [[concept car|concept vehicle]], but expectations for the new model were largely unfulfilled.<ref name=Prince/> Reviews were mixed and sales fell far short of expectations through the car's early years. The program was nearly canceled, but Chevrolet would ultimately stay the course.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n[[Harley Earl]], as head of GM's Styling Section, was an avid fan of sporting cars.

When production began six months later, at an MSRP of $3,513, it had evolved into a considerably costlier car than the bare-bones $2000 roadster Harley Earl originally had in mind.<ref>[https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1953-corvette.htm 1953 Corvette \u2013 HowStuffWorks]</ref> The EX-122 car is now located at the ''Kerbeck Corvette'' museum in [[Atlantic City]] and is believed to be the oldest Corvette in existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerbeck.com/kerbeck/kerbeck.nsf/Worlds_Oldest_Corvette|title=EX122 Motorama Experimental Protocol|publisher=Kerbeck Corvette|accessdate=26 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220135400/http://www.kerbeck.com/kerbeck/kerbeck.nsf/Worlds_Oldest_Corvette |archivedate=20 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====Design and engineering====\nTo keep costs down, GM executive Robert F. McLean mandated off-the-shelf mechanical components, and used the chassis and suspension design from the 1949\u20131954 Chevrolet passenger vehicles. The drivetrain and passenger compartment were moved rearward to achieve a 53/47 front-to-rear weight distribution. It had a {{convert|102|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase.

Because there was currently no manual transmission available to Chevrolet rated to handle 150 HP, a two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic was used. {{cvt|0|-|60|mph}} time was 11.5 seconds.\n\nThree body variants were created. The [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] was built as the Corvette, the Corvair [[fastback]] variant never went in production, and two-door Nomad [[station wagon]] was eventually built as the [[Chevrolet Nomad]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfX4o9YQT8g ''Concept Cars of the 1950s''], History TV</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n| title  = Corvette Corvair Show Car\n| lines  = 2\n| width  = 170\n| height = 170\n| align     = center \n|File:Corvette Corvair 1.jpg|alt1=|Corvette Corvair show car, front view\n|File:Corvette Corvair 2.jpg|alt2=|Corvette Corvair show car, rear view\n}}\n\nDuring the last half of 1953, 300 Corvettes were to a large degree, hand-built on a makeshift assembly line that was installed in an old truck plant in [[Flint, Michigan]]<ref name=Prince/><!--This facility is now an academic building at [[Kettering University]].--> while a factory was being prepped for a full-scale 1954 production run. The outer body was made out of then-revolutionary [[fiberglass|glass fiber reinforced plastic]] material. Although steel shortages or quotas are sometimes mentioned as a factor in the decision to use fiberglass, no evidence exists to support this. In calendar years 1952 and 1953 Chevrolet produced nearly 2 million steel bodied full-size passenger cars and the intended production volume of 10,000 Corvette for 1954 was only a small fraction of that.<ref name=Premo1>{{cite journal|last=Premo |first=Ellis |title=The Corvette Plastic Body|journal=Society of Automotive Engineers |date=1954 |volume=540257 |url= http://papers.sae.org/540257/ |accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=SAE International}}</ref>\n\nThe body engineer for the Corvette was Ellis James Premo. He presented a paper to the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] in 1954 regarding the development of the body.<ref name=Premo1 /> Several excerpts highlight some of the key points in the body material choice:\n{{Quote|text=\n''The body on the show model was made of reinforced plastic purely as an expedient to get the job done quickly.''\n\n''Although we were going ahead with the building of an experimental plastic body in order to get a car rolling for chassis development work \u2013 at the time of the Waldorf Show, we were actually concentrating body-design-wise on a steel body utilizing [[Zamak|Kirksite]] tooling for the projected production of 10,000 units during the 1954 model year. It was some time later that we decided to produce this quantity in reinforced plastic.''\n\n''About this time, some doubt was expressed that we should build the 1954 model of steel. People seemed to be captivated by the idea of the fiberglass plastic body. Furthermore, information being given to us by the reinforced plastic industry seemed to indicate the practicality of fabricating plastic body parts for automobiles on a large scale.''\n}}\n\nA 55 degree raked windshield was made of safety glass, while the license plate holder was set back in the trunk, covered with a plastic window.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Underneath the new body material were standard components from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the \"Blue Flame\" [[Straight-6|inline six-cylinder]] engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and [[drum brake]]s. The engine's output, {{cvt|136|hp}}, was increased however from a [[Carter Carburetor|Carter]] triple-carburetor system exclusive to the Corvette, but performance of the car was decidedly \"lackluster\".<ref name=\"Prince\">{{cite book |title= Corvette Buyers Guide, 1953-1967 |last=Prince |first=Richard |year= 2002 |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |isbn=978-0-7603-1009-0|page= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6fqyf5ceXucC&printsec=frontcover#PPA25,M1 |accessdate=2010-10-22 }}</ref> Compared to the British and Italian sports cars of the day, the Corvette lacked a [[manual transmission]] and required more effort to bring to a stop, but like their British competition, such as [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]], was not fitted with roll-up windows;<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet_Corvette/1953_Chevrolet_Corvette/1953_Corvette_Foldout/1953%20Chevrolet%20Corvette-out.html |title=1953 Corvette Foldout |page=outside |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref> this would have to wait until sometime in the 1956 model year.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> A [[Paxton Automotive|Paxton]] centrifugal [[supercharger]] became available in 1954 as a dealer-installed option, greatly improving the Corvette's straight-line performance,<ref>{{cite book |title=Classic Corvette 30 Years |last= Mueller |first= Mike |year= 2003 |publisher= Crestline Imprints |isbn= 978-0-7603-1806-5 |page=40 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jBtsVHSnt5gC&printsec=frontcover#PPA40,M1 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref> but sales continued to decline.\n\nThe Chevrolet division was GM's entry-level marque.<ref>{{cite book |title= Focus: The Future of Your Company Depends on It |last= Ries |first= Al |year= 2005 |publisher= HarperCollins |isbn= 978-0-06-079990-8 |page= 204}}</ref> Managers at GM were seriously considering shelving the project,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pricing on Purpose: creating and capturing value |last= Baker |first= Ronald J.|year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-72980-8 |page=89 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6YYr3e_bAcC&pg=PA89&dq=Corvette+lackluster&lr=&ei=4TTVScPMJYj-NcqX6PAC#PPA89,M1 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref> leaving the Corvette to be little more than a footnote in automotive history, and would have done so if not for three important events.

The third factor in the Corvette's survival was [[Ford]]'s introduction of the 1955 two-seat [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]],<ref>{{cite book |title= Corvette from the Inside |last= McLellan |first= Dave |year= 2002 |publisher= Bentley Publishers |isbn= 978-0-8376-0859-4 |page= 20 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WCN7CfWjhhoC&pg=PA94&dq |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref> which was billed as a \"personal luxury car\", not a sports car. Even so, the Ford-Chevrolet rivalry in those days demanded GM not appear to back down from the challenge. The original concept for the Corvette emblem incorporated an American flag into the design, but was changed well before production since associating the flag with a product was [[United States Flag Code|frowned upon]].\n\n==1953\u20131955==\n[[File:Corvette logo.jpg|thumb|Performance-themed logo]]\n[[File:53 Corvette.jpg|thumb|1953, the first year of production]]\n\n===1953===\nThe 1953 model year was not only the Corvette's first production year, but at 300 produced it was also the lowest-volume Corvette. The cars were essentially hand-built and techniques evolved during the production cycle, so that each 1953 Corvette is slightly different. All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and black canvas soft tops. Order guides showed heaters and AM radios as optional, but all 1953 models were equipped with both. Over two hundred 1953 Corvettes are known to exist today.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Antonick |first=Mike |date=2001 |title=Corvette Price Handbook 2002: 1953-1995 Models With Web Updates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V61-E0ZmZyEC&q=The+Genuine+Corvette+Price+Handbook&dq=The+Genuine+Corvette+Price+Handbook&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSz6X19o3PAhVFPT4KHZKwAKcQ6AEIFDAA |location= |publisher=Motorbooks International |page= |isbn=9780933534506 |accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> They had independent front suspension,<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures.com\"/> but featured a rigid axle supported by longitudinal leaf springs at the rear.

Other problems, such as water leaks and doors that could open while the car was driven, were reported with the most severe errors corrected in subsequent units produced, but some shortcomings continued beyond the Corvette's inaugural year.<ref name=Prince/> By December 1953, Chevrolet had a newly equipped factory in St. Louis ready to build 10,000 Corvettes annually. However, negative customer reaction in 1953 and early 1954 models caused sales to plummet.\n\n===1954===\nIn 1954, only 3,640 of this model were built and nearly a third were unsold at year's end. New colors were available, but the six-cylinder engine and Powerglide automatic, the only engine and transmission available, were not what sports car enthusiasts expected. It is known that 1954 models were painted Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, and Black, in addition to Polo White. All had red interiors, except for those finished in Pennant Blue which had a beige interior and beige canvas soft top. Order guides listed several options, but all options were \"mandatory\" and all 1954 Corvettes were equipped the same.<ref name=gunnel>{{cite book |editor-last=Gunnel |editor-first=John |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1987 | isbn=0-87341-096-3}}</ref>\n[[File:Corvette c1 1954.JPG|thumb|Two-toned color schemes were popular in and out (1954)]]\n\nIn the October 1954 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' there was an extensive survey of Corvette owners in America. The surprising finding was their opinions in comparison to foreign sports cars. It was found that 36% of those taking the survey had owned a foreign sports car, and of that, half of them rated the Corvette as better than their previous foreign sports car. Nineteen percent rated the Corvette as equal to their foreign sports car and 22% rated the Corvette as inferior. While many were well pleased with the Corvette, they did not consider it as a true sports car. The principal complaint of the surveyed owners was the tendency of the body to leak extensively during rain storms.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oMYwT4n1Lsnyggfv2OCyBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Corvette Is A Fine Fun Car But It Has Its Limitations.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1954, pp. 118-122/356.</ref>\n\n===1955===\nChevrolet debuted its [[Chevrolet small-block engine#265|{{cvt|265|CID|L}} small-block, {{cvt|195|hp}}]] [[V8]] in 1955 and the engine found its way into the Corvette. At first 1955 V8 Corvettes continued with the mandatory-option Powerglide automatic transmission (as did the few 6-cylinder models built), but a new three-speed manual transmission came along later in the year for V8 models only. Exterior color choices were expanded to at least five, combined with at least four interior colors. Even soft-tops came in three colors and different materials. Despite all this, only 700 1955 Corvettes were built, making it second only to 1953 in scarcity. Very few six-cylinder 1955 models were built, and all documented examples are equipped with automatic transmissions. The \"V\" in the Corvette emblem was enlarged and gold colored, signifying the V8 engine under the hood and 12 volt electrical systems, while 6-cylinder models retained the 6-volt systems used in 1953-54.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Rare option estimate: Manual transmission (75).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough not a part of the original Corvette project, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] was responsible for the addition of the V8 engine and three-speed manual transmission. Duntov improved the car's marketing and image and helped the car compete with the new V8\u2014engined [[Ford Thunderbird]], and turned the Corvette from its lackluster performance into a credible performer. In 1956 he became the director of high-performance vehicle design and development for Chevrolet helping him earn the nickname \"Father of the Corvette.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= Corvette, 1968-1982 |last= Mueller |first= Mike |year= 2000 |publisher= MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7603-0418-1 |page= 94 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WCN7CfWjhhoC&pg=PA94&dq }}</ref><ref name=\"Prince\" />\n\nAlthough the C1 Corvette chassis and suspension design were derived from Chevrolet's full-size cars, the same basic design was continued through the 1962 model even after the full-size cars were completely redesigned for the 1955 model year. {{Citation needed span|This was due to the combined factors of the relatively high re-engineering and re-tooling costs for this low-volume production vehicle, the continued potential for cancellation of the car, and the increased size and weight of the all-new suspension design for the full-size cars, which made it unsuitable for use in the lighter weight Corvette.|date=August 2014}}\n\n{{Gallery|title=1953-1955 Corvette\n| lines  = 2\n| width  = 170\n| height = 170\n| align     = center \n|File:53 Corvette.jpg|1953\n|File:Corvette 1953 trunk.JPG|1953\n|File:54 Chevrolet Corvette (9684047670).jpg|1954\n|File:1955 Chevrolet Corvette roadster - svl (12913501534).jpg|1955\n}}\n\n==1956\u20131957==\n[[File:Chevrolet Corvette Transistorized Hybrid Car Radio-1956.JPG|thumb|left|Options in 1956-57 included a car radio that featured both transistors &ndash;cutting-edge technology at that time &ndash; and a vacuum tube]]\n[[File:1957 Chevrolet Corvette EUD883.jpg|thumb|Fuel-injected 1957 convertible]]\n\n===1956===\nThe 1956 Corvette featured a new body, with real glass roll up windows and a more substantial convertible top.

Although steel shortages or quotas are sometimes mentioned as a factor in the decision to use fiberglass, no evidence exists to support this.

It was some time later that we decided to produce this quantity in reinforced plastic.''\n\n''About this time, some doubt was expressed that we should build the 1954 model of steel. People seemed to be captivated by the idea of the fiberglass plastic body. Furthermore, information being given to us by the reinforced plastic industry seemed to indicate the practicality of fabricating plastic body parts for automobiles on a large scale.''\n}}\n\nA 55 degree raked windshield was made of safety glass, while the license plate holder was set back in the trunk, covered with a plastic window.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Underneath the new body material were standard components from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the \"Blue Flame\" [[Straight-6|inline six-cylinder]] engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and [[drum brake]]s.

Other problems, such as water leaks and doors that could open while the car was driven, were reported with the most severe errors corrected in subsequent units produced, but some shortcomings continued beyond the Corvette's inaugural year.<ref name=Prince/> By December 1953, Chevrolet had a newly equipped factory in St. Louis ready to build 10,000 Corvettes annually.

New colors were available, but the six-cylinder engine and Powerglide automatic, the only engine and transmission available, were not what sports car enthusiasts expected. It is known that 1954 models were painted Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, and Black, in addition to Polo White. All had red interiors, except for those finished in Pennant Blue which had a beige interior and beige canvas soft top.

The surprising finding was their opinions in comparison to foreign sports cars. It was found that 36% of those taking the survey had owned a foreign sports car, and of that, half of them rated the Corvette as better than their previous foreign sports car. Nineteen percent rated the Corvette as equal to their foreign sports car and 22% rated the Corvette as inferior. While many were well pleased with the Corvette, they did not consider it as a true sports car.

At first 1955 V8 Corvettes continued with the mandatory-option Powerglide automatic transmission (as did the few 6-cylinder models built), but a new three-speed manual transmission came along later in the year for V8 models only. Exterior color choices were expanded to at least five, combined with at least four interior colors. Even soft-tops came in three colors and different materials. Despite all this, only 700 1955 Corvettes were built, making it second only to 1953 in scarcity. Very few six-cylinder 1955 models were built, and all documented examples are equipped with automatic transmissions. The \"V\" in the Corvette emblem was enlarged and gold colored, signifying the V8 engine under the hood and 12 volt electrical systems, while 6-cylinder models retained the 6-volt systems used in 1953-54.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Rare option estimate: Manual transmission (75).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough not a part of the original Corvette project, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] was responsible for the addition of the V8 engine and three-speed manual transmission.

The creation of the school was in response to widespread fears that the inadequacy of the French political and diplomatic corps would further diminish the country's international stature, as France grappled with a series of crises, including the defeat in the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], the demise of [[Napoleon III]], and the upheaval and massacre resulting from [[Paris Commune]].

Even though eight of thirteen ministers in De Gaulle's government, including Debr\u00e9 himself, were Sciences Po alumni, a significant reform of the university seemed inevitable, as it had been instrumental in training the class of leaders whom many accused of complacency in face of Nazi aggression. Communist politicians including [[Georges Cogniot]] proposed abolishing the ELSP entirely and founding a new state-run administration college on its premises.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=138 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref>\n\nDebr\u00e9 proposed the compromise that was eventually adopted. First, the government established the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]] (ENA), an elite postgraduate college for training government officials. From then on, the Grands Corps de l'Etat were obliged to recruit new entrants from ENA.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=141 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref> The change, however, had little impact on Sciences Po's central role in educating the French elite.

Both entities were tasked by the French government to ensure \"the progress and the spread, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology\".<ref name=\"purpose\" /> FNSP, a private foundation that receives generous subsidies from the government, manages the ''IEP de Paris'', owns its buildings and libraries, and determines its budget. The two entities work together in lockstep, however, as the director of the school is, by tradition, also the administrator of FNSP. This institutional arrangement gives Sciences Po a unique status, as the school draws much of its resources through substantial government subsidies to FNSP, but does not subject it to many government interventions and regulations, giving it a much higher level of autonomy compared to other French universities and schools.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The epithet ''Sciences Po'' is applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in ''ELSP''.<ref name=\"duality\">\"Le statut juridique de Sciences Po: la dualit\u00e9 FNSP et IEP de Paris\" ''[http://www.sciences-po.fr/presse/sciencespo_infos/cc/txt_1.htm Centre d'histoire de Sciences Po]''</ref>\n\nThe public-private nature of Sciences Po, Paris, also distinguishes it from a network of [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques|institutes of political studies]] throughout the country that were inspired by its curriculum, but that do not enjoy the same level of autonomy and prestige, namely in [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Lyon|Lyon]], [[Sciences Po Aix|Aix]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble Institute of Political Studies|Grenoble]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse|Toulouse]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Rennes|Rennes]] and [[Sciences Po Lille|Lille]]. They are not to be confused with the seven campuses of Sciences Po in France.\n\n=== 1945 to 1997 ===\nBetween 1952 and 1969, 77.5% of the ENA's graduate student intake were Sciences Po alumni.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nord|first1=Philip|title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199256464|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false}}</ref>\n\n''FNSP'' further strengthened its role as a scientific publication center with significant donations from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. ''FNSP'' periodicals such as ''la Revue fran\u00e7aise de science politique'', ''le Bulletin analytique de documentation'', ''la Chronologie politique africaine'', and the ''Cahiers de la Fondation'' as well as its seven research centres and main publishing house, ''Presses de Sciences Po'', consolidated the university's reputation as a research hub.<ref name=\"purpose\" />\n\n===The Richard Descoings era (1997\u20132012)===\n\nSciences Po underwent various reforms under the directorship of [[Richard Descoings]] (1997\u20132012). The school began requiring all its undergraduate students to spend a year abroad, and introduced a multilingual curriculum in French, English,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/10/29/7-countries-where-americans-can-study-at-universities-in-english-for-free-or-almost-free/|title=7 countries where Americans can study at universities, in English, for free (or almost free)|last=Noack|first=Rick|date=2014-10-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> and other languages. Sciences Po also began to expand outside Paris, establishing regional campuses throughout France.\n\nDuring this period, Sciences Po also implemented reforms in its admissions process.

The creation of the school was in response to widespread fears that the inadequacy of the French political and diplomatic corps would further diminish the country's international stature, as France grappled with a series of crises, including the defeat in the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], the demise of [[Napoleon III]], and the upheaval and massacre resulting from [[Paris Commune]]. The founders of the school sought to reform the training of French politicians by establishing a new \"breeding ground where nearly all the major, non-technical state commissioners were trained.\".<ref name=\"purpose\">\"Sciences Po 1945\u20131979\" ''[http://chevs.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/sciences_po_2_en.htm Centre d\u2019histoire de Sciences Po] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051012215250/http://chevs.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/sciences_po_2_en.htm |date=12 October 2005}}''</ref>\n\nELSP proved remarkably successful at preparing candidates for entry into senior civil service posts, and acquired a major role in [[Politics of France|France's political system]].

Even though eight of thirteen ministers in De Gaulle's government, including Debr\u00e9 himself, were Sciences Po alumni, a significant reform of the university seemed inevitable, as it had been instrumental in training the class of leaders whom many accused of complacency in face of Nazi aggression. Communist politicians including [[Georges Cogniot]] proposed abolishing the ELSP entirely and founding a new state-run administration college on its premises.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=138 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref>\n\nDebr\u00e9 proposed the compromise that was eventually adopted. First, the government established the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]] (ENA), an elite postgraduate college for training government officials. From then on, the Grands Corps de l'Etat were obliged to recruit new entrants from ENA.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false |title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199256464 |location=Oxford |page=141 |last1=Nord |first1=Philip}}</ref> The change, however, had little impact on Sciences Po's central role in educating the French elite.

Both entities were tasked by the French government to ensure \"the progress and the spread, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology\".<ref name=\"purpose\" /> FNSP, a private foundation that receives generous subsidies from the government, manages the ''IEP de Paris'', owns its buildings and libraries, and determines its budget. The two entities work together in lockstep, however, as the director of the school is, by tradition, also the administrator of FNSP. This institutional arrangement gives Sciences Po a unique status, as the school draws much of its resources through substantial government subsidies to FNSP, but does not subject it to many government interventions and regulations, giving it a much higher level of autonomy compared to other French universities and schools.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The epithet ''Sciences Po'' is applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in ''ELSP''.<ref name=\"duality\">\"Le statut juridique de Sciences Po: la dualit\u00e9 FNSP et IEP de Paris\" ''[http://www.sciences-po.fr/presse/sciencespo_infos/cc/txt_1.htm Centre d'histoire de Sciences Po]''</ref>\n\nThe public-private nature of Sciences Po, Paris, also distinguishes it from a network of [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques|institutes of political studies]] throughout the country that were inspired by its curriculum, but that do not enjoy the same level of autonomy and prestige, namely in [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Lyon|Lyon]], [[Sciences Po Aix|Aix]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble Institute of Political Studies|Grenoble]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse|Toulouse]], [[Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Rennes|Rennes]] and [[Sciences Po Lille|Lille]]. They are not to be confused with the seven campuses of Sciences Po in France.\n\n=== 1945 to 1997 ===\nBetween 1952 and 1969, 77.5% of the ENA's graduate student intake were Sciences Po alumni.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nord|first1=Philip|title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199256464|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation#v=onepage&q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&f=false}}</ref>\n\n''FNSP'' further strengthened its role as a scientific publication center with significant donations from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

Sciences Po also began to expand outside Paris, establishing regional campuses throughout France.\n\nDuring this period, Sciences Po also implemented reforms in its admissions process.

He actually works as a security service provider for an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri steals Ji-soo's business phone, finds the password and starts blackmailing him. Through the app, Gyu-ri accepts Min-hee's request to go to a client's room where she has a panic attack due to her [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and requires Mr. Lee's help. Ji-soo starts tracking his second phone, having a violent encounter with Ki-tae \u2013 Min-hee's bully boyfriend \u2013 in the process, but Gyu-ri outsmarts him. Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money. Afraid of leaving his home because the blackmailer threatened to expose him, Ji-soo is visited by Gyu-ri who finds a way to make him leave the apartment and searches for the money. She hides when Ji-soo's father sneaks into the apartment and accidentally discovers the money before stealing it. She chases him, in vain. In the street, Ji-soo sees his father fleeing with the money and discovers that Gyu-ri is the blackmailer. The following day, she tells her classmates that Ji-soo is her boyfriend in order to stop Ki-tae from bullying him. She takes Ji-soo to a baseball [[batting cage]] and shows off her muscly friends, offering him to recruit them to expand his business and make up for the loss of money.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri follows Ji-soo to Ulsan where they break into Ji-soo's father's house and search for the stolen money but find nothing. Gyu-ri argues that Ji-soo is a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] but he insists that he is only a security service provider and falls asleep after she refuses to explain why she needs money when her family is rich. In the morning, they catch Ji-soo's father and learn that he invested all the money in [[cryptocurrency]]. They witness as he looses more than 90% of the money and Ji-soo glares at a kitchen knife but restrains himself from stabbing his father. Back in Seoul, Ji-soo is struggling financially and cannot pay Mr. Lee who refuses to work until he receives his monthly payment. Mr. Lee tries to convince Min-hee to stop working but she refuses, and when Sung-mi \u2013 Min-hee's colleague who was assaulted by the same client \u2013 pressures other sex workers to look for another security service provider, Min-hee says she will only work with Mr. Lee who himself will only work with Uncle. Gyu-ri offers money to Ji-soo in exchange for a partnership in his business but he refuses. After failing his midterm exam, because he had to work part-time and was too mentally and physically exhausted to study, Ji-soo has a breakdown and hits his classmate Chae-bin in the face before

He actually works as a security service provider for an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri steals Ji-soo's business phone, finds the password and starts blackmailing him. Through the app, Gyu-ri accepts Min-hee's request to go to a client's room where she has a panic attack due to her [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and requires Mr. Lee's help. Ji-soo starts tracking his second phone, having a violent encounter with Ki-tae \u2013 Min-hee's bully boyfriend \u2013 in the process, but Gyu-ri outsmarts him. Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money. Afraid of leaving his home because the blackmailer threatened to expose him, Ji-soo is visited by Gyu-ri who finds a way to make him leave the apartment and searches for the money. She hides when Ji-soo's father sneaks into the apartment and accidentally discovers the money before stealing it. She chases him, in vain. In the street, Ji-soo sees his father fleeing with the money and discovers that Gyu-ri is the blackmailer. The following day, she tells her classmates that Ji-soo is her boyfriend in order to stop Ki-tae from bullying him. She takes Ji-soo to a baseball [[batting cage]] and shows off her muscly friends, offering him to recruit them to expand his business and make up for the loss of money.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri follows Ji-soo to Ulsan where they break into Ji-soo's father's house and search for the stolen money but find nothing. Gyu-ri argues that Ji-soo is a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] but he insists that he is only a security service provider and falls asleep after she refuses to explain why she needs money when her family is rich. In the morning, they catch Ji-soo's father and learn that he invested all the money in [[cryptocurrency]]. They witness as he looses more than 90% of the money and Ji-soo glares at a kitchen knife but restrains himself from stabbing his father. Back in Seoul, Ji-soo is struggling financially and cannot pay Mr. Lee who refuses to work until he receives his monthly payment. Mr. Lee tries to convince Min-hee to stop working but she refuses, and when Sung-mi \u2013 Min-hee's colleague who was assaulted by the same client \u2013 pressures other sex workers to look for another security service provider, Min-hee says she will only work with Mr. Lee who himself will only work with Uncle. Gyu-ri offers money to Ji-soo in exchange for a partnership in his business but he refuses. After failing his midterm exam, because he had to work part-time and was too mentally and physically exhausted to study, Ji-soo has a breakdown and hits his classmate Chae-bin in the face before accepting Ji-soo's offer.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Episode 7\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = Episode 9\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = Episode 10\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe series is written by [[Song Ji-na]]'s son Jin Han-sae, directed by {{illm|Kim Jin-min|ko|\uae40\uc9c4\ubbfc (\uc5f0\ucd9c\uac00)}} (''[[Time Between Dog and Wolf]]'', ''[[Road No. 1]]'', ''[[Lawless Lawyer]]''), and produced by Studio 329, the same company behind [[YouTube Premium]]'s first and only Korean original series ''[[Top Management (TV series)|Top Management]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming ended on August 6, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=So-hee|url=https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20190807164206994|date=August 7, 2019|work=Daum|title=\uae40\ub3d9\ud76c, '\uc778\uac04\uc218\uc5c5' \ucd2c\uc601 \ub05d \"\ud568\uaed8 \ud574\uc900 \uc2a4\ud15d\ub4e4 \uac10\uc0ac\ud574\uc694\"|language=ko|accessdate=August 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://www.netflix.com/title/80990668 Extracurricular]'' on [[Netflix]]\n* {{IMDb title|tt10262630}}\n* {{Hancinema drama|Human_Lessons}}\n\n{{Netflix original series}}\n\n[[Category:Korean-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:2020s South Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2020 South Korean television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Teen drama television series]]\n[[Category:South Korean crime television series]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Seoul]]\n", "name_user": "Seokgjin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEpisodes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_(TV_series)"}
