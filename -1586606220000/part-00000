He was captain of [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] during their most successful era in the 1970s and 1980s, winning the [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championship]] in 1983 and the [[Scottish League Cup]] twice. Hegarty won eight full international caps for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He has managed [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], Dundee United, [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] and [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]].\n\n== Playing career ==\n{{BLP sources section|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Hamilton Academical===\nHegarty's senior career began as a [[Striker (football)|striker]] with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Accies]] in 1972.\n\n===Dundee United===\nIn November 1974, [[Dundee United]] manager [[Jim McLean]] signed him for a fee of \u00a327,500. Two years later, McLean transformed Hegarty's career when he experimented by pairing him with [[Dave Narey]] in United's central defence. The partnership they forged would be integral to United's successes for over a decade and Hegarty would develop into a top class central [[Defender (football)|defender]]. As club captain, Hegarty led United to their first ever major trophy, the [[Scottish League Cup]] in [[1979\u201380 in Scottish football|1979]], which they retained the following year.\n\nIn [[1982\u201383 in Scottish football|1982\u201383]], Hegarty was an ever-present as United captured the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] title. He also featured in many notable victories in European competition, albeit injury restricted his participation in United's run to the [[1987 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to Dundee United, the club allowed him to leave on a free transfer in January 1990.\n\n===St Johnstone===\nHe briefly played for [[St Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]], helping them to promotion.\n\n===Scotland ===\nHegarty represented his country between 1979 and 1983, captaining the side against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in his eighth and final appearance for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He is widely regarded as one of the best central halves to have never been a regular for Scotland. He also turned out for the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21 side]] as a permitted over-age player and represented the [[Scottish League XI|Scottish League]].<ref name = \"league\"/>\n\n==Player manager==\n===Forfar Athletic===\n\nHe next before joined [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]] as player/manager. His tenure at Station Park ended in relegation in [[1991\u201392 in Scottish football|1992]] and Hegarty left shortly afterwards.\n\n== Management and coaching ==\n\nHegarty's next role was a return to Dundee United when he was offered a position on the club's coaching staff. After leaving [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] again in 1995 he went on to work for [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in coaching capacities, returning to management at Aberdeen. Following the dismissal of [[Alex Miller]], he was appointed as manager on an interim basis in January 1999. However, despite saving the club from relegation, Aberdeen elected at the end of the season not to continue with Hegarty in the job on a long-term basis. Once again, Dundee United offered Hegarty a coaching role, which became a manager role in October 2002 after chairman [[Eddie Thompson]] was unable to prise first-choice [[Ian McCall (footballer)|Ian McCall]] from [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/2312877.stm|title=McCall stays with Falkirk|date=9 October 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Initially appointed as caretaker,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/2333107.stm|title=Hegarty given time at United|date=6 October 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Hegarty's role was to be extended until the end of the season<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/2392123.stm|title=Hegarty lands United job|date=5 November 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> before he was sacked in January 2003 \u2013 and subsequently replaced with McCall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/2709587.stm|title=Dundee Utd appoint McCall|date=13 February 2003|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>\n\nSince his latest departure from Tannadice, Hegarty continued to work in coaching, having been on the staff of both [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/livingston/3363175.stm|title=Hegarty joins Livi|date=2 January 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> and [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/3822159.stm|title=Cleland replaces Hegarty|date=21 June 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> While at Dunfermline, Hegarty was approached by [[Inverness CT F.C.|Inverness CT]] to be part of the management with former Dundee United colleague [[Maurice Malpas]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/3996137.stm|title=Caley Thistle make approaches |date=10 November 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> although the move never materialised.

He has managed [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], Dundee United, [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] and [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]].\n\n== Playing career ==\n{{BLP sources section|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Hamilton Academical===\nHegarty's senior career began as a [[Striker (football)|striker]] with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Accies]] in 1972.\n\n===Dundee United===\nIn November 1974, [[Dundee United]] manager [[Jim McLean]] signed him for a fee of \u00a327,500. Two years later, McLean transformed Hegarty's career when he experimented by pairing him with [[Dave Narey]] in United's central defence. The partnership they forged would be integral to United's successes for over a decade and Hegarty would develop into a top class central [[Defender (football)|defender]]. As club captain, Hegarty led United to their first ever major trophy, the [[Scottish League Cup]] in [[1979\u201380 in Scottish football|1979]], which they retained the following year.\n\nIn [[1982\u201383 in Scottish football|1982\u201383]], Hegarty was an ever-present as United captured the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] title. He also featured in many notable victories in European competition, albeit injury restricted his participation in United's run to the [[1987 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to Dundee United, the club allowed him to leave on a free transfer in January 1990.\n\n===St Johnstone===\nHe briefly played for [[St Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]], helping them to promotion.\n\n===Scotland ===\nHegarty represented his country between 1979 and 1983, captaining the side against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in his eighth and final appearance for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He is widely regarded as one of the best central halves to have never been a regular for Scotland. He also turned out for the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21 side]] as a permitted over-age player and represented the [[Scottish League XI|Scottish League]].<ref name = \"league\"/>\n\n==Player Manager==\n===Forfar Athletic===\n\nHe next before joined [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]] as player/manager. His tenure at Station Park ended in relegation in [[1991\u201392 in Scottish football|1992]] and Hegarty left shortly afterwards.\n\n== Management and coaching ==\n\nHegarty's next role was a return to Dundee United when he was offered a position on the club's coaching staff. After leaving [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] again in 1995 he went on to work for [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in coaching capacities, returning to management at Aberdeen. Following the dismissal of [[Alex Miller]], he was appointed as manager on an interim basis in January 1999. However, despite saving the club from relegation, Aberdeen elected at the end of the season not to continue with Hegarty in the job on a long-term basis. Once again, Dundee United offered Hegarty a coaching role, which became a manager role in October 2002 after chairman [[Eddie Thompson]] was unable to prise first-choice [[Ian McCall (footballer)|Ian McCall]] from [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/2312877.stm|title=McCall stays with Falkirk|date=9 October 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Initially appointed as caretaker,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/2333107.stm|title=Hegarty given time at United|date=6 October 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Hegarty's role was to be extended until the end of the season<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/2392123.stm|title=Hegarty lands United job|date=5 November 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> before he was sacked in January 2003 \u2013 and subsequently replaced with McCall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/2709587.stm|title=Dundee Utd appoint McCall|date=13 February 2003|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>\n\nSince his latest departure from Tannadice, Hegarty continued to work in coaching, having been on the staff of both [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/livingston/3363175.stm|title=Hegarty joins Livi|date=2 January 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> and [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dunfermline_athletic/3822159.stm|title=Cleland replaces Hegarty|date=21 June 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> While at Dunfermline, Hegarty was approached by [[Inverness CT F.C.|Inverness CT]] to be part of the management with former Dundee United colleague [[Maurice Malpas]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/3996137.stm|title=Caley Thistle make approaches |date=10 November 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> although the move never materialised.

The boundary between [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]], west of the pass, and [[Yakima County, Washington|Yakima County]] to the east, coincides with the ridge. Terrain immediately west of the pass is in the [[Cowlitz River]] watershed. Terrain on the east side drains to the [[Yakima River]] watershed.\n\nThe pass provides the east entrance to [[Mount Rainier National Park]], and carries [[Washington State Route 410|State Route 410]] between the towns of [[Enumclaw, Washington|Enumclaw]] and [[Naches, Washington|Naches]]. Because of the high elevation, Chinook Pass is usually closed in November due to very heavy snow and significant [[avalanche]] danger. It usually opens in mid-May and is not uncommon to have a snow depth at the summit of up to 15 feet.\n\nAs part of the [[All-American Road]] program, Route 410 through Chinook Pass has been designated by the U.S. government as the [[Chinook Scenic Byway]]. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful routes in the United States. Because the summit is above the treeline, there are many places to park along the road to view the scenery.  As commercial vehicles are not allowed through the National Park section of State Route 410, this route is also favoured by summer tourists.\n\n==History==\nChinook Pass was chosen as a route across the Cascade Mountains as a compromise.  The height of the route would mean that it would likely never be a year-round road.  The alternative was [[Naches Pass]], which with the addition of a short tunnel would be much lower (and easier to keep open in winter).  The Naches Pass plan is still on the books as [[Washington State Route 168|SR 168]], but it has never been built.\n\nThe cost of the tunnel was the deciding factor, and the Chinook Pass route was chosen.\n\nThe [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] side of a road over Chinook Pass was partially completed in 1914, but then work was abandoned for several years.  This section was referred to as the 'Normile Grade'.  In 1921 work began again on the Yakima side, below Normile, on the [[American River (Washington)|American River]].  This work was done using horse teams.  In 1924, an army tractor was brought in to speed up the work.  Work on the west side of the road commenced later, and took longer.  The two sides did not meet until 1931 at [[Tipsoo Lake]] near the summit.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Tipsoo Lake overlook at Mount Rainier.jpg|thumb|left|Tipsoo Lake overlook at Chinook Pass]]\nFrom 1940 to 59, Chinook Pass was one of the top ski areas in the state, with a season that ran from December to June. There were numerous non-permanent rope tows that extended from Cayuse Pass to the [[Tipsoo Lake]] area. The requirement that they were temporary tows was made by the Mt Rainier Nat'l Park so the lifts could be removed when the snow melted in the summer months.

The boundary between [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]], west of the pass, and [[Yakima County, Washington|Yakima County]] to the east, coincides with the ridge. Terrain immediately west of the pass is in the [[Cowlitz River]] watershed. Terrain on the east side drains to the [[Yakima River]] watershed.\n\nThe pass provides the east entrance to [[Mount Rainier National Park]], and carries [[Washington State Route 410|State Route 410]] between the towns of [[Enumclaw, Washington|Enumclaw]] and [[Naches, Washington|Naches]]. Because of the high elevation, Chinook Pass is usually closed in November due to very heavy snow and significant [[avalanche]] danger. It usually opens in mid-May and is not uncommon to have a snow depth at the summit of up to 15 feet.\n\nAs part of the [[All-American Road]] program, Route 410 through Chinook Pass has been designated by the U.S. government as the [[Chinook Scenic Byway]]. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful routes in the United States. Because the summit is above the treeline, there are many places to park along the road to view the scenery.  As commercial vehicles are not allowed through the National Park section of State Route 410, this route is also favored by summer tourists.\n\n==History==\nChinook Pass was chosen as a route across the Cascade Mountains as a compromise.  The height of the route would mean that it would likely never be a year-round road.  The alternative was [[Naches Pass]], which with the addition of a short tunnel would be much lower (and easier to keep open in winter).  The Naches Pass plan is still on the books as [[Washington State Route 168|SR 168]], but it has never been built.\n\nThe cost of the tunnel was the deciding factor, and the Chinook Pass route was chosen.\n\nThe [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] side of a road over Chinook Pass was partially completed in 1914, but then work was abandoned for several years.  This section was referred to as the 'Normile Grade'.  In 1921 work began again on the Yakima side, below Normile, on the [[American River (Washington)|American River]].  This work was done using horse teams.  In 1924, an army tractor was brought in to speed up the work.  Work on the west side of the road commenced later, and took longer.  The two sides did not meet until 1931 at [[Tipsoo Lake]] near the summit.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Tipsoo Lake overlook at Mount Rainier.jpg|thumb|left|Tipsoo Lake overlook at Chinook Pass]]\nFrom 1940\u201359, Chinook Pass was one of the top ski areas in the state, with a season that ran from December to June. There were numerous non-permanent rope tows that extended from Cayuse Pass to the [[Tipsoo Lake]] area. The requirement that they were temporary tows was made by the Mt Rainier Nat'l Park so the lifts could be removed when the snow melted in the summer months. With the state government plans to no longer keep Chinook Pass open during the winter months and the opening of [[White Pass Ski Area]], lift skiing ended.  It is still a very popular area for backcountry [[telemark skiing]] and snowboarding from May to July.\n\nTipsoo Lake is located just a few hundred meters from the summit, with a picnic area and a trail going around the lake, is one of the most photographed landscapes in the [[United States]].\n\nChinook Pass is also a trailhead to the [[Pacific Crest Trail]], providing access to Dewey Lake and Cougar Lake (in the [[William O. Douglas Wilderness]]), [[Crystal Mountain (Washington)|Crystal Mountain Ski Resort]], and the [[Norse Peak Wilderness]].\n\nThe [[Naches Peak Loop]] is a trail route that goes around [[Naches Peak]], containing a segment of the [[Pacific Crest Trail]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cayuse Pass]]\n* [[Mount Rainier National Park]]\n* [[Cascade Range]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081217084857/http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/passes/chinook/ Chinook Pass] at the Washington State Department of Transportation website\n* [http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/winter/PassDates.htm Pass opening and closure dates] for Chinook Pass, [[Cayuse Pass]], and [[North Cascades Highway]] at the Washington State Department of Transportation website\n* [http://www.chinookpass.com ChinookPass.com] for Chinook Pass road conditions and Mount Rainier National Park news\n\n[[Category:Mountain passes of Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Mountain passes of the Cascades]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Pierce County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Pierce County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Pierce County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Yakima County, Washington]]\n", "name_user": "Burco18", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_Pass"}

In 1807, Robert Goodbody married into the Pim family, who had investments in [[shipping]], [[insurance]], [[banking]], [[mining]], and [[railways]]. Robert set up a milling company of his own and fathered five sons, all of whom went on to set up relatively successful businesses. One of those sons, Marcus, married Hannah Perry, daughter of James Perry, a successful businessman with investments in [[iron]], railways, and [[brewing]]. Their first child, Robert, went on to found the Goodbody Stockbroking company. Robert originally passed the [[bar exam]], and married into the Pim family, like his grandfather. The Pim family, however, did not like the idea of their daughter marrying a lawyer, so, Goodbody embarked on a career in stockbroking.<ref name=\"our heritage\">{{cite web |title=Our Heritage |url=https://www.goodbody.ie/our-heritage.html |website=goodbody.ie |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The business begins ===\nOn 13 November 1874, Goodbody attended a meeting of the [[Dublin Stock Exchange]], and his license to start his business was approved. Two years later, on 26 April 1876, Robert's cousin, Jonathan, joined him to form R&J Goodbody.<ref name=\"our heritage\"/>\n=== Paths separate ===\nIn 1855, Robert departed Ireland for [[New York City]], and R&J Goodbody was dissolved. Jonathan became partners with Theodore Richard Webb, a fellow [[Quakers|Quaker]], to create Goodbody & Webb. In New York, Robert partnered with [[Charles Dow]], forming Goodbody, Glynn & Dow. Dow went on to found the [[Wall Street Journal]]. By 1891, both men parted ways. Robert started his own firm entitled Robert Goodbody & Co, which became the fifth largest brokerage firm in the United States, before being bought by [[Merrill Lynch]] in 1971.<ref name=\"our heritage\"/>\n=== Goodbody & Webb era: 1885-1976 ===\nJonathan retired from Goodbody & Webb in 1928, being succeeded by his son, Denis, along with his cousin, Jack Freeman. Denis remained a [[Dublin Stock Exchange]] partner until 1970. Freeman was [[chairman]] of the [[Provincial Bank of Ireland]], which joined with Munster and Leinster to form [[Allied Irish Banks]]. In 1974, Goodbody & Webb became the first Irish firm to open an office in [[London]].<ref name=\"our heritage\"/>\n=== Merger era: 1976-1990 ===\nGoodbody & Webb merged with Wilkinson & Faulkner and was renamed to Goodbody & Wilkinson.

In 1807, Robert Goodbody married into the Pim family, who had investments in [[shipping]], [[insurance]], [[banking]], [[mining]], and [[railways]]. Robert set up a milling company of his own and fathered five sons, all of whom went on to set up relatively successful businesses. One of those sons, Marcus, married Hannah Perry, daughter of James Perry, a successful businessman with investments in [[iron]], railways, and [[brewing]]. Their first child, Robert, went on to found the Goodbody Stockbroking company. Robert originally passed the [[bar exam]], and married into the Pim family, like his grandfather. The Pim family, however, did not like the idea of their daughter marrying a lawyer, so, Goodbody embarked on a career in stockbroking.<ref name=\"our heritage\">{{cite web |title=Our Heritage |url=https://www.goodbody.ie/our-heritage.html |website=goodbody.ie |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The business begins ===\nOn 13 November 1874, Goodbody attended a meeting of the [[Dublin Stock Exchange]], and his license to start his business was approved. Two years later, on 26 April 1876, Robert's cousin, Jonathan, joined him to form R&J Goodbody.<ref name=\"our heritage\"/>\n=== Paths separate ===\nIn 1855, Robert departed Ireland for [[New York City]], and R&J Goodbody was dissolved. Jonathan became partners with Theodore Richard Webb, a fellow [[Quakers|Quaker]], to create Goodbody & Webb. In New York, Robert partnered with [[Charles Dow]], forming Goodbody, Glynn & Dow. Dow went on to found the [[Wall Street Journal]]. By 1891, both men parted ways. Robert started his own firm entitled Robert Goodbody & Co, which became the fifth largest brokerage firm in the United States, before being bought by [[Merrill Lynch]] in 1971.<ref name=\"our heritage\"/>\n=== Goodbody & Webb era: 1885-1976 ===\nJonathan retired from Goodbody & Webb in 1928, being succeeded by his son, Denis, along with his cousin, Jack Freeman. Denis remained a [[Dublin Stock Exchange]] partner until 1970. Freeman was [[chairman]] of the [[Provincial Bank of Ireland]], which joined with Munster and Leinster to form [[Allied Irish Banks]]. In 1974, Goodbody & Webb became the first Irish firm to open an office in [[London]].<ref name=\"our heritage\"/>\n=== Merger era: 1976-1990 ===\nGoodbody & Webb merged with Wilkinson & Faulkner and was renamed to Goodbody & Wilkinson.

{"title_page": "Joint probability distribution", "text_new": "{{Annotated image | caption=Many sample observations (black) are shown from a joint probability distribution. The marginal densities are shown as well.\n| image=Multivariate normal sample.svg\n| image-width = 300\n| annotations =\n{{Annotation|60|190|<math>X</math>}}\n{{Annotation|240|190|<math>Y</math>}}\n{{Annotation|240|20|<math>p(X)</math>}}\n{{Annotation|60|20|<math>p(Y)</math>}}\n}}\n\n{{Probability fundamentals}}\nGiven [[random variable]]s <math>X,Y,\\ldots</math>, that are defined on a [[probability space]], the '''joint probability distribution''' for <math>X,Y,\\ldots</math> is a [[probability distribution]] that gives the probability that each of <math>X,Y,\\ldots</math> falls in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variable. In the case of only two random variables, this is called a '''bivariate distribution''', but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables, giving a '''multivariate distribution'''.\n\nThe joint probability distribution can be expressed either in terms of a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] or in terms of a joint [[probability density function]] (in the case of [[continuous variable]]s) or joint [[probability mass function]] (in the case of [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] variables). These in turn can be used to find two other types of distributions: the [[marginal density|marginal distribution]] giving the probabilities for any one of the variables with no reference to any specific ranges of values for the other variables, and the [[conditional probability distribution]] giving the probabilities for any subset of the variables conditional on particular values of the remaining variables.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Draws from an urn===\n\nSuppose each of  two urns contains twice as many red balls as blue balls, and no others, and suppose one ball is randomly selected from each urn, with the two draws independent of each other. Let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the draw from the first urn and second urn respectively. The probability of drawing a red ball from either of the urns is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a blue ball is 1/3. We can present the joint probability distribution as the following table:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! A=Red !! A=Blue !! P(B)\n|-\n! B=Red\n| (2/3)(2/3)=4/9 || (1/3)(2/3)=2/9 || 4/9+2/9=2/3\n|-\n! B=Blue\n|(2/3)(1/3)=2/9 || (1/3)(1/3)=1/9 || 2/9+1/9=1/3\n|-\n! P(A)\n| 4/9+2/9=2/3 || 2/9+1/9=1/3 ||\n|}\n\nEach of the four inner cells shows the probability of a particular combination of results from the two draws; these probabilities are the joint distribution. In any one cell the probability of a particular combination occurring is (since the draws are independent) the product of the probability of the specified result for A and the probability of the specified result for B. The probabilities in these four cells sum to 1, as it is always true for probability distributions.\n\nMoreover, the final row and the final column give the [[marginal probability distribution]] for A and the marginal probability distribution for B respectively. For example, for A the first of these cells gives the sum of the probabilities for A being red, regardless of which possibility for B in the column above the cell occurs, as 2/3. Thus the marginal probability distribution for <math>A</math> gives <math>A</math>'s probabilities ''unconditional'' on <math>B</math>, in a margin of the table.\n\n===Coin flips===\nConsider the flip of two [[fair coin]]s; let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the first and second coin flips respectively. Each coin flip is a [[Bernoulli trial]] and has a [[Bernoulli distribution]]. If a coin displays \"heads\" then the associated random variable takes the value 1, and it takes the value 0 otherwise.

\"mixed joint density\" may be defined where one or more random variables are continuous and the other random variables are discrete. With one variable of each type we have\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_{X \\mid Y}(x \\mid y)\\mathrm{P}(Y=y)= \\mathrm{P}(Y=y \\mid X=x) f_X(x).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nOne example of a situation in which one may wish to find the cumulative distribution of one random variable which is continuous and another random variable which is discrete arises when one wishes to use a [[logistic regression]] in predicting the probability of a binary outcome Y conditional on the value of a continuously distributed outcome <math>X</math>. One ''must'' use the \"mixed\" joint density when finding the cumulative distribution of this binary outcome because the input variables <math>(X,Y)</math> were initially defined in such a way that one could not collectively assign it either a probability density function or a probability mass function.  Formally, <math>f_{X,Y}(x,y)</math> is the probability density function of <math>(X,Y)</math> with respect to the [[product measure]] on the respective [[support (measure theory)|supports]] of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. Either of these two decompositions can then be used to recover the joint cumulative distribution function:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nF_{X,Y}(x,y)&=\\sum\\limits_{t\\le y}\\int_{s=-\\infty}^x f_{X,Y}(s,t)\\;ds.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe definition generalizes to a mixture of arbitrary numbers of discrete and continuous random variables.\n\n==Additional properties==\n===Joint distribution for independent variables===\nIn general two random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[statistical independence|independent]] if and only if the joint cumulative distribution function satisfies\n:<math> F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x) \\cdot F_Y(y) </math>\n\nTwo discrete random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are independent if and only if the joint probability mass function satisfies\n:<math> P(X = x \\ \\mbox{and} \\ Y = y ) = P( X = x) \\cdot P( Y = y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\nWhile the number of independent random events grows, the related joint probability value decreases rapidly to zero, according to a negative exponential law.\n\nSimilarly, two absolutely continuous random variables are independent if and only if\n:<math> f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) \\cdot f_Y(y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. This means that acquiring any information about the value of one or more of the random variables leads to a conditional distribution of any other variable that is identical to its unconditional (marginal) distribution; thus no variable provides any information about any other variable.\n\n===Joint distribution for conditionally dependent variables===\nIf a subset <math>A</math> of the variables <math>X_1,\\cdots,X_n</math> is [[conditional dependence|conditionally dependent]] given another subset <math>B</math> of these variables, then the  probability mass function of the joint distribution is <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math>.  <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math> is equal to <math>P(B)\\cdot P(A\\mid B)</math>. Therefore, it can be efficiently represented by the lower-dimensional probability distributions <math>P(B)</math> and <math>P(A\\mid B)</math>. Such conditional independence relations can be represented with a [[Bayesian network]] or [[Copula (probability theory)|copula functions]].\n\n=== [[Covariance]] ===\nWhen two or more random variables are defined on a probability space, it is useful to describe how they vary together; that is, it is useful to measure the relationship between the variables. A common measure of the relationship between two random variables is the covariance. Covariance is a measure of linear relationship between the random variables. If the relationship between the random variables is nonlinear, the covariance might not be sensitive to the relationship.\n\nThe covariance between the random variable X and Y, denoted as cov(X,Y), is :\n\n<math>\\sigma_{XY}=E[(X-\\mu_x)(Y-\\mu_y)]=E(XY)-\\mu_x\\mu_y</math><ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied statistics and probability for engineers|last=Montgomery, Douglas C.|others=Runger, George C.|isbn=978-1-118-53971-2|edition=Sixth|location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=861273897|date = 19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Correlation and dependence|Correlation]] ===\nThere is another measure of the relationship between two random variables that is often easier to interpret than the covariance.\n\nThe correlation just scales the covariance by the product of the standard deviation of each variable. Consequently, the correlation is a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the linear relationships between pairs of variables in different units. If the points in the joint probability distribution of X and Y that receive positive probability tend to fall along a line of positive (or negative) slope, \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> is near +1 (or \u22121). If \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> equals +1 or \u22121, it can be shown that the points in the joint probability distribution that receive positive probability fall exactly along a straight line. Two random variables with nonzero correlation are said to be correlated. Similar to covariance, the correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between random variables.\n\nThe correlation between random variable X and Y, denoted as  \n\n<math>\\rho_{XY}=\\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{XY}}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y}</math>\n\n==Important named distributions==\n\nNamed joint distributions that arise frequently in statistics include the [[multivariate normal distribution]], the [[multivariate stable distribution]], the [[multinomial distribution]], the [[negative multinomial distribution]], the [[multivariate hypergeometric distribution]], and the [[elliptical distribution]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bayesian programming]]\n* [[Chow\u2013Liu tree]]\n* [[Conditional probability]]\n* [[Copula (probability theory)]]\n* [[Disintegration theorem]]\n* [[Multivariate statistics]]\n* [[Statistical interference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Joint distribution|id=p/j054260}}\n* {{springer|title=Multi-dimensional distribution|id=p/m065120}}\n*''A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how''.

In the case of only two random variables, this is called a '''bivariate distribution''', but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables, giving a '''multivariate distribution'''.\n\nThe joint probability distribution can be expressed either in terms of a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] or in terms of a joint [[probability density function]] (in the case of [[continuous variable]]s) or joint [[probability mass function]] (in the case of [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] variables). These in turn can be used to find two other types of distributions: the [[marginal density|marginal distribution]] giving the probabilities for any one of the variables with no reference to any specific ranges of values for the other variables, and the [[conditional probability distribution]] giving the probabilities for any subset of the variables conditional on particular values of the remaining variables.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Draws from an urn===\n\nSuppose each of  two urns contains twice as many red balls as blue balls, and no others, and suppose one ball is randomly selected from each urn, with the two draws independent of each other. Let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the draw from the first urn and second urn respectively. The probability of drawing a red ball from either of the urns is 2/3, and the probability of drawing a blue ball is 1/3. We can present the joint probability distribution as the following table:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! A=Red !! A=Blue !! P(B)\n|-\n! B=Red\n| (2/3)(2/3)=4/9 || (1/3)(2/3)=2/9 || 4/9+2/9=2/3\n|-\n! B=Blue\n|(2/3)(1/3)=2/9 || (1/3)(1/3)=1/9 || 2/9+1/9=1/3\n|-\n! P(A)\n| 4/9+2/9=2/3 || 2/9+1/9=1/3 ||\n|}\n\nEach of the four inner cells shows the probability of a particular combination of results from the two draws; these probabilities are the joint distribution. In any one cell the probability of a particular combination occurring is (since the draws are independent) the product of the probability of the specified result for A and the probability of the specified result for B. The probabilities in these four cells sum to 1, as it is always true for probability distributions.\n\nMoreover, the final row and the final column give the [[marginal probability distribution]] for A and the marginal probability distribution for B respectively. For example, for A the first of these cells gives the sum of the probabilities for A being red, regardless of which possibility for B in the column above the cell occurs, as 2/3. Thus the marginal probability distribution for <math>A</math> gives <math>A</math>'s probabilities ''unconditional'' on <math>B</math>, in a margin of the table.\n\n===Coin flips===\nConsider the flip of two [[fair coin]]s; let <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> be discrete random variables associated with the outcomes of the first and second coin flips respectively. Each coin flip is a [[Bernoulli trial]] and has a [[Bernoulli distribution]]. If a coin displays \"heads\" then the associated random variable takes the value 1, and it takes the value 0 otherwise. The probability of each of these outcomes is 1/2, so the marginal (unconditional) density functions are\n\n:<math>P(A)=1/2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad A\\in \\{0, 1\\};</math>\n:<math>P(B)=1/2 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad B\\in \\{0, 1\\}.</math>\n\nThe joint probability density function of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> defines probabilities for each pair of outcomes. All possible outcomes are\n:<math>\n(A=0,B=0),\n(A=0,B=1),\n(A=1,B=0),\n(A=1,B=1).\n</math>\nSince each outcome is equally likely the joint probability density function becomes\n:<math>P(A,B)=1/4 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad A,B\\in\\{0,1\\}.</math>\n\nSince the coin flips are independent, the joint probability density function is the product\nof the marginals:\n:<math>P(A,B)=P(A)P(B) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad A,B \\in\\{0,1\\}.</math>\n\n===Rolling a die===\nConsider the roll of a fair {{dice|die}} and let <math>A=1</math> if the number is even (i.e. 2, 4, or 6) and <math>A=0</math> otherwise.

the two-variable case\n\n:<math>\\sum_i \\sum_j \\mathrm{P}(X=x_i\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ Y=y_j) = 1,\\,</math>\nwhich generalizes for <math>n\\,</math> discrete random variables <math>X_1, X_2, \\dots ,

function]]''' <math>f_{X,Y}(x,y)</math> for two [[continuous random variable]]s is defined as the derivative of the joint cumulative distribution function (see {{EquationNote|Eq.1}}):\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 F_{X,Y}(x,y)}{\\partial x \\partial y}</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.5}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nThis is equal to:\n:<math>f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_{Y\\mid X}(y\\mid x)f_X(x) = f_{X\\mid Y}(x\\mid y)f_Y(y)</math>\n\nwhere <math>f_{Y\\mid X}(y\\mid x)</math> and <math>f_{X\\mid Y}(x\\mid y)</math> are the [[conditional distribution]]s of <math>Y</math> given <math>X=x</math> and of <math>X</math> given <math>Y=y</math> respectively, and <math>f_X(x)</math> and <math>f_Y(y)</math> are the [[marginal distribution]]s for <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> respectively.\n\nThe definition extends naturally to more than two random variables:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f_{X_1,\\ldots,X_n}(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\frac{\\partial^n F_{X_1,\\ldots,X_n}(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)}{\\partial x_1 \\ldots \\partial x_n}</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.6}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nAgain, since these are probability distributions, one has\n:<math>\\int_x \\int_y f_{X,Y}(x,y) \\; dy \\; dx= 1</math>\nrespectively\n:<math>\\int_{x_1} \\ldots \\int_{x_n} f_{X_1,\\ldots,X_n}(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\; dx_1 \\ldots \\; dx_n = 1</math>\n\n===Mixed case===\nThe \"mixed joint density\" may be defined where one or more random variables are continuous and the other random variables are discrete. With one variable of each type we have\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_{X \\mid Y}(x \\mid y)\\mathrm{P}(Y=y)= \\mathrm{P}(Y=y \\mid X=x) f_X(x).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nOne example of a situation in which one may wish to find the cumulative distribution of one random variable which is continuous and another random variable which is discrete arises when one wishes to use a [[logistic regression]] in predicting the probability of a binary outcome Y conditional on the value of a continuously distributed outcome <math>X</math>. One ''must'' use the \"mixed\" joint density when finding the cumulative distribution of this binary outcome because the input variables <math>(X,Y)</math> were initially defined in such a way that one could not collectively assign it either a probability density function or a probability mass function.  Formally, <math>f_{X,Y}(x,y)</math> is the probability density function of <math>(X,Y)</math> with respect to the [[product measure]] on the respective [[support (measure theory)|supports]] of <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>. Either of these two decompositions can then be used to recover the joint cumulative distribution function:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nF_{X,Y}(x,y)&=\\sum\\limits_{t\\le y}\\int_{s=-\\infty}^x f_{X,Y}(s,t)\\;ds.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe definition generalizes to a mixture of arbitrary numbers of discrete and continuous random variables.\n\n==Additional properties==\n===Joint distribution for independent variables===\nIn general two random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[statistical independence|independent]] if and only if the joint cumulative distribution function satisfies\n:<math> F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_X(x) \\cdot F_Y(y) </math>\n\nTwo discrete random variables <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are independent if and only if the joint probability mass function satisfies\n:<math> P(X = x \\ \\mbox{and} \\ Y = y ) = P( X = x) \\cdot P( Y = y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\nWhile the number of independent random events grows, the related joint probability value decreases rapidly to zero, according to a negative exponential law.\n\nSimilarly, two absolutely continuous random variables are independent if and only if\n:<math> f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) \\cdot f_Y(y) </math>\nfor all <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. This means that acquiring any information about the value of one or more of the random variables leads to a conditional distribution of any other variable that is identical to its unconditional (marginal) distribution; thus no variable provides any information about any other variable.\n\n===Joint distribution for conditionally dependent variables===\nIf a subset <math>A</math> of the variables <math>X_1,\\cdots,X_n</math> is [[conditional dependence|conditionally dependent]] given another subset <math>B</math> of these variables, then the  probability mass function of the joint distribution is <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math>.  <math>\\mathrm{P}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)</math> is equal to <math>P(B)\\cdot P(A\\mid B)</math>. Therefore, it can be efficiently represented by the lower-dimensional probability distributions <math>P(B)</math> and <math>P(A\\mid B)</math>. Such conditional independence relations can be represented with a [[Bayesian network]] or [[Copula (probability theory)|copula functions]].\n\n=== [[Covariance]] ===\nWhen two or more random variables are defined on a probability space, it is useful to describe how they vary together; that is, it is useful to measure the relationship between the variables. A common measure of the relationship between two random variables is the covariance. Covariance is a measure of linear relationship between the random variables. If the relationship between the random variables is nonlinear, the covariance might not be sensitive to the relationship.\n\nThe covariance between the random variable X and Y, denoted as cov(X,Y), is :\n\n<math>\\sigma_{XY}=E[(X-\\mu_x)(Y-\\mu_y)]=E(XY)-\\mu_x\\mu_y</math><ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied statistics and probability for engineers|last=Montgomery, Douglas C.|others=Runger, George C.|isbn=978-1-118-53971-2|edition=Sixth|location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=861273897|date = 19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Correlation and dependence|Correlation]] ===\nThere is another measure of the relationship between two random variables that is often easier to interpret than the covariance.\n\nThe correlation just scales the covariance by the product of the standard deviation of each variable. Consequently, the correlation is a dimensionless quantity that can be used to compare the linear relationships between pairs of variables in different units. If the points in the joint probability distribution of X and Y that receive positive probability tend to fall along a line of positive (or negative) slope, \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> is near +1 (or \u22121). If \u03c1<sub>XY</sub> equals +1 or \u22121, it can be shown that the points in the joint probability distribution that receive positive probability fall exactly along a straight line. Two random variables with nonzero correlation are said to be correlated. Similar to covariance, the correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between random variables.\n\nThe correlation between random variable X and Y, denoted as  \n\n<math>\\rho_{XY}=\\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{XY}}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y}</math>\n\n==Important named distributions==\n\nNamed joint distributions that arise frequently in statistics include the [[multivariate normal distribution]], the [[multivariate stable distribution]], the [[multinomial distribution]], the [[negative multinomial distribution]], the [[multivariate hypergeometric distribution]], and the [[elliptical distribution]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bayesian programming]]\n* [[Chow\u2013Liu tree]]\n* [[Conditional probability]]\n* [[Copula (probability theory)]]\n* [[Disintegration theorem]]\n* [[Multivariate statistics]]\n* [[Statistical interference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Joint distribution|id=p/j054260}}\n* {{springer|title=Multi-dimensional distribution|id=p/m065120}}\n*''A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how''.

Sony claims that this can compensate a 4.5-stop equivalent of camera shake.
