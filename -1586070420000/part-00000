He was  well known for being an innovator of the church bus ministry that brought thousands of people each week from surrounding towns to Hammond for services.<ref name=\"Janega\">Janega, James Rev. \"Jack Hyles; Led bus ministry\", ''Chicago Tribune'', February 9, 2001.</ref> Hyles built First Baptist up from fewer than a thousand members to a membership of 100,000. In 1993 and again in 1994, it was reported that 20,000 people attended First Baptist every Sunday, making it the most attended Baptist church in the United States.<ref name=\"shun\">Lehmann, Daniel J. \"Fundamentalists Shun a Society They Try to Save\", ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', June 6, 1993, p. 5.</ref><ref name=\"Pastor Linked\">Lehmann, Daniel J. \"Pastor Linked to Sex Abuse Lashes Out,\" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', June 2, 1993. p. 5.</ref><ref name=\"Chalfant\">Chalfant, H.

Hyles often described his less-than-ideal upbringing which, he said, included a distant father. At the age of eighteen, Hyles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served as a [[paratrooper]] with the [[82nd Airborne Division]] during [[World War II]]. He and his wife, Beverly, were married during the war.\n\nAfter the war was over, Hyles completed his college education at [[East Texas Baptist University]] (then College) in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], the seat of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]]. After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R. Rice]] and his own annual \"Pastors School\". The school continues to attract as many as seven thousand annual visitors to the Hammond area.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zabroski | first = Steve | year = 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414133420/http://nwitimes.com/articles/1997/10/04/export247369.txt|archivedate=April 14, 2009|url = http://nwitimes.com/articles/2006/03/24/news/lake_county/2970eb71e3fc94308625713b0014b869.txt | title = Faithful flock to Hammond | work = [[Northwest Indiana Times]] | accessdate = March 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles wrote approximately fifty works in his lifetime with over 14 million total copies in circulation, including the popular ''Is There A Hell?'', based on a sermon he preached at a National Sword of the Lord Conference.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  Another work, ''Enemies of Soul Winning'' tackled many issues considered controversial in fundamentalist and evangelical circles, which include the doctrine of repentance, [[Lordship salvation]], and the role of the church in soul winning. The ''Calvary Contender'' wrote, \"Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | title = Jack Hyles Succumbs To Heart Attack | work = [[Calvary Contender]] | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060512171223/http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | archivedate = May 12, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles was better known as \"Brother Hyles\" to his tens of thousands of congregants.<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.\n\nIn his book, ''Enemies of Soulwinning'', Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the [[King James Version]] was used somewhere along the line in that person's life.<ref>''Enemies of Soulwinning'' by Jack Hyles, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> He did not teach [[Landmarkism]]/[[Baptist successionism]] (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at [[Pentecost]]), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in AD 313.<ref name=\"landmark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/Dr%20Jack%20Hyles/The%20Church/fundamental_baptist_church-chap_23.htm|title=What Is a Fundamental Baptist Church?}}</ref>\n\n=== Honors, award, and praise ===\nIn contrast to the criticism, Hyles has been the recipient of praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life, even continuing past his death. The ''Washington Post'' compared the \"meek\" preaching style of [[Jerry Falwell]] to the \"spit and fire\" of Hyles. The Post suggested that after you heard a preacher like Hyles, \"you knew that you'd been preached to\".<ref>Harrington, Walt. \"What Hath Falwell Wrought?\" ''Washington Post'', July 24, 1988, p. W19.</ref> Falwell said that \"Hyles will be remembered as a leader in evangelism through the local church.\"  Falwell also said, \"He inspired me as a young pastor to win others to Christ through Sunday school, the pulpit, and personal witnessing. He made a great contribution to the cause of Christ\".<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Midwestern Baptist College]], an unaccredited Bible college in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].<ref>As discussed along with his misuse of the title on [[Preying from the Pulpit]] in May 1993 by [[WJBK]] of [[Detroit]].</ref>\n\nThe ''Chicago Sun Times'' wrote about Hyles on the occasion of his death, \"When he chose the interests of poor, inner-city kids over millionaire church members, they said he'd never keep the doors of his church open.\" However, Hyles \"proved them all wrong. In the process he built one of the largest congregations in the country, a college, six schools, and a vibrant ministry that will now have to survive without him.\"<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\n[[Matthew Barnett]], while discussing his work at an inner-city Los Angeles ministry, explained how he learned from Hyles. Barnett also expounded on how Hyles was a tremendous soulwinner and how Hyles had great influence throughout the entire Chicago area.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/le/2005/001/3.22.html High hopes: Matthew Barnett's secret is to inspire others to dream what God can do\u2014and dream big] The Leadership Interview from ''Leadership Journal'' January 1, 2005.</ref>\n\nHyles is honored in Founder's Park at his college, where they laid 30,000 bricks as flooring for life-sized statues of Hyles and his widow.<ref>[http://nwitimes.com/articles/2001/10/20/export348149.txt News briefs Illinois edition: Dedication to unveil college founder] October 20, 2001, ''Northwest Indiana Times''.</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nAccusations of improper sexual behavior, financial and emotional abuse are highlights to Hyles' legacy.<ref name=\"LetPrey\">{{cite news |title= Let Us Prey: Big Trouble at First Baptist Church' |first= Bryan |last= Smith |url= http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/January-2013/Let-Us-Prey-Big-Trouble-at-First-Baptist-Church/ |magazine= [[Chicago Magazine]] |date= January 2013 |accessdate= 2012-12-17 }}</ref> In 1989, the paper [[The Biblical Evangelist]] published a story \"The Saddest Story We Ever Published\", accusing Hyles of sexual scandals, financial misappropriation and doctrinal errors.<ref name=\"biblicalevangelist.org\">{{cite web | year=1989 | url = http://www.biblicalevangelist.org/jack_hyles_chapter3.php | title = The Saddest Story We Ever Published | work = [[The Biblical Evangelist]] | accessdate = February 4, 2011 }}</ref> These charges were denied by Hyles who deemed them \"lies\".<ref name=\"lies\">{{cite web|last=Hirsley|first=Michael|title=Charges All Lies, Hammond Pastor Says|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-05-28/news/8902040871_1_church-deacon-church-office-fundamentalist|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=July 8, 2010|date=May 28, 1989}}</ref> He was accused of a decade long affair with his secretary, Jennie Nischik, who happened to be the wife of a church deacon, Victor Nischik.<ref name=\"LetPrey\"/>\n\nIn 1991, a First Baptist Church of Hammond deacon molested a 7-year-old girl in her Hammond Sunday school class.<ref name=\"Pastor Linked\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/jack-schaap-pastor-fired-_n_1728302.html | title=Jack Schaap, Pastor, Fired From Megachurch For Committing 'A Sin'  |work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=August 1, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-10-24}}</ref> During a Sunday school class \"a church worker reportedly witnessed the act and removed the girl from the room, police said.\"<ref name=\"f\">\"Church leaders sued in sex-abuse case,\" ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 16, 1991.</ref> The ''Chicago Tribune'' in a 1991 article reported that Hyles was sued for $1 million by the parents of the girl.<ref name=\"f\" /> The paper reported the \"lawsuit claims Hyles and the church had not fulfilled their obligation to ensure that children were protected from harm during Sunday school.\"<ref name=\"f\" />  Furthermore, the lawsuit \"claims the minister told the child's parents that Ballenger 'just loved children,' and, 'You don't have a case.'\"<ref name=\"f\" /> The church settled the lawsuit out of court and the terms were not disclosed.<ref>\"A civil suit filed against Ballenger and the church by the girl's family was settled almost two years ago.\" from Though it is not proven facts and some of this was not caused by Hyles and not enitrely his fault.\n{{cite news | url=http://nwitimes.com/uncategorized/article_fd37980b-51ad-59e4-ac20-52b14229e670.html | title=One step closer to the end |newspaper=[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]] | date=March 31, 1996 | first=Amanda | last=Beeler | accessdate = 2009-07-24}}</ref> At the criminal trial, three young women testified deacon A.V.

Hyles often described his less-than-ideal upbringing which, he said, included a distant father. At the age of eighteen, Hyles enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and served as a [[paratrooper]] with the [[82nd Airborne Division]] during [[World War II]]. He and his wife, Beverly, were married during the war.\n\nAfter the war was over, Hyles completed his college education at [[East Texas Baptist University]] (then College) in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], the seat of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]]. After his graduation from East Texas, Hyles started preaching at several small Texas churches, whose memberships began to grow.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  These churches included: Marris Chapel Baptist Church, [[Bogata, Texas]]; Grange Hall Baptist Church, [[Marshall, Texas]]; and Southside Baptist Church, [[Henderson, Texas]]. After receiving his education Hyles pastored at the Miller Road Baptist Church in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]] in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] for about six years. During this time the congregation grew from 44 to 4,000 members.<ref name=\"Janega\" /> It was during those days that Hyles left the Southern Baptist Convention and became an independent Baptist. Hyles then led Miller Road Baptist Church as an independent preacher for a while.<ref name=\"Janega\" /><ref name=\"BJH\">Falsani, Cathleen. \"Brother Jack Hyles of Hammond dies at 74\" ''Chicago Sun Times'', February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\n===The move to Hammond, Indiana===\nIn 1959, Hyles moved to the church provided parsonage at 8232 Greenwood avenue, [[Munster, Indiana]], and became the pastor of [[First Baptist Church of Hammond]]. When he arrived, the church had a membership of about seven hundred, said to be mostly \"high-society types.\"  About a third of the members left the church after hearing Hyles' preaching style, which was much different than that to which they had been accustomed. Hyles then led the church to its status as an independent Baptist church\u2014freeing it from its ties with the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]]s. Hyles started his bus ministry and soon shepherded the church from a congregation of several hundred to more than 20,000. In the early 1990s a national survey ranked First Baptist as the largest church in the nation, by average weekly attendance figures.<ref name=\"Chalfant\" /><ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nBeginning in 1969, and continuing for several years, First Baptist received recognition for the size of its Sunday School. In 1969, [[Elmer Towns]] wrote a book called ''The Ten Largest Sunday Schools and What Makes Them Grow'' which analyzed First Baptist's Sunday School.<ref name=\"FBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fbchammond.com/the_voice/01%20decembervoice2003.pdf |format=PDF |title=First Baptist Church...

As early as 1975, ''Time'' magazine described the phenomenon in an article titled, \"Superchurch.\"  The ''Time'' article notes that First Baptist Church of Hammond Sunday School, which regularly ran almost 14,000 people, pushed the church to a record attendance of 30,560 on March 16, 1975, thanks to a boisterous contest between two bus route teams.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,913788,00.html Superchurch]'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]] December 1, 1975 (retrieved June 4, 2006).</ref>  In that year, the First Baptist bus route ministry consisted of 1,000 workers using 230 buses to ferry as many as 10,000 people every Sunday.<ref name=\"Time\" />  In 2001, a fleet of over 200 buses was regularly ferrying 7,000 to 15,000 people from all over the area.<ref name=\"BJH\" />\n\nHyles spoke at '[[The Sword of the Lord]]' conferences with [[John R. Rice]] and his own annual \"Pastors School\". The school continues to attract as many as seven thousand annual visitors to the Hammond area.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zabroski | first = Steve | year = 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414133420/http://nwitimes.com/articles/1997/10/04/export247369.txt|archivedate=April 14, 2009|url = http://nwitimes.com/articles/2006/03/24/news/lake_county/2970eb71e3fc94308625713b0014b869.txt | title = Faithful flock to Hammond | work = [[Northwest Indiana Times]] | accessdate = March 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles wrote approximately fifty works in his lifetime with over 14 million total copies in circulation, including the popular ''Is There A Hell?'', based on a sermon he preached at a National Sword of the Lord Conference.<ref name=\"Janega\" />  Another work, ''Enemies of Soul Winning'' tackled many issues considered controversial in fundamentalist and evangelical circles, which include the doctrine of repentance, [[Lordship salvation]], and the role of the church in soul winning. The ''Calvary Contender'' wrote, \"Hyles will be remembered as a one-of-a-kind, ever controversial leader whose ministry touched the lives of multitudes.\"<ref>{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | title = Jack Hyles Succumbs To Heart Attack | work = [[Calvary Contender]] | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060512171223/http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-1-2001.html | archivedate = May 12, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nHyles was better known as \"Brother Hyles\" to his tens of thousands of congregants.<ref name=\"Janega\" />\n\nHyles often held nationwide speaking engagements. In 1984, for instance, he addressed a large gathering in the small city of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]], Texas, the seat of [[Scurry County, Texas|Scurry County]], hosted by pastor Luther Wallace \"Buck\" Hatfield (1929\u20131995) of Faith Baptist Church. Independent Baptists from throughout the area, such as Ross J. Spencer from Bethany Baptist Church in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], organized bus trips to the convention hall in Snyder. Hatfield and Spencer also adapted the bus ministry approach for their congregations.\n\nIn his book, ''Enemies of Soulwinning'', Hyles taught that one could not be born again unless the [[King James Version]] was used somewhere along the line in that person's life.<ref>''Enemies of Soulwinning'' by Jack Hyles, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> He did not teach [[Landmarkism]]/[[Baptist successionism]] (the belief that the Baptist church is the original church), but did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at [[Pentecost]]), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in AD 313.<ref name=\"landmark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Printed%20Books/Dr%20Jack%20Hyles/The%20Church/fundamental_baptist_church-chap_23.htm|title=What Is a Fundamental Baptist Church?}}</ref>\n\n=== Honors, award, and praise ===\nIn contrast to the criticism, Hyles has been the recipient of praise, an honorary doctorate, and other accolades throughout the course of his life, even continuing past his death. The ''Washington Post'' compared the \"meek\" preaching style of [[Jerry Falwell]] to the \"spit and fire\" of Hyles. The Post suggested that after you heard a preacher like Hyles, \"you knew that you'd been preached to\".<ref>Harrington, Walt. \"What Hath Falwell Wrought?\" ''Washington Post'', July 24, 1988, p. W19.</ref> Falwell said that \"Hyles will be remembered as a leader in evangelism through the local church.\"  Falwell also said, \"He inspired me as a young pastor to win others to Christ through Sunday school, the pulpit, and personal witnessing.

{"title_page": "History of Poland", "text_new": "{{short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{History of Poland}}\nThe '''history of [[Poland]]''' ({{lang-pl|Historia Polski}}) represents over 1,000 years of recorded historical events as well as 500,000 years of human activity on Polish soil. An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]].

The [[Greater Poland uprising (1846)|Greater Poland uprising]] ended in a fiasco in early 1846. In the [[Krak\u00f3w uprising]] of February 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow]] into the Austrian Partition. The Austrian officials took advantage of peasant discontent and incited villagers against the noble-dominated insurgent units. This resulted in the [[Galician slaughter]] of 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> a large-scale rebellion of [[serfdom|serf]]s seeking relief from their post-feudal condition of [[Serfdom in Poland|mandatory labor]] as practiced in ''[[folwark]]s''. The uprising freed many from bondage and hastened decisions that led to the [[abolition of serfdom in Poland|abolition of Polish serfdom]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1848. A new wave of Polish involvement in revolutionary movements soon took place in the partitions and in other parts of Europe in the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] revolutions of 1848 (e.g. [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]'s participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions in Austria]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]]). The 1848 [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|German revolutions]] precipitated the [[Greater Poland uprising (1848)|Greater Poland uprising of 1848]],<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> in which peasants in the Prussian Partition, who were by then largely enfranchised, played a prominent role.<ref name=\"Gierowski 232\u2013287\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=232\u2013287}}.</ref>\n\n====The Uprising of January 1863====\n\n[[File:Romuald Traugutt 111.PNG|thumb|upright|right|[[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]]]]\n\nAs a matter of continuous policy, the Russian autocracy kept assailing Polish national core values of language, religion and culture.<ref name=\"Burant 131\u2013156\">{{Harvnb|Burant|1985|pp=131\u2013156}}.</ref> In consequence, despite the limited liberalization measures allowed in [[Congress Poland]] under the rule of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], a renewal of popular liberation activities took place in 1860\u20131861. During large-scale demonstrations in Warsaw, Russian forces inflicted numerous casualties on the civilian participants. The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The \"[[Whites (January Uprising)|White]]\", or [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] faction, was inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities and countered with partial reform proposals. In order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], the conservative leader of the government of Congress Poland, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army in the years 1862 and 1863.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> This action hastened the outbreak of hostilities. The [[January Uprising]], joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelmingly advantaged enemy. The uprising lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> when [[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the insurgency, was captured by the tsarist police.<ref name=\"Gierowski 287\u2013311\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=287\u2013311}}.</ref><ref name=\"Biel, czerwie\u0144, czer\u0144\">{{Harvnb|Zdrada|2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, compelled by the uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published an [[Abolition of serfdom in Poland|enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland]] along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents. The act created the conditions necessary for the development of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system on central Polish lands.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government. The [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (an [[academy of sciences]]) was founded in Krak\u00f3w in 1872.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/>\n\nSocial activities termed \"[[organic work]]\" consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and work on improving the competitiveness of Polish-owned businesses, industrial, agricultural or other. New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities. Such activities were most pronounced in the Prussian Partition.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref>\n\n[[Positivism in Poland]] replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=182\u2013187}}.</ref><ref name=\"Lukowski 192\u2013194\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=192\u2013194}}.</ref> It reflected the ideals and values of the emerging urban [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=66\u201367}}.</ref> Around 1890, the urban classes gradually abandoned the positivist ideas and came under the influence of modern pan-European [[nationalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=297\u2013298}}.</ref>\n\n====Economic development and social change====\n\n[[File:Gierymski Feast of trumpets I.jpg|thumb|right|Many [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]] emigrated from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but most remained to form a large [[Minority group|ethnic minority]]]]\n\nUnder the partitioning powers, economic diversification and progress, including large-scale [[industrialisation]], were introduced in the traditionally agrarian Polish lands, but this development turned out to be very uneven. Advanced agriculture was practiced in the Prussian Partition, except for [[Upper Silesia]], where the coal-mining industry created a large labor force. The densest network of railroads was built in German-ruled western Poland. In Russian Congress Poland, a striking growth of industry, railways and towns took place, all against the background of an extensive, but less productive agriculture.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=187\u2013192, 199}}.</ref> The industrial initiative, capital and know-how were provided largely by entrepreneurs who were not ethnic Poles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|p=294}}.</ref> Warsaw (a metallurgical center) and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (a textiles center) grew rapidly, as did the total proportion of urban population, making the region the most economically advanced in the Russian Empire (industrial production exceeded agricultural production there by 1909). The coming of the railways spurred some industrial growth even in the vast Russian Partition territories outside of Congress Poland. The Austrian Partition was rural and poor, except for the industrialized [[Cieszyn Silesia]] area. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad. Millions of residents of the former Commonwealth of various [[ethnic group]]s worked or settled in Europe and in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nSocial and economic changes were partial and gradual. The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n\n[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]  [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|in Poland]]|thumb|left]]\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

The revolt was part of much broader disturbances throughout the Russian Empire associated with the general [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]. In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition. Ethnically Polish settlement spread over a large area further to the east, including its greatest concentration in the [[Vilnius Region]], amounted to only over 20% of that number.<ref name=\"Lukowski 208\u2013216\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=208\u2013216}}.</ref>\n \nPolish paramilitary organizations oriented toward independence, such as the [[Union of Active Struggle]], were formed in 1908\u20131914, mainly in Galicia.

All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.  Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary units stationed in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] in 1914 and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Pi\u0142sudski, who refused demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=217\u2013222}}.</ref><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005b|pp=279\u2013290}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy Paderewski 02.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] was a pianist and a statesman]]\n\nDue to a series of German victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the area of [[Congress Poland]] became occupied by the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria;<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915.

In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities.

An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens of [[Untermensch|different faiths or identities]] perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and [[Holocaust|extermination]]. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[satellite state|satellite]] [[communism|communist]] country under Soviet influence, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[Planned economy|communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989\u2013present)|modern Polish state]], the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Prehistory and protohistory==\n\n{{further|Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|Poland in the Early Middle Ages}}\n\n[[File:Biskupin_brama_od_wewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], 8th century BC]]\n\nIn [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times, over a period of at least 500,000 years, the area of present-day Poland was intermittently inhabited by members of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]''.

The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government.

New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education.

[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad. Millions of residents of the former Commonwealth of various [[ethnic group]]s worked or settled in Europe and in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nSocial and economic changes were partial and gradual. The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n\n[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]  [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|in Poland]]|thumb|left]]\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

The revolt was part of much broader disturbances throughout the Russian Empire associated with the general [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]. In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition. Ethnically Polish settlement spread over a large area further to the east, including its greatest concentration in the [[Vilnius Region]], amounted to only over 20% of that number.<ref name=\"Lukowski 208\u2013216\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=208\u2013216}}.</ref>\n \nPolish paramilitary organizations oriented toward independence, such as the [[Union of Active Struggle]], were formed in 1908\u20131914, mainly in Galicia.

All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.  Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary units stationed in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] in 1914 and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Pi\u0142sudski, who refused demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=217\u2013222}}.</ref><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005b|pp=279\u2013290}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy Paderewski 02.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] was a pianist and a statesman]]\n\nDue to a series of German victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the area of [[Congress Poland]] became occupied by the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria;<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915.

This increasingly autonomous puppet state existed until November 1918, when it was replaced by the newly established [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]]. The existence of this \"kingdom\" and its planned Polish army had a positive effect on the Polish national efforts on the [[Triple Entente|Allied side]], but in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] of March 1918 the victorious in the east [[German Empire|Germany]] imposed harsh conditions on defeated Russia and ignored Polish interests.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\"/><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\"/><ref name=\"Versailles\">{{Harvnb|Henig|2011}}.</ref> Toward the end of the war, the German authorities engaged in massive, purposeful devastation of industrial and other economic potential of Polish lands in order to impoverish the country, a likely future competitor of Germany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|p=276}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Polish Regents 1916.jpg|thumb|left|The Regency Council of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1918.

There was also a 30,000-men strong Polish anti-German army in Russia. Dmowski, operating from Paris as head of the [[Polish National Committee (1917\u201319)|Polish National Committee]] (KNP), became the spokesman for Polish nationalism in the Allied camp.

According to the language criterion of the [[Polish census of 1931]], the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the [[Yiddish]] language) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of [[Ukrainian language]] schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\nThe population grew steadily, reaching 35 million in 1939. However, the overall economic situation in the interwar period was one of [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. There was little money for investment inside Poland, and few foreigners were interested in investing there.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> Total industrial production barely increased between 1913 and 1939 (within the area delimited by the 1939 borders), but because of population growth (from 26.3 million in 1919 to 34.8 million in 1939),<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> the ''per capita'' output actually decreased by 18%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=360}}.</ref>\n\nConditions in the predominant agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, which resulted in rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities. It was firmly repressed by the authorities. According to [[Norman Davies]], the failures of the Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses by the end of the 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more repressive regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\n===Final Sanation years (1935\u20131939)===\n\n[[File:Sk\u0142adkowski premierem.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A year after Pi\u0142sudski's death, his former personal assistant General [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]] became the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s last prime minister]]\n\nAfter Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935, Poland was governed until (and initially during) the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of 1939]] by old allies and subordinates known as \"[[Pi\u0142sudski's colonels]]\".

Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders. Elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed little upward social mobility.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V. Koos, ''The Junior College Movement'' (1924).</ref> By the 1960s they were renamed as \"community colleges.\"\n\nJunior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

Completing each course to the schools satisfaction gains the student a number of credits. To enter tertiary education the student will be doing a number of [[Advanced placement]] courses that will gain the highest number of credits. A student graduates from High School when the minimum number of credits has been achieved, and will be accepted by a college when their required number is achieved. The college system is similar: each course passed earns a set number of credits, and the student graduates with an undergraduate degree when the set number have been earned. The credits travel with the student should they change institution. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}} <!-- This is a paragraph that is needed for non-US to follow the rest of the article- but it must be corrected by someone in the US-->\n\n===Universities===\n[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Anselm College]], a [[New England]] liberal arts college]]\nUniversities are educational institutions with undergraduate and graduate programs.

Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders. Elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed little upward social mobility.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V. Koos, ''The Junior College Movement'' (1924).</ref> By the 1960s they were renamed as \"community colleges.\"\n\nJunior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

To enter tertiary education the student will be doing a number of [[Advanced placement]] courses that will gain the highest number of credits.

Some students, rather than being rejected, are \"wait-listed\" for a particular college and may be admitted if another student who was admitted decides not to attend the college or university.

Additionally, the first tier is characterized by selective participation, since only the elite programs in their sport are able to participate; some colleges offer [[athletic scholarship]]s to intercollegiate sports competitors. The second tier includes [[intramural]] and recreational sports clubs, which are available to more of the student body. Competition between student clubs from different colleges, not organized by and therefore not representing the institutions or their faculties, may also be called \"intercollegiate\" athletics or simply college sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosandich|first=Thomas|title=Collegiate Sports Programs: A Comparative Analysis|page=476|publisher=Education|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe largest collegiate sport governing body in the first tier is the NCAA, which regulates athletes of 1,268 institutions across the US and Canada.

Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== Pedagogical Characteristics ==\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b, d g>2 <a d fis> <b d g>1\t\t \n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <3>2 <5 _+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Compound Cadence ===\nA compound cadence is when, above \u2464, one makes a dissonance of a 4th prepared by the 8ve of \u2460 and resolved to the major 3rd of \u2464.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                 \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n              << { g2~ g4 fis }  \\\\ { d2 d }  \\\\ \\\\ { s2 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a2 } \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 b2 >> |\n              < b d g >1  |\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                     <3>2 <5 4>4 <_+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Double Cadence ===\nA double cadence is when, above \u2464, one puts the major 3rd and 5th, the 6th and 4th, the 5th and 4th, and then the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                 \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 45 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n              <b d g>1 | << {fis'4 g~ g fis} \\\\ {s2 d} \\\\ {\\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 d4 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 d s2} \\\\ {s2 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a} \\\\ {\\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a4 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 b s2}  >> |\n              < b d g >1  |\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                     <3>1 <5 _+>4 <6 4> <5 4> <5 _+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g1 d g,\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n== Rule of the Octave ==\n\nAfter learning cadences, students at the Neapolitan conservatories were immediately taught the Rule of the Octave.

That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b, d g>2 <a d fis> <b d g>1\t\t \n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <3>2 <5 _+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Compound Cadence ===\nA compound cadence is when, above \u2464, one makes a dissonance of a 4th prepared by the 8ve of \u2460 and resolved to the major 3rd of \u2464.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                 \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n              << { g2~ g4 fis }  \\\\ { d2 d }  \\\\ \\\\ { s2 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a2 } \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 b2 >> |\n              < b d g >1  |\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                     <3>2 <5 4>4 <_+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g2 d g,1\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n=== Double Cadence ===\nA double cadence is when, above \u2464, one puts the major 3rd and 5th, the 6th and 4th, the 5th and 4th, and then the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                 \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 50 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n              <b d g>1 | << {fis'4 g~ g fis} \\\\ {s2 d} \\\\ {\\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 d4 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 d s2} \\\\ {s2 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a} \\\\ {\\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 a4 \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 b s2}  >> |\n              < b d g >1  |\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                     <3>1 <5 _+>4 <6 4> <5 4> <5 _+> <3>1\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g1 d g,\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n== Rule of the Octave ==\n\nAfter learning cadences, students at the Neapolitan conservatories were immediately taught the Rule of the Octave.

He holds the [[Peter C. Doherty]] Endowed Chair of Immunology in [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. His research has focused on the process of active [[cell death]] and cell survival, extending from the role of cell death in cancer regulation and [[immune responses]] in the whole organism to the molecular events directing the death of the cell. Green is editor in chief of the journal ''[[Oncogene (journal)|Oncogene]]'' and the author of  the book ''Cell Death, Means To An End''.\n\n==Education ==\n\nGreen attended high school in Ashland, MA. He graduated [[magna cum laude]] from the [[Yale University]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Biology and Distinction in Biology in 1977. After training at [[MIT]] during 1977 and 1978, he graduated in 1981 with a [[PhD]] from Yale University, where he studied immunology with [[Richard K. Gershon]].\n\nGreen joined the faculty at the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton in 1985.<ref name=iuis>{{cite web|url=https://iuis2019.org/major-symposium-speaker-douglas-green/ |accessdate=11 July 2019 |title=Major Symposium Speaker: Douglas Green |publisher=International Congress of Immunology}}</ref>.

He holds the [[Peter C. Doherty]] Endowed Chair of Immunology in [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. His research has focused on the process of active [[cell death]] and cell survival, extending from the role of cell death in cancer regulation and [[immune responses]] in the whole organism to the molecular events directing the death of the cell. Green is editor in chief of the journal ''[[Oncogene (journal)|Oncogene]]'' and the author of  the book ''Cell Death, Means To An End''.\n\n==Education ==\n\nGreen attended high school in Ashland, MA. He graduated [[magna cum laude]] from the [[Yale University]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Biology and Distinction in Biology in 1977. After training at [[MIT]] during 1977 and 1978, he graduated in 1981 with a [[PhD]] from Yale University, where he studied immunology with [[Richard K. Gershon]].\n\nGreen joined the faculty at the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton in 1985.<ref name=iuis>{{cite web|url=https://iuis2019.org/major-symposium-speaker-douglas-green/ |accessdate=11 July 2019 |title=Major Symposium Speaker: Douglas Green |publisher=International Congress of Immunology}}</ref>.

Movie Central was designated to operate west of the [[Ontario]]-[[Manitoba]] border, including the [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories of Canada|territories]]. Although the channel's name implies that it focuses solely on theatrically released [[feature film|motion pictures]], Movie Central's programming included original and foreign [[television series]], [[television movie|made-for-cable movies]] and [[documentary|documentaries]].\n\nMovie Central was carried by various Canadian [[cable television|cable]], [[IPTV]], and [[satellite television]] providers in [[Western Canada]] including [[Bell TV]], [[Shaw Direct]], [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]], [[Access Communications]], [[Telus TV|Telus Optik TV]] and [[Westman Communications Group]], among other providers. Its programming was comparable to that of [[The Movie Network]] (TMN), a separately owned pay service which is marketed to Eastern Canada, in areas located east of the Ontario-Manitoba border. Movie Central was headquartered at the [[Corus Quay]] building in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], alongside Corus's other television properties, despite that city being located outside the service's territory.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Corus announced that it would shut down Movie Central and sister service [[Encore Avenue]] in order to focus on its specialty television services. [[The Movie Network]], which previously held a regional monopoly in Eastern Canada, subsequently expanded into the West to become a national service. TMN owner [[Bell Media]] made a payment of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]211 million to Corus for its services in transitioning MC subscribers to TMN.\n==History==\nIn 1982, the CRTC licensed Canada's first national pay television services. The commission licensed one national general-interest service \u2013 [[The Movie Network#History|First Choice]] \u2013 as well as a number of short-lived niche channels, and several regional general-interest channels.\n\nAllarcom Pay Television, owned by [[Charles Allard]], was initially granted the regional concession for [[Alberta]]. However, by the time Allarcom's service, '''Superchannel''', launched on February 1, 1983, Allarcom had apparently also gained control of a second regional channel, [[Ontario]] Independent Pay Television.<ref>\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MCHEJNzWvM The Launch of SUPERCHANNEL]\", [[YouTube]] video, retrieved December 15, 2007. The video shows distinct feeds for \"ONT Program\" and \"ALTA Program\" launching at different times.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Superchannel-paytv.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Early version of the Superchannel logo (used from 1983 to 1984), a later version of the logo showed the words 'First Choice' in the star.]]\nBy January 1984, Superchannel had received approval to expand its service area to [[Saskatchewan]] (replacing Teletheatre, a province-wide pay-cable network that had been operating since the late 1970s), [[Manitoba]], and what is now the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]].<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/DB84-1.htm ARCHIVED -  Decision CRTC 84-1]</ref> Allarcom also took control of [[AIM Pay-Tv Corp.|Aim Satellite Broadcasting]] (serving [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]]) and provided the Superchannel feed in those markets on an \"interim\" basis while Aim could establish its own service.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/DB84-2.htm ARCHIVED -  Decision CRTC 84-2]</ref>\n\nBy the spring of 1984, it became clear that the remaining pay service operators were continuing to post substantial monetary losses. In August, AIM and OIPT were merged into Allarcom's operations, and the resulting channel exited the Ontario market. Meanwhile, the formerly national service First Choice agreed to serve only Ontario, [[Quebec]] and [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/DB84-654.HTM ARCHIVED -  Decision CRTC 84-654]</ref> As part of their agreement, Allarcom and First Choice agreed to jointly market their services under the name '''First Choice Superchannel''', in which the Superchannel \"star\" branding was predominant. This practice continued until 1989, at which point the \"First Choice\" name remained in the east and \"Superchannel\" was [[dividing territories|restricted to the west]]. With the respective launches of [[The Sports Network]] and [[MuchMusic]] in September 1984, Superchannel reduced the amount of sports programming and concert specials that it broadcast, and converted to a predominantly [[film|movie]]-based service, as did First Choice.\n\nAllarcom was later acquired by [[Western International Communications]], which launched a parallel classic movie service, [[Encore Avenue|MovieMax!]], in the Superchannel service area in October 1994. Originally featuring movies from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the channel's programming later expanded to include older movies (its licence actually allows the channel to air movies that were released more than five years from the present year). When [[digital cable]] and satellite television became available in the 1990s, Superchannel 2 and Superchannel 3 were launched (which were essentially [[timeshift channel|timeshifted]] versions of Superchannel 1 on respective two- and four-hour delays), along with MovieMax! 2, which was available on satellite only (operating as a two-hour delayed feed of MovieMax!). During its years under WIC ownership, there was a noticeable difference in programming quality between the WIC services and their eastern counterparts, due largely to a 1996 lawsuit against [[HBO]] for allegedly promoting the grey-market availability of U.S.-based [[satellite television]] providers. WIC was at the time also a significant shareholder in domestic satellite provider ExpressVu (now [[Bell TV]]). In retaliation, HBO refused to license any of its programmes to Superchannel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://print.google.com/print/doc?articleid=iNEERuzZfMB |title=http://print.google.com/print/doc?articleid=iNEERuzZfMB }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Movie Central.png|thumb|150px|Former Movie Central logo, used from 2001 to 2006.]]\nThe duelling takeover bids for, and eventual split of, WIC resulted in Superchannel and MovieMax! being transferred to [[Corus Entertainment]], which settled the HBO lawsuit and began to license programmes such as ''[[The Sopranos]]''. On April 1, 2001, Superchannel and MovieMax! were rebranded under the umbrella brand Movie Central, which consisted of six diverse channels, most of which utilized a common street-themed branding scheme: Movie Central, Adrenaline Drive (focusing on action movies), Heartland Road (focusing on romance films), Shadow Lane (focusing on horror and suspense films), Encore Avenue (focusing on classic movies), and Comic Strip (focusing on comedy films).\n\nOn March 1, 2006, the sub-brands were dropped due to confusion among subscribers regarding the meanings of the channel's names; four of the channels remained under the Movie Central brand (but using numbered names rather than a combination of the parent network's name and a sub-brand, a common naming scheme for North American premium television services), and the two remaining channels became Encore Avenue, each of which were diverse in their schedules. The Encore Avenue channels adopted a format of films from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, possibly due to the introduction of [[Turner Classic Movies]] in Canada.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Corus announced that as a result of a strategic review, it decided to exit the pay TV business in order to concentrate on its national specialty channels, and would discontinue Movie Central and Encore Avenue.

In addition to its main channel, Movie Central also operated high definition simulcast feeds of its two Movie Central-branded multiplex channels and HBO Canada. In December 2004, Movie Central launched its first high definition channel called Movie Central HD, which delivered  simulcasted content from Movie Central's various multiplex channels, excluding Encore Avenue and Encore Avenue 2. In 2006, Movie Central launched its second HD simulcast feed, Movie Central 2 HD, which delivered an alternative schedule of HD content from Movie Central HD.

HBO Canada operated as a separate SVOD service, '''HBO Canada On Demand''', providing feature films along with series content from American premium service [[HBO]]; it was available to subscribers of Movie Central on most providers at no additional cost. Movie Central On Demand's rotating program selection incorporates select new titles that were added each Friday, alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks.\n\n====TV Everywhere====\nMovie Central did not have a cross-provider [[TV Everywhere]] service for online and mobile streaming similar to [[HBO GO]] or [[The Movie Network#The Movie Network GO|TMN GO]]. However, selected service providers offered this content through their own apps: [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]] offered a dedicated \"Shaw Go \u2013 Movie Central\" app for this purpose,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/shaw-go-movie-central/id559526942?mt=8|title = Shaw Go Movie Central on the App Store on iTunes|date = |accessdate = October 5, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> while [[Bell TV]] and [[Telus TV|Telus Optik TV]] made Movie Central content available through their respective omnibus TV Everywhere apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/optik-on-the-go/id467259446?mt=8|title = Optik\u2122 on the go on the App Store on iTunes|date = |accessdate = October 5, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/bell-tv/id353830087?mt=8|title = Bell TV on the App Store on iTunes|date = |accessdate = October 5, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nMovie Central offered an extensive variety of first-run [[films]] and [[television series]], most of which come from the American premium television services [[HBO]], [[Cinemax]] and [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], as well as critically acclaimed original Canadian series, most of which were co-produced in partnership with The Movie Network. A selected time block on the channel called '''Metro''', aired [[independent film|independent]], [[short film|short]], [[film festival|festival]], foreign, and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] films, [[documentary film|documentaries]] and original programming.\n\nFilms typically debuted on Movie Central within a lag of between 10 and 12 months on average from their initial theatrical release, three to six months after their initial release on [[pay-per-view]] services and over 1\u00bd years before their network television or basic cable debuts. Sports coverage was permitted, but in such limited amounts that it is rarely seen, in contrast to HBO and Showtime.\n\n===Movie library===\n{{expand section|include information on film studios to which Movie Central holds distribution rights to televise movies, listed in a prose form|date=August 2013}}\n\n===List of programs broadcast by Movie Central and HBO Canada===\n\n====Original programming====\n*''[[Call Me Fitz]]''\n*''[[Less Than Kind]]''\n*''Transporter''\n*''[[Rogue_(TV_series)|Rogue]]''\n*''Funny as Hell''\n*''[[Sensitive Skin (Canadian TV series)|Sensitive Skin]]''\n*''[[Reelside]]''\n\n====Acquired programming====\n*''[[Game of Thrones]]''\n*''[[True Blood]]''\n*''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''\n*''[[Masters of Sex]]''\n*''[[Shameless (U.S. TV series)|Shameless]]''\n*''[[House of Lies]]''\n*''[[Episodes (TV series)|Episodes]]''\n*''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''\n*''[[Nurse Jackie]]''\n*''[[Ray Donovan]]''\n*''[[Banshee (TV series)|Banshee]]''\n*''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''\n*''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]''\n*''[[Strike Back (TV series)|Strike Back]]''\n\n==Duopoly issue==\nFor many years, the ''de facto'' [[monopoly|twin regional monopolies]] of The Movie Network and Movie Central have been criticised. At the time, no other similar premium services had broadcast within Canada. Critics argued that this limited competition and consumer choice, while proponents said that there was very little in content or functionality that was not already offered by the existing services.\n\nIn July 2005, the CRTC, the Canadian federal broadcast regulator, announced that public hearings would begin on October 24 of that year on four applications for new national pay television licences from different groups. Each applicant claimed that they would commit to invest and develop more [[Canadian content|Canadian-produced programming content]]. On May 18, 2006, the CRTC announced that had accepted an application by Allarco Entertainment, while the other three were rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2006/db2006-193.htm |title=CRTC Decision 2006-193 |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}</ref>Watch free movie online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ww1.0123movie.net/|title=123movies |publisher=ww1.0123movie.net/|date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref>This approved application effectively ended The Movie Network/Movie Central duopoly in Canada.

Movie Central was designated to operate west of the [[Ontario]]-[[Manitoba]] border, including the [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories of Canada|territories]]. Although the channel's name implies that it focuses solely on theatrically released [[feature film|motion pictures]], Movie Central's programming included original and foreign [[television series]], [[television movie|made-for-cable movies]] and [[documentary|documentaries]].\n\nMovie Central was carried by various Canadian [[cable television|cable]], [[IPTV]], and [[satellite television]] providers in [[Western Canada]] including [[Bell TV]], [[Shaw Direct]], [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]], [[Access Communications]], [[Telus TV|Telus Optik TV]] and [[Westman Communications Group]], among other providers. Its programming was comparable to that of [[The Movie Network]] (TMN), a separately owned pay service which is marketed to Eastern Canada, in areas located east of the Ontario-Manitoba border. Movie Central was headquartered at the [[Corus Quay]] building in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], alongside Corus's other television properties, despite that city being located outside the service's territory.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Corus announced that it would shut down Movie Central and sister service [[Encore Avenue]] in order to focus on its specialty television services. [[The Movie Network]], which previously held a regional monopoly in Eastern Canada, subsequently expanded into the West to become a national service. TMN owner [[Bell Media]] made a payment of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]211 million to Corus for its services in transitioning MC subscribers to TMN.\n==History==\nIn 1982, the CRTC licensed Canada's first national pay television services. The commission licensed one national general-interest service \u2013 [[The Movie Network#History|First Choice]] \u2013 as well as a number of short-lived niche channels, and several regional general-interest channels.\n\nAllarcom Pay Television, owned by [[Charles Allard]], was initially granted the regional concession for [[Alberta]]. However, by the time Allarcom's service, '''Superchannel''', launched on February 1, 1983, Allarcom had apparently also gained control of a second regional channel, [[Ontario]] Independent Pay Television.<ref>\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MCHEJNzWvM The Launch of SUPERCHANNEL]\", [[YouTube]] video, retrieved December 15, 2007. The video shows distinct feeds for \"ONT Program\" and \"ALTA Program\" launching at different times.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Superchannel-paytv.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Early version of the Superchannel logo (used from 1983 to 1984), a later version of the logo showed the words 'First Choice' in the star.]]\nBy January 1984, Superchannel had received approval to expand its service area to [[Saskatchewan]] (replacing Teletheatre, a province-wide pay-cable network that had been operating since the late 1970s), [[Manitoba]], and what is now the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]].<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/DB84-1.htm ARCHIVED -  Decision CRTC 84-1]</ref> Allarcom also took control of [[AIM Pay-Tv Corp.|Aim Satellite Broadcasting]] (serving [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]]) and provided the Superchannel feed in those markets on an \"interim\" basis while Aim could establish its own service.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/DB84-2.htm ARCHIVED -  Decision CRTC 84-2]</ref>\n\nBy the spring of 1984, it became clear that the remaining pay service operators were continuing to post substantial monetary losses. In August, AIM and OIPT were merged into Allarcom's operations, and the resulting channel exited the Ontario market. Meanwhile, the formerly national service First Choice agreed to serve only Ontario, [[Quebec]] and [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/DB84-654.HTM ARCHIVED -  Decision CRTC 84-654]</ref> As part of their agreement, Allarcom and First Choice agreed to jointly market their services under the name '''First Choice Superchannel''', in which the Superchannel \"star\" branding was predominant. This practice continued until 1989, at which point the \"First Choice\" name remained in the east and \"Superchannel\" was [[dividing territories|restricted to the west]]. With the respective launches of [[The Sports Network]] and [[MuchMusic]] in September 1984, Superchannel reduced the amount of sports programming and concert specials that it broadcast, and converted to a predominantly [[film|movie]]-based service, as did First Choice.\n\nAllarcom was later acquired by [[Western International Communications]], which launched a parallel classic movie service, [[Encore Avenue|MovieMax!]], in the Superchannel service area in October 1994. Originally featuring movies from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the channel's programming later expanded to include older movies (its licence actually allows the channel to air movies that were released more than five years from the present year). When [[digital cable]] and satellite television became available in the 1990s, Superchannel 2 and Superchannel 3 were launched (which were essentially [[timeshift channel|timeshifted]] versions of Superchannel 1 on respective two- and four-hour delays), along with MovieMax! 2, which was available on satellite only (operating as a two-hour delayed feed of MovieMax!). During its years under WIC ownership, there was a noticeable difference in programming quality between the WIC services and their eastern counterparts, due largely to a 1996 lawsuit against [[HBO]] for allegedly promoting the grey-market availability of U.S.-based [[satellite television]] providers. WIC was at the time also a significant shareholder in domestic satellite provider ExpressVu (now [[Bell TV]]). In retaliation, HBO refused to license any of its programmes to Superchannel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://print.google.com/print/doc?articleid=iNEERuzZfMB |title=http://print.google.com/print/doc?articleid=iNEERuzZfMB }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Movie Central.png|thumb|150px|Former Movie Central logo, used from 2001 to 2006.]]\nThe duelling takeover bids for, and eventual split of, WIC resulted in Superchannel and MovieMax! being transferred to [[Corus Entertainment]], which settled the HBO lawsuit and began to license programmes such as ''[[The Sopranos]]''. On April 1, 2001, Superchannel and MovieMax! were rebranded under the umbrella brand Movie Central, which consisted of six diverse channels, most of which utilized a common street-themed branding scheme: Movie Central, Adrenaline Drive (focusing on action movies), Heartland Road (focusing on romance films), Shadow Lane (focusing on horror and suspense films), Encore Avenue (focusing on classic movies), and Comic Strip (focusing on comedy films).\n\nOn March 1, 2006, the sub-brands were dropped due to confusion among subscribers regarding the meanings of the channel's names; four of the channels remained under the Movie Central brand (but using numbered names rather than a combination of the parent network's name and a sub-brand, a common naming scheme for North American premium television services), and the two remaining channels became Encore Avenue, each of which were diverse in their schedules. The Encore Avenue channels adopted a format of films from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, possibly due to the introduction of [[Turner Classic Movies]] in Canada.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Corus announced that as a result of a strategic review, it decided to exit the pay TV business in order to concentrate on its national specialty channels, and would discontinue Movie Central and Encore Avenue. It was concurrently announced that [[The Movie Network]] and [[TMN Encore]], now owned by [[Bell Media]] as the successor to the former First Choice, would expand into the Western Canadian markets that were previously served exclusively by Movie Central. Bell took over full ownership of [[HBO Canada]] (a jointly operated multiplex channel of both TMN and Movie Central).

In March 2012, Movie Central launched Movie Central 3 HD, a [[High-definition television|high-definition]] simulcast of its third multiplex channel.\n\n====Movie Central On Demand====\nMovie Central operated a [[video on demand|subscription video-on-demand]] television service called '''Movie Central On Demand''', which is available at no additional charge to new and existing subscribers of Movie Central.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.moviecentral.ca/ondemand|title = How To Access On Demand|date = |accessdate = October 5, 2014|website = Movie Central|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Content featured on the service included films and television series from Movie Central and its four multiplex channels, excluding the two Encore Avenue channels. HBO Canada operated as a separate SVOD service, '''HBO Canada On Demand''', providing feature films along with series content from American premium service [[HBO]]; it was available to subscribers of Movie Central on most providers at no additional cost. Movie Central On Demand's rotating program selection incorporates select new titles that were added each Friday, alongside existing program titles held over from the previous one to two weeks.\n\n====TV Everywhere====\nMovie Central did not have a cross-provider [[TV Everywhere]] service for online and mobile streaming similar to [[HBO GO]] or [[The Movie Network#The Movie Network GO|TMN GO]]. However, selected service providers offered this content through their own apps: [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]] offered a dedicated \"Shaw Go \u2013 Movie Central\" app for this purpose,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/shaw-go-movie-central/id559526942?mt=8|title = Shaw Go Movie Central on the App Store on iTunes|date = |accessdate = October 5, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> while [[Bell TV]] and [[Telus TV|Telus Optik TV]] made Movie Central content available through their respective omnibus TV Everywhere apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/optik-on-the-go/id467259446?mt=8|title = Optik\u2122 on the go on the App Store on iTunes|date = |accessdate = October 5, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/bell-tv/id353830087?mt=8|title = Bell TV on the App Store on iTunes|date = |accessdate = October 5, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nMovie Central offered an extensive variety of first-run [[films]] and [[television series]], most of which come from the American premium television services [[HBO]], [[Cinemax]] and [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], as well as critically acclaimed original Canadian series, most of which were co-produced in partnership with The Movie Network. A selected time block on the channel called '''Metro''', aired [[independent film|independent]], [[short film|short]], [[film festival|festival]], foreign, and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] films, [[documentary film|documentaries]] and original programming.\n\nFilms typically debuted on Movie Central within a lag of between 10 and 12 months on average from their initial theatrical release, three to six months after their initial release on [[pay-per-view]] services and over 1\u00bd years before their network television or basic cable debuts. Sports coverage was permitted, but in such limited amounts that it is rarely seen, in contrast to HBO and Showtime.\n\n===Movie library===\n{{expand section|include information on film studios to which Movie Central holds distribution rights to televise movies, listed in a prose form|date=August 2013}}\n\n===List of programs broadcast by Movie Central and HBO Canada===\n\n====Original programming====\n*''[[Call Me Fitz]]''\n*''[[Less Than Kind]]''\n*''Transporter''\n*''[[Rogue_(TV_series)|Rogue]]''\n*''Funny as Hell''\n*''[[Sensitive Skin (Canadian TV series)|Sensitive Skin]]''\n*''[[Reelside]]''\n\n====Acquired programming====\n*''[[Game of Thrones]]''\n*''[[True Blood]]''\n*''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''\n*''[[Masters of Sex]]''\n*''[[Shameless (U.S. TV series)|Shameless]]''\n*''[[House of Lies]]''\n*''[[Episodes (TV series)|Episodes]]''\n*''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''\n*''[[Nurse Jackie]]''\n*''[[Ray Donovan]]''\n*''[[Banshee (TV series)|Banshee]]''\n*''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''\n*''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]''\n*''[[Strike Back (TV series)|Strike Back]]''\n\n==Duopoly issue==\nFor many years, the ''de facto'' [[monopoly|twin regional monopolies]] of The Movie Network and Movie Central have been criticised. At the time, no other similar premium services had broadcast within Canada. Critics argued that this limited competition and consumer choice, while proponents said that there was very little in content or functionality that was not already offered by the existing services.\n\nIn July 2005, the CRTC, the Canadian federal broadcast regulator, announced that public hearings would begin on October 24 of that year on four applications for new national pay television licences from different groups. Each applicant claimed that they would commit to invest and develop more [[Canadian content|Canadian-produced programming content]]. On May 18, 2006, the CRTC announced that had accepted an application by Allarco Entertainment, while the other three were rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2006/db2006-193.htm |title=CRTC Decision 2006-193 |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}</ref> This approved application effectively ended The Movie Network/Movie Central duopoly in Canada. On November 2, 2007, the new service was launched as [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]].\n\nWith approval for The Movie Network to go national and the discontinuation of the Movie Central service, Canada now has 2-full-time national premium movie services.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n{{Canadian movie channels}}\n{{Canadian premium television services}}\n{{Corus Entertainment}}\n\n[[Category:Defunct Canadian television channels]]\n[[Category:Movie channels in Canada]]\n[[Category:Commercial-free television networks]]\n[[Category:English-language television stations in Canada]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2016]]\n[[Category:Canadian companies established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Former Corus Entertainment subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:ABS-CBN Corporation]]\n", "name_user": "37.111.229.6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDuopoly issue)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_Central"}
