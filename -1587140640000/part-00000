He is also a licensed [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|commercial pilot]] and [[Flight Instructor#United States|flight instructor]].\n\nSeliger is currently a member of the [[National Rifle Association]], the [[Texas Farm Bureau]], and the [[Harley-Davidson]] [[Harley Owners Group|Owners Group]].\n\nSeliger and his wife, the former Nancy Caroline Meredith (born October 11, 1960), reside in Amarillo with their two sons, Jonathan and Matthew.\n\n==Political life==\n\nSeliger served four terms in the [[nonpartisan]] position as  [[mayor]] of Amarillo (1993&ndash;2001). He is also a former city [[commissioner]] and a former member of the Amarillo Civil Service Commission. He also served on former Texas [[Attorney General of Texas|Attorney General]] [[John Cornyn]]'s Municipal Advisory Committee and, in 2002, he was appointed to the [[Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission]] by [[Texas Governor|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]].\n\nSeliger was sworn into the [[Texas]] [[Texas Senate|Senate]] on March 2, 2004, to complete the term of [[Teel Bivins]] of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], who obtained a diplomatic appointment as [[United States Ambassador]] to [[Sweden]] from the administration of [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Seliger was reelected to serve a full, four-year term on November 4, 2004. The district spans twenty-six counties and serves large slices of the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]] and [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], including [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], and [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]]. It is one of the most Republican districts in the state; he has only faced a Democratic opponent once, during his first bid for a full term in 2004.\n\nSeliger is a [[List of members of the American Legislative Exchange Council|member of]] the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), serving as Texas state leader.<ref>http://www.alec.org/about-alec/state-chairmen/</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2016}}\n\nSeliger was appointed by [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]] [[David Dewhurst]] to serve as Vice-Chair of the Criminal Justice Committee for the [[Seventy-ninth Texas Legislature]]. In addition, he was appointed to the Natural Resources, International Relations and Trade, and Administration Committees.\n\nSeliger filed and sponsored over seventy-five [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]], fifty of which were passed in one form or another during the regular session of the 79th Legislature. As the vice chairman of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, Senator Seliger passed House Bill 2577 requiring local [[Police|law enforcement agencies]] to report to the state the reason for a [[peace officer]]'s termination to protect the integrity of the state's law enforcement officers. This legislation prevents those peace officers with a history of poor performance or unethical behavior, termed \"[[gypsy cop]]s,\" from taking advantage of police departments that lack the resources to investigate their employment history.\n\nSeliger's membership on the Senate Natural Resources Committee aided him in passing several important bills for [[West Texas]]. House Bill 2161 ensures that effective pipeline safety standards are in place for all construction work around [[Pipeline transport|oil and gas pipelines]]. It also establishes a program to address abandoned or orphaned [[Oil well|oil and gas wells]] and includes considerations for potential future periods of decline in [[Price of petroleum|oil and gas prices]]. Additionally, House Bill 951 will establish a notice and remediation process for construction around pipelines.\n\nThe Texas Municipal League presented Seliger with its 2005 Distinguished Legislative Service Award for his dedication to protecting and promoting local control. He also received the 2005 Rural Legislator of the Year Award from the Association of Rural Communities in Texas.\n\nSeliger won re-nomination to a full four-year term in the state Senate in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He defeated attorney and former Midland Mayor Michael Jackson \"Mike\" Canon, Sr. (born 1946), 36,623 (52.4 percent) to 33,223 (47.6 percent).<ref name=electionreturns>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=8866&id=965 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140305183835/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=8866&id=965 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 5, 2014 |title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014 |publisher=team1.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nSeliger is a moderate Republican by Texas standards. He is considered one of the most moderate of the twenty (as of 2015) Texas Senate Republicans, along with [[Kevin Eltife]] of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], according to an analysis by Mark P. Jones of the political science department at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. Jones also found that these Republicans saw passage of 90 percent of the bills for which they voted.\n\nIn February 2015, Seliger filed proposed legislation backed by many school districts that a graduation committee be appointed for each pupil who twice fails an end-of-course assessment. With a unanimous committee vote, the student would be allowed to graduate from high school. The committee would consist of a principal, counselor, teacher, and parent and would consider course grades, standardized test scores, and regularity of attendance as factors to permit graduation in such situations. A. Marcus Nelson, superintendent of the [[Laredo Independent School District]] endorsed Seliger's bill, which he said would impact 172 pupils in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] who have twice failed the end-of-course assessments. \"We need to find the right balance in the number of assessments and the accountability that goes with it,\" Nelson said.<ref>Judith Rayo, \"Senate Bill 149: State exit exams eyed; More students could graduate\", ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', February 26, 2015, pp. 1, 14A</ref>\n\nSeliger is the recipient of the Bell Helicopter 2012 Legislative Leadership Award, the Texas Municipal League's 2011 Legislator of the Year, the Texas District and County Attorneys Association's 2009 Law and Order Award, Legislator of the Year 2009 from the Associated Security Services and Investigators of the State of Texas and the citizens of Odessa honored him with the 2009 Heritage of Odessa Foundation Community Statesman Award in Government.<ref name=\"senatorbio\"/>\n\nIn the [[general election]] held on November 6, 2018, Seliger handily prevailed over his only opponent, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] Jack B . Westbrook, 171,831 votes (87.5 percent) to 24,458 (12.5 percent). No Democrat sought the seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov06_331_state.htm?x=0&y=0&id=545|title=Election Returns|date=November 6, 2018|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110200011/https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov06_331_state.htm?x=0&y=0&id=545|archive-date=November 10, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nSeliger's status as a [[Rockefeller Republican|Moderate Republican]] wields him potentially great power in the state Senate. He can join with the body's twelve Democratic members to block conservative initiatives from coming to the floor. In 2019, Seliger announced opposition to the [[property tax]] relief package offered by [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]], Governor [[Greg Abbott]], and House Speaker [[Dennis Bonnen]], who maintain that the issue of runaway property taxes has reached emergency status. Seliger, however, said that municipalities and counties should be able to set their own rates in conjunction with value estimates from the appraisal boards and the will of local voters. Under the measure, counties with more than $15 million in combined property and [[sales tax]]es must obtain voter approval for any increase in property taxes greater than 2.5 percent of the current year rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20190214/key-gop-lawmaker-opposes-marquee-property-tax-bill/1|title=Key GOP lawmaker opposes marquee property tax bill|publisher=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=February 14, 2019|author=Asher Price|accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Removal from Agriculture Committee chairmanship==\nOn January 22, 2019, Seliger was removed as chair of the Texas Senate Agriculture Committee after suggesting that a female staffer at the Capitol in Austin kiss his posterior.<ref>[https://www.myhighplains.com/news/your-local-election-hq/state-sen-kel-seliger-removed-as-chair-of-senate-agriculture-committee/1716573724 AUDIO: State Sen.

A senior staffer for Lieutenant Governor Patrick, Sherry Sylvester, responded to Seliger's complaint by stating that if Seliger believed being chair of Agriculture was beneath him then he should step down and let Patrick appoint someone else to the job.  On the radio show, \"Other Side of Texas,\" Seliger said, \"It was extremely snide and really unbecoming for a member of the staff, the lieutenant governor\u2019s or my staff.

He is also a licensed [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|commercial pilot]] and [[Flight Instructor#United States|flight instructor]].\n\nSeliger is currently a member of the [[National Rifle Association]], the [[Texas Farm Bureau]], and the [[Harley-Davidson]] [[Harley Owners Group|Owners Group]].\n\nSeliger and his wife, the former Nancy Caroline Meredith (born October 11, 1960), reside in Amarillo with their two sons, Jonathan and Matthew.\n\n==Political life==\n\nSeliger served four terms in the [[nonpartisan]] position as  [[mayor]] of Amarillo (1993&ndash;2001). He is also a former city [[commissioner]] and a former member of the Amarillo Civil Service Commission. He also served on former Texas [[Attorney General of Texas|Attorney General]] [[John Cornyn]]'s Municipal Advisory Committee and, in 2002, he was appointed to the [[Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission]] by [[Texas Governor|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]].\n\nSeliger was sworn into the [[Texas]] [[Texas Senate|Senate]] on March 2, 2004, to complete the term of [[Teel Bivins]] of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], who obtained a diplomatic appointment as [[United States Ambassador]] to [[Sweden]] from the administration of [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Seliger was reelected to serve a full, four-year term on November 4, 2004. The district spans twenty-six counties and serves large slices of the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]] and [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], including [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], and [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]]. It is one of the most Republican districts in the state; he has only faced a Democratic opponent once, during his first bid for a full term in 2004.\n\nSeliger is a [[List of members of the American Legislative Exchange Council|member of]] the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), serving as Texas state leader.<ref>http://www.alec.org/about-alec/state-chairmen/</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2016}}\n\nSeliger was appointed by [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]] [[David Dewhurst]] to serve as Vice-Chair of the Criminal Justice Committee for the [[Seventy-ninth Texas Legislature]]. In addition, he was appointed to the Natural Resources, International Relations and Trade, and Administration Committees.\n\nSeliger filed and sponsored over seventy-five [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]], fifty of which were passed in one form or another during the regular session of the 79th Legislature. As the vice chairman of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, Senator Seliger passed House Bill 2577 requiring local [[Police|law enforcement agencies]] to report to the state the reason for a [[peace officer]]'s termination to protect the integrity of the state's law enforcement officers. This legislation prevents those peace officers with a history of poor performance or unethical behavior, termed \"[[gypsy cop]]s,\" from taking advantage of police departments that lack the resources to investigate their employment history.\n\nSeliger's membership on the Senate Natural Resources Committee aided him in passing several important bills for [[West Texas]]. House Bill 2161 ensures that effective pipeline safety standards are in place for all construction work around [[Pipeline transport|oil and gas pipelines]]. It also establishes a program to address abandoned or orphaned [[Oil well|oil and gas wells]] and includes considerations for potential future periods of decline in [[Price of petroleum|oil and gas prices]]. Additionally, House Bill 951 will establish a notice and remediation process for construction around pipelines.\n\nThe Texas Municipal League presented Seliger with its 2005 Distinguished Legislative Service Award for his dedication to protecting and promoting local control. He also received the 2005 Rural Legislator of the Year Award from the Association of Rural Communities in Texas.\n\nSeliger won re-nomination to a full four-year term in the state Senate in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He defeated attorney and former Midland Mayor Michael Jackson \"Mike\" Canon, Sr. (born 1946), 36,623 (52.4 percent) to 33,223 (47.6 percent).<ref name=electionreturns>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=8866&id=965 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140305183835/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=8866&id=965 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 5, 2014 |title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014 |publisher=team1.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nSeliger is a moderate Republican by Texas standards. He is considered one of the most moderate of the twenty (as of 2015) Texas Senate Republicans, along with [[Kevin Eltife]] of [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], according to an analysis by Mark P. Jones of the political science department at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. Jones also found that these Republicans saw passage of 90 percent of the bills for which they voted.\n\nIn February 2015, Seliger filed proposed legislation backed by many school districts that a graduation committee be appointed for each pupil who twice fails an end-of-course assessment. With a unanimous committee vote, the student would be allowed to graduate from high school. The committee would consist of a principal, counselor, teacher, and parent and would consider course grades, standardized test scores, and regularity of attendance as factors to permit graduation in such situations. A. Marcus Nelson, superintendent of the [[Laredo Independent School District]] endorsed Seliger's bill, which he said would impact 172 pupils in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] who have twice failed the end-of-course assessments. \"We need to find the right balance in the number of assessments and the accountability that goes with it,\" Nelson said.<ref>Judith Rayo, \"Senate Bill 149: State exit exams eyed; More students could graduate\", ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', February 26, 2015, pp. 1, 14A</ref>\n\nSeliger is the recipient of the Bell Helicopter 2012 Legislative Leadership Award, the Texas Municipal League's 2011 Legislator of the Year, the Texas District and County Attorneys Association's 2009 Law and Order Award, Legislator of the Year 2009 from the Associated Security Services and Investigators of the State of Texas and the citizens of Odessa honored him with the 2009 Heritage of Odessa Foundation Community Statesman Award in Government.<ref name=\"senatorbio\"/>\n\nIn the [[general election]] held on November 6, 2018, Seliger handily prevailed over his only opponent, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] Jack B . Westbrook, 171,831 votes (87.5 percent) to 24,458 (12.5 percent). No Democrat sought the seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov06_331_state.htm?x=0&y=0&id=545|title=Election Returns|date=November 6, 2018|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110200011/https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov06_331_state.htm?x=0&y=0&id=545|archive-date=November 10, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nSeliger's status as a [[Rockefeller Republican|Moderate Republican]] wields him potentially great power in the state Senate. He can join with the body's twelve Democratic members to block conservative initiatives from coming to the floor. In 2019, Seliger announced opposition to the [[property tax]] relief package offered by [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]], Governor [[Greg Abbott]], and House Speaker [[Dennis Bonnen]], who maintain that the issue of runaway property taxes has reached emergency status. Seliger, however, said that municipalities and counties should be able to set their own rates in conjunction with value estimates from the appraisal boards and the will of local voters. Under the measure, counties with more than $15 million in combined property and [[sales tax]]es must obtain voter approval for any increase in property taxes greater than 2.5 percent of the current year rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20190214/key-gop-lawmaker-opposes-marquee-property-tax-bill/1|title=Key GOP lawmaker opposes marquee property tax bill|publisher=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=February 14, 2019|author=Asher Price|accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Removal from Agriculture Committee chairmanship==\nOn January 22, 2019, Seliger was removed as chair of the Texas Senate Agriculture Committee after suggesting that a female staffer at the Capitol in Austin kiss his posterior.<ref>[https://www.myhighplains.com/news/your-local-election-hq/state-sen-kel-seliger-removed-as-chair-of-senate-agriculture-committee/1716573724 AUDIO: State Sen.

A senior staffer for Lieutenant Governor Patrick, Sherry Sylvester, responded to Seliger's complaint by stating that if Seliger believed being chair of Agriculture was beneath him then he should step down and let Patrick appoint someone else to the job.  On the radio show, \"Other Side of Texas,\" Seliger said, \"It was extremely snide and really unbecoming for a member of the staff, the lieutenant governor\u2019s or my staff. I didn\u2019t say anything of the sort, and that assertion is disingenuous and I have a recommendation for Miss Sylvester and her lips and my back end.\"  Patrick then removed Seliger from the chairmanship after Seliger was given forty-eight hours by Patrick to apologize to the female staffer.

[[West Germany]] had not yet been granted sovereignty over its airspace, so it was not known when the new airline could become operational.

In parallel, the airline also initiated a marketing campaign to sell itself and West Germany. The challenges involved encouraging travelers to consider visiting the country in the wake of World War II, as well as offering services to other nations via the Frankfurt airport hub. More specifically, Lufthansa's efforts shaped and reflected the development of a modern form of consumerism and advertising through the sale of air travel. By 1963, the airline, initially limited in its public relations efforts, had become a major purveyor of West Germany's image abroad.<ref>{{cite book|last1=de Syon|first1=Guillaume|editor1-last=Swett|editor1-first=Pamela E|editor1-link=Selling Modernity: Advertising in Twentiteh_Century Germany|title=Lufthansa Welcomes You: Air Transport and Tourism in the Adenauer Era|date=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/15858180|chapter=7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Berlin Soviet Zone|special status]] of Berlin meant that Lufthansa was not allowed to fly to either part of [[Berlin]] until 1989.

[[Boeing 720]]Bs were later bought to back up the 707 fleets. In February 1961 Far East routes were extended beyond [[Bangkok]], Thailand, to Hong Kong and Tokyo. [[Lagos]], Nigeria and [[Johannesburg]], South Africa were added in 1962.\n\nLufthansa introduced the [[Boeing 727]] in 1964 and that May began the [[Polar route]] from Frankfurt to Tokyo via Anchorage. In February 1965 the company ordered twenty-one [[Boeing 737]]s that went into service in 1968. Lufthansa was the first customer for the Boeing 737 and was one of four buyers of the 737-100s (the others were [[NASA]], [[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]], and [[Avianca]] \u2013 while the NASA airframe was the first built, it was the last delivered and originally intended for delivery to Lufthansa). Lufthansa was the first foreign launch customer for a Boeing airliner.\n\n===1970s\u20131980s: The wide-body era===\nThe [[wide-body]] era for Lufthansa started with a [[Boeing 747]] flight on 26 April 1970. It was followed by the introduction of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10-30]] on 12 November 1973, and the first [[Airbus A300]] in 1976. In 1979 Lufthansa and [[Swissair]] became launch customers for the [[Airbus A310]] with an order for twenty-five aircraft.\n\nThe company's fleet modernization programme for the 1990s began on 29 June 1985, with an order for fifteen [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320s]] and seven [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300-600s]]. Ten [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300s]] were ordered a few days later. All were delivered between 1987 and 1992. Lufthansa also bought [[Airbus A321]], [[Airbus A340]], and [[Boeing 747-400]] aircraft.\n\nIn 1987 Lufthansa, together with [[Air France]], [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], and [[Scandinavian Airlines]], founded [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]], an IT company (also known as a [[Computer reservations system|GDS]]) that would enable travel agencies to sell the founders and other airlines' products from a single system.]\n\nLufthansa adopted a new corporate identity in 1988.

Lufthansa has a good track record for posting profits, even in 2001, after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]], the airline suffered a significant loss in profits but still managed to stay 'in the black'. While many other airlines announced layoffs (typically 20% of their workforce), Lufthansa retained its current workforce.<ref>Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 2001, Lufthansa announced an order for 15 [[Airbus A380]] superjumbos with 10 more options, which was confirmed on 20 December. The A380 fleet would be used for long-haul flights from Frankfurt exclusively.\n\nIn June 2003, Lufthansa opened Terminal 2 at [[Munich]]'s [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df Airport]] to relieve its main hub, [[Frankfurt]], which was suffering from capacity constraints. It is one of the first [[airport terminal|terminals]] in Europe partially owned by an airline.\n\nOn 17 May 2004, Lufthansa became the launch customer for the [[Connexion by Boeing]] in-flight online connectivity service.\n\nIn autumn 2003, the implementation of a new sales strategy initiated by then-incumbent [[Executive Vice President]] Thierry Antinori to make the company fit for the digital era led to the abolition of commission payments for [[travel agencies]] and led to a revolution in the German travel business with many travel agencies disappearing from the market on the one hand, and the rise of new [[Digital data|digital]] distribution platforms on the other hand.<ref>Axel Kaune (Hrsg.): Konfliktmanagement im Tourismus - Die Einf\u00fchrung der Nullprovision.

The stylised crane has been kept.]]\nThe Lufthansa logo, an encircled stylized [[crane (bird)|crane]] in flight, was first created in 1918 by Otto Firle. It was part of the livery of the first German airline, [[Deutsche Luft-Reederei]] (abbreviated DLR), which began air service on 5 February 1919. In 1926, [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] adopted this symbol, and in 1954, Lufthansa expressed continuity by adopting it and later in 1963 \u2013 a variant thereof as redesigned by [[Robert Lisovskyi]].\n\nThe original creator of the name Lufthansa is believed to be F.A. Fischer von Puturzyn. In 1925, he published a book entitled \"Luft-Hansa\" which examined the options open to aviation policymakers at the time. Luft Hansa was the name given to the new airline, which resulted from the merger of [[Junkers]]' airline ([[Junkers Luftverkehr|Luftverkehr AG]]) and ''Deutscher Aero Lloyd''.<ref name=\"lh_chronicle\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091010130610/http://konzern.lufthansa.com/en/html/ueber_uns/geschichte/chronik/index.html Lufthansa Chronicle]. Konzern.lufthansa.com (28 June 2011). Retrieved on 8 July 2011.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the company kept blue and yellow as their main colours and the crane logo. Since the beginning of the 1960s, [[Helvetica]] was used for the company name in the livery. The fuselage was painted white on top and was aluminium below a blue window band. The crane logo was painted blue on a yellow parabola inside a blue band on the tail.\n\nGerman designer [[Otl Aicher]] created a comprehensive corporate design for the airline in 1967. The crane logo was now always displayed in a circle which, on the livery, was yellow on an otherwise blue tailfin. Helvetica was used as the main typeface for both the livery and publications. The blue band and general paint scheme of the aircraft were retained from the previous livery.\n\nAicher's concept was retained in the 1988 design. The window band was removed and the fuselage was painted in grey.\n\nIn 2018, Lufthansa refreshed their livery. The encircled crane was retained, however, the background was changed from yellow to dark blue. The vertical stabilizer and the rear fuselage was all painted in dark blue, with the tail cone remained white. The main fuselage was painted in all white, and the brand name \"Lufthansa\" was painted above the windows, also in dark blue.\n\n===Alliances and partnerships===\n[[File:FRA LH Lounge First seating.jpg|thumb|The Lufthansa First Class lounge at [[Frankfurt Airport]]]]\n\n====Commercial====\nLufthansa bought a 19% stake in [[JetBlue Airways]] in December 2007 and entered a code-sharing agreement with the airline. It was the first major investment by a European carrier in an American carrier since the [[EU\u2013U.S. Open Skies Agreement]] came into effect in 2008. Lufthansa sold its stake in JetBlue in March 2015.\n\nIn late 2007, Lufthansa Cargo was forced to relocate a hub from [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Russia]].\n\nOn 28 August 2008, Lufthansa and [[Brussels Airlines]] announced that they were negotiating joining together.<ref>[http://konzern.lufthansa.com/en/html/presse/pressemeldungen/index.html?c=nachrichten/app/show/en/2008/08/852/HOM&s=0 Lufthansa.com].

conventions===\nIn September 1960, a Lufthansa Boeing 707 (D-ABOC), which would serve the Frankfurt-New York intercontinental route, was christened ''Berlin'' after the divided city of Berlin by then-mayor [[Willy Brandt]]. Following ''Berlin'', other Lufthansa 707 planes were named \"[[Hamburg]]\", \"[[Frankfurt]]\", \"[[Munich|M\u00fcnchen]]\", and \"[[Bonn]].\" With these names, the company established a tradition of [[Ship naming and launching|naming]] the planes in its fleet after German cities and towns or federal states, with a rule of thumb that the airplane make, size, or route would correspond roughly to the relative size or importance of the city or town it was named after.\n\nThis tradition continued, with two notable exceptions, until 2010: The first was an [[Airbus A340-300]] registered D-AIFC, named \"Gander/Halifax\", after [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], two Canadian cities along the standard flight path from Europe to North America. It became the first Lufthansa airplane named after a non-German city. The name commemorates the hospitality of the communities of Gander and Halifax, which served as improvised safe havens for the passengers and crew of the multitude of international aircraft unable to return to their originating airports during [[Operation Yellow Ribbon]] after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The other aircraft not named after a German city was an [[Airbus A321-100]] registered as D-AIRA, which was designated ''Finkenwerder'' in honor of the Airbus facility in the district of [[Finkenwerder|Hamburg-Finkenwerder]],<ref name=\"lhtaufnamen2\">[http://lh-taufnamen.de/lufthansa/ lh-taufnamen.de - Lufthansa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115210604/https://www.lh-taufnamen.de/lufthansa/ |date=15 January 2018 }} retrieved 20 June 2016</ref> where about 40% of Airbus narrowbody models are manufactured.\n\nIn February 2010, Lufthansa announced that its first two [[Airbus A380]]s would be named ''Frankfurt am Main'' (D-AIMA) and ''M\u00fcnchen'' (D-AIMB) after Lufthansa's two hub airports. Subsequent A380 aircraft were named after other Lufthansa Group hub airports ''[[Zurich]]'', ''Wien'' ([[Vienna]]) and ''Br\u00fcssel'' ([[Brussels]]) and the major German cities of ''[[D\u00fcsseldorf]]'' and ''[[Berlin]]''. The remaining A380s were named after [[Star Alliance]] hub cities ''Tokyo'', ''Beijing'', ''Johannesburg'', ''New York'', ''San Francisco'' and ''Delhi''. However, D-AIMN ''San Francisco'' was renamed ''Deutschland'' (Germany) in 2016.<ref name=\"lhtaufnamen2\" />\n\nAs of 2016, there are several short- and long-haul aircraft in Lufthansa's fleet that do not bear any name. They either never received one or their former one has been given to a newer aircraft, which was the case for several [[Boeing 747-400]]s. For example, the former ''Bayern'' ([[Bavaria]]), a Boeing 747-400 still in active service lost that name to a new [[Boeing 747-8|Boeing 747-8I]].<ref name=\"lhtaufnamen2\"/>\n\n===Vintage aircraft restoration===\n[[Lufthansa Technik]], the airline's maintenance arm, restored a [[Junkers Ju 52/3m]] built in 1936 to [[airworthy|airworthiness]]; this aircraft was in use on the 10-hour Berlin to Rome route, across the [[Alps]], in the 1930s. Lufthansa is now restoring a [[Lockheed Super Constellation]], using parts from three such aircraft bought at auctions. Lufthansa's Super Constellations and L1649 \"Starliners\" served routes such as [[Hamburg]]-[[Madrid]]-[[Dakar]]-[[Caracas]]-[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Lufthansa Technik recruits retired employees and volunteers for skilled labour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Michaels|first=Daniel|title=WSJ's Dan Michaels reports how German carrier Lufthansa refurbished a 1936 Junkers 52/3m|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121357457537975947?mod=hps_us_inside_today|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=27 August 2013|date=16 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Michaels|first=Daniel|title=Engineering Veteran Plays a Vital Role in Plane's Rebirth|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121319460970364371?mod=A-hed|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=27 August 2013|date=16 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Airbus A380===\nLufthansa had initially ordered a total of 15 [[Airbus A380-800]], of which by June 2012 ten were delivered. In September 2011, the order was increased by two more copies to 17, this order was confirmed on 14 March 2013. However, in September 2013 it was announced that the Lufthansa Supervisory Board had approved the purchase of only twelve of the first 15 A380s. Thus, a total of 14 A380s have been added to the fleet.\n\nLufthansa uses its A380s from and to Frankfurt am Main (9 aircraft) and since March 2018 to and from Munich as well (5 aircraft). From 6 to 12 December 2011, Lufthansa already used an A380 once a day on the route from Munich to New York-JFK. This happened mainly against the backdrop of Christmas shopping in New York City.\n\nOn 13 March 2019, Lufthansa announced that it will be removing 6 [[A380]] aircraft from the fleet and replacing them with Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900 aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldairlinenews.com/2019/03/13/lufthansa-group-orders-40-boeing-787-9-dreamliners-and-airbus-a350-900-aircraft-will-sell-6-a380s/|title=Lufthansa Group orders 40 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and Airbus A350-900 aircraft, will sell 6 A380s|first=Bruce|last=Drum|date=13 March 2019|accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 March 2020, Lufthansa announced that it would be grounding all of its A380 aircraft due to a decline in bookings caused by the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpleflying.com/lufthansa-a380-grounding-coronavirus/|title=Breaking: Lufthansa To Ground Entire Airbus A380 Fleet|date=2020-03-08|website=Simple Flying|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airlinegeeks.com/2020/03/08/lufthansa-grounds-airbus-a380-fleet/|title=Lufthansa Grounds Airbus A380 Fleet|date=2020-03-08|website=AirlineGeeks.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onemileatatime.com/lufthansa-grounding-a380-fleet/|title=Lufthansa Grounding Entire A380 Fleet|last=Ben|date=2020-03-08|website=One Mile at a Time|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\n==Services==\n===Frequent-flyer programme===\n{{Main|Miles & More}}\nLufthansa's [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent-flyer]] programme is called ''Miles & More'', and is shared among several European airlines, including all of Lufthansa's subsidiary airlines (excluding the [[SunExpress]] joint ventures), plus [[Adria Airways]], [[Condor Flugdienst]] (formerly owned by Lufthansa), [[Croatia Airlines]], [[LOT Polish Airlines]], and [[Luxair]] (stake formerly held by Lufthansa).<ref name=\"Miles & More partners\">{{cite web |url=https://www.miles-and-more.com/row/en/program/partners.html |title=All partners at a glance Miles & More |publisher=Miles-and-more.com |accessdate=29 July 2019 }}</ref> Miles & More members may earn miles on Lufthansa flights and [[Star Alliance]] partner flights, as well as through Lufthansa credit cards, and purchases made through the Lufthansa shops.

In parallel, the airline also initiated a marketing campaign to sell itself and West Germany. The challenges involved encouraging travelers to consider visiting the country in the wake of World War II, as well as offering services to other nations via the Frankfurt airport hub. More specifically, Lufthansa's efforts shaped and reflected the development of a modern form of consumerism and advertising through the sale of air travel. By 1963, the airline, initially limited in its public relations efforts, had become a major purveyor of West Germany's image abroad.<ref>{{cite book|last1=de Syon|first1=Guillaume|editor1-last=Swett|editor1-first=Pamela E|editor1-link=Selling Modernity: Advertising in Twentiteh_Century Germany|title=Lufthansa Welcomes You: Air Transport and Tourism in the Adenauer Era|date=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/15858180|chapter=7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Berlin Soviet Zone|special status]] of Berlin meant that Lufthansa was not allowed to fly to either part of [[Berlin]] until 1989.

[[Boeing 720]]Bs were later bought to back up the 707 fleets. In February 1961 Far East routes were extended beyond [[Bangkok]], Thailand, to Hong Kong and Tokyo. [[Lagos]], Nigeria and [[Johannesburg]], South Africa were added in 1962.\n\nLufthansa introduced the [[Boeing 727]] in 1964 and that May began the [[Polar route]] from Frankfurt to Tokyo via Anchorage. In February 1965 the company ordered twenty-one [[Boeing 737]]s that went into service in 1968. Lufthansa was the first customer for the Boeing 737 and was one of four buyers of the 737-100s (the others were [[NASA]], [[Malaysia-Singapore Airlines]], and [[Avianca]] \u2013 while the NASA airframe was the first built, it was the last delivered and originally intended for delivery to Lufthansa). Lufthansa was the first foreign launch customer for a Boeing airliner.\n\n===1970s\u20131980s: The wide-body era===\nThe [[wide-body]] era for Lufthansa started with a [[Boeing 747]] flight on 26 April 1970. It was followed by the introduction of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10-30]] on 12 November 1973, and the first [[Airbus A300]] in 1976. In 1979 Lufthansa and [[Swissair]] became launch customers for the [[Airbus A310]] with an order for twenty-five aircraft.\n\nThe company's fleet modernization programme for the 1990s began on 29 June 1985, with an order for fifteen [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320s]] and seven [[Airbus A300|Airbus A300-600s]]. Ten [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300s]] were ordered a few days later. All were delivered between 1987 and 1992. Lufthansa also bought [[Airbus A321]], [[Airbus A340]], and [[Boeing 747-400]] aircraft.\n\nIn 1987 Lufthansa, together with [[Air France]], [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], and [[Scandinavian Airlines]], founded [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]], an IT company (also known as a [[Computer reservations system|GDS]]) that would enable travel agencies to sell the founders and other airlines' products from a single system.]\n\nLufthansa adopted a new corporate identity in 1988.

Lufthansa has a good track record for posting profits, even in 2001, after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]], the airline suffered a significant loss in profits but still managed to stay 'in the black'. While many other airlines announced layoffs (typically 20% of their workforce), Lufthansa retained its current workforce.<ref>Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 2001, Lufthansa announced an order for 15 [[Airbus A380]] superjumbos with 10 more options, which was confirmed on 20 December. The A380 fleet would be used for long-haul flights from Frankfurt exclusively.\n\nIn June 2003, Lufthansa opened Terminal 2 at [[Munich]]'s [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df Airport]] to relieve its main hub, [[Frankfurt]], which was suffering from capacity constraints. It is one of the first [[airport terminal|terminals]] in Europe partially owned by an airline.\n\nOn 17 May 2004, Lufthansa became the launch customer for the [[Connexion by Boeing]] in-flight online connectivity service.\n\nIn autumn 2003, the implementation of a new sales strategy initiated by then-incumbent [[Executive Vice President]] Thierry Antinori to make the company fit for the digital era led to the abolition of commission payments for [[travel agencies]] and led to a revolution in the German travel business with many travel agencies disappearing from the market on the one hand, and the rise of new [[Digital data|digital]] distribution platforms on the other hand.<ref>Axel Kaune (Hrsg.): Konfliktmanagement im Tourismus - Die Einf\u00fchrung der Nullprovision.

The stylised crane has been kept.]]\nThe Lufthansa logo, an encircled stylized [[crane (bird)|crane]] in flight, was first created in 1918 by Otto Firle. It was part of the livery of the first German airline, [[Deutsche Luft-Reederei]] (abbreviated DLR), which began air service on 5 February 1919. In 1926, [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] adopted this symbol, and in 1954, Lufthansa expressed continuity by adopting it and later in 1963 \u2013 a variant thereof as redesigned by [[Robert Lisovskyi]].\n\nThe original creator of the name Lufthansa is believed to be F.A. Fischer von Puturzyn. In 1925, he published a book entitled \"Luft-Hansa\" which examined the options open to aviation policymakers at the time. Luft Hansa was the name given to the new airline, which resulted from the merger of [[Junkers]]' airline ([[Junkers Luftverkehr|Luftverkehr AG]]) and ''Deutscher Aero Lloyd''.<ref name=\"lh_chronicle\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091010130610/http://konzern.lufthansa.com/en/html/ueber_uns/geschichte/chronik/index.html Lufthansa Chronicle]. Konzern.lufthansa.com (28 June 2011). Retrieved on 8 July 2011.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the company kept blue and yellow as their main colours and the crane logo. Since the beginning of the 1960s, [[Helvetica]] was used for the company name in the livery. The fuselage was painted white on top and was aluminium below a blue window band. The crane logo was painted blue on a yellow parabola inside a blue band on the tail.\n\nGerman designer [[Otl Aicher]] created a comprehensive corporate design for the airline in 1967. The crane logo was now always displayed in a circle which, on the livery, was yellow on an otherwise blue tailfin. Helvetica was used as the main typeface for both the livery and publications. The blue band and general paint scheme of the aircraft were retained from the previous livery.\n\nAicher's concept was retained in the 1988 design. The window band was removed and the fuselage was painted in grey.\n\nIn 2018, Lufthansa refreshed their livery. The encircled crane was retained, however, the background was changed from yellow to dark blue. The vertical stabilizer and the rear fuselage was all painted in dark blue, with the tail cone remained white. The main fuselage was painted in all white, and the brand name \"Lufthansa\" was painted above the windows, also in dark blue.\n\n===Alliances and partnerships===\n[[File:FRA LH Lounge First seating.jpg|thumb|The Lufthansa First Class lounge at [[Frankfurt Airport]]]]\n\n====Commercial====\nLufthansa bought a 19% stake in [[JetBlue Airways]] in December 2007 and entered a code-sharing agreement with the airline. It was the first major investment by a European carrier in an American carrier since the [[EU\u2013U.S. Open Skies Agreement]] came into effect in 2008. Lufthansa sold its stake in JetBlue in March 2015.\n\nIn late 2007, Lufthansa Cargo was forced to relocate a hub from [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Russia]].\n\nOn 28 August 2008, Lufthansa and [[Brussels Airlines]] announced that they were negotiating joining together.<ref>[http://konzern.lufthansa.com/en/html/presse/pressemeldungen/index.html?c=nachrichten/app/show/en/2008/08/852/HOM&s=0 Lufthansa.com].

conventions===\nIn September 1960, a Lufthansa Boeing 707 (D-ABOC), which would serve the Frankfurt-New York intercontinental route, was christened ''Berlin'' after the divided city of Berlin by then-mayor [[Willy Brandt]]. Following ''Berlin'', other Lufthansa 707 planes were named \"[[Hamburg]]\", \"[[Frankfurt]]\", \"[[Munich|M\u00fcnchen]]\", and \"[[Bonn]].\" With these names, the company established a tradition of [[Ship naming and launching|naming]] the planes in its fleet after German cities and towns or federal states, with a rule of thumb that the airplane make, size, or route would correspond roughly to the relative size or importance of the city or town it was named after.\n\nThis tradition continued, with two notable exceptions, until 2010: The first was an [[Airbus A340-300]] registered D-AIFC, named \"Gander/Halifax\", after [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], two Canadian cities along the standard flight path from Europe to North America. It became the first Lufthansa airplane named after a non-German city. The name commemorates the hospitality of the communities of Gander and Halifax, which served as improvised safe havens for the passengers and crew of the multitude of international aircraft unable to return to their originating airports during [[Operation Yellow Ribbon]] after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The other aircraft not named after a German city was an [[Airbus A321-100]] registered as D-AIRA, which was designated ''Finkenwerder'' in honor of the Airbus facility in the district of [[Finkenwerder|Hamburg-Finkenwerder]],<ref name=\"lhtaufnamen2\">[http://lh-taufnamen.de/lufthansa/ lh-taufnamen.de - Lufthansa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115210604/https://www.lh-taufnamen.de/lufthansa/ |date=15 January 2018 }} retrieved 20 June 2016</ref> where about 40% of Airbus narrowbody models are manufactured.\n\nIn February 2010, Lufthansa announced that its first two [[Airbus A380]]s would be named ''Frankfurt am Main'' (D-AIMA) and ''M\u00fcnchen'' (D-AIMB) after Lufthansa's two hub airports. Subsequent A380 aircraft were named after other Lufthansa Group hub airports ''[[Zurich]]'', ''Wien'' ([[Vienna]]) and ''Br\u00fcssel'' ([[Brussels]]) and the major German cities of ''[[D\u00fcsseldorf]]'' and ''[[Berlin]]''. The remaining A380s were named after [[Star Alliance]] hub cities ''Tokyo'', ''Beijing'', ''Johannesburg'', ''New York'', ''San Francisco'' and ''Delhi''. However, D-AIMN ''San Francisco'' was renamed ''Deutschland'' (Germany) in 2016.<ref name=\"lhtaufnamen2\" />\n\nAs of 2016, there are several short- and long-haul aircraft in Lufthansa's fleet that do not bear any name. They either never received one or their former one has been given to a newer aircraft, which was the case for several [[Boeing 747-400]]s. For example, the former ''Bayern'' ([[Bavaria]]), a Boeing 747-400 still in active service lost that name to a new [[Boeing 747-8|Boeing 747-8I]].<ref name=\"lhtaufnamen2\"/>\n\n===Vintage aircraft restoration===\n[[Lufthansa Technik]], the airline's maintenance arm, restored a [[Junkers Ju 52/3m]] built in 1936 to [[airworthy|airworthiness]]; this aircraft was in use on the 10-hour Berlin to Rome route, across the [[Alps]], in the 1930s. Lufthansa is now restoring a [[Lockheed Super Constellation]], using parts from three such aircraft bought at auctions. Lufthansa's Super Constellations and L1649 \"Starliners\" served routes such as [[Hamburg]]-[[Madrid]]-[[Dakar]]-[[Caracas]]-[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Lufthansa Technik recruits retired employees and volunteers for skilled labour.<ref>{{cite news|last=Michaels|first=Daniel|title=WSJ's Dan Michaels reports how German carrier Lufthansa refurbished a 1936 Junkers 52/3m|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121357457537975947?mod=hps_us_inside_today|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=27 August 2013|date=16 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Michaels|first=Daniel|title=Engineering Veteran Plays a Vital Role in Plane's Rebirth|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121319460970364371?mod=A-hed|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=27 August 2013|date=16 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Airbus A380===\nLufthansa had initially ordered a total of 15 [[Airbus A380-800]], of which by June 2012 ten were delivered. In September 2011, the order was increased by two more copies to 17, this order was confirmed on 14 March 2013. However, in September 2013 it was announced that the Lufthansa Supervisory Board had approved the purchase of only twelve of the first 15 A380s. Thus, a total of 14 A380s have been added to the fleet.\n\nLufthansa uses its A380s from and to Frankfurt am Main (9 aircraft) and since March 2018 to and from Munich as well (5 aircraft). From 6 to 12 December 2011, Lufthansa already used an A380 once a day on the route from Munich to New York-JFK. This happened mainly against the backdrop of Christmas shopping in New York City.\n\nOn 13 March 2019, Lufthansa announced that it will be removing 6 [[A380]] aircraft from the fleet and replacing them with Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900 aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldairlinenews.com/2019/03/13/lufthansa-group-orders-40-boeing-787-9-dreamliners-and-airbus-a350-900-aircraft-will-sell-6-a380s/|title=Lufthansa Group orders 40 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and Airbus A350-900 aircraft, will sell 6 A380s|first=Bruce|last=Drum|date=13 March 2019|accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 March 2020, Lufthansa announced that it would be grounding all of its A380 aircraft due to a decline in bookings caused by the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpleflying.com/lufthansa-a380-grounding-coronavirus/|title=Breaking: Lufthansa To Ground Entire Airbus A380 Fleet|date=2020-03-08|website=Simple Flying|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airlinegeeks.com/2020/03/08/lufthansa-grounds-airbus-a380-fleet/|title=Lufthansa Grounds Airbus A380 Fleet|date=2020-03-08|website=AirlineGeeks.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onemileatatime.com/lufthansa-grounding-a380-fleet/|title=Lufthansa Grounding Entire A380 Fleet|last=Ben|date=2020-03-08|website=One Mile at a Time|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\n==Services==\n===Frequent-flyer programme===\n{{Main|Miles & More}}\nLufthansa's [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent-flyer]] programme is called ''Miles & More'', and is shared among several European airlines, including all of Lufthansa's subsidiary airlines (excluding the [[SunExpress]] joint ventures), plus [[Adria Airways]], [[Condor Flugdienst]] (formerly owned by Lufthansa), [[Croatia Airlines]], [[LOT Polish Airlines]], and [[Luxair]] (stake formerly held by Lufthansa).<ref name=\"Miles & More partners\">{{cite web |url=https://www.miles-and-more.com/row/en/program/partners.html |title=All partners at a glance Miles & More |publisher=Miles-and-more.com |accessdate=29 July 2019 }}</ref> Miles & More members may earn miles on Lufthansa flights and [[Star Alliance]] partner flights, as well as through Lufthansa credit cards, and purchases made through the Lufthansa shops.

The goal is for players to make their way through the castle to rescue the queen from an evil witch.\n\n==Basic rules==\nEnchanted Palace comes with the following pieces:\n* The Board\n* The Castle (the castle must be built, like in [[Dark Tower (game)|Dark Tower]])\n* A Witch & Queen Pawn (Cardboard Standie of the Witch, an image of the queen placed in the tower)\n* 4 Transparent Gliterized Player Pawns: Pink, Blue, Purple, and Yellow/Orange\n* 4 Frog Standies Player Pawns (cardboard standies of frogs with bows matching the colors of the Player Pawns - for enchanted players)\n* 4 Transparent Gliterized Crowns (The Colors Of The Player Pawns)\n* 4 of each: Lantern, Mirror, Key (Cardboard pieces with images of these items, which the players must collect)\n* 1 Magic Wand (batteries not included)\n\nOnce the castle has been \"built\", the queen will ask, \"Who will help me?\" and call out the names of each of the Princesses (the player pieces).  As each name is called, the player presses the magic wand on a button on the speaker to 'sign in'.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nThe witch then addresses the player characters, stating, \"I have your queen, you will never save her!\"  The queen then instructs the first player to enter a room.  The player's Princess pawn is then moved into a room, and the wand is inserted into one of the holes on the board to select the room, then into the crown on the game console to search the room.  The princess will then be told she found one of the three items, or that \"There is nothing for you here!\"\n\nIf all four pawns are in play, the Pink is first to move, followed by the Blue, then Purple, and finally the Yellow/Orange.<ref>[http://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/2356/enchanted-palace Enchanted Palace] from RetroJunk.com</ref>\n\nThe witch will randomly select a room to cast a spell upon, if a Princess is in the enchanted room, she will be changed into a frog, and the player must replace the glittery Princess pawn with a frog pawn and pass the wand to the next player.  The next player is given the choice to enter the next room or to cast a spell.  If the player casts a spell, they will be told the enchanted player has been saved, the enchanted player can then resume with the original Princess pawn, but must repay the rescuing player with one of the items they previously recovered.\n\nOnce a player has all three items, the queen calls that player to the tower, the pawn is moved to the tower and the player passes the wand on to the next player, until the next turn.  Once all players have had a final turn, the queen will call out to the Princess standing on the tower to \"Help me!\"  The player presses the button on top of the tower, and the doors swing open, freeing the queen, and knocking the witch off the tower.  The queen then addresses the winning player and states, \"You saved me. You are the princess of the kingdom!\" Then you take the bow off your pawn's head, and replace it with her corresponding crown.\n\n===Single player===\nIf playing Solo, the player signs in as Rose, the Pink Princess and plays as far as possible.  If Rose is \"cursed\" and turned into a frog, then the Blue Princess will come in, this can continue until the player has won, or until all four Princesses have been turned into a Frog.\n\n===Game over===\nIn multi-player mode, it is game over if all four Princess pawns are in the same room and turned into Frogs when the witch casts her spell.

The goal is for players to make their way through the castle to rescue the queen from an evil witch.\n\n==Basic rules==\nEnchanted Palace comes with the following pieces:\n* The Board\n* The Castle (the castle must be built, like in [[Dark Tower (game)|Dark Tower]])\n* A Witch & Queen Pawn (Cardboard Standie of the Witch, an image of the queen placed in the tower)\n* 4 Transparent Gliterized Player Pawns: Pink, Blue, Purple, and Yellow/Orange\n* 4 Frog Standies Player Pawns (cardboard standies of frogs with bows matching the colors of the Player Pawns - for enchanted players)\n* 4 Transparent Gliterized Crowns (The Colors Of The Player Pawns)\n* 4 of each: Lantern, Mirror, Key (Cardboard pieces with images of these items, which the players must collect)\n* 1 Magic Wand (batteries not included)\n\nOnce the castle has been \"built\", the queen will ask, \"Who will help me?\" and call out the names of each of the Princesses (the player pieces).  As each name is called, the player presses the magic wand on a button on the speaker to 'sign in'.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nThe witch then addresses the player characters, stating, \"I have your queen, you will never save her!\"  The queen then instructs the first player to enter a room.  The player's Princess pawn is then moved into a room, and the wand is inserted into one of the holes on the board to select the room, then into the crown on the game console to search the room.  The princess will then be told she found one of the three items, or that \"There is nothing for you here!\"\n\nIf all four pawns are in play, the Pink is first to move, followed by the Blue, then Purple, and finally the Yellow/Orange.<ref>[http://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/2356/enchanted-palace Enchanted Palace] from RetroJunk.com</ref>\n\nThe witch will randomly select a room to cast a spell upon, if a Princess is in the enchanted room, she will be changed into a frog, and the player must replace the glittery Princess pawn with a frog pawn and pass the wand to the next player.  The next player is given the choice to enter the next room or to cast a spell.  If the player casts a spell, they will be told the enchanted player has been saved, the enchanted player can then resume with the original Princess pawn, but must repay the rescuing player with one of the items they previously recovered.\n\nOnce a player has all three items, the queen calls that player to the tower, the pawn is moved to the tower and the player passes the wand on to the next player, until the next turn.

It is also possible that the name comes directly from the verb ''pozna\u0107'', which means \"to get to know\" or \"to recognize,\" so it may simply mean \"known town\".\n[[File:Pozna\u0144 seal from XIV century.PNG|thumb|upright|left|14th-century seal showing Pozna\u0144's coat of arms]]\nThe earliest surviving references to the city are found in the chronicles of [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], written between 1012 and 1018: {{lang|la|episcopus Posnaniensis}} (\"[[List of Bishops of Pozna\u0144|bishop of Pozna\u0144]]\", in an entry for 970) and ''ab urbe Posnani'' (\"from the city of Pozna\u0144\", for 1005). The city's name appears in documents in the Latin [[nominative case]] as ''Posnania'' in 1236 and ''Poznania'' in 1247. The phrase ''in Poznan'' appears in 1146 and 1244.\n\nThe city's full official name is ''Sto\u0142eczne Miasto Pozna\u0144'' (\"The Capital City of Pozna\u0144\"), in reference to its role as a centre of political power in the [[Piast Poland|early Polish state]]. Pozna\u0144 is known as ''Posen'' in [[German language|German]], and was officially called ''Haupt- und Residenzstadt Posen'' (\"Capital and Residence City of Pozna\u0144\") between 20 August 1910 and 28 November 1918. The [[Latin]] names of the city are ''Posnania'' and ''Civitas Posnaniensis''. Its [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name is {{lang|yi|\u05e4\u05bc\u05f1\u05d6\u05df}}, or ''Poyzn''.\n\nIn Polish, the city name has masculine [[grammatical gender]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Pozna\u0144|Timeline of Pozna\u0144|Historical population of Pozna\u0144}}\n[[File:Z\u0142ota Kaplica Pozna\u0144 RB1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Monument of [[Mieszko I]] and [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], Golden Chapel in [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 Cathedral]]]]\nFor centuries before the Christianization of Poland, Pozna\u0144 (consisting of a fortified stronghold between the [[Warta]] and [[Cybina]] rivers, on what is now [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]]) was an important cultural and political centre of the [[Polans (western)|Polan]] tribe. [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the first historically recorded ruler of the Polans, and of the early Polish state which they dominated, built one of his main stable headquarters in Pozna\u0144. [[Christianization of Poland|Mieszko's baptism]] of 966, seen as a defining moment in the Christianization of the Polish state, may have taken place in Pozna\u0144.\n\nFollowing the baptism, construction began of [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144's cathedral]], the first in Poland. Pozna\u0144 was probably the main seat of the first missionary bishop sent to Poland, [[Bishop Jordan]]. The [[Congress of Gniezno]] in 1000 led to the country's first permanent [[archbishopric]] being established in [[Gniezno]] (which is generally regarded as Poland's capital in that period), although Pozna\u0144 continued to have independent bishops of its own. Pozna\u0144's cathedral was the place of burial of the early [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] monarchs (Mieszko I, [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus I]], [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]]), and later of [[Przemys\u0142 I of Poland|Przemys\u0142 I]] and King [[Przemys\u0142 II of Poland|Przemys\u0142 II]].\n[[File:Grobowiec Mieszka I i Boles\u0142awa I Chrobrego.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of Mieszko I and Boles\u0142aw I in [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 Cathedral]]]]\nThe [[pagan reaction in Poland|pagan reaction]] that followed Mieszko II's death (probably in Pozna\u0144) in 1034 left the region weak, and in 1038, Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] of [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]] sacked and destroyed both Pozna\u0144 and Gniezno. Poland was reunited under [[Casimir the Restorer|Casimir I the Restorer]] in 1039, but the capital was moved to [[Krak\u00f3w]], which had been relatively unaffected by the troubles.\nIn 1138, by the [[testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|testament of Boles\u0142aw III]], Poland was divided into separate duchies under the late king's sons, and Pozna\u0144 and its surroundings became the domain of [[Mieszko III the Old]], the first of the [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Dukes of Greater Poland]]. This period of fragmentation lasted until 1320. Duchies frequently changed hands; control of Pozna\u0144, Gniezno and [[Kalisz]] sometimes lay with a single duke, but at other times these constituted separate duchies.\n\nIn about 1249, Duke [[Przemys\u0142 I]] began constructing what would become the [[Royal Castle, Poznan|Royal Castle]] on a hill on the left bank of the Warta. Then in 1253 Przemys\u0142 issued a charter to Thomas of [[Guben]] (Gubin) for the founding of a town under [[Magdeburg law]], between the castle and the river.

The city's importance began to grow in the [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonian]] period, due to its position on trading routes from [[Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and [[Ruthenia]] to western Europe. It would become a major centre for the [[fur trade]] by the late 16th century. Suburban settlements developed around the city walls, on the river islands and on the right bank, with some (Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, [[\u015ar\u00f3dka, Pozna\u0144|\u015ar\u00f3dka]], Chwaliszewo, Ostr\u00f3wek) obtaining their own town charters. However the city's development was hampered by regular major fires and floods. On 2 May 1536 a fire destroyed 175 buildings, including the castle, the town hall, the monastery and the suburban settlement called St. Martin.<ref>J. Perles: ''Geschichte der Juden in Posen''.

However a [[Jesuits]]' college, founded in the city in 1571 during the [[Counter-Reformation]], had the right to award degrees from 1611 until 1773, when it was combined with the Academy.\n[[File:Poznan Braun Hohenberg.jpg|thumb|290px|Posnania (Pozna\u0144), c. 1617, view from the north]]\nIn the second half of the 17th century and most of the 18th, Pozna\u0144 was severely affected by a series of wars (and attendant military occupations, lootings and destruction) \u2013 the [[Second Northern War|Second]] and [[Third Northern War]]s, the [[War of the Polish Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[Bar Confederation]] rebellion. It was also hit by frequent outbreaks of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], and by floods, particularly that of 1736, which destroyed most of the suburban buildings. The population of the conurbation declined (from 20,000 around 1600 to 6,000 around 1730), and [[Bamberg]]ian and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers (''[[Bambrzy]]'' and ''[[Ol\u0119drzy]]'') were brought in to rebuild the devastated suburbs. In 1778 a \"Committee of Good Order\" (''Komisja Dobrego Porz\u0105dku'') was established in the city, which oversaw rebuilding efforts and reorganised the city's administration. However, in 1793, in the [[Second Partition of Poland]], Pozna\u0144 came under the control of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], becoming part of (and initially the seat of) the province of [[South Prussia]].\n\nThe Prussian authorities expanded the city boundaries, making the walled city and its closest suburbs into a single administrative unit. Left-bank suburbs were incorporated in 1797, and Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Chwaliszewo, \u015ar\u00f3dka, Ostr\u00f3wek and \u0141acina (St. Roch) in 1800. The old city walls were taken down in the early 19th century, and major development took place to the west of the old city, with many of the main streets of today's city centre being laid out.\n\n[[File:Iglesia colegial de Poznan, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 28-30 HDR.jpg|thumb|Details in the interior of the [[Pozna\u0144 Fara|Pozna\u0144 Fara Collegiate Church]], one of the most stunning and best preserved examples of [[Baroque in Poland|baroque architecture in Poland]]. The construction of the temple began in 1651 and took almost half a century to complete]]\n\nIn the [[Greater Poland Uprising of 1806]], Polish soldiers and civilian volunteers assisted the efforts of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] by driving out Prussian forces from the region. The city became a part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in 1807, and was the seat of [[Pozna\u0144 Department]] \u2013 a unit of administrative division and local government. However, in 1815, following the [[Congress of Vienna]], the region was returned to Prussia, and Pozna\u0144 became the capital of the semi-autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Posen]].\n\nThe city continued to expand, and various projects were funded by Polish philanthropists, such as the [[Raczy\u0144ski Library]] and the Bazar hotel. The city's first railway, running to [[Stargard]], opened in 1848. Due to its strategic location, the Prussian authorities intended to make Pozna\u0144 into a fortress city, building a ring of defensive fortifications around it. Work began on the citadel ([[Fort Winiary]]) in 1828, and in subsequent years the entire set of defences (''[[Festung Posen]]'') was completed.\n\nA [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848]] was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Grand Duchy lost its remaining autonomy, Pozna\u0144 becoming simply the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Posen]]. It would become part of the [[German Empire]] with the [[Unification of Germany|unification of German states]] in 1871. Polish patriots continued to form societies (such as the [[Central Economic Society for the Grand Duchy of Pozna\u0144]]), and a [[Polish Theatre in Pozna\u0144|Polish theatre]] (''Teatr Polski'', still functioning) opened in 1875; however the authorities made efforts to [[Germanization|Germanize]] the region, particularly through the [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] (founded 1886). Germans accounted for 38% of the city's population in 1867, though this percentage would later decline somewhat, particularly after the region returned to Poland.\n\nAnother expansion of ''[[Festung Posen]]'' was planned, with an outer ring of more widely spaced forts around the perimeter of the city. Building of the first nine forts began in 1876, and nine intermediate forts were built from 1887. The inner ring of fortifications was now considered obsolete and came to be mostly taken down by the early 20th century (although the citadel remained in use). This made space for further civilian construction, particularly the [[Imperial Castle in Pozna\u0144|Imperial Palace]] (''Zamek''), completed 1910, and other grand buildings around it (including today's central university buildings and the opera house). The city's boundaries were also significantly extended to take in former suburban villages: Piotrowo and Berdychowo in 1896, \u0141azarz, G\u00f3rczyn, [[Je\u017cyce, Pozna\u0144|Je\u017cyce]] and [[Wilda, Pozna\u0144|Wilda]] in 1900, and So\u0142acz in 1907.\n[[File:MTP at night.jpg|thumb|upright|left|240px|[[Pozna\u0144 International Fair]]s were held for the first time in 1925]]\n\nAt the end of [[World War I]], the final [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|Greater Poland Uprising]] (1918\u20131919) brought Pozna\u0144 and most of the region back to newly reborn Poland, which was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The local German populace had to acquire Polish citizenship or leave the country. This led to a wide emigration of the ethnic Germans of the town's population.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The town's German population decreased from 65,321 in 1910 to 5,980 in 1926 and further to 4,387 in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVg_tMs_ZPIC&pg=PA365&dq=Goetheschule+Graudenz#v=onepage&q=adelnau&f=false|title=Polens Politik gegen\u00fcber seiner deutschen Minderheit 1919\u20131939|first1=Albert S.|last1=Kotowski|page=56|publisher=Forschungsstelle Ostmitteleuropa, [[University of Dortmund]] |year=1998 |language=German|ISBN=3-447-03997-3}}</ref> In the interwar [[Second Polish Republic]], the city again became the capital of [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship]]. Pozna\u0144's university (today called [[Adam Mickiewicz University]]) was founded in 1919, and in 1925 the [[Pozna\u0144 International Fairs]] began. In 1929 the fairs site was the venue for a major National Exhibition (''Powszechna Wystawa Krajowa'', popularly ''PeWuKa'') marking the tenth anniversary of independence; it attracted around 4.5 million visitors. The city's boundaries were again expanded in 1925 (to include G\u0142\u00f3wna, Komandoria, [[Rataje, Pozna\u0144|Rataje]], Staro\u0142\u0119ka, D\u0119biec, Szel\u0105g and [[Winogrady]]) and 1933 (Gol\u0119cin, Podolany).\n\nDuring the [[Occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] of 1939\u20131945, Pozna\u0144 was incorporated into the [[Third Reich]] as the capital of ''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]''. Many Polish inhabitants were executed, arrested, expelled to the [[General Government]] or used as forced labour; at the same time many Germans and [[Volksdeutsche]] were settled in the city. The German population increased from around 5,000 in 1939 (some 2% of the inhabitants) to around 95,000 in 1944.<ref>Jerzy Topolski. ''Dzieje Poznania w latach 1793\u20131945: 1918\u20131945''.

A [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] was set up in [[Fort VII]], one of the 19th-century perimeter forts. The camp was later moved to [[\u017babikowo, Lubo\u0144|\u017babikowo]] south of Pozna\u0144. The Nazi authorities significantly expanded Pozna\u0144's boundaries to include most of the present-day area of the city; these boundaries were retained after the war. Pozna\u0144 was captured by the [[Red Army]], assisted by Polish volunteers, on 23 February 1945 following the [[Battle of Pozna\u0144 (1945)|Battle of Pozna\u0144]], in which the German army conducted a last-ditch defence in line with Hitler's designation of the city as a ''[[German World War II strongholds|Festung]]''. The [[Pozna\u0144 Citadel|Citadel]] was the last point to be taken, and the fighting left much of the city, particularly the Old Town, in ruins.\n\nDue to the [[expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II|expulsion and flight of German population]] Pozna\u0144's post-war population was almost uniformly Polish. The city again became a voivodeship capital; in 1950 the size of [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship]] was reduced, and the city itself was given separate voivodeship status. This status was lost in the 1975 reforms, which also significantly reduced the size of Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship.\n[[File:Poznan_1956.jpg|thumb|[[Pozna\u0144 protests of 1956]]. The sign reads \"We demand bread!\".]]\nThe [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]] are seen as an early instance of discontent with communist rule. In June 1956, a protest by workers at the city's [[Cegielski]] locomotive factory developed into a series of strikes and popular protests against the policies of the government. After a protest march on 28 June was fired on, crowds attacked the communist party and secret police headquarters, where they were repulsed by gunfire. Riots continued for two days until being quelled by the army; 67 people were killed according to official figures. A monument to the victims was erected in 1981 at Plac Mickiewicza.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/poland/wielkopolska/poznan/sights/landmarks-monuments/monument-victims-june-1956 |title=Monument to the Victims of June 1956 |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=28 June 1981 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe post-war years had seen much reconstruction work on buildings damaged in the fighting. From the 1960s onwards intensive housing development took place, consisting mainly of [[Panelak|pre-fabricated concrete blocks of flats]], especially in [[Rataje, Pozna\u0144|Rataje]] and [[Winogrady]], and later (following its incorporation into the city in 1974) [[Pi\u0105tkowo, Pozna\u0144|Pi\u0105tkowo]]. Another infrastructural change (completed in 1968) was the rerouting of the river [[Warta]] to follow two straight branches either side of Ostr\u00f3w Tumski.\n\nThe most recent expansion of the city's boundaries took place in 1987, with the addition of new areas mainly to the north, including [[Morasko]], Radojewo and [[Kiekrz]]. The first free local elections following the [[fall of communism]] took place in 1990. With the [[Polish local government reforms]] of 1999, Pozna\u0144 again became the capital of a larger province ([[Greater Poland Voivodeship]]). It also became the seat of a ''[[powiat]]'' (\"[[Pozna\u0144 County]]\"), with the city itself gaining separate ''powiat'' status.\n\nRecent infrastructural developments include the opening of the fast tram route (''[[Pozna\u0144ski Szybki Tramwaj]]'', popularly ''Pestka'') in 1997, and Pozna\u0144's first [[motorway]] connection (part of the [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 ''autostrada'']]) in 2003. In 2006 Poland's first [[F-16 Fighting Falcons]] came to be stationed at the [[31st Air Base]] in [[Nowe Miasto, Pozna\u0144|Krzesiny]] in the south-east of the city.\n\nPozna\u0144 continues to host regular trade fairs and international events, including the [[2008 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in 2008. It was one of the host cities for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Na_Polwiejskiej..._Poznan.jpg|thumb|P\u00f3\u0142wiejska Street is one of the city's many pedestrianised central streets.]]\n\nPozna\u0144 covers an area of {{convert|261.3|km2|1|abbr=on}}, and has coordinates in the range 52\u00b017'34<nowiki>''</nowiki>\u201352\u00b030'27<nowiki>''</nowiki>N, 16\u00b044'08<nowiki>''</nowiki>\u201317\u00b004'28<nowiki>''</nowiki>E.

The lowest altitude is {{convert|60|m|0|abbr=on}}, in the [[Warta]] valley.\n[[File:Malta Trybuny Pozna\u0144 RB1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lake Malta]]]]\n\nPozna\u0144's main river is the [[Warta]], which flows through the city from south to north. As it approaches the city centre it divides into two branches, flowing west and east of [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]] (the cathedral island) and meeting again further north. The smaller [[Cybina]] river flows through eastern Pozna\u0144 to meet the east branch of the Warta (that branch is also called Cybina \u2013 its northern section was originally a continuation of that river, while its southern section has been artificially widened to form a main stream of the Warta). Other tributaries of the Warta within Pozna\u0144 are the Junikowo Stream ''(Strumie\u0144 Junikowski)'', which flows through southern Pozna\u0144 from the west, meeting the Warta just outside the city boundary in [[Lubo\u0144]]; the Bogdanka and Wierzbak, formerly two separate tributaries flowing from the north-west and along the north side of the city centre, now with their lower sections diverted underground; the G\u0142\u00f3wna, flowing through the neighbourhood of the same name in north-east Pozna\u0144; and the Rose Stream ''(Strumie\u0144 R\u00f3\u017cany)'' flowing east from Morasko in the north of the city. The course of the Warta in central Pozna\u0144 was formerly quite different from today: the main stream ran between Grobla and Chwaliszewo, which were originally both islands. The branch west of Grobla (the ''Zgni\u0142a Warta'' \u2013 \"rotten Warta\") was filled in late in the 19th century, and the former main stream west of Chwaliszewo was diverted and filled in during the 1960s. This was done partly to prevent floods, which did serious damage to Pozna\u0144 frequently throughout history.\n[[File:Plaza Mayor, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 41.jpg|thumb|The view of Pozna\u0144's Old Town]]\n\nPozna\u0144's largest lake is ''Jezioro Kierskie'' ([[Kiekrz]] Lake) in the extreme north-west of the city (within the city boundaries since 1987). Other large lakes include [[Lake Malta|Malta]] (an artificial lake on the lower Cybina, formed in 1952), ''Jezioro Strzeszy\u0144skie'' (Strzeszyn Lake) on the Bogdanka, and [[Lake Rusa\u0142ka|Rusa\u0142ka]], an artificial lake further down the Bogdanka, formed in 1943. The latter two are popular bathing places. Kiekrz Lake is much used for [[sailing]], while Malta is a competitive [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[canoeing]] venue.\n\nThe city centre (including the [[Pozna\u0144 Old Town|Old Town]], the former islands of Grobla and Chwaliszewo, the main street ''[[\u015awi\u0119ty Marcin]]'' and many other important buildings and districts) lies on the west side of the Warta. Opposite it between the two branches of the Warta is Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, containing [[Pozna\u0144 Cathedral]] and other ecclesiastical buildings, as well as housing and industrial facilities. Facing the cathedral on the east bank of the river is the historic district of [[\u015ar\u00f3dka, Pozna\u0144|\u015ar\u00f3dka]]. Large areas of apartment blocks, built from the 1960s onwards, include [[Rataje, Pozna\u0144|Rataje]] in the east, and [[Winogrady]] and [[Pi\u0105tkowo, Pozna\u0144|Pi\u0105tkowo]] north of the centre. Older residential and commercial districts include those of Wilda, \u0141azarz and G\u00f3rczyn to the south, and Je\u017cyce to the west. There are also significant areas of forest within the city boundaries, particularly in the east adjoining [[Swarz\u0119dz]], and around the lakes in the north-west.\n\nFor more details on Pozna\u0144's geography, see the articles on the five districts: [[Stare Miasto, Pozna\u0144|Stare Miasto]], [[Nowe Miasto, Pozna\u0144|Nowe Miasto]], [[Je\u017cyce, Pozna\u0144|Je\u017cyce]], [[Grunwald, Pozna\u0144|Grunwald]] and [[Wilda, Pozna\u0144|Wilda]].\n{{wide image|Poznan Panorama.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|A [[Panorama|panoramic]] view of Pozna\u0144, taken from the city's north-eastern suburbs in [[Nowe Miasto, Pozna\u0144|Nowe Miasto]]}}\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Pozna\u0144 is within the transition zone between a [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'' to ''Dfb'' although it totally fits in the second in the 0&nbsp;\u00b0C isotherm) and with relatively cold winters and warm summers.

Pozna\u0144}}\n[[File:Poznan dzielnice administracyjne 1990 z nazwami.png|225px|right|Administrative divisions of Pozna\u0144]]\n[[File:Pozna\u0144 Centrum.jpg|thumb|240px|Notable highrises in central Pozna\u0144]]\nPozna\u0144 is divided into 42 neighbourhoods (''see'' [[osiedle]]), each of which has its own elected council with certain decision-making and spending powers. The first uniform elections for these councils covering the whole area of the city were held on 20 March 2011.\n\nFor certain administrative purposes, the old division into five districts ([[dzielnica]]s) is used \u2013 although these ceased to be governmental units in 1990. These were:\n* [[Poznan-Stare Miasto|Stare Miasto]] (\"Old Town\"), population 161,200, area {{convert|47.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the central and northern parts of the city\n* [[Poznan-Nowe Miasto|Nowe Miasto]] (\"New Town\"), population 141,424, area {{convert|105.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, including all parts of the city on the right (east) bank of the [[Warta]]\n* [[Poznan-Grunwald|Grunwald]], population 125,500, area {{convert|36.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the south-western parts of the city\n* [[Poznan-Jezyce|Je\u017cyce]], population 81,300, area {{convert|57.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the north-western parts of the city\n* [[Poznan-Wilda|Wilda]], population 62,290, area {{convert|15.0|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, in the southern part of the city\n\nMany citizens of Pozna\u0144 thanks to the strong economy of the city and high salaries started moving to suburbs of the [[Pozna\u0144 County]] ([[powiat]]) in the 1990s. Although the number of inhabitants in Pozna\u0144 itself was decreasing for the past two decades, the suburbs gained almost twice as many inhabitants. Thus, Pozna\u0144 urban area has been growing steadily over past years and has already reached 1.0 million inhabitants when student population is included, whereas the entire metropolitan zone may have reached 1.5\u20131.7 million inhabitants when satellite cities and towns (so-called second Pozna\u0144 ring counties such as [[Wrze\u015bnia]], [[Gniezno]] and [[Ko\u015bcian]]) are included. The complex infrastructure, population density, number of companies and gross product per capita of Pozna\u0144 suburbs may be only compared to Warsaw suburbs. Many parts of closer suburbs (for example [[Tarnowo Podgorne]], [[Komorniki]], [[Suchy Las]], [[Dopiewo]]) produce more in terms of [[GDP]] per capita than the city itself.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Stary Browar Wn\u0119trze RB1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Stary Browar]] (Old Brewery) in Pozna\u0144]]\n[[File:Pixel building, Poznan.jpg|thumb|Pixel building \u2013 headquarters of [[Allegro (auction website)|Allegro]] company ]]\n\nPozna\u0144 has been an important trade centre since the [[Middle Ages]]. Starting in the 19th century, local heavy industry began to grow. Several major factories were built, including the [[Hipolit Cegielski]] steel mill and railway factory (see [[H. Cegielski - Pozna\u0144 S.A.]]).\n\nNowadays Pozna\u0144 is one of the major trade centres in Poland. Pozna\u0144 is regarded as the second most prosperous city in Poland after [[Warsaw]]. The city of Pozna\u0144 produced PLN 31.8 billion of Poland's [[gross domestic product]] in 2006. It boasts a GDP [[per capita]] of 200,4% (2008) of Poland's average. Furthermore, Pozna\u0144 had very low unemployment rate of 2.3% as of May 2009. For comparison, Poland's national unemployment rate was over 10%.\n\n[[File:Andersia.JPG|thumb|[[Andersia Tower]] (left) and [[Pozna\u0144 Financial Centre]] (right)]]\n\nMany Western European companies have established their Polish headquarters in Pozna\u0144 or in the nearby towns of [[Tarnowo Podg\u00f3rne]] and [[Swarz\u0119dz]]. Most foreign investors are [[Germany|German]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] companies, with a few others. The best known examples of corporation who have their headquarters in Pozna\u0144 and the surrounding areas are that of [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Raben Group]] (near [[K\u00f3rnik]]) and [[Kuehne + Nagel]] (near [[G\u0105dki]]).\n\nInvestors are mostly from the food processing, furniture, automotive and transport and logistics industries. Foreign companies are primarily attracted by low labour costs and by the relatively good road and railway network, good vocational skills of workers and relatively liberal employment laws.\n\nThe recently built [[Stary Browar]] shopping centre contains many high-end shops and is considered one of the best in Europe. It has won an award for the best shopping centre in the world in the medium-sized commercial buildings category. Other notable shopping centres in the city include Galeria Malta, one of the largest in [[Central Europe]], and the shops at the Hotel Bazar, a historical hotel and commercial centre in the Old Town.\n\nSome of the best-known major corporations founded and still based in Pozna\u0144 and the city's metropolitan area include [[Allegro (auction)|Allegro]], Poland's biggest online auction site, [[H. Cegielski-Pozna\u0144 SA]], a historic manufacturer, [[Solaris Bus & Coach]], a modern bus and coach maker based in [[Bolechowo, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Bolechowo]] and [[Enea S.A.]], one of the country's biggest energy firms. Pozna\u0144 is also where the [[software development]] leader [[Netguru]] was founded, one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. [[Kompania Piwowarska]] based in Pozna\u0144 produces some of Poland's best known beers, and includes not only the local [[Lech Browary Wielkopolski|Lech Brewery]] but also [[Tyskie]] from [[Tychy]] and [[Dojlidy Brewery]] from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] among many others.\n\n==Transport==\n{{See also|Tramways in Pozna\u0144}}\nPozna\u0144 has an extensive public transport system, mostly consisting of trams, such as the [[Pozna\u0144 Fast Tram]], and both urban and suburban buses. The main railway station is [[Pozna\u0144 G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Pozna\u0144 Central Station]] to the southwest of the city centre; there is also the smaller ''[[Pozna\u0144 Wsch\u00f3d railway station|Pozna\u0144 Wsch\u00f3d]]'' and ''[[Pozna\u0144 Garbary railway station|Pozna\u0144 Garbary]]'' station northeast of the centre and a number of other stations on the outskirts of the city. The main east-west [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 motorway]] runs south of the city connecting it with [[Berlin]] in the west and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a|\u0141\u00f3d\u017c]] and Warsaw in the east; other main roads run in the direction of [[Warsaw]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[W\u0105growiec]], [[Oborniki]], [[Katowice]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Buk]] and Berlin.\nPozna\u0144 has one of the biggest airports in the west of Poland called [[Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica Airport]]. In 2016 it handled approximately 1.71 million passengers.\n\n{{Gallery|title=|width=180|height=130|lines=1|align=center\n|File:PL A2 Poznan Komorniki.JPG|A2 Motorway in Pozna\u0144\n|File:27 Grudnia, Tramino, Poznan.jpg|[[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris Tramino]] Tram\n|File:Witosa Wiadukt bus stop in Poznan.JPG|[[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris]] Urbino Bus\n|File:PKP ED160-017 27022016.jpg|[[Pozna\u0144 Central Station]]\n|File:EN76 029 in Poznan Glowny.JPG|[[Koleje Wielkopolskie|Greater Poland Railways]]\n}}\n\n==Culture and sights==\n[[File:POZnan-city-logo.jpg|thumb|left|Pozna\u0144's new city logo]]\n{{see also|List of museums in Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 Old Town|Pozna\u0144 Trumpet Call}}\n[[File:Zamek cesarski w Poznaniu 01.JPG|upright|thumb|The former [[Imperial Castle in Pozna\u0144|Imperial Castle]] is now one of Pozna\u0144's premier cultural-theatrical institutions.]]\nPozna\u0144 has many historic buildings and sights, mostly concentrated around the [[Pozna\u0144 Old Town|Old Town]] and other parts of the city centre. Many of these lie on [[the Royal-Imperial Route in Pozna\u0144]] \u2013 a tourist walk leading through the most important parts of the city showing its history, culture and identity. Portions of the city centre are listed as one of Poland's official national [[List of Historical Monuments (Poland)|Historic Monuments]] (''[[Pomnik historii]]''), as designated 28 November 2008, along with other portions of the city's historic core. Its listing is maintained by the [[Narodowy Instytut Dziedzictwa|National Heritage Board of Poland]].\n[[File:Ayuntamiento, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 67-72 HDR.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Pozna\u0144 City Hall]], located on the Old Market Square, used to serve as the Seat of local government until 1939, and now houses a museum]]\nResults of new extensive archaeological research performed on Pozna\u0144's [[Ostrow Tumski, Poznan|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]] by Prof. dr hab. Hanna Kocka-Krec from Instytut Prahistorii [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|UAM]] indicate that Pozna\u0144 indeed was a central site of the early Polish State (recent discovery of first Polish ruler, [[Mieszko I]]'s Palatium). Thus, the [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Tumski]] Island is more important than it was thought previously, and may have been as important as [[Gniezno]] in the Poland of first [[Piasts]]. Though it is currently under construction, [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]] of Pozna\u0144 should soon have a very rich historical exposition and be a very interesting place for visitors. It promises to include many attractions, such as the above-mentioned Cathedral, Church of St. Mary the Virgin, [[Lubranski Academy]] and they opened in 2012 [[Genius Loci Archeological Park]] as well as planned to be opened in 2013 [[Interactive Center of Ostrow Tumski History|Interactive Center of Ostr\u00f3w Tumski History]] (ICHOT) that presents a multimedia museum of the Polish State through many different periods. The Palatium in Pozna\u0144 will be also transformed into a museum, although more funds are needed. When all the expositions are ready, in a couple of years, Ostr\u00f3w Tumski may be as worth visiting as the [[Wawel Castle|Wawel castle]] of Krak\u00f3w. There is a very famous sentence illustrating the importance of Ostr\u00f3w Tumski in Pozna\u0144 by the [[Pope John Paul II]]: \"''Poland began here''\".\n\nA popular venue is [[Lake Malta|Malta]], a park with an artificial lake in its centre. On one bank of the lake there are ski and sleigh slopes (Malta Ski), on the opposite bank a huge complex of swimming pools including an Olympic-size one (Termy Maltanskie).\n\nAn important cultural event in Pozna\u0144 is the annual [[Malta theatre festival|Malta Festival]], which takes place at many city venues, usually in late June and early July. It hosts mainly modern experimental off-theatre performances, often taking place on squares and other public spaces. It also includes cinema, visual, music and dancing events. Malta Theatre Festival gave birth to many off-theater groups, expressing new ideas in an already rich theatrical background of the city. Thus, Pozna\u0144 with a great deal of off-theaters and their performances has recently become a new Polish off-theater performance centre.\n[[File:Poland-00552 - Whipping Post (29733262383).jpg|left|thumb|220px|[[Pozna\u0144 Old Town]], filled with many picturesque [[townhouse]]s, is a major tourist attraction]]\nClassical music events include the [[Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition]] (held every 5 years), and classical music concerts by the city's [[Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic|Philharmonic Orchestra]] held each month in the University ''Aula''.

Pozna\u0144 is also known for its rock music performers ([[Muchy (band)|Muchy]], Malgorzata Ostrowska).\n\nPozna\u0144 apart from many traditional theatres with a long history (\"Teatr Nowy\", \"[[Grand Theatre, Pozna\u0144|Teatr Wielki]]\", \"[[Polish Theatre in Pozna\u0144|Teatr Polski]]\", \"Teatr Muzyczny\" and several others) is also home to a growing number of alternative theatre groups, some of them stemming from International Malta Festival: \"Teatr Strefa Ciszy\", \"Teatr Porywcze Cial\", \"Teatr Usta Usta\", \"Teatr u Przyjaciol\", \"[[Teatr Biuro Podrozy]]\", \"Teatr Osmego Dnia\" and many others \u2013 it is believed that even up to 30 more or less known groups may work in the city.\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb| ''[[St. Martin's croissant]]'']]\nEvery year on [[November 11|11 November]], Poznanians celebrate The [[St. Martin's Day|Day of St. Martin]].

The [[Rozbrat]] social centre, a [[Squatting|squatted]] former factory in [[Je\u017cyce, Pozna\u0144|Je\u017cyce]], serves as a home for independent and open-minded culture. It hosts frequent gigs, an anarchistic library, vernissages, exhibitions, annual birthday festival (each October), poetry evenings and graffiti festivals. The city centre has many clubs, pubs and coffee houses, mainly in the area of the Old Town.\n\nThe city is also home to one of the oldest [[zoological garden]]s in Poland, the [[Old Zoo (Poznan)|Old Zoo in Pozna\u0144]], which was established in 1874.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.zoo.poznan.pl/page/view/7-English_Version |title=Welcome to Pozna\u0144 ZOO |access-date=2018-08-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Gra\u017cyna Kulczyk]]'s effort to build the [[Museum of Contemporary and Performance Arts]] in Pozna\u0144 was rejected.<ref name=Adam>{{cite news|last1=Adam|first1=Georgina|title=Grazyna Kulczyk's collection on show at Boadilla del Monte, Madrid|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/475032c4-9966-11e3-b3a2-00144feab7de.html|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=7 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=Joanna>{{cite news|last1=Berendt|first1=Joanna|title=\nPolish Philanthropist, Grazyna Kulczyk, Is Seeking to Open Museum in Warsaw|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/polish-philanthropist-grazyna-kulczyk-is-seeking-to-open-museum-in-warsaw/|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=New York Times|date=30 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46157435-a-chip-shop-in-pozna ''A Chip Shop in Poznan: My Unlikely Year in Poland''] is a travel book published in 2019, which details British author Ben Aitken's experience of being an immigrant in the city.

The number of students in the city of Pozna\u0144 is about 140,000 (fourth/third after Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and close to Wroc\u0142aw student population). Every one of four inhabitants in Pozna\u0144 is a student.\n\nSince Pozna\u0144 is smaller than [[Warsaw]] or [[Cracow|Krak\u00f3w]] still having a very large number of students it makes the city even more vibrant and dense academic hub than both former and current capitals of Poland. Pozna\u0144, with its almost 30 colleges and universities, has the second richest educational offering in Poland after Warsaw.\n\n===Public universities===\nThe city has many state-owned [[university|universities]].

The majority of faculties are already open, although a few more facilities will be constructed. The campus infrastructure belongs to the most impressive among Polish universities. Also, there are plans for \"Uniwersytecki Park Historii Ziemii\" (Earth History Park), one of the reason for the park construction is a \"[[Morasko meteorite nature reserve]]\" situated close by, it is one of the rare sites of Europe where a number of meteorites fell and some traces may be still seen.\n\n===Private higher education===\n[[File:Poznan-Wyz_Szk_Nauk_Hum_i_Dzienn.jpg|thumb|[[Collegium Da Vinci]]]]\nThere is also a great number of smaller, mostly private-run colleges and institutions of higher education ''(\"Uczelnie\")'':\n\n* [[University of Social Sciences and Humanities]]\n*[[Collegium Da Vinci]]\n* Pozna\u0144ska Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Biznesu i J\u0119zyk\u00f3w Obcych\n* Schola Posnaniensis - Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Sztuki Stosowanej\n* Wielkopolska Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Turystyki i Zarz\u0105dzania\n* [[WSB Universities|Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Bankowa w Poznaniu]]<ref>[http://www.wsb.pl/english/about-wsb-group/wsb-poznan WSB University in Pozna\u0144] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301124949/http://www.wsb.pl/english/about-wsb-group/wsb-poznan |date=1 March 2016 }} \u2013 WSB Universities</ref>\n** Branch in [[Chorz\u00f3w]]\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Handlu i Us\u0142ug\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Umiej\u0119tno\u015bci Spo\u0142ecznych\n** Branch in [[Katowice]]\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Zarz\u0105dzania i Bankowo\u015bci\n** [[Wroc\u0142aw]] branch\n* [[\u00c9cole Franco-Polonaise]] - closed in 1997\n* Arcybiskupie Seminarium Duchowne w Poznaniu\n* Wielkopolska Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Turystyki i Zarz\u0105dzania w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Biznesu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Bezpiecze\u0144stwa w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Edukacji i Terapii w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Edukacji Integracyjnej i Interkulturowej w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Handlu i Rachunkowo\u015bci\n** Branch in [[Wrze\u015bnia]]\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Hotelarstwa i Gastronomii\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a J\u0119zyk\u00f3w Obcych im.

Lech plays at the [[Stadion Miejski (Pozna\u0144)|Municipal Stadium]], which hosted the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 European Championship]] group stages as well as the opening game and the final of the [[2006 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|U-19 Euro Championship]] in June 2006. Warta plays at the small [[D\u0119bi\u0144ska Road Stadium]]; a former training ground for [[Edmund Szyc Stadium]] however since the latter fell into disrepair in 1998 and was sold in 2001 it became the team's main ground;\nthe club does have aims to restore and return to the historical 60 000 capacity stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazyn.wp.pl/artykul/widok-jak-z-horroru-w-samym-centrum-miasta-stadion-ktory-straszy-od-lat|title=Widok jak z horroru w samym centrum miasta.

The club is a large sports complex surrounded by [[Lake Rusa\u0142ka]], and apart from the tennis facilities boasts a large city recreation area: [[mountain biking]] facilities including a [[four-cross]] track; an [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] stadium (capacity 3000); and a [[association football|football]]-[[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] stadium (capacity 20 000), which fell into vast disrepair until it was acquired by the city council from the police in 2013 and was renovated. The football-speedway stadium hosts [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] club [[PS\u017b Pozna\u0144]], [[rugby union]] side [[Chaos Pozna\u0144|NKR Chaos]], [[American football]] team the Pozna\u0144 Patriots, and [[association football|football]] team Poznaniak Pozna\u0144.\n\nThe city has the largest circuit in Poland, [[Tor Pozna\u0144]], located in the suburbs in [[Prze\u017amierowo]]. [[Lake Malta]] hosted the [[World Rowing Championships]] in 2009 and has previously hosted some regattas in the [[Rowing World Cup]]. It also hosted the [[ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships]] ([[canoe racing|sprint canoe]]) in [[1990 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|1990]] and [[2001 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2001]], and again in [[2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2010]]. Also near the lake the \"Malta Ski\" [[Dry slope skiing|year-long skiing complex]] hosts minor sport competitions, and is also equipped with a [[toboggan run]] and a [[minigolf]] course. There is also a roller rink with a [[roller skating]] club nearby.\n\nPozna\u0144 has experience as a host for international sporting events such as the official [[2009 EuroBasket]].<ref>[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/sid/6328/_/index.html 2009 EuroBasket], ARCHIVE.FIBA.com, Retrieved 5 June 2016.</ref>\n\nThe city is also considered to be the hotbed of Polish [[field hockey]], with several top teams: [[Warta Pozna\u0144]]; [[Grunwald Pozna\u0144]]; which also has [[shooting]], [[wrestling]], [[team handball|handball]] and [[tennis]] sections; [[Pocztowiec Pozna\u0144]]; and [[AZS AWF Pozna\u0144]], the student club which also fields professional teams in women's [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]] ([[AZS Pozna\u0144]]).\n\nOther clubs include: [[Posnania Pozna\u0144]], one of the best [[rugby union]] clubs in the country; [[Polonia Pozna\u0144]], formerly a [[multi-sports club]] with many successes in rugby, however today only a football section remains; [[KKS Wiara Lecha]], football club formed by the supporters of [[Lech Pozna\u0144]]; and [[Odlew Pozna\u0144]], arguably the most famous amateur club in the country due to their extensive media coverage and humorous exploits. There are also numerous [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[synchronised swimming]] clubs, as well as numerous less notable amateur [[association football|football]] teams.\n\nPozna\u0144 bid for the [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics]] but lost to [[Nanjing]], with the [[China|Chinese]] city receiving 47 votes over Pozna\u0144's 42.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n[[File:Stare Miasto w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|280px|Old Town and city hall]]\nSince the end of the [[People's Republic of Poland|communist era]] in 1989, Pozna\u0144 municipality and suburban area have invested heavily in infrastructure, especially public transport and administration. There is massive investment from foreign companies in Pozna\u0144 as well as in communities west and south of Pozna\u0144 (namely, [[K\u00f3rnik]] and [[Tarnowo Podg\u00f3rne]]).\n\nCity investments into transportation were mostly into public transport. While the number of cars since 1989 has at least doubled, municipal policy concentrated on improving public transport. Limiting car access to the city centre, building new [[tram]] lines (including [[Pozna\u0144ski Szybki Tramwaj]]) and investing in new rolling stock (such as modern [[Combino]] trams by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris]] low-floor buses) actually increased the level of ridership.\n\nFuture investments into transportation include the construction of a third bypass of Pozna\u0144, and the completion of [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 (E30)]] motorway towards Berlin. New cycle lanes are being built, linking to existing ones, and an attempt is currently being made to develop a [[Karlsruhe]]-style [[light rail]] system for commuters. All this is made more complicated (and more expensive) by the heavy neglect of transport infrastructure throughout the Communist era.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and

The phrase ''in Poznan'' appears in 1146 and 1244.\n\nThe city's full official name is ''Sto\u0142eczne Miasto Pozna\u0144'' (\"The Capital City of Pozna\u0144\"), in reference to its role as a centre of political power in the [[Piast Poland|early Polish state]]. Pozna\u0144 is known as ''Posen'' in [[German language|German]], and was officially called ''Haupt- und Residenzstadt Posen'' (\"Capital and Residence City of Pozna\u0144\") between 20 August 1910 and 28 November 1918. The [[Latin]] names of the city are ''Posnania'' and ''Civitas Posnaniensis''. Its [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name is {{lang|yi|\u05e4\u05bc\u05f1\u05d6\u05df}}, or ''Poyzn''.\n\nIn Polish, the city name has masculine [[grammatical gender]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Pozna\u0144|Timeline of Pozna\u0144|Historical population of Pozna\u0144}}\n[[File:Z\u0142ota Kaplica Pozna\u0144 RB1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Monument of [[Mieszko I]] and [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], Golden Chapel in [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 Cathedral]]]]\nFor centuries before the Christianization of Poland, Pozna\u0144 (consisting of a fortified stronghold between the [[Warta]] and [[Cybina]] rivers, on what is now [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]]) was an important cultural and political centre of the [[Polans (western)|Polan]] tribe. [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the first historically recorded ruler of the Polans, and of the early Polish state which they dominated, built one of his main stable headquarters in Pozna\u0144. [[Christianization of Poland|Mieszko's baptism]] of 966, seen as a defining moment in the Christianization of the Polish state, may have taken place in Pozna\u0144.\n\nFollowing the baptism, construction began of [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144's cathedral]], the first in Poland. Pozna\u0144 was probably the main seat of the first missionary bishop sent to Poland, [[Bishop Jordan]]. The [[Congress of Gniezno]] in 1000 led to the country's first permanent [[archbishopric]] being established in [[Gniezno]] (which is generally regarded as Poland's capital in that period), although Pozna\u0144 continued to have independent bishops of its own. Pozna\u0144's cathedral was the place of burial of the early [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] monarchs (Mieszko I, [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus I]], [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]]), and later of [[Przemys\u0142 I of Poland|Przemys\u0142 I]] and King [[Przemys\u0142 II of Poland|Przemys\u0142 II]].\n[[File:Grobowiec Mieszka I i Boles\u0142awa I Chrobrego.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of Mieszko I and Boles\u0142aw I in [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 Cathedral]]]]\nThe [[pagan reaction in Poland|pagan reaction]] that followed Mieszko II's death (probably in Pozna\u0144) in 1034 left the region weak, and in 1038, Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] of [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]] sacked and destroyed both Pozna\u0144 and Gniezno. Poland was reunited under [[Casimir the Restorer|Casimir I the Restorer]] in 1039, but the capital was moved to [[Krak\u00f3w]], which had been relatively unaffected by the troubles.\nIn 1138, by the [[testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty|testament of Boles\u0142aw III]], Poland was divided into separate duchies under the late king's sons, and Pozna\u0144 and its surroundings became the domain of [[Mieszko III the Old]], the first of the [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Dukes of Greater Poland]]. This period of fragmentation lasted until 1320. Duchies frequently changed hands; control of Pozna\u0144, Gniezno and [[Kalisz]] sometimes lay with a single duke, but at other times these constituted separate duchies.\n\nIn about 1249, Duke [[Przemys\u0142 I]] began constructing what would become the [[Royal Castle, Poznan|Royal Castle]] on a hill on the left bank of the Warta. Then in 1253 Przemys\u0142 issued a charter to Thomas of [[Guben]] (Gubin) for the founding of a town under [[Magdeburg law]], between the castle and the river. Thomas brought a large number of German settlers to aid in the building and settlement of the city \u2013 this is an example of the German eastern migration (''[[Ostsiedlung]]'') characteristic of that period.<ref name=Brather87156159>{{cite book|last=Brather|first=Sebastian|title=Arch\u00e4ologie der westlichen Slawen.

The city's importance began to grow in the [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonian]] period, due to its position on trading routes from [[Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and [[Ruthenia]] to western Europe. It would become a major centre for the [[fur trade]] by the late 16th century. Suburban settlements developed around the city walls, on the river islands and on the right bank, with some (Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, [[\u015ar\u00f3dka, Pozna\u0144|\u015ar\u00f3dka]], Chwaliszewo, Ostr\u00f3wek) obtaining their own town charters. However the city's development was hampered by regular major fires and floods. On 2 May 1536 a fire destroyed 175 buildings, including the castle, the town hall, the monastery and the suburban settlement called St. Martin.<ref>J. Perles: ''Geschichte der Juden in Posen''.

However a [[Jesuits]]' college, founded in the city in 1571 during the [[Counter-Reformation]], had the right to award degrees from 1611 until 1773, when it was combined with the Academy.\n[[File:Poznan Braun Hohenberg.jpg|thumb|290px|Posnania (Pozna\u0144), c. 1617, view from the north]]\nIn the second half of the 17th century and most of the 18th, Pozna\u0144 was severely affected by a series of wars (and attendant military occupations, lootings and destruction) \u2013 the [[Second Northern War|Second]] and [[Third Northern War]]s, the [[War of the Polish Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[Bar Confederation]] rebellion. It was also hit by frequent outbreaks of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], and by floods, particularly that of 1736, which destroyed most of the suburban buildings. The population of the conurbation declined (from 20,000 around 1600 to 6,000 around 1730), and [[Bamberg]]ian and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers (''[[Bambrzy]]'' and ''[[Ol\u0119drzy]]'') were brought in to rebuild the devastated suburbs. In 1778 a \"Committee of Good Order\" (''Komisja Dobrego Porz\u0105dku'') was established in the city, which oversaw rebuilding efforts and reorganised the city's administration. However, in 1793, in the [[Second Partition of Poland]], Pozna\u0144 came under the control of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], becoming part of (and initially the seat of) the province of [[South Prussia]].\n\nThe Prussian authorities expanded the city boundaries, making the walled city and its closest suburbs into a single administrative unit. Left-bank suburbs were incorporated in 1797, and Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Chwaliszewo, \u015ar\u00f3dka, Ostr\u00f3wek and \u0141acina (St. Roch) in 1800. The old city walls were taken down in the early 19th century, and major development took place to the west of the old city, with many of the main streets of today's city centre being laid out.\n\n[[File:Iglesia colegial de Poznan, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 28-30 HDR.jpg|thumb|Details in the interior of the [[Pozna\u0144 Fara|Pozna\u0144 Fara Collegiate Church]], one of the most stunning and best preserved examples of [[Baroque in Poland|baroque architecture in Poland]]. The construction of the temple began in 1651 and took almost half a century to complete]]\n\nIn the [[Greater Poland Uprising of 1806]], Polish soldiers and civilian volunteers assisted the efforts of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] by driving out Prussian forces from the region. The city became a part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in 1807, and was the seat of [[Pozna\u0144 Department]] \u2013 a unit of administrative division and local government. However, in 1815, following the [[Congress of Vienna]], the region was returned to Prussia, and Pozna\u0144 became the capital of the semi-autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Posen]].\n\nThe city continued to expand, and various projects were funded by Polish philanthropists, such as the [[Raczy\u0144ski Library]] and the Bazar hotel. The city's first railway, running to [[Stargard]], opened in 1848. Due to its strategic location, the Prussian authorities intended to make Pozna\u0144 into a fortress city, building a ring of defensive fortifications around it. Work began on the citadel ([[Fort Winiary]]) in 1828, and in subsequent years the entire set of defences (''[[Festung Posen]]'') was completed.\n\nA [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848]] was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Grand Duchy lost its remaining autonomy, Pozna\u0144 becoming simply the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Posen]]. It would become part of the [[German Empire]] with the [[Unification of Germany|unification of German states]] in 1871. Polish patriots continued to form societies (such as the [[Central Economic Society for the Grand Duchy of Pozna\u0144]]), and a [[Polish Theatre in Pozna\u0144|Polish theatre]] (''Teatr Polski'', still functioning) opened in 1875; however the authorities made efforts to [[Germanization|Germanize]] the region, particularly through the [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] (founded 1886). Germans accounted for 38% of the city's population in 1867, though this percentage would later decline somewhat, particularly after the region returned to Poland.\n\nAnother expansion of ''[[Festung Posen]]'' was planned, with an outer ring of more widely spaced forts around the perimeter of the city. Building of the first nine forts began in 1876, and nine intermediate forts were built from 1887. The inner ring of fortifications was now considered obsolete and came to be mostly taken down by the early 20th century (although the citadel remained in use). This made space for further civilian construction, particularly the [[Imperial Castle in Pozna\u0144|Imperial Palace]] (''Zamek''), completed 1910, and other grand buildings around it (including today's central university buildings and the opera house). The city's boundaries were also significantly extended to take in former suburban villages: Piotrowo and Berdychowo in 1896, \u0141azarz, G\u00f3rczyn, [[Je\u017cyce, Pozna\u0144|Je\u017cyce]] and [[Wilda, Pozna\u0144|Wilda]] in 1900, and So\u0142acz in 1907.\n[[File:MTP at night.jpg|thumb|upright|left|240px|[[Pozna\u0144 International Fair]]s were held for the first time in 1925]]\n\nAt the end of [[World War I]], the final [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|Greater Poland Uprising]] (1918\u20131919) brought Pozna\u0144 and most of the region back to newly reborn Poland, which was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The local German populace had to acquire Polish citizenship or leave the country. This led to a wide emigration of the ethnic Germans of the town's population.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The town's German population decreased from 65,321 in 1910 to 5,980 in 1926 and further to 4,387 in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVg_tMs_ZPIC&pg=PA365&dq=Goetheschule+Graudenz#v=onepage&q=adelnau&f=false|title=Polens Politik gegen\u00fcber seiner deutschen Minderheit 1919\u20131939|first1=Albert S.|last1=Kotowski|page=56|publisher=Forschungsstelle Ostmitteleuropa, [[University of Dortmund]] |year=1998 |language=German|ISBN=3-447-03997-3}}</ref> In the interwar [[Second Polish Republic]], the city again became the capital of [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship]]. Pozna\u0144's university (today called [[Adam Mickiewicz University]]) was founded in 1919, and in 1925 the [[Pozna\u0144 International Fairs]] began. In 1929 the fairs site was the venue for a major National Exhibition (''Powszechna Wystawa Krajowa'', popularly ''PeWuKa'') marking the tenth anniversary of independence; it attracted around 4.5 million visitors. The city's boundaries were again expanded in 1925 (to include G\u0142\u00f3wna, Komandoria, [[Rataje, Pozna\u0144|Rataje]], Staro\u0142\u0119ka, D\u0119biec, Szel\u0105g and [[Winogrady]]) and 1933 (Gol\u0119cin, Podolany).\n\nDuring the [[Occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] of 1939\u20131945, Pozna\u0144 was incorporated into the [[Third Reich]] as the capital of ''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]''. Many Polish inhabitants were executed, arrested, expelled to the [[General Government]] or used as forced labour; at the same time many Germans and [[Volksdeutsche]] were settled in the city. The German population increased from around 5,000 in 1939 (some 2% of the inhabitants) to around 95,000 in 1944.<ref>Jerzy Topolski. ''Dzieje Poznania w latach 1793\u20131945: 1918\u20131945''.

The camp was later moved to [[\u017babikowo, Lubo\u0144|\u017babikowo]] south of Pozna\u0144. The Nazi authorities significantly expanded Pozna\u0144's boundaries to include most of the present-day area of the city; these boundaries were retained after the war. Pozna\u0144 was captured by the [[Red Army]], assisted by Polish volunteers, on 23 February 1945 following the [[Battle of Pozna\u0144 (1945)|Battle of Pozna\u0144]], in which the German army conducted a last-ditch defence in line with Hitler's designation of the city as a ''[[German World War II strongholds|Festung]]''. The [[Pozna\u0144 Citadel|Citadel]] was the last point to be taken, and the fighting left much of the city, particularly the Old Town, in ruins.\n\nDue to the [[expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II|expulsion and flight of German population]] Pozna\u0144's post-war population was almost uniformly Polish. The city again became a voivodeship capital; in 1950 the size of [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship]] was reduced, and the city itself was given separate voivodeship status. This status was lost in the 1975 reforms, which also significantly reduced the size of Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship.\n[[File:Poznan_1956.jpg|thumb|[[Pozna\u0144 protests of 1956]]. The sign reads \"We demand bread!\".]]\nThe [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]] are seen as an early instance of discontent with communist rule. In June 1956, a protest by workers at the city's [[Cegielski]] locomotive factory developed into a series of strikes and popular protests against the policies of the government. After a protest march on 28 June was fired on, crowds attacked the communist party and secret police headquarters, where they were repulsed by gunfire. Riots continued for two days until being quelled by the army; 67 people were killed according to official figures. A monument to the victims was erected in 1981 at Plac Mickiewicza.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/poland/wielkopolska/poznan/sights/landmarks-monuments/monument-victims-june-1956 |title=Monument to the Victims of June 1956 |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=28 June 1981 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe post-war years had seen much reconstruction work on buildings damaged in the fighting. From the 1960s onwards intensive housing development took place, consisting mainly of [[Panelak|pre-fabricated concrete blocks of flats]], especially in [[Rataje, Pozna\u0144|Rataje]] and [[Winogrady]], and later (following its incorporation into the city in 1974) [[Pi\u0105tkowo, Pozna\u0144|Pi\u0105tkowo]]. Another infrastructural change (completed in 1968) was the rerouting of the river [[Warta]] to follow two straight branches either side of Ostr\u00f3w Tumski.\n\nThe most recent expansion of the city's boundaries took place in 1987, with the addition of new areas mainly to the north, including [[Morasko]], Radojewo and [[Kiekrz]]. The first free local elections following the [[fall of communism]] took place in 1990. With the [[Polish local government reforms]] of 1999, Pozna\u0144 again became the capital of a larger province ([[Greater Poland Voivodeship]]). It also became the seat of a ''[[powiat]]'' (\"[[Pozna\u0144 County]]\"), with the city itself gaining separate ''powiat'' status.\n\nRecent infrastructural developments include the opening of the fast tram route (''[[Pozna\u0144ski Szybki Tramwaj]]'', popularly ''Pestka'') in 1997, and Pozna\u0144's first [[motorway]] connection (part of the [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 ''autostrada'']]) in 2003. In 2006 Poland's first [[F-16 Fighting Falcons]] came to be stationed at the [[31st Air Base]] in [[Nowe Miasto, Pozna\u0144|Krzesiny]] in the south-east of the city.\n\nPozna\u0144 continues to host regular trade fairs and international events, including the [[2008 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in 2008. It was one of the host cities for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Na_Polwiejskiej..._Poznan.jpg|thumb|P\u00f3\u0142wiejska Street is one of the city's many pedestrianised central streets.]]\n\nPozna\u0144 covers an area of {{convert|261.3|km2|1|abbr=on}}, and has coordinates in the range 52\u00b017'34<nowiki>''</nowiki>\u201352\u00b030'27<nowiki>''</nowiki>N, 16\u00b044'08<nowiki>''</nowiki>\u201317\u00b004'28<nowiki>''</nowiki>E.

As it approaches the city centre it divides into two branches, flowing west and east of [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]] (the cathedral island) and meeting again further north. The smaller [[Cybina]] river flows through eastern Pozna\u0144 to meet the east branch of the Warta (that branch is also called Cybina \u2013 its northern section was originally a continuation of that river, while its southern section has been artificially widened to form a main stream of the Warta). Other tributaries of the Warta within Pozna\u0144 are the Junikowo Stream ''(Strumie\u0144 Junikowski)'', which flows through southern Pozna\u0144 from the west, meeting the Warta just outside the city boundary in [[Lubo\u0144]]; the Bogdanka and Wierzbak, formerly two separate tributaries flowing from the north-west and along the north side of the city centre, now with their lower sections diverted underground; the G\u0142\u00f3wna, flowing through the neighbourhood of the same name in north-east Pozna\u0144; and the Rose Stream ''(Strumie\u0144 R\u00f3\u017cany)'' flowing east from Morasko in the north of the city. The course of the Warta in central Pozna\u0144 was formerly quite different from today: the main stream ran between Grobla and Chwaliszewo, which were originally both islands. The branch west of Grobla (the ''Zgni\u0142a Warta'' \u2013 \"rotten Warta\") was filled in late in the 19th century, and the former main stream west of Chwaliszewo was diverted and filled in during the 1960s. This was done partly to prevent floods, which did serious damage to Pozna\u0144 frequently throughout history.\n[[File:Plaza Mayor, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 41.jpg|thumb|The view of Pozna\u0144's Old Town]]\n\nPozna\u0144's largest lake is ''Jezioro Kierskie'' ([[Kiekrz]] Lake) in the extreme north-west of the city (within the city boundaries since 1987). Other large lakes include [[Lake Malta|Malta]] (an artificial lake on the lower Cybina, formed in 1952), ''Jezioro Strzeszy\u0144skie'' (Strzeszyn Lake) on the Bogdanka, and [[Lake Rusa\u0142ka|Rusa\u0142ka]], an artificial lake further down the Bogdanka, formed in 1943. The latter two are popular bathing places. Kiekrz Lake is much used for [[sailing]], while Malta is a competitive [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[canoeing]] venue.\n\nThe city centre (including the [[Pozna\u0144 Old Town|Old Town]], the former islands of Grobla and Chwaliszewo, the main street ''[[\u015awi\u0119ty Marcin]]'' and many other important buildings and districts) lies on the west side of the Warta. Opposite it between the two branches of the Warta is Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, containing [[Pozna\u0144 Cathedral]] and other ecclesiastical buildings, as well as housing and industrial facilities. Facing the cathedral on the east bank of the river is the historic district of [[\u015ar\u00f3dka, Pozna\u0144|\u015ar\u00f3dka]]. Large areas of apartment blocks, built from the 1960s onwards, include [[Rataje, Pozna\u0144|Rataje]] in the east, and [[Winogrady]] and [[Pi\u0105tkowo, Pozna\u0144|Pi\u0105tkowo]] north of the centre. Older residential and commercial districts include those of Wilda, \u0141azarz and G\u00f3rczyn to the south, and Je\u017cyce to the west.

Pozna\u0144}}\n[[File:Poznan dzielnice administracyjne 1990 z nazwami.png|225px|right|Administrative divisions of Pozna\u0144]]\n[[File:Pozna\u0144 Centrum.jpg|thumb|240px|Notable highrises in central Pozna\u0144]]\nPozna\u0144 is divided into 42 neighbourhoods (''see'' [[osiedle]]), each of which has its own elected council with certain decision-making and spending powers. The first uniform elections for these councils covering the whole area of the city were held on 20 March 2011.\n\nFor certain administrative purposes, the old division into five districts ([[dzielnica]]s) is used \u2013 although these ceased to be governmental units in 1990. These were:\n* [[Poznan-Stare Miasto|Stare Miasto]] (\"Old Town\"), population 161,200, area {{convert|47.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the central and northern parts of the city\n* [[Poznan-Nowe Miasto|Nowe Miasto]] (\"New Town\"), population 141,424, area {{convert|105.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, including all parts of the city on the right (east) bank of the [[Warta]]\n* [[Poznan-Grunwald|Grunwald]], population 125,500, area {{convert|36.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the south-western parts of the city\n* [[Poznan-Jezyce|Je\u017cyce]], population 81,300, area {{convert|57.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, covering the north-western parts of the city\n* [[Poznan-Wilda|Wilda]], population 62,290, area {{convert|15.0|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, in the southern part of the city\n\nMany citizens of Pozna\u0144 thanks to the strong economy of the city and high salaries started moving to suburbs of the [[Pozna\u0144 County]] ([[powiat]]) in the 1990s. Although the number of inhabitants in Pozna\u0144 itself was decreasing for the past two decades, the suburbs gained almost twice as many inhabitants. Thus, Pozna\u0144 urban area has been growing steadily over past years and has already reached 1.0 million inhabitants when student population is included, whereas the entire metropolitan zone may have reached 1.5\u20131.7 million inhabitants when satellite cities and towns (so-called second Pozna\u0144 ring counties such as [[Wrze\u015bnia]], [[Gniezno]] and [[Ko\u015bcian]]) are included. The complex infrastructure, population density, number of companies and gross product per capita of Pozna\u0144 suburbs may be only compared to Warsaw suburbs. Many parts of closer suburbs (for example [[Tarnowo Podgorne]], [[Komorniki]], [[Suchy Las]], [[Dopiewo]]) produce more in terms of [[GDP]] per capita than the city itself.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Stary Browar Wn\u0119trze RB1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Stary Browar]] (Old Brewery) in Pozna\u0144]]\n[[File:Pixel building, Poznan.jpg|thumb|Pixel building \u2013 headquarters of [[Allegro (auction website)|Allegro]] company ]]\n\nPozna\u0144 has been an important trade centre since the [[Middle Ages]]. Starting in the 19th century, local heavy industry began to grow. Several major factories were built, including the [[Hipolit Cegielski]] steel mill and railway factory (see [[H. Cegielski - Pozna\u0144 S.A.]]).\n\nNowadays Pozna\u0144 is one of the major trade centres in Poland. Pozna\u0144 is regarded as the second most prosperous city in Poland after [[Warsaw]]. The city of Pozna\u0144 produced PLN 31.8 billion of Poland's [[gross domestic product]] in 2006. It boasts a GDP [[per capita]] of 200,4% (2008) of Poland's average. Furthermore, Pozna\u0144 had very low unemployment rate of 2.3% as of May 2009. For comparison, Poland's national unemployment rate was over 10%.\n\n[[File:Andersia.JPG|thumb|[[Andersia Tower]] (left) and [[Pozna\u0144 Financial Centre]] (right)]]\n\nMany Western European companies have established their Polish headquarters in Pozna\u0144 or in the nearby towns of [[Tarnowo Podg\u00f3rne]] and [[Swarz\u0119dz]]. Most foreign investors are [[Germany|German]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] companies, with a few others. The best known examples of corporation who have their headquarters in Pozna\u0144 and the surrounding areas are that of [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Raben Group]] (near [[K\u00f3rnik]]) and [[Kuehne + Nagel]] (near [[G\u0105dki]]).\n\nInvestors are mostly from the food processing, furniture, automotive and transport and logistics industries. Foreign companies are primarily attracted by low labour costs and by the relatively good road and railway network, good vocational skills of workers and relatively liberal employment laws.\n\nThe recently built [[Stary Browar]] shopping centre contains many high-end shops and is considered one of the best in Europe. It has won an award for the best shopping centre in the world in the medium-sized commercial buildings category. Other notable shopping centres in the city include Galeria Malta, one of the largest in [[Central Europe]], and the shops at the Hotel Bazar, a historical hotel and commercial centre in the Old Town.\n\nSome of the best-known major corporations founded and still based in Pozna\u0144 and the city's metropolitan area include [[Allegro (auction)|Allegro]], Poland's biggest online auction site, [[H. Cegielski-Pozna\u0144 SA]], a historic manufacturer, [[Solaris Bus & Coach]], a modern bus and coach maker based in [[Bolechowo, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Bolechowo]] and [[Enea S.A.]], one of the country's biggest energy firms. Pozna\u0144 is also where the [[software development]] leader [[Netguru]] was founded, one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. [[Kompania Piwowarska]] based in Pozna\u0144 produces some of Poland's best known beers, and includes not only the local [[Lech Browary Wielkopolski|Lech Brewery]] but also [[Tyskie]] from [[Tychy]] and [[Dojlidy Brewery]] from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] among many others.\n\n==Transport==\n{{See also|Tramways in Pozna\u0144}}\nPozna\u0144 has an extensive public transport system, mostly consisting of trams, such as the [[Pozna\u0144 Fast Tram]], and both urban and suburban buses. The main railway station is [[Pozna\u0144 G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station|Pozna\u0144 Central Station]] to the southwest of the city centre; there is also the smaller ''[[Pozna\u0144 Wsch\u00f3d railway station|Pozna\u0144 Wsch\u00f3d]]'' and ''[[Pozna\u0144 Garbary railway station|Pozna\u0144 Garbary]]'' station northeast of the centre and a number of other stations on the outskirts of the city. The main east-west [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 motorway]] runs south of the city connecting it with [[Berlin]] in the west and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a|\u0141\u00f3d\u017c]] and Warsaw in the east; other main roads run in the direction of [[Warsaw]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[W\u0105growiec]], [[Oborniki]], [[Katowice]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Buk]] and Berlin.\nPozna\u0144 has one of the biggest airports in the west of Poland called [[Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica Airport]]. In 2016 it handled approximately 1.71 million passengers.\n\n{{Gallery|title=|width=180|height=130|lines=1|align=center\n|File:PL A2 Poznan Komorniki.JPG|A2 Motorway in Pozna\u0144\n|File:27 Grudnia, Tramino, Poznan.jpg|[[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris Tramino]] Tram\n|File:Witosa Wiadukt bus stop in Poznan.JPG|[[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris]] Urbino Bus\n|File:PKP ED160-017 27022016.jpg|[[Pozna\u0144 Central Station]]\n|File:EN76 029 in Poznan Glowny.JPG|[[Koleje Wielkopolskie|Greater Poland Railways]]\n}}\n\n==Culture and sights==\n[[File:POZnan-city-logo.jpg|thumb|left|Pozna\u0144's new city logo]]\n{{see also|List of museums in Pozna\u0144|Pozna\u0144 Old Town|Pozna\u0144 Trumpet Call}}\n[[File:Zamek cesarski w Poznaniu 01.JPG|upright|thumb|The former [[Imperial Castle in Pozna\u0144|Imperial Castle]] is now one of Pozna\u0144's premier cultural-theatrical institutions.]]\nPozna\u0144 has many historic buildings and sights, mostly concentrated around the [[Pozna\u0144 Old Town|Old Town]] and other parts of the city centre. Many of these lie on [[the Royal-Imperial Route in Pozna\u0144]] \u2013 a tourist walk leading through the most important parts of the city showing its history, culture and identity. Portions of the city centre are listed as one of Poland's official national [[List of Historical Monuments (Poland)|Historic Monuments]] (''[[Pomnik historii]]''), as designated 28 November 2008, along with other portions of the city's historic core. Its listing is maintained by the [[Narodowy Instytut Dziedzictwa|National Heritage Board of Poland]].\n[[File:Ayuntamiento, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 67-72 HDR.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Pozna\u0144 City Hall]], located on the Old Market Square, used to serve as the Seat of local government until 1939, and now houses a museum]]\nResults of new extensive archaeological research performed on Pozna\u0144's [[Ostrow Tumski, Poznan|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]] by Prof. dr hab. Hanna Kocka-Krec from Instytut Prahistorii [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|UAM]] indicate that Pozna\u0144 indeed was a central site of the early Polish State (recent discovery of first Polish ruler, [[Mieszko I]]'s Palatium). Thus, the [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Tumski]] Island is more important than it was thought previously, and may have been as important as [[Gniezno]] in the Poland of first [[Piasts]]. Though it is currently under construction, [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]] of Pozna\u0144 should soon have a very rich historical exposition and be a very interesting place for visitors. It promises to include many attractions, such as the above-mentioned Cathedral, Church of St. Mary the Virgin, [[Lubranski Academy]] and they opened in 2012 [[Genius Loci Archeological Park]] as well as planned to be opened in 2013 [[Interactive Center of Ostrow Tumski History|Interactive Center of Ostr\u00f3w Tumski History]] (ICHOT) that presents a multimedia museum of the Polish State through many different periods. The Palatium in Pozna\u0144 will be also transformed into a museum, although more funds are needed. When all the expositions are ready, in a couple of years, Ostr\u00f3w Tumski may be as worth visiting as the [[Wawel Castle|Wawel castle]] of Krak\u00f3w. There is a very famous sentence illustrating the importance of Ostr\u00f3w Tumski in Pozna\u0144 by the [[Pope John Paul II]]: \"''Poland began here''\".\n\nA popular venue is [[Lake Malta|Malta]], a park with an artificial lake in its centre. On one bank of the lake there are ski and sleigh slopes (Malta Ski), on the opposite bank a huge complex of swimming pools including an Olympic-size one (Termy Maltanskie).\n\nAn important cultural event in Pozna\u0144 is the annual [[Malta theatre festival|Malta Festival]], which takes place at many city venues, usually in late June and early July. It hosts mainly modern experimental off-theatre performances, often taking place on squares and other public spaces. It also includes cinema, visual, music and dancing events. Malta Theatre Festival gave birth to many off-theater groups, expressing new ideas in an already rich theatrical background of the city. Thus, Pozna\u0144 with a great deal of off-theaters and their performances has recently become a new Polish off-theater performance centre.\n[[File:Poland-00552 - Whipping Post (29733262383).jpg|left|thumb|220px|[[Pozna\u0144 Old Town]], filled with many picturesque [[townhouse]]s, is a major tourist attraction]]\nClassical music events include the [[Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition]] (held every 5 years), and classical music concerts by the city's [[Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic|Philharmonic Orchestra]] held each month in the University ''Aula''.

Pozna\u0144 is also known for its rock music performers ([[Muchy (band)|Muchy]], Malgorzata Ostrowska).\n\nPozna\u0144 apart from many traditional theatres with a long history (\"Teatr Nowy\", \"[[Grand Theatre, Pozna\u0144|Teatr Wielki]]\", \"[[Polish Theatre in Pozna\u0144|Teatr Polski]]\", \"Teatr Muzyczny\" and several others) is also home to a growing number of alternative theatre groups, some of them stemming from International Malta Festival: \"Teatr Strefa Ciszy\", \"Teatr Porywcze Cial\", \"Teatr Usta Usta\", \"Teatr u Przyjaciol\", \"[[Teatr Biuro Podrozy]]\", \"Teatr Osmego Dnia\" and many others \u2013 it is believed that even up to 30 more or less known groups may work in the city.\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb| ''[[St. Martin's croissant]]'']]\nEvery year on [[November 11|11 November]], Poznanians celebrate The [[St. Martin's Day|Day of St. Martin]].

Other festivals: \"[[Transatlantyk Festival|Transatlantyk]] (film music festival by [[Jan A.P.

The [[Rozbrat]] social centre, a [[Squatting|squatted]] former factory in [[Je\u017cyce, Pozna\u0144|Je\u017cyce]], serves as a home for independent and open-minded culture. It hosts frequent gigs, an anarchistic library, vernissages, exhibitions, annual birthday festival (each October), poetry evenings and graffiti festivals. The city centre has many clubs, pubs and coffee houses, mainly in the area of the Old Town.\n\nThe city is also home to one of the oldest [[zoological garden]]s in Poland, the [[Old Zoo (Poznan)|Old Zoo in Pozna\u0144]], which was established in 1874.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.zoo.poznan.pl/page/view/7-English_Version |title=Welcome to Pozna\u0144 ZOO |access-date=2018-08-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Gra\u017cyna Kulczyk]]'s effort to build the [[Museum of Contemporary and Performance Arts]] in Pozna\u0144 was rejected.<ref name=Adam>{{cite news|last1=Adam|first1=Georgina|title=Grazyna Kulczyk's collection on show at Boadilla del Monte, Madrid|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/475032c4-9966-11e3-b3a2-00144feab7de.html|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=7 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=Joanna>{{cite news|last1=Berendt|first1=Joanna|title=\nPolish Philanthropist, Grazyna Kulczyk, Is Seeking to Open Museum in Warsaw|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/polish-philanthropist-grazyna-kulczyk-is-seeking-to-open-museum-in-warsaw/|accessdate=1 December 2015|work=New York Times|date=30 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46157435-a-chip-shop-in-pozna ''A Chip Shop in Poznan: My Unlikely Year in Poland''] is a travel book published in 2019, which details British author Ben Aitken's experience of being an immigrant in the city.

The number of students in the city of Pozna\u0144 is about 140,000 (fourth/third after Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and close to Wroc\u0142aw student population). Every one of four inhabitants in Pozna\u0144 is a student.\n\nSince Pozna\u0144 is smaller than [[Warsaw]] or [[Cracow|Krak\u00f3w]] still having a very large number of students it makes the city even more vibrant and dense academic hub than both former and current capitals of Poland. Pozna\u0144, with its almost 30 colleges and universities, has the second richest educational offering in Poland after Warsaw.\n\n===Public universities===\nThe city has many state-owned [[university|universities]]. [[Pozna\u0144 University|Adam Mickiewicz University]] (abbreviated ''UAM'' in Polish, ''AMU'' in English) is one of the most influential and biggest [[List of universities in Poland|universities in Poland]]:\n{{main|Universities in Pozna\u0144}}\n[[File:Poznan 10-2013 img02 Raczynski Library.jpg|thumb|The [[Raczy\u0144ski Library]], 1822\u20131828]]\n[[File:Poznan 10-2013 img06 University.jpg|thumb|The Collegium Minus \u2013 [[Adam Mickiewicz University]]]]\n[[File:Teatr Wielki, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 53.jpg|thumbnail|[[Grand Theatre, Pozna\u0144|Grand Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Teatro Polaco, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 56.jpg|thumbnail|Polish Theatre]]\n\n* [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144|Adam Mickiewicz University]] (UAM)\n* [[University of Fine Arts in Pozna\u0144]]\n* Academy of Music in Pozna\u0144\n* [[Pozna\u0144 University of Economics]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144 University of Medical Sciences]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144 University of Technology]]\n* Pozna\u0144 University School of Physical Education\n* [[University of Life Sciences in Pozna\u0144]]\n\n[[Adam Mickiewicz University]] is one of the three best universities in Poland after [[University of Warsaw]] and [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]]. They all have a very high number of international student and scientist exchange, research grants and top publications.\nIn northern suburbs of Pozna\u0144 a very large \"Morasko Campus\" has been built (Faculty of Biology, Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Political Sciences, Geography). The majority of faculties are already open, although a few more facilities will be constructed. The campus infrastructure belongs to the most impressive among Polish universities. Also, there are plans for \"Uniwersytecki Park Historii Ziemii\" (Earth History Park), one of the reason for the park construction is a \"[[Morasko meteorite nature reserve]]\" situated close by, it is one of the rare sites of Europe where a number of meteorites fell and some traces may be still seen.\n\n===Private higher education===\n[[File:Poznan-Wyz_Szk_Nauk_Hum_i_Dzienn.jpg|thumb|[[Collegium Da Vinci]]]]\nThere is also a great number of smaller, mostly private-run colleges and institutions of higher education ''(\"Uczelnie\")'':\n\n* [[University of Social Sciences and Humanities]]\n*[[Collegium Da Vinci]]\n* Pozna\u0144ska Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Biznesu i J\u0119zyk\u00f3w Obcych\n* Schola Posnaniensis - Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Sztuki Stosowanej\n* Wielkopolska Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Turystyki i Zarz\u0105dzania\n* [[WSB Universities|Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Bankowa w Poznaniu]]<ref>[http://www.wsb.pl/english/about-wsb-group/wsb-poznan WSB University in Pozna\u0144] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301124949/http://www.wsb.pl/english/about-wsb-group/wsb-poznan |date=1 March 2016 }} \u2013 WSB Universities</ref>\n** Branch in [[Chorz\u00f3w]]\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Handlu i Us\u0142ug\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Umiej\u0119tno\u015bci Spo\u0142ecznych\n** Branch in [[Katowice]]\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Zarz\u0105dzania i Bankowo\u015bci\n** [[Wroc\u0142aw]] branch\n* [[\u00c9cole Franco-Polonaise]] - closed in 1997\n* Arcybiskupie Seminarium Duchowne w Poznaniu\n* Wielkopolska Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Turystyki i Zarz\u0105dzania w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Biznesu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Bezpiecze\u0144stwa w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Edukacji i Terapii w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Edukacji Integracyjnej i Interkulturowej w Poznaniu\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Handlu i Rachunkowo\u015bci\n** Branch in [[Wrze\u015bnia]]\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Hotelarstwa i Gastronomii\n* Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a J\u0119zyk\u00f3w Obcych im.

Some of the most notable are:\n\n*[[Adam Mickiewicz High School in Pozna\u0144|Adam Mickiewicz High School]]\n*[[D\u0105br\u00f3wka High School (Pozna\u0144)|D\u0105br\u00f3wka High School]]\n*[[Luisenschule (Posen)]]\n*[[St. John Cantius High School, Pozna\u0144, Poland|St. John Cantius High School]]\n*[[Saint Mary Magdalene High School in Pozna\u0144|Saint Mary Magdalene High School]]\n\n==Scientific and regional organisations==\n* [[Pozna\u0144 Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences]]\n* Pozna\u0144 Supercomputing and Networking Center\n* [[Western Institute]]\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadion Lecha Poznan. 2010-11-03 (4).JPG|thumb|[[Stadion Miejski (Pozna\u0144)|Stadion Miejski]] interior]]\n[[File:Lech Poznan 2011.jpg|left|thumb|KKS Lech Pozna\u0144 before match against [[Legia Warsaw|Legia Warszawa]]]]\nPozna\u0144 is famous for its football teams, [[Warta Pozna\u0144]], which was one of the most successful clubs in pre-[[World War II|war]] history, and [[Lech Pozna\u0144]], who are currently one of the biggest clubs in the country, frequently playing in European cups and have many fans from all over the [[Greater Poland|region]]. Lech plays at the [[Stadion Miejski (Pozna\u0144)|Municipal Stadium]], which hosted the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 European Championship]] group stages as well as the opening game and the final of the [[2006 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|U-19 Euro Championship]] in June 2006. Warta plays at the small [[D\u0119bi\u0144ska Road Stadium]]; a former training ground for [[Edmund Szyc Stadium]] however since the latter fell into disrepair in 1998 and was sold in 2001 it became the teams main ground;\nthe club does have aims to restore and return to the historical 60 000 capacity stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazyn.wp.pl/artykul/widok-jak-z-horroru-w-samym-centrum-miasta-stadion-ktory-straszy-od-lat|title=Widok jak z horroru w samym centrum miasta.

The club is a large sports complex surrounded by [[Lake Rusa\u0142ka]], and apart from the tennis facilities boasts a large city recreation area: [[mountain biking]] facilities including a [[four-cross]] track; an [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] stadium (capacity 3000); and a [[association football|football]]-[[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] stadium (capacity 20 000), which fell into vast disrepair until it was acquired by the city council from the police in 2013 and was renovated. The football-speedway stadium hosts [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] club [[PS\u017b Pozna\u0144]], [[rugby union]] side [[Chaos Pozna\u0144|NKR Chaos]], [[American football]] team the Pozna\u0144 Patriots, and [[association football|football]] team Poznaniak Pozna\u0144.\n\nThe city has the largest circuit in Poland, [[Tor Pozna\u0144]], located in the suburbs in [[Prze\u017amierowo]]. [[Lake Malta]] hosted the [[World Rowing Championships]] in 2009 and has previously hosted some regattas in the [[Rowing World Cup]]. It also hosted the [[ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships]] ([[canoe racing|sprint canoe]]) in [[1990 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|1990]] and [[2001 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2001]], and again in [[2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2010]]. Also near the lake the \"Malta Ski\" [[Dry slope skiing|year-long skiing complex]] hosts minor sport competitions, and is also equipped with a [[toboggan run]] and a [[minigolf]] course. There is also a roller rink with a [[roller skating]] club nearby.\n\nPozna\u0144 has experience as a host for international sporting events such as the official [[2009 EuroBasket]].<ref>[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/sid/6328/_/index.html 2009 EuroBasket], ARCHIVE.FIBA.com, Retrieved 5 June 2016.</ref>\n\nThe city is also considered to be the hotbed of Polish [[field hockey]], with several top teams: [[Warta Pozna\u0144]]; [[Grunwald Pozna\u0144]]; which also has [[shooting]], [[wrestling]], [[team handball|handball]] and [[tennis]] sections; [[Pocztowiec Pozna\u0144]]; and [[AZS AWF Pozna\u0144]], the student club which also fields professional teams in women's [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]] ([[AZS Pozna\u0144]]).\n\nOther clubs include: [[Posnania Pozna\u0144]], one of the best [[rugby union]] clubs in the country; [[Polonia Pozna\u0144]], formerly a [[multi-sports club]] with many successes in rugby, however today only a football section remains; [[KKS Wiara Lecha]], football club formed by the supporters of [[Lech Pozna\u0144]]; and [[Odlew Pozna\u0144]], arguably the most famous amateur club in the country due to their extensive media coverage and humorous exploits. There are also numerous [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[synchronised swimming]] clubs, as well as numerous less notable amateur [[association football|football]] teams.\n\nPozna\u0144 bid for the [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics]] but lost to [[Nanjing]], with the [[China|Chinese]] city receiving 47 votes over Pozna\u0144's 42.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n[[File:Stare Miasto w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|280px|Old Town and city hall]]\nSince the end of the [[People's Republic of Poland|communist era]] in 1989, Pozna\u0144 municipality and suburban area have invested heavily in infrastructure, especially public transport and administration. There is massive investment from foreign companies in Pozna\u0144 as well as in communities west and south of Pozna\u0144 (namely, [[K\u00f3rnik]] and [[Tarnowo Podg\u00f3rne]]).\n\nCity investments into transportation were mostly into public transport. While the number of cars since 1989 has at least doubled, municipal policy concentrated on improving public transport. Limiting car access to the city centre, building new [[tram]] lines (including [[Pozna\u0144ski Szybki Tramwaj]]) and investing in new rolling stock (such as modern [[Combino]] trams by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Solaris Bus & Coach|Solaris]] low-floor buses) actually increased the level of ridership.\n\nFuture investments into transportation include the construction of a third bypass of Pozna\u0144, and the completion of [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 (E30)]] motorway towards Berlin. New cycle lanes are being built, linking to existing ones, and an attempt is currently being made to develop a [[Karlsruhe]]-style [[light rail]] system for commuters. All this is made more complicated (and more expensive) by the heavy neglect of transport infrastructure throughout the Communist era.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and

By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nThe area of the former [[County of Holland]] roughly coincides with the two current Dutch [[Provinces of the Netherlands|provinces]] of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] into which it was divided, and which together include the Netherlands's three largest cities: the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital of the Netherlands|capital city]] of [[Amsterdam]]; [[Rotterdam]], home of [[Port of Rotterdam|Europe's largest port]]; and the [[seat of government]] of [[The Hague]]. Holland has a population of 6,583,534 as of November 2019,<ref>https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table</ref> and a density of {{convert|1203|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on|sortable=on}}.\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nThe name ''Holland'' first appeared in sources for the region around [[Haarlem]], and by 1064 was being used as the name of the entire county. By the early twelfth century, the inhabitants of Holland were called ''Hollandi'' in a [[Latin]] text.<ref>Antheun Janse, \"Een zichzelf verdeeld rijk\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 1, p. 73</ref> ''Holland'' is derived from the [[Old Dutch]] term ''holtlant'' (\"wood-land\").<ref name=Oxford>''Oxford English Dictionary'', \"Holland, n. 1,\" etymology.</ref> This spelling variation remained in use until around the 14th century, at which time the name stabilised as ''Holland'' (alternative spellings at the time were ''Hollant'' and ''Hollandt''). A popular but erroneous [[folk etymology]] holds that ''Holland'' is derived from ''hol land'' (\"hollow land\" in Dutch) purportedly inspired by the [[lowland|low-lying]] [[geography]] of the land.<ref name=Oxford/>\n\n\"Holland\" is informally used in [[English language|English]] and other languages, including sometimes the [[Dutch language]] itself, to mean the whole of the modern country of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Netherlands]].<ref name=MoFA/> This example of ''[[pars pro toto]]'' or [[synecdoche]] is similar to the tendency to refer to the United Kingdom as \"England\",<ref>\"The majority of English people still behave as if 'English' and 'British' are synonymous\", historian [[Norman Davies]] quoted in [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255337.stm The English: Europe's lost tribe], BBC News Story, 14 January 1999</ref><ref>George Mikes, ''How to be an Alien'', \"When people say England, they sometimes mean Great Britain, sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles - but never England.\"</ref> and developed due to Holland's becoming the dominant province and thus having the majority of political and economic interactions with other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/story/is-holland-the-same-place-as-the-netherlands|title=Is \"Holland\" the Same Place as \"the Netherlands\"?}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1806 and 1810 \"Holland\" was the official name for the country as a whole, after [[Napoleon]] made his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] the monarch of the [[Kingdom of Holland]].\n\nThe people of Holland are referred to as \"Hollanders\" in both Dutch and English, though in English this is now unusual. Today this refers specifically to people from the current provinces of North Holland and South Holland. Strictly speaking, the term \"Hollanders\" does not refer to people from the other provinces in the Netherlands, but colloquially \"Hollanders\" is sometimes used in this wider sense.\n\nIn Dutch, the Dutch word \"''Hollands''\" is the adjectival form for \"''Holland''\". The Dutch word \"''Hollands''\" is also colloquially and occasionally used by some Dutch people in the sense of \"''Nederlands''\" (Dutch), but often with the intention of contrasting with other types of Dutch people or language, for example [[Limburgish]], the Belgian varieties of the Dutch language (\"[[Flemish]]\"), or even any southern variety of Dutch within the Netherlands itself.\n\nIn English, \"Dutch\" refers to the Netherlands as a whole, but there is no commonly used adjective for \"Holland\". The word \"Hollandish\" is no longer in common use. \"[[Hollandic]]\" is the name linguists give to the dialect spoken in Holland, and is occasionally also used by historians and when referring to pre-Napoleonic Holland.\n\n== History ==\nInitially, Holland was a remote corner of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gradually, its regional importance increased until it began to have a decisive, and ultimately dominant, influence on the [[History of the Netherlands]].\n\n=== County of Holland ===\n{{Further information|County of Holland}}\n[[File:Wapen graafschap Holland.svg|150px|thumb|right|[[Coat of arms]] of the County of Holland]]\nUntil the start of the 12th century, the inhabitants of the area that became Holland were known as [[Frisians]]. The area was initially part of [[Frisia]]. At the end of the 9th century, West-Frisia became a separate [[county]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The first [[Count of Holland|Count]] known about with certainty was [[Dirk I, Count of Holland|Dirk I]], who ruled from 896 to 931. He was succeeded by a [[Counts of Holland family tree|long line of counts]] in the House of Holland (who were in fact known as counts of Frisia until 1101). When [[John I, Count of Holland]], died childless in 1299, the county was inherited by [[John II, Count of Holland|John II of Avesnes]], [[county of Hainaut|count of Hainaut]]. By the time of [[William V, Count of Holland|William V]] ([[House of Wittelsbach]]; 1354\u20131388) the count of Holland was also the count of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Zeeland|Zealand]].\n\nAfter the [[St. Lucia's flood]] in 1287 the part of Frisia west of the later [[Zuiderzee]], [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], was conquered. As a result, most provincial institutions, including the [[States of Holland|States of Holland and West Frisia]], would for more than five centuries refer to \"Holland and West Frisia\" as a unit. The [[Hook and Cod wars]] started around this time and ended when the countess of Holland, Jacoba or [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut|Jacqueline]] was forced to cede Holland to the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian]] Philip III, known as [[Philip the Good]], in 1432.\n\nIn 1432, Holland became part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] and since 1477 of the [[Habsburg]] [[Seventeen Provinces]]. In the 16th century the county became the most densely [[urbanisation|urbanised]] region in Europe, with the majority of the population living in cities. Within the Burgundian Netherlands, Holland was the dominant province in the north; the political influence of Holland largely determined the extent of Burgundian dominion in that area. The last count of Holland was Philip III, better known as [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], king of Spain. He was deposed in 1581 by the [[Act of Abjuration]], although the kings of Spain continued to carry the titular appellation of Count of Holland until the [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] signed in 1648.\n\n=== Dutch Republic ===\n[[File:COMITATUS HOLLANDIAE 1682.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Holland from 1682]]\nIn the Dutch Rebellion against the Habsburgs during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the naval forces of the rebels, the [[Watergeuzen]], established their first permanent base in 1572 in the town of [[Brielle|Brill]]. In this way, Holland, now a sovereign state in a larger Dutch confederation, became the centre of the rebellion. It became the cultural, political and economic centre of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] ({{Lang-nl|Verenigde Provinci\u00ebn}}), in the 17th century, the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the wealthiest nation in the world. After the [[Act of Abjuration|King of Spain]] was deposed as the count of Holland, the executive and legislative power rested with the States of Holland, which was led by a political figure who held the office of [[Grand Pensionary]].\n\nThe largest cities in the [[Dutch Republic]] were in the province of Holland, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Leiden]], [[Alkmaar]], [[The Hague]], [[Delft]], [[Dordrecht]] and [[Haarlem]]. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over [[Europe]], and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland.\n\nMany Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as ''Holland'' rather than as the ''Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands''. A strong impression of ''Holland'' was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a \"Hollandification\" of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. The dialect of urban Holland became the [[standard language]].\n\n=== Under French rule ===\n{{Further information|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\n[[File:Departments of French Empire North 1811-ex.svg|thumb|Departments of French Empire North 1811]]\n\nThe formation of the [[Batavian Republic]], inspired by the [[French revolution]], led to a more centralised government. Holland became a province of a [[unitary state]]. Its independence was further reduced by an administrative reform in 1798, in which its territory was divided into several departments called ''Amstel'', ''Delf'', ''Texel'', and part of ''Schelde en Maas''.\n\nFrom 1806 to 1810 [[Napoleon]] styled his vassal state, governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis Napoleon]] and shortly by the son of Louis, [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte]], as the \"[[Kingdom of Holland]]\". This kingdom encompassed much of what would become the modern Netherlands. The name reflects how natural at the time it had become to equate Holland with the non-Belgian Netherlands as a whole.<ref>Willem Frijhoff, \"Hollands hegemonie\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2002, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 2, p. 468</ref>\n\nDuring the period when the Low Countries were annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and actually incorporated into France (from 1810 to 1813), Holland was divided into [[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]s [[Zuyderz\u00e9e]], and [[Bouches-de-la-Meuse]]. From 1811 to 1813 [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance]] served as [[governor-general]]. He was assisted by Antoine de Celles, [[Goswin de Stassart]] and Fran\u00e7ois Jean-Baptiste d'Alphonse.<ref>C.F. Gijsberti Hodenpijl (1904) Napoleon in Holland, pp. 6-7.</ref> In 1813, Dutch dignitaries proclaimed the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands]].\n\n=== Kingdom of the Netherlands ===\nIn 1815, Holland was restored as a province of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Holland was divided into the present provinces [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in 1840, after the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830. This reflected a historical division of Holland along the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] into a Southern Quarter (''Zuiderkwartier'') and a Northern Quarter (''Noorderkwartier''),<ref>G. Geerts & H. Heestermans, 1981, ''Groot Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal. Deel II'', Van Dale Lexicografie, Utrecht, p 1831-1832</ref> but the present division is different from the old division. From 1850, a strong process of [[nation building|nation formation]] took place, the Netherlands being culturally unified and economically integrated by a [[Modernization theory|modernisation]] process, with the cities of Holland as its centre.<ref>Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, \"Brandpunt van macht en modernisering\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 548</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Further information|Geography of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Provincie Noord-Holland.gif|thumb|right|North Holland]]\n[[File:Provincie Zuid-Holland.gif|thumb|right|South Holland]]\nHolland is located in the west of the Netherlands. A maritime region, Holland lies on the [[North Sea]] at the mouths of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse]] (Maas). It contains numerous rivers and lakes, and has an extensive inland canal and waterway system. To the south is [[Zeeland|Zealand]]. The region is bordered on the east by the [[IJsselmeer]] and four Dutch provinces.\n\nHolland is protected from the sea by a long line of coastal [[dune]]s. The highest point in Holland, about {{convert|55|m|ft}} above sea level,<ref>{{cite web|title=Highpoints of the Netherlands|url=http://www.summitpost.org/highpoints-of-the-netherlands/462452|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920044727/http://www.summitpost.org/highpoints-of-the-netherlands/462452|archivedate=20 September 2015}}</ref> is in the {{Ill|Schoorlse Duinen|nl}} (Schoorl Dunes). Most of the land area behind the dunes consists of [[polder]] landscape lying well below [[sea level]]. At present the lowest point in Holland is a polder near [[Rotterdam]], which is about {{convert|7|m|ft|lk=out|spell=in}} below sea level. Continuous drainage is necessary to keep Holland from flooding. In earlier centuries [[windmill]]s were used for this task. The landscape was (and in places still is) dotted with windmills, which have become a symbol of Holland.\n\nHolland is {{convert|7,494|km2|lk=out|abbr=off}}, land and water included, making it roughly 13% of the area of the Netherlands. Looking at land alone, it is {{convert|5,488|km2|abbr=off}} in area. The combined population was in 2018 6.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"stat\">{{in lang|nl}} [http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=37230ned&D1=0-2,4-5,7-8,13-17&D2=0,4,8,12-13,30,77&D3=195-206,208-212&HDR=G2&STB=G1,T&VW=T] Statline CBS: Bevolkingsontwikkeling per maand</ref>\n\nThe main cities in Holland are Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. [[Amsterdam]] is formally the [[capital of the Netherlands]] and its largest city. The [[Port of Rotterdam]] is Europe's largest and most important harbour and port. [[The Hague]] is the [[seat of government]] of the Netherlands. These cities, combined with [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and other smaller municipalities, effectively form a single [[Conurbation|metroplex]]\u2014a conurbation called [[Randstad]].\n\nThe Randstad area is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe, but still relatively free of urban sprawl. There are strict [[zoning laws]]. Population pressures are enormous, property values are high, and new housing is constantly under development on the edges of the built-up areas. Surprisingly, much of the province still has a rural character. The remaining agricultural land and natural areas are highly valued and protected. Most of the arable land is used for [[Intensive farming|intensive agriculture]], including horticulture and [[greenhouse]] agri-businesses.\n\n=== Reclamation of the land ===\n[[File:Benthuizen dijk polder.jpg|thumb|left|Benthuizen polder, as seen from a dike]]\nThe land that is now Holland has not been \"stable\" since prehistoric times. The western coastline shifted up to {{convert|30|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} to the east and storm surges regularly broke through the row of coastal dunes. The [[Frisian Islands|Frisian Isles]], originally joined to the mainland, became detached islands in the north. The main rivers, the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River|Meuse (Maas)]], flooded regularly and changed course repeatedly and dramatically.\n\nThe people of Holland found themselves living in an unstable, watery environment. Behind the [[dunes]] on the coast of the Netherlands a high [[peat]] plateau had grown, forming a natural protection against the sea. Much of the area was [[marsh]] and [[bog]]. By the tenth century the inhabitants set about cultivating this land by draining it. However, the drainage resulted in extreme soil shrinkage, lowering the surface of the land by up to {{convert|15|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}}.\n\nTo the south of Holland, in [[Zeeland]], and to the north, in [[Frisia]], this development led to [[Floods in the Netherlands|catastrophic storm floods]] literally washing away entire regions, as the peat layer disintegrated or became detached and was carried away by the flood water. From the Frisian side the sea even flooded the area to the east, gradually hollowing Holland out from behind and forming the [[Zuiderzee]] (the present IJsselmeer). This inland sea threatened to link up with the \"drowned lands\" of Zealand in the south, reducing Holland to a series of narrow dune [[barrier island]]s in front of a [[lagoon]]. Only drastic administrative intervention saved the county from utter destruction. The counts and large monasteries took the lead in these efforts, building the first heavy emergency [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to bolster critical points. Later special autonomous administrative bodies were formed, the ''[[waterschap]]pen'' (\"water control boards\"), which had the legal power to enforce their regulations and decisions on [[water management]]. They eventually constructed an extensive dike system that covered the coastline and the polders, thus protecting the land from further incursions by the sea.\n\nHowever, the Hollanders did not stop there. Starting around the 16th century, they took the offensive and began [[land reclamation]] projects, converting lakes, marshy areas and adjoining mudflats into [[polder]]s. This continued well into the 20th century. As a result, historical maps of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and early modern Holland bear little resemblance to present maps.\n\nThis ongoing struggle to master the water played an important role in the development of Holland as a maritime and economic power, and has traditionally been seen as developing the presumed collective character of its inhabitants: stubborn, egalitarian and frugal.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe stereotypical image of Holland is an artificial amalgam of [[tulip]]s, [[windmill]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|clogs]], [[Edam cheese]] and the traditional dress (''klederdracht'') of the village of [[Volendam]], far from the reality of everyday Holland. These stereotypes were deliberately created in the late 19th century by official \"Holland Promotion\" to attract tourists.\n\nThe predominance of Holland in the Netherlands has resulted in [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] on the part of the other provinces, a reaction to the perceived threat that Holland poses to their local culture and identity. The other provinces have a strong, and often negative,<ref>Rob van Ginkel, \"Hollandse Tonelen\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 688</ref> image of Holland and the Hollanders, to whom certain qualities are ascribed within a [[mental geography]], a conceptual mapping of spaces and their inhabitants.<ref>Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, \"Brandpunt van macht en modernisering\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 556</ref> On the other hand, some Hollanders take Holland's cultural dominance for granted and treat the concepts of \"Holland\" and \"the Netherlands\" as coinciding. Consequently, they see themselves not primarily as Hollanders, but simply as Dutch (''Nederlanders'').<ref>Thimo de Nijs, \"Hollandse identiteit in perspectief\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 700</ref> This phenomenon has been called \"hollandocentrism\".<ref>Rob van Ginkel, \"Hollandse Tonelen\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 647</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe predominant language spoken in Holland is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Hollanders sometimes call the Dutch language \"''Hollands,''\"<ref>''Dutch: An Essential Grammar'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=p9d9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&dq= p. 15], William Z. Shetter, Esther Ham, Routledge, 2007</ref> instead of the standard term ''Nederlands''. Inhabitants of Belgium and other provinces of the Netherlands use \"Hollands\" to mean a [[Hollandic]] dialect or strong accent.\n\nStandard Dutch was historically largely based on the dialect of the [[County of Holland]], incorporating many traits derived from the dialects of the previously more powerful [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[County of Flanders]]. Strong dialectal variation still exists throughout the [[Low Countries]]. Today, Holland proper is the region where the original dialects are least spoken, in many areas having been completely replaced by standard Dutch, and the [[Randstad]] has the largest influence on the developments of the standard language\u2014with the exception of the Dutch spoken in Belgium.<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\nDespite this correspondence between standard Dutch and the Dutch spoken in the Randstad, there are local variations within Holland itself that differ from standard Dutch. The main cities each have their own modern urban dialect, that can be considered a [[sociolect]].<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, p. 123</ref> Some people, especially in the area north of Amsterdam, still speak the original dialect of the county, Hollandic. This dialect is present in the north: [[Volendam]] and [[Marken]] and the area around there, [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]] and the [[Zaanstreek]]; and in a southeastern fringe bordering the provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Utrecht]]. In the south on the island of [[Goeree-Overflakkee]], [[Zeelandic]] is spoken.<ref>E.J. van den Broecke-de Man, D.K. Soldaat-Poortvliet & F. Heerschap, 1988,  ''Dialect op Goeree-Overflakkee'', Zeeuwsche Vereeniging voor Dialectonderzoek, Ouddorp, 271 pp</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== New Holland ===\n{{see|New Holland (disambiguation){{!}}New Holland}}\nThe province of Holland gave its name to a number of colonial settlements and discovered regions that were called ''Nieuw Holland'' or [[New Holland (disambiguation)|New Holland]]. The largest was the island continent presently known as [[Australia]]:<ref name=\"Van Dale\"/> [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] was first applied to Australia in 1644 by the Dutch seafarer [[Dirk Hartog]] as a [[Latin]] ''Nova Hollandia'', and remained in international use for 190 years. Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] named [[New Zealand]] after the Dutch province of [[Zeeland|Zealand]]. In the Netherlands ''Nieuw Holland'' would remain the usual name of the continent until the end of the 19th century; it is now no longer in use there, the Dutch name today being ''Australi\u00eb''.\n\n=== As contemporary exonym for the Netherlands ===\n{{see|Terminology of the Low Countries#Holland as exonym}}\nWhile \"Holland\" has been replaced in English as the official name for the country of the Netherlands, other languages still use it or a variant of it to officially refer to the Netherlands.

By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nThe area of the former [[County of Holland]] roughly coincides with the two current Dutch [[Provinces of the Netherlands|provinces]] of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] into which it was divided, and which together include the Netherlands's three largest cities: the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital of the Netherlands|capital city]] of [[Amsterdam]]; [[Rotterdam]], home of [[Port of Rotterdam|Europe's largest port]]; and the [[seat of government]] of [[The Hague]]. Holland has a population of 6,583,534 as of November 2019<ref>https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table</ref>, and a density of {{convert|1203|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on|sortable=on}}.\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nThe name ''Holland'' first appeared in sources for the region around [[Haarlem]], and by 1064 was being used as the name of the entire county. By the early twelfth century, the inhabitants of Holland were called ''Hollandi'' in a [[Latin]] text.<ref>Antheun Janse, \"Een zichzelf verdeeld rijk\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 1, p. 73</ref> ''Holland'' is derived from the [[Old Dutch]] term ''holtlant'' (\"wood-land\").<ref name=Oxford>''Oxford English Dictionary'', \"Holland, n. 1,\" etymology.</ref> This spelling variation remained in use until around the 14th century, at which time the name stabilised as ''Holland'' (alternative spellings at the time were ''Hollant'' and ''Hollandt''). A popular but erroneous [[folk etymology]] holds that ''Holland'' is derived from ''hol land'' (\"hollow land\" in Dutch) purportedly inspired by the [[lowland|low-lying]] [[geography]] of the land.<ref name=Oxford/>\n\n\"Holland\" is informally used in [[English language|English]] and other languages, including sometimes the [[Dutch language]] itself, to mean the whole of the modern country of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Netherlands]].<ref name=MoFA/> This example of ''[[pars pro toto]]'' or [[synecdoche]] is similar to the tendency to refer to the United Kingdom as \"England\",<ref>\"The majority of English people still behave as if 'English' and 'British' are synonymous\", historian [[Norman Davies]] quoted in [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255337.stm The English: Europe's lost tribe], BBC News Story, 14 January 1999</ref><ref>George Mikes, ''How to be an Alien'', \"When people say England, they sometimes mean Great Britain, sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles - but never England.\"</ref> and developed due to Holland's becoming the dominant province and thus having the majority of political and economic interactions with other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/story/is-holland-the-same-place-as-the-netherlands|title=Is \"Holland\" the Same Place as \"the Netherlands\"?}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1806 and 1810 \"Holland\" was the official name for the country as a whole, after [[Napoleon]] made his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] the monarch of the [[Kingdom of Holland]].\n\nThe people of Holland are referred to as \"Hollanders\" in both Dutch and English, though in English this is now unusual. Today this refers specifically to people from the current provinces of North Holland and South Holland. Strictly speaking, the term \"Hollanders\" does not refer to people from the other provinces in the Netherlands, but colloquially \"Hollanders\" is sometimes used in this wider sense.\n\nIn Dutch, the Dutch word \"''Hollands''\" is the adjectival form for \"''Holland''\". The Dutch word \"''Hollands''\" is also colloquially and occasionally used by some Dutch people in the sense of \"''Nederlands''\" (Dutch), but often with the intention of contrasting with other types of Dutch people or language, for example [[Limburgish]], the Belgian varieties of the Dutch language (\"[[Flemish]]\"), or even any southern variety of Dutch within the Netherlands itself.\n\nIn English, \"Dutch\" refers to the Netherlands as a whole, but there is no commonly used adjective for \"Holland\". The word \"Hollandish\" is no longer in common use. \"[[Hollandic]]\" is the name linguists give to the dialect spoken in Holland, and is occasionally also used by historians and when referring to pre-Napoleonic Holland.\n\n== History ==\nInitially, Holland was a remote corner of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gradually, its regional importance increased until it began to have a decisive, and ultimately dominant, influence on the [[History of the Netherlands]].\n\n=== County of Holland ===\n{{Further information|County of Holland}}\n[[File:Wapen graafschap Holland.svg|150px|thumb|right|[[Coat of arms]] of the County of Holland]]\nUntil the start of the 12th century, the inhabitants of the area that became Holland were known as [[Frisians]]. The area was initially part of [[Frisia]]. At the end of the 9th century, West-Frisia became a separate [[county]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The first [[Count of Holland|Count]] known about with certainty was [[Dirk I, Count of Holland|Dirk I]], who ruled from 896 to 931. He was succeeded by a [[Counts of Holland family tree|long line of counts]] in the House of Holland (who were in fact known as counts of Frisia until 1101). When [[John I, Count of Holland]], died childless in 1299, the county was inherited by [[John II, Count of Holland|John II of Avesnes]], [[county of Hainaut|count of Hainaut]]. By the time of [[William V, Count of Holland|William V]] ([[House of Wittelsbach]]; 1354\u20131388) the count of Holland was also the count of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Zeeland|Zealand]].\n\nAfter the [[St. Lucia's flood]] in 1287 the part of Frisia west of the later [[Zuiderzee]], [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], was conquered. As a result, most provincial institutions, including the [[States of Holland|States of Holland and West Frisia]], would for more than five centuries refer to \"Holland and West Frisia\" as a unit. The [[Hook and Cod wars]] started around this time and ended when the countess of Holland, Jacoba or [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut|Jacqueline]] was forced to cede Holland to the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian]] Philip III, known as [[Philip the Good]], in 1432.\n\nIn 1432, Holland became part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] and since 1477 of the [[Habsburg]] [[Seventeen Provinces]]. In the 16th century the county became the most densely [[urbanisation|urbanised]] region in Europe, with the majority of the population living in cities. Within the Burgundian Netherlands, Holland was the dominant province in the north; the political influence of Holland largely determined the extent of Burgundian dominion in that area. The last count of Holland was Philip III, better known as [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], king of Spain. He was deposed in 1581 by the [[Act of Abjuration]], although the kings of Spain continued to carry the titular appellation of Count of Holland until the [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] signed in 1648.\n\n=== Dutch Republic ===\n[[File:COMITATUS HOLLANDIAE 1682.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Holland from 1682]]\nIn the Dutch Rebellion against the Habsburgs during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the naval forces of the rebels, the [[Watergeuzen]], established their first permanent base in 1572 in the town of [[Brielle|Brill]]. In this way, Holland, now a sovereign state in a larger Dutch confederation, became the centre of the rebellion. It became the cultural, political and economic centre of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] ({{Lang-nl|Verenigde Provinci\u00ebn}}), in the 17th century, the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the wealthiest nation in the world. After the [[Act of Abjuration|King of Spain]] was deposed as the count of Holland, the executive and legislative power rested with the States of Holland, which was led by a political figure who held the office of [[Grand Pensionary]].\n\nThe largest cities in the [[Dutch Republic]] were in the province of Holland, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Leiden]], [[Alkmaar]], [[The Hague]], [[Delft]], [[Dordrecht]] and [[Haarlem]]. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over [[Europe]], and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland.\n\nMany Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as ''Holland'' rather than as the ''Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands''. A strong impression of ''Holland'' was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a \"Hollandification\" of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. The dialect of urban Holland became the [[standard language]].\n\n=== Under French rule ===\n{{Further information|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\n[[File:Departments of French Empire North 1811-ex.svg|thumb|Departments of French Empire North 1811]]\n\nThe formation of the [[Batavian Republic]], inspired by the [[French revolution]], led to a more centralised government. Holland became a province of a [[unitary state]]. Its independence was further reduced by an administrative reform in 1798, in which its territory was divided into several departments called ''Amstel'', ''Delf'', ''Texel'', and part of ''Schelde en Maas''.\n\nFrom 1806 to 1810 [[Napoleon]] styled his vassal state, governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis Napoleon]] and shortly by the son of Louis, [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte]], as the \"[[Kingdom of Holland]]\". This kingdom encompassed much of what would become the modern Netherlands. The name reflects how natural at the time it had become to equate Holland with the non-Belgian Netherlands as a whole.<ref>Willem Frijhoff, \"Hollands hegemonie\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2002, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 2, p. 468</ref>\n\nDuring the period when the Low Countries were annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and actually incorporated into France (from 1810 to 1813), Holland was divided into [[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]s [[Zuyderz\u00e9e]], and [[Bouches-de-la-Meuse]]. From 1811 to 1813 [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance]] served as [[governor-general]]. He was assisted by Antoine de Celles, [[Goswin de Stassart]] and Fran\u00e7ois Jean-Baptiste d'Alphonse.<ref>C.F. Gijsberti Hodenpijl (1904) Napoleon in Holland, pp. 6-7.</ref> In 1813, Dutch dignitaries proclaimed the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands]].\n\n=== Kingdom of the Netherlands ===\nIn 1815, Holland was restored as a province of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Holland was divided into the present provinces [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in 1840, after the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830. This reflected a historical division of Holland along the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] into a Southern Quarter (''Zuiderkwartier'') and a Northern Quarter (''Noorderkwartier''),<ref>G. Geerts & H. Heestermans, 1981, ''Groot Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal. Deel II'', Van Dale Lexicografie, Utrecht, p 1831-1832</ref> but the present division is different from the old division. From 1850, a strong process of [[nation building|nation formation]] took place, the Netherlands being culturally unified and economically integrated by a [[Modernization theory|modernisation]] process, with the cities of Holland as its centre.<ref>Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, \"Brandpunt van macht en modernisering\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 548</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Further information|Geography of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Provincie Noord-Holland.gif|thumb|right|North Holland]]\n[[File:Provincie Zuid-Holland.gif|thumb|right|South Holland]]\nHolland is located in the west of the Netherlands. A maritime region, Holland lies on the [[North Sea]] at the mouths of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse]] (Maas). It contains numerous rivers and lakes, and has an extensive inland canal and waterway system. To the south is [[Zeeland|Zealand]]. The region is bordered on the east by the [[IJsselmeer]] and four Dutch provinces.\n\nHolland is protected from the sea by a long line of coastal [[dune]]s. The highest point in Holland, about {{convert|55|m|ft}} above sea level,<ref>{{cite web|title=Highpoints of the Netherlands|url=http://www.summitpost.org/highpoints-of-the-netherlands/462452|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920044727/http://www.summitpost.org/highpoints-of-the-netherlands/462452|archivedate=20 September 2015}}</ref> is in the {{Ill|Schoorlse Duinen|nl}} (Schoorl Dunes). Most of the land area behind the dunes consists of [[polder]] landscape lying well below [[sea level]]. At present the lowest point in Holland is a polder near [[Rotterdam]], which is about {{convert|7|m|ft|lk=out|spell=in}} below sea level. Continuous drainage is necessary to keep Holland from flooding. In earlier centuries [[windmill]]s were used for this task. The landscape was (and in places still is) dotted with windmills, which have become a symbol of Holland.\n\nHolland is {{convert|7,494|km2|lk=out|abbr=off}}, land and water included, making it roughly 13% of the area of the Netherlands. Looking at land alone, it is {{convert|5,488|km2|abbr=off}} in area. The combined population was in 2018 6.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"stat\">{{in lang|nl}} [http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=37230ned&D1=0-2,4-5,7-8,13-17&D2=0,4,8,12-13,30,77&D3=195-206,208-212&HDR=G2&STB=G1,T&VW=T] Statline CBS: Bevolkingsontwikkeling per maand</ref>\n\nThe main cities in Holland are Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. [[Amsterdam]] is formally the [[capital of the Netherlands]] and its largest city. The [[Port of Rotterdam]] is Europe's largest and most important harbour and port. [[The Hague]] is the [[seat of government]] of the Netherlands. These cities, combined with [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and other smaller municipalities, effectively form a single [[Conurbation|metroplex]]\u2014a conurbation called [[Randstad]].\n\nThe Randstad area is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe, but still relatively free of urban sprawl. There are strict [[zoning laws]]. Population pressures are enormous, property values are high, and new housing is constantly under development on the edges of the built-up areas. Surprisingly, much of the province still has a rural character. The remaining agricultural land and natural areas are highly valued and protected. Most of the arable land is used for [[Intensive farming|intensive agriculture]], including horticulture and [[greenhouse]] agri-businesses.\n\n=== Reclamation of the land ===\n[[File:Benthuizen dijk polder.jpg|thumb|left|Benthuizen polder, as seen from a dike]]\nThe land that is now Holland has not been \"stable\" since prehistoric times. The western coastline shifted up to {{convert|30|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} to the east and storm surges regularly broke through the row of coastal dunes. The [[Frisian Islands|Frisian Isles]], originally joined to the mainland, became detached islands in the north. The main rivers, the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River|Meuse (Maas)]], flooded regularly and changed course repeatedly and dramatically.\n\nThe people of Holland found themselves living in an unstable, watery environment. Behind the [[dunes]] on the coast of the Netherlands a high [[peat]] plateau had grown, forming a natural protection against the sea. Much of the area was [[marsh]] and [[bog]]. By the tenth century the inhabitants set about cultivating this land by draining it. However, the drainage resulted in extreme soil shrinkage, lowering the surface of the land by up to {{convert|15|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}}.\n\nTo the south of Holland, in [[Zeeland]], and to the north, in [[Frisia]], this development led to [[Floods in the Netherlands|catastrophic storm floods]] literally washing away entire regions, as the peat layer disintegrated or became detached and was carried away by the flood water. From the Frisian side the sea even flooded the area to the east, gradually hollowing Holland out from behind and forming the [[Zuiderzee]] (the present IJsselmeer). This inland sea threatened to link up with the \"drowned lands\" of Zealand in the south, reducing Holland to a series of narrow dune [[barrier island]]s in front of a [[lagoon]]. Only drastic administrative intervention saved the county from utter destruction. The counts and large monasteries took the lead in these efforts, building the first heavy emergency [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to bolster critical points. Later special autonomous administrative bodies were formed, the ''[[waterschap]]pen'' (\"water control boards\"), which had the legal power to enforce their regulations and decisions on [[water management]]. They eventually constructed an extensive dike system that covered the coastline and the polders, thus protecting the land from further incursions by the sea.\n\nHowever, the Hollanders did not stop there. Starting around the 16th century, they took the offensive and began [[land reclamation]] projects, converting lakes, marshy areas and adjoining mudflats into [[polder]]s. This continued well into the 20th century. As a result, historical maps of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and early modern Holland bear little resemblance to present maps.\n\nThis ongoing struggle to master the water played an important role in the development of Holland as a maritime and economic power, and has traditionally been seen as developing the presumed collective character of its inhabitants: stubborn, egalitarian and frugal.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe stereotypical image of Holland is an artificial amalgam of [[tulip]]s, [[windmill]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|clogs]], [[Edam cheese]] and the traditional dress (''klederdracht'') of the village of [[Volendam]], far from the reality of everyday Holland. These stereotypes were deliberately created in the late 19th century by official \"Holland Promotion\" to attract tourists.\n\nThe predominance of Holland in the Netherlands has resulted in [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] on the part of the other provinces, a reaction to the perceived threat that Holland poses to their local culture and identity. The other provinces have a strong, and often negative,<ref>Rob van Ginkel, \"Hollandse Tonelen\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 688</ref> image of Holland and the Hollanders, to whom certain qualities are ascribed within a [[mental geography]], a conceptual mapping of spaces and their inhabitants.<ref>Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, \"Brandpunt van macht en modernisering\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 556</ref> On the other hand, some Hollanders take Holland's cultural dominance for granted and treat the concepts of \"Holland\" and \"the Netherlands\" as coinciding. Consequently, they see themselves not primarily as Hollanders, but simply as Dutch (''Nederlanders'').<ref>Thimo de Nijs, \"Hollandse identiteit in perspectief\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 700</ref> This phenomenon has been called \"hollandocentrism\".<ref>Rob van Ginkel, \"Hollandse Tonelen\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Vol. 3, p. 647</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe predominant language spoken in Holland is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Hollanders sometimes call the Dutch language \"''Hollands,''\"<ref>''Dutch: An Essential Grammar'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=p9d9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&dq= p. 15], William Z. Shetter, Esther Ham, Routledge, 2007</ref> instead of the standard term ''Nederlands''. Inhabitants of Belgium and other provinces of the Netherlands use \"Hollands\" to mean a [[Hollandic]] dialect or strong accent.\n\nStandard Dutch was historically largely based on the dialect of the [[County of Holland]], incorporating many traits derived from the dialects of the previously more powerful [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[County of Flanders]]. Strong dialectal variation still exists throughout the [[Low Countries]]. Today, Holland proper is the region where the original dialects are least spoken, in many areas having been completely replaced by standard Dutch, and the [[Randstad]] has the largest influence on the developments of the standard language\u2014with the exception of the Dutch spoken in Belgium.<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\nDespite this correspondence between standard Dutch and the Dutch spoken in the Randstad, there are local variations within Holland itself that differ from standard Dutch. The main cities each have their own modern urban dialect, that can be considered a [[sociolect]].<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, p. 123</ref> Some people, especially in the area north of Amsterdam, still speak the original dialect of the county, Hollandic. This dialect is present in the north: [[Volendam]] and [[Marken]] and the area around there, [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]] and the [[Zaanstreek]]; and in a southeastern fringe bordering the provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Utrecht]]. In the south on the island of [[Goeree-Overflakkee]], [[Zeelandic]] is spoken.<ref>E.J. van den Broecke-de Man, D.K. Soldaat-Poortvliet & F. Heerschap, 1988,  ''Dialect op Goeree-Overflakkee'', Zeeuwsche Vereeniging voor Dialectonderzoek, Ouddorp, 271 pp</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== New Holland ===\n{{see|New Holland (disambiguation){{!}}New Holland}}\nThe province of Holland gave its name to a number of colonial settlements and discovered regions that were called ''Nieuw Holland'' or [[New Holland (disambiguation)|New Holland]]. The largest was the island continent presently known as [[Australia]]:<ref name=\"Van Dale\"/> [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] was first applied to Australia in 1644 by the Dutch seafarer [[Dirk Hartog]] as a [[Latin]] ''Nova Hollandia'', and remained in international use for 190 years. Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] named [[New Zealand]] after the Dutch province of [[Zeeland|Zealand]]. In the Netherlands ''Nieuw Holland'' would remain the usual name of the continent until the end of the 19th century; it is now no longer in use there, the Dutch name today being ''Australi\u00eb''.\n\n=== As contemporary exonym for the Netherlands ===\n{{see|Terminology of the Low Countries#Holland as exonym}}\nWhile \"Holland\" has been replaced in English as the official name for the country of the Netherlands, other languages still use it or a variant of it to officially refer to the Netherlands. This is still the case in the [[languages of Indonesia]], for example:\n* [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]]: ''[[:ace:Blanda|Blanda]]''\n* [[Banjar language|Banjar]]: ''[[:bjn:Walanda|Walanda]]''\n* [[Banyumasan dialect|Banyumasan]]: ''[[:map-bms:Landa|Landa]]''\n* [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''[[:id:Belanda|Belanda]]''\n* [[Javanese language|Javanese]]: ''[[:jv:Walanda|Walanda]]''\n* [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''[[:ms:Belanda|Belanda]]''\n* [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]]: ''[[:min:Balando|Balando]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{Coord|52.250|N|4.667|E|display=title|source:nlwiki}}\n\n[[Category:Holland| ]]<!--please leave the empty space as standard-->\n\n[[Category:Regions of the Netherlands]]\n", "name_user": "Moiikke", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland"}
