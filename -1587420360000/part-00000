Grant]] ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack.\nThe volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \"forlorn hope\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.\nThe Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed.

Grant]] ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack.\nThe volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \"forlorn hope\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.\nThe Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed.

countries as the shortened version of [[Alexander]] and [[Alexandra]] or their regional alternatives. It is also used as a [[surname]], although very rarely. Alternative spellings include: '''{{lang|ru|\u0421\u0430\u0448\u0430}}''' ({{lang|ru-Latn|Sasha}} \u2013 Russian, Serbo-Croatian), '''{{lang|bg|\u0421\u0430\u0448\u043e}}''' ({{lang|bg-Latn|Sasho}} \u2013 Bulgarian), '''{{lang|mk|\u0421\u0430\u0448\u0435}}''' ({{lang|mk-Latn|Sashe}} \u2013 Macedonian), '''{{lang|sl|Sa\u0161a|italic=no}}''' (Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Slovak, Latvian, Lithuanian), '''{{lang|ro|Sa\u0219a|italic=no}}''' (Romanian), '''{{lang|pl|Sasza|italic=no}}''' (Polish), '''{{lang|uk|\u0421\u0430\u0448\u043a\u043e}}''' ({{lang|uk-Latn|Sashko}} \u2013 Ukrainian), '''{{lang|de|Sascha|italic=no}}''' (German), '''{{lang|nl|Sasja|italic=no}}''' (Danish and Swedish), '''{{lang|fr|Sacha|italic=no}}''' (French), and '''{{lang|he|\u05e1\u05e9\u05d4}}''' ({{lang|mk-Latn|Sasha}} \u2013 Yiddish and Hebrew).\n\n== Usage ==\nThis name is especially common in Europe, where it is used by both females and males as a diminutive of Alexandra and Alexander, respectively. Despite its popularity in informal usage, the name is rarely recorded on birth certificates in countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, as it is considered a diminutive, not a formal name. Exceptions are Croatia, Germany, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia and Switzerland. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn French-speaking regions ([[Belgium]],

Born and raised in [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]], he worked as a teacher and farmer before developing an interest in mycology. He collected specimens extensively, and together with his wife, prepared 200,000 sets of dried fungal samples that were sent out to subscribers in series between 1878 and 1894. Together with colleagues [[William A. Kellerman]] and [[Benjamin Matlack Everhart]], he founded the ''Journal of Mycology'' in 1885, forerunner to the modern journal ''[[Mycologia]]''. He described over 4000 species of fungi, and his collection of over 100,000 specimens is currently housed at the [[herbarium]] of the [[New York Botanical Gardens]]. Ellis had over 100 [[taxon|taxa]] of fungi named in his honor.\n\n==Life==\n\nEllis was born in [[Potsdam, New York]] on January 21, 1829 to parents Freeman Ellis and Sarah Bicknell. He was the tenth child of fourteen. In 1851, he graduated from [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], the same institution attended by lichenologist [[Edward Tuckerman]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] 1837) and mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] (A.B. 1859). Bicknell began an erratic career as a [[classics]] teacher and farmer in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[South Carolina]]. He became the principal of the Canton Academy in 1856, the same year he married Arvilla Jane Bacon, who became his lifelong assistant and collaborator. Their daughter Cora was born on January 12, 1857; she later became a professional musician in New York. It was around this time that Bicknell started developing his interest in botany, by collecting plants with fellow teachers on weekends. He saw a copy of [[Henry William Ravenel]]'s ''Fungi Caroliniani Exsiccati'', a set of dried specimens (exsiccati) collected from [[North Carolina]] and area.

Born and raised in [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]], he worked as a teacher and farmer before developing an interest in mycology. He collected specimens extensively, and together with his wife, prepared 200,000 sets of dried fungal samples that were sent out to subscribers in series between 1878 and 1894. Together with colleagues [[William A. Kellerman]] and [[Benjamin Matlack Everhart]], he founded the ''Journal of Mycology'' in 1885, forerunner to the modern journal ''[[Mycologia]]''. He described over 4000 species of fungi, and his collection of over 100,000 specimens is currently housed at the [[herbarium]] of the [[New York Botanical Gardens]]. Ellis had over 100 [[taxon|taxa]] of fungi named in his honor.\n\n==Life==\n\nEllis was born in [[Potsdam, New York]] on January 21, 1829 to parents Freeman Ellis and Sarah Bicknell. He was the tenth child of fourteen. In 1851, he graduated from [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], the same institution attended by lichenologist [[Edward Tuckerman]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] 1837) and mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] (A.B. 1859). Bicknell began an erratic career as a [[classics]] teacher and farmer in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[South Carolina]]. He became the principal of the Canton Academy in 1856, the same year he married Arvilla Jane Bacon, who became his lifelong assistant and collaborator. Their daughter Cora was born on January 12, 1857; she later became a professional musician in New York. It was around this time that Bicknell started developing his interest in botany, by collecting plants with fellow teachers on weekends. He saw a copy of [[Henry William Ravenel]]'s ''Fungi Caroliniani Exsiccati'', a set of dried specimens (exsiccati) collected from [[North Carolina]] and area.
