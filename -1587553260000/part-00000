He developed an easily recognizable style of Late [[Elizabethan baroque|Baroque]], both sumptuous and majestic. His major works, including the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and the [[Catherine Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], are famed for extravagant luxury and opulence of decoration.<ref name=brit/>\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1716, Bartolomeo moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, accompanying his father, Italian sculptor [[Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] (1675\u20131744).<ref name=brit/> His ambition was to combine the latest Italian architectural fashion with traditions of the [[Naryshkin Baroque|Muscovite Baroque]] style. The first important commission came in 1721 when he was asked to build a palace for Prince [[Dmitri Kantemir|Demetre Cantemir]], former ruler of [[Moldavia]].\n\nHe was appointed to the post of senior court architect in 1730. His works found favour with female monarchs of his time, and he retained this post throughout the reigns of Empresses [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] (1730\u20131740) and [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] (1741\u20131762).\n\nRastrelli's last and most ambitious project was the [[Smolny Convent]] in St. Petersburg where Empress Elizabeth was to spend the rest of her life. The projected [[belfry (architecture)|bell-tower]] was to become the tallest building in St Petersburg and all of Russia.

He developed an easily recognizable style of Late [[Elizabethan baroque|Baroque]], both sumptuous and majestic. His major works, including the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and the [[Catherine Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], are famed for extravagant luxury and opulence of decoration.<ref name=brit/>\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1716, Bartolomeo moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, accompanying his father, Italian sculptor [[Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] (1675\u20131744).<ref name=brit/> His ambition was to combine the latest Italian architectural fashion with traditions of the [[Naryshkin Baroque|Muscovite Baroque]] style. The first important commission came in 1721 when he was asked to build a palace for Prince [[Dmitri Kantemir|Demetre Cantemir]], former ruler of [[Moldavia]].\n\nHe was appointed to the post of senior court architect in 1730. His works found favour with female monarchs of his time, and he retained this post throughout the reigns of Empresses [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] (1730\u20131740) and [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] (1741\u20131762).\n\nRastrelli's last and most ambitious project was the [[Smolny Convent]] in St. Petersburg where Empress Elizabeth was to spend the rest of her life. The projected [[belfry (architecture)|bell-tower]] was to become the tallest building in St Petersburg and all of Russia. Elizabeth's death in 1762 prevented Rastrelli from completing this grand design.<ref name=brit/>\n\nThe new empress, [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], dismissed [[Baroque architecture]] as an old-fashioned \"whipped cream\", and the aged architect retired to [[Courland]], where he supervised the completion and decoration of the ducal palaces.\n\nHis last years were spent in obscure commerce with Italian art-dealers.

Developing a good relationship with [[target markets]] is essential for brand management. Tangible elements of brand management include the product itself; its look, price, and packaging, etc.  The intangible elements are the experiences that the [[target markets]] share with the brand, and also the relationships they have with the brand.  A brand manager would oversee all aspects of the consumer's brand association as well as relationships with members of the [[supply chain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/understanding-the-power-of-a-brand-name.html|title=Understanding the Power of a Brand Name|website=www.nielsen.com}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nIn 2001, Hislop defined branding as \"the process of creating a relationship or a connection between a company's product and emotional perception of the customer for the purpose of generating segregation among competition and building loyalty among customers\". In 2004 and 2008, Kapferer and Keller respectively defined it as a fulfillment in customer expectations and consistent customer satisfaction.<ref name=shamoon2011>Shamoon, Sumaira, and Saiqa Tehseen. \"Brand Management: What Next?\" ''Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business'' 2.12 (2011): 435\u2013441.

Based on the aims of the established marketing strategy, brand management enables the price of products to grow and builds loyal customers through positive associations and images or a strong awareness of the brand.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brand Management Definition|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-management.asp|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBrand management is the process of identifying the core value of a particular brand and reflecting the core value among the targeted customers. In modern terms, a brand could be corporate, product, service, or person. Brand management builds brand credibility and credible brands only can build brand loyalty, bounce back from circumstantial crisis, and can benefit from price-sensitive customers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e\u00c9mileCh\u00e9non6716.jpg|thumb|left|In pre-literate societies, the distinctive shape of [[amphorae]] served some of the functions of a label, communicating information about region of origin, the name of the producer and may have carried product [[quality claim]]s]]\n\nThe earliest origins of branding can be traced to [[pre-historic]] times. The practice may have first begun with the [[cattle branding|branding of farm animals]] in the middle East in the [[neolithic]] period. [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[cave painting]]s depict images of branded cattle. [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] funerary artwork also depicts branded animals.<ref>Briciu, V.A, and Briciu, A., \"A Brief History of Brands and the Evolution of Place Branding,\" Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov [Series VII: Social Sciences], Vol. 9 (58) No. 2 2016, p.137 <Online: http://webbut.unitbv.ro/bulletin/Series%20VII/BULETIN%20I/22_Briciu.pdf</ref> Over time, the practice was extended to marking personal property such as pottery or tools, and eventually some type of brand or insignia was attached to goods intended for trade.\n\nAround 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.<ref>[[Wengrow, David]], \"Prehistories of Commodity Branding,\" ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7\u201334</ref> Bevan and Wengrow have argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient Mesopotamia in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding.<ref>Bevan, A, \"Making and Marking Relationships: Bronze Age Brandings and Mediterranean Commodities In Bevan, A. and D. Wengrow (eds.), ''Cultures of Commodity Branding,'' Walnut Coast, Left Coast Press, 2010</ref> Diana Twede has argued that the \"consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions\" (p.&nbsp;107). She has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for purchasers during exchange. Systematic use of stamped labels dates appears to date from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings functioned as a brand, conveying information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality.<ref>Twede, D., \"Commercial amphoras: The earliest consumer packages?\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 1, 2002, pp 98\u2013108</ref>\n\nA number of archaeological research studies have found extensive evidence of branding, packaging and [[labelling]] in antiquity.<ref>Maran, J. and Stockhammer, P.W.

Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  \"Lassius\" and \"L. Eumachius;\" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name and other information including the use, price or intended recipient. These markings demonstrate the public's need for product information in an increasingly complex [[market (place)|market-place]].<ref>Beard, M., ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,'' Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, \"Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker,\"</ref>\n\nIn the East, evidence of branding also dates to an early period. Recent research suggests that Chinese merchants made extensive use of branding, packaging, advertising and retail signage.<ref>Moore, K. and Reid., S., \"The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding,\" ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp 419\u201332.</ref> From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 AD.<ref>Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. \"A Brief History of Branding in China,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp 210\u2013221</ref> Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the [[Economy of the Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131127), Chinese society developed a [[consumerist]] culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite (p.&nbsp;212). The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, [[trademark protection]] and the brand concepts of baoji, hao, lei, gongpin, piazi and pinpai, which roughly equate with Western concepts of family status, quality grading, and upholding traditional Chinese values (p.&nbsp;219). Eckhardt and Bengtsson's analysis suggests that brands emerged in China as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture, in which brands provide social status and stratification. Thus, the evolution of brands in China stands in sharp contrast to the West where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate, increase market share and ultimately profits (pp 218\u2013219). In Japan, branding has a long heritage. For many Japanese businesses, a \"mon\" or seal is an East Asian form of brand or trademark.\n[[File:DUR-F8A896 Hallmark (FindID 583041).jpg|thumb|left|Hallmark on an English silver spoon, dated to the Medieval period]]\nNot all historians agree that the distinctive packages and markings used in antiquity can be compared with modern brands or labels. Moore and Reid, for example, have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed ''proto-brands'' rather than seen as modern brands according to our modern understanding.<ref>Moore, K. and Reid., S., \"The Birth of the Brand: 4000 Years of Branding,\" ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008, p. 5; 23</ref> A proto-brand is one that possesses at least one of three characteristics; ''place'' \u2013 information about the origin of manufacture-expressed by a mark, signature or even by the physical properties of the raw  materials including the packaging materials,  ''performs a basic marketing function'' such as storage, transportation and assortment; and ''quality attributes''- information about the product's quality expressed by the name of the manufacturer, place of origin or ingredients or any other generally accepted indicator of quality.<ref>Briciu, V.A, and Briciu, A., \"A Brief History of Brands and the Evolution of Branding,\" Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov [Series VII: Social Sciences], Vol. 9 (58) No. 2 2016, p.139 <Online: http://webbut.unitbv.ro/bulletin/Series%20VII/BULETIN%20I/22_Briciu.pdf</ref>\n\nThe impetus for more widespread branding was often provided by government laws, requiring producers to meet minimum quality specifications or to standardise weights and measures, which in turn, was driven by public concerns about quality and fairness in exchange. The use of [[hallmark]]s, applied to precious metal objects, was well in place by the 4th century CE in Byzantium. Evidence of silver bars marked under authority of the Emperor [[Augustinian]] dates to around 350 CE, and represents one of the oldest known forms of consumer protection.<ref>{{cite report |last1=Benson |first1=Paul L. |last2=Gilmore |first2=Robert S. |url=https://www.ncptt.nps.gov/blog/non-destructive-imaging-of-worn-off-hallmarks-and-engravings-from-metal-objects-of-art-using-acoustic-microscopy-2004-06/ |title=Non-Destructive Imaging of Worn-off Hallmarks and Engravings from Metal Objects of Art Using Scanning Acoustic Microscopy |date=15 November 2004 |others=[[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] |publisher=[[National Center for Preservation Technology and Training]] |publication-place=Natchitoches, LA }}<br>Cites: {{cite book |last=Dodd |first=Erica Cruikshank |title=Byzantine Silver Stamps |series=Dumbarton Oaks Studies |volume=7 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection |location=Washington |date=1961 |pages=23\u201335 |others=J.P.C.

Craft guilds, which sprang up across Europe around this time, codified and reinforced, systems of marking products to ensure quality and standards. Bread-makers, silversmiths and goldsmiths all marked their wares during this period.<ref>Dvorak, F., ''Build Your Own Brand,'' Pelican, Louisiana, 2010, p. 13</ref> By 1266, English bakers were required by law to put a symbol on each product they sold. Bricui et al. have argued that the number of different forms of brands blossomed from the 14th century following the period of European discovery and expansion.<ref>Briciu, V.A, and Briciu, A., \"A Brief History of Brands and the Evolution of Place Branding,\" Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov [Series VII: Social Sciences], Vol. 9 (58) No. 2 2016, p.137-38 Online: http://webbut.unitbv.ro/bulletin/Series%20VII/BULETIN%20I/22_Briciu.pdf</ref> Some individual brand marks have been in continuous use for centuries. The brand, [[Staffelter Hof]], for example, dates to 862 or earlier and the company still produces wine under its name today.\n\nThe granting a royal charter to tradesmen, markets and fairs was practiced across Europe from the early Medieval period. At a time when concerns about product quality were major public issues, a royal endorsement provided the public with a signal that the holder supplied goods worthy of use in the Royal household, and by implication inspired public confidence. In the 15th century, a ''[[Royal warrant of appointment]]'' replaced the royal charter in England. The Lord Chamberlain of England formally appointed tradespeople as suppliers to the Royal household.<ref>Otnes, C.C., and Maclaran,''Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture,''University  of California Press, 2015, pp 167\u201369</ref> The printer, [[William Caxton]], for example, was one of the earliest recipients of a Royal Warrant when he became the King's printer in 1476.<ref>Heald, T., ''A Peerage for Trade: A History of the Royal Warrant,'' Royal Warrant Holders Association, 2001; Barford, V., \"Royal warrants: What they tell us about the Royal Family,\" ''BBC News Magazine,'' 12 July 2013, Online: https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23255710; Wakelin, D., \"Caxton's Exemplar for The Chronicles of England?\" ''Journal of the Early Book Society, '' No. 14, 2011,  p. 75</ref> By the 18th-century, mass market manufacturers such as [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], recognised the value of supplying royalty, often at prices well below cost, for the sake of the publicity and cudos it generated.<ref>Applbaum, K., ''The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning,'' Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127</ref> Many manufacturers began actively displaying the royal arms on their premises, packaging and labelling.

Retailers were tending to specialize in specific goods or services and began to exhibit a variety of modern marketing techniques.

Many of the earliest radio drama series were sponsored by soap manufacturers and the genre became known as a ''[[soap opera]].''<ref>Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}</ref> Before long, radio station owners realized they could increase advertising revenue by selling 'air-time' in small time allocations which could be sold to multiple businesses. By the 1930s, these ''advertising spots,'' as the packets of time became known, were being sold by the station's geographical sales representatives, ushering in an era of national radio advertising.<ref>Leigh, F., ''Historical Dictionary of American Radio,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, p.8</ref>\n\nFrom the first decades of the 20th-century, advertisers began to focus on developing brand personality, brand image and brand identity\u2014concepts. The British advertising agency, W. S. Crawford's Ltd, began to use the concept of 'product personality' and the 'advertising idea' arguing that in order to stimulate sales and create a 'buying habit', advertising had to 'build a definitive association of ideas round the goods'. In the US, advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson company (JWT), was pioneering similar concepts of brand personality and brand image. The notion of a 'brand personality' was developed independently and simultaneously in both the US and Britain.<ref>Schwarzkopf, S., ''Turning Trade Marks into Brands: How Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900\u20131930,'' CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008, p. 22</ref> For example, in 1915 JWT acquired the advertising account for Lux soap and recommended that the traditional positioning as a product for woolen garments should be broadened so that consumers would see it as a soap for use on all fine fabrics in the household. To implement, Lux was repositioned with a more up-market posture, and began a long association with expensive clothing and high fashion. Cano has argued that the positioning strategy JWT used for Lux exhibited an insightful understanding of the way that consumers mentally construct brand images. JWT recognised that advertising effectively manipulated socially shared symbols. In the case of Lux, the brand disconnected from images of household drudgery, and connected with images of leisure and fashion.<ref>Cano,  C., \"The  Recent  Evolution  of  Market  Segmentation  Concepts  and  Thoughts  Primarily  by  Marketing  Academics,\" in  E.

Strong branded campaigns for  Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn research methods from psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th-century. Esso's \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\" campaign was based on a tiger mascot used in Scandinavia at the turn of last century, and first appeared as a global advertising slogan in the 1950s and 60s, and subsequently reappeared in the 1990s.<ref>Karmasin, H., \"Ernest Dichter\u2019s Studies on Automobile Marketing,\" in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R.

For this reason, industries such as agricultural (which sells to other companies in the food sector), student loans (which have a relationship with universities/schools rather than the individual loan-taker), and electricity (which is generally a controlled monopoly) have less prominent and less recognized branding. Brand value, moreover, is not simply a fuzzy feeling of \"consumer appeal,\" but an actual quantitative value of good will under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Companies will rigorously defend their brand name, including prosecution of [[trademark infringement]]. Occasionally trademarks may differ across countries.\n\n[[File:Coca Cola in France.jpg|thumb|The distinctive red colour, custom-designed Spencerian script and the shape of the bottle make Coca-Cola one of the most recognisable brands globally]]\n\nAmong the most highly visible and recognizable brands is the script and logo for [[Coca-Cola]] products. Despite numerous blind tests indicating that Coke's flavor is not preferred, Coca-Cola continues to enjoy a dominant share of the cola market. Coca-Cola's history is so replete with uncertainty that a folklore has sprung up around the brand, including the (refuted) myth that Coca-Cola invented the red-dressed Santa-Claus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/santa/cocacola.asp|title=FACT CHECK: Did Coca-Cola Invent the Modern Image of Santa Claus?|publisher=}}</ref> which is used to gain market entry in less capitalistic regions in the world such as the former Soviet Union and China, and such brand-management stories as \"Coca-Cola's first entry into the Chinese market resulted in their brand being translated as 'bite the wax tadpole'\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/tadpole.asp|title=FACT CHECK: Bite the Wax Tadpole|publisher=}}</ref> Brand management science is replete with such stories, including the Chevrolet 'Nova' or \"it doesn't go\" in Spanish, and proper cultural translation is useful to companies entering new markets.\n\nModern brand management also intersects with legal issues such as '[[Generic trademark|genericization of trademark]].' The 'Xerox' Company continues to fight heavily in media whenever a reporter or other writer uses 'xerox' as simply a synonym for 'photocopy.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28238/25-words-you-might-not-know-are-trademarked|title=41 Brand Names People Use as Generic Terms|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref> Should usage of 'xerox' be accepted as the standard American English term for 'photocopy,' then Xerox's competitors could successfully argue in court that they are permitted to create 'xerox' machines as well.

The most important driving force behind this increased interest in strong brands is the accelerating pace of [[globalization]]. This has resulted in an ever-tougher competitive situation on many markets. A product's superiority is in itself no longer sufficient to guarantee its success. The fast pace of technological development and the increased speed with which imitations turn up on the market have dramatically shortened [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycles]]. The consequence is that product-related [[competitive advantage]]s soon risk being transformed into competitive prerequisites. For this reason, increasing numbers of companies are looking for other, more enduring, competitive tools \u2013 such as brands.\n\n==Justification==\nBrand management aims to create an emotional connection between products, companies and their customers and constituents.

A typical \"no-brand\" advertisement might simply put up the price (and indeed, brand managers may patrol retail outlets for using their name in discount/clearance sales), whereas on the other end of the extreme a perfume brand might be created that does not show the actual use of the perfume or [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] may sponsor an aerobatics team purely for the \"image\" created by such sponsorship. Space travel and brand management for this reason also enjoys a special relationship.\n\n\"[[Nation branding]]\" is a modern term conflating foreign relations and the idea of a brand.<ref>{{cite book|last=True|first=Jacqui|author-link=Jacqui True|editor=Raymond Miller|year=2006|title=Globalisation and Identity|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=South Melbourne|isbn=978-0-19-558492-9|page=74}}</ref> An example is [[Cool Britannia]] of the 1990s.\n\n==Social media==\n\nEven though social media has changed the tactics of marketing brands, its primary goals remain the same; to attract and retain customers.<ref>Weber, L.

Based on the aims of the established marketing strategy, brand management enables the price of products to grow and builds loyal customers through positive associations and images or a strong awareness of the brand.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brand Management Definition|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-management.asp|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBrand management is the process of identifying the core value of a particular brand and reflecting the core value among the targeted customers. In modern terms, a brand could be corporate, product, service, or person. Brand management builds brand credibility and credible brands only can build brand loyalty, bounce back from circumstantial crisis, and can benefit from price-sensitive customers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e\u00c9mileCh\u00e9non6716.jpg|thumb|left|In pre-literate societies, the distinctive shape of [[amphorae]] served some of the functions of a label, communicating information about region of origin, the name of the producer and may have carried product [[quality claim]]s]]\n\nThe earliest origins of branding can be traced to [[pre-historic]] times. The practice may have first begun with the [[cattle branding|branding of farm animals]] in the middle East in the [[neolithic]] period.

Systematic use of stamped labels dates appears to date from around the fourth century BCE.

Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  \"Lassius\" and \"L. Eumachius;\" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name and other information including the use, price or intended recipient. These markings demonstrate the public's need for product information in an increasingly complex [[market (place)|market-place]].<ref>Beard, M., ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,'' Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, \"Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker,\"</ref>\n\nIn the East, evidence of branding also dates to an early period. Recent research suggests that Chinese merchants made extensive use of branding, packaging, advertising and retail signage.<ref>Moore, K. and Reid., S., \"The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding,\" ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp 419\u201332.</ref> From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 AD.<ref>Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. \"A Brief History of Branding in China,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp 210\u2013221</ref> Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the [[Economy of the Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131127), Chinese society developed a [[consumerist]] culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite (p.&nbsp;212). The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, [[trademark protection]] and the brand concepts of baoji, hao, lei, gongpin, piazi and pinpai, which roughly equate with Western concepts of family status, quality grading, and upholding traditional Chinese values (p.&nbsp;219). Eckhardt and Bengtsson's analysis suggests that brands emerged in China as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture, in which brands provide social status and stratification. Thus, the evolution of brands in China stands in sharp contrast to the West where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate, increase market share and ultimately profits (pp 218\u2013219). In Japan, branding has a long heritage. For many Japanese businesses, a \"mon\" or seal is an East Asian form of brand or trademark.\n[[File:DUR-F8A896 Hallmark (FindID 583041).jpg|thumb|left|Hallmark on an English silver spoon, dated to the Medieval period]]\nNot all historians agree that the distinctive packages and markings used in antiquity can be compared with modern brands or labels. Moore and Reid, for example, have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed ''proto-brands'' rather than seen as modern brands according to our modern understanding.<ref>Moore, K. and Reid., S., \"The Birth of the Brand: 4000 Years of Branding,\" ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008, p. 5; 23</ref> A proto-brand is one that possesses at least one of three characteristics; ''place'' \u2013 information about the origin of manufacture-expressed by a mark, signature or even by the physical properties of the raw  materials including the packaging materials,  ''performs a basic marketing function'' such as storage, transportation and assortment; and ''quality attributes''- information about the product's quality expressed by the name of the manufacturer, place of origin or ingredients or any other generally accepted indicator of quality.<ref>Briciu, V.A, and Briciu, A., \"A Brief History of Brands and the Evolution of Branding,\" Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Bra\u015fov [Series VII: Social Sciences], Vol. 9 (58) No. 2 2016, p.139 <Online: http://webbut.unitbv.ro/bulletin/Series%20VII/BULETIN%20I/22_Briciu.pdf</ref>\n\nThe impetus for more widespread branding was often provided by government laws, requiring producers to meet minimum quality specifications or to standardise weights and measures, which in turn, was driven by public concerns about quality and fairness in exchange. The use of [[hallmark]]s, applied to precious metal objects, was well in place by the 4th century CE in Byzantium. Evidence of silver bars marked under authority of the Emperor [[Augustinian]] dates to around 350 CE, and represents one of the oldest known forms of consumer protection.<ref>{{cite report |last1=Benson |first1=Paul L. |last2=Gilmore |first2=Robert S. |url=https://www.ncptt.nps.gov/blog/non-destructive-imaging-of-worn-off-hallmarks-and-engravings-from-metal-objects-of-art-using-acoustic-microscopy-2004-06/ |title=Non-Destructive Imaging of Worn-off Hallmarks and Engravings from Metal Objects of Art Using Scanning Acoustic Microscopy |date=15 November 2004 |others=[[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] |publisher=[[National Center for Preservation Technology and Training]] |publication-place=Natchitoches, LA }}<br>Cites: {{cite book |last=Dodd |first=Erica Cruikshank |title=Byzantine Silver Stamps |series=Dumbarton Oaks Studies |volume=7 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection |location=Washington |date=1961 |pages=23\u201335 |others=J.P.C.

Craft guilds, which sprang up across Europe around this time, codified and reinforced, systems of marking products to ensure quality and standards. Bread-makers, silversmiths and goldsmiths all marked their wares during this period.<ref>Dvorak, F., ''Build Your Own Brand,'' Pelican, Louisiana, 2010, p. 13</ref> By 1266, English bakers were required by law to put a symbol on each product they sold.

The brand, [[Staffelter Hof]], for example, dates to 862 or earlier and the company still produces wine under its name today.\n\nThe granting a royal charter to tradesmen, markets and fairs was practiced across Europe from the early Medieval period. At a time when concerns about product quality were major public issues, a royal endorsement provided the public with a signal that the holder supplied goods worthy of use in the Royal household, and by implication inspired public confidence. In the 15th century, a ''[[Royal warrant of appointment]]'' replaced the royal charter in England. The Lord Chamberlain of England formally appointed tradespeople as suppliers to the Royal household.<ref>Otnes, C.C., and Maclaran,''Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture,''University  of California Press, 2015, pp 167\u201369</ref> The printer, [[William Caxton]], for example, was one of the earliest recipients of a Royal Warrant when he became the King's printer in 1476.<ref>Heald, T., ''A Peerage for Trade: A History of the Royal Warrant,'' Royal Warrant Holders Association, 2001; Barford, V., \"Royal warrants: What they tell us about the Royal Family,\" ''BBC News Magazine,'' 12 July 2013, Online: https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23255710; Wakelin, D., \"Caxton's Exemplar for The Chronicles of England?\" ''Journal of the Early Book Society, '' No. 14, 2011,  p. 75</ref> By the 18th-century, mass market manufacturers such as [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]], recognised the value of supplying royalty, often at prices well below cost, for the sake of the publicity and cudos it generated.<ref>Applbaum, K., ''The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning,'' Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127</ref> Many manufacturers began actively displaying the royal arms on their premises, packaging and labelling.

Many of the earliest radio drama series were sponsored by soap manufacturers and the genre became known as a ''[[soap opera]].''<ref>Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}</ref> Before long, radio station owners realized they could increase advertising revenue by selling 'air-time' in small time allocations which could be sold to multiple businesses.

The British advertising agency, W. S. Crawford's Ltd, began to use the concept of 'product personality' and the 'advertising idea' arguing that in order to stimulate sales and create a 'buying habit', advertising had to 'build a definitive association of ideas round the goods'. In the US, advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson company (JWT), was pioneering similar concepts of brand personality and brand image. The notion of a 'brand personality' was developed independently and simultaneously in both the US and Britain.<ref>Schwarzkopf, S., ''Turning Trade Marks into Brands: How Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900\u20131930,'' CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008, p. 22</ref> For example, in 1915 JWT acquired the advertising account for Lux soap and recommended that the traditional positioning as a product for woolen garments should be broadened so that consumers would see it as a soap for use on all fine fabrics in the household. To implement, Lux was repositioned with a more up-market posture, and began a long association with expensive clothing and high fashion. Cano has argued that the positioning strategy JWT used for Lux exhibited an insightful understanding of the way that consumers mentally construct brand images. JWT recognised that advertising effectively manipulated socially shared symbols. In the case of Lux, the brand disconnected from images of household drudgery, and connected with images of leisure and fashion.<ref>Cano,  C., \"The  Recent  Evolution  of  Market  Segmentation  Concepts  and  Thoughts  Primarily  by  Marketing  Academics,\" in  E.

For this reason, industries such as agricultural (which sells to other companies in the food sector), student loans (which have a relationship with universities/schools rather than the individual loan-taker), and electricity (which is generally a controlled monopoly) have less prominent and less recognized branding. Brand value, moreover, is not simply a fuzzy feeling of \"consumer appeal,\" but an actual quantitative value of good will under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Despite numerous blind tests indicating that Coke's flavor is not preferred, Coca-Cola continues to enjoy a dominant share of the cola market.

The most important driving force behind this increased interest in strong brands is the accelerating pace of [[globalization]]. This has resulted in an ever-tougher competitive situation on many markets. A product's superiority is in itself no longer sufficient to guarantee its success. The fast pace of technological development and the increased speed with which imitations turn up on the market have dramatically shortened [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycles]]. The consequence is that product-related [[competitive advantage]]s soon risk being transformed into competitive prerequisites. For this reason, increasing numbers of companies are looking for other, more enduring, competitive tools \u2013 such as brands.\n\n==Justification==\nBrand management aims to create an emotional connection between products, companies and their customers and constituents. Brand managers & Marketing managers may try to control the [[brand image]].<ref name=shamoon2011/>\n\nBrand managers create strategies to convert a suspect to prospect, prospect to buyer, buyer to customer, and customer to brand advocates.\n\n==Approaches==\n\n\"By Appointment to His Royal Majesty\" was a registered and limited list of approved brands suitable for supply to the Royal British family.\n\nSome believe brand managers can be counter-productive, due to their short-term focus.<ref name=shamoon2011/>\n\nOn the other end of the extreme, luxury and high-end premium brands may create advertisements or sponsor teams merely for the \"overall feeling\" or goodwill generated. A typical \"no-brand\" advertisement might simply put up the price (and indeed, brand managers may patrol retail outlets for using their name in discount/clearance sales), whereas on the other end of the extreme a perfume brand might be created that does not show the actual use of the perfume or [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] may sponsor an aerobatics team purely for the \"image\" created by such sponsorship. Space travel and brand management for this reason also enjoys a special relationship.\n\n\"[[Nation branding]]\" is a modern term conflating foreign relations and the idea of a brand.<ref>{{cite book|last=True|first=Jacqui|author-link=Jacqui True|editor=Raymond Miller|year=2006|title=Globalisation and Identity|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=South Melbourne|isbn=978-0-19-558492-9|page=74}}</ref> An example is [[Cool Britannia]] of the 1990s.\n\n==Social media==\n\nEven though social media has changed the tactics of marketing brands, its primary goals remain the same; to attract and retain customers.<ref>Weber, L. (2009). Marketing to the social web: How digital customer communities build your business. London: Wiley.</ref> However, companies have now experienced a new challenge with the introduction of social media.  This change is finding the right balance between empowering customers to spread the word about the brand through viral platforms, while still controlling the company's own core strategic marketing goals.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wolny, J. |author2=Mueller, C. |year=2013|title=Analysis of fashion consumers' motives to engage in electronic word-of-mouth communication through social media platforms|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=29|issue=5/6|pages=562\u2013583|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2013.778324}}</ref> Word-of-mouth marketing via social media, falls under the category of viral marketing, which broadly describes any strategy that encourages individuals to propagate a message, thus, creating the potential for exponential growth in the message's exposure and influence.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Bampo, M. |author2=Ewing, M.

This marketing technique allows users to spread the word on the brand which creates exposure for the company. Because of this, brands have become interested in exploring or using social media for commercial benefit.\n\n==Brand heritage==\n\nBrands with heritage are not simply associated with antiquated organizations; rather, they actively extol values and position themselves in relation to their heritage.<ref name=\"Curran 1234\u20131257\">{{Cite journal|last=Curran|first=Ross|last2=Taheri|first2=Babak|last3=MacIntosh|first3=Robert|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2016-12-01|title=Nonprofit Brand Heritage: Its Ability to Influence Volunteer Retention, Engagement, and Satisfaction|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|language=en|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1234\u20131257|doi=10.1177/0899764016633532|issn=0899-7640|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd1c9ec940bfa8ed2a588f14bc6735abd3051c68}}</ref> Brands offer multiple benefits to organisations at various market levels, reflecting the entire experiential process afforded to consumers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin Lane|last2=Lehmann|first2=Donald R.|date=2006-11-01|title=Brands and Branding: Research Findings and Future Priorities|journal=Marketing Science|volume=25|issue=6|pages=740\u2013759|doi=10.1287/mksc.1050.0153|issn=0732-2399|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2e004c4b77b22d881e29ccb99cc1d290155ed8e3}}</ref> In the case of voluntary organisations if they can unlock their brand heritage and it will improve volunteer engagement, to the extent that organisations 'with a long history, core values, positive track record, and use of symbols possess, whether consciously or not, an inherent advantage in an increasingly competitive landscape'.<ref name=\"Curran 1234\u20131257\"/>  In the context of tourism preconceived notions of brand heritage stimulate the increased experience of existential authenticity, increasing satisfaction with the visitor experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Farrington|first2=Thomas|last3=Curran|first3=Ross|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2017-04-11|title=Sustainability and the authentic experience.
