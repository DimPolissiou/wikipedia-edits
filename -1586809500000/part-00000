Their first single was called \"[[One Step Closer (S Club Juniors song)|One Step Closer]]\". The single was promoted by the television series ''S Club Junior: The Story'' and was released in the UK on 22 April 2002 in a chart battle with the [[Sugababes]] who released their comeback single the same day.<ref name=\"t40\">[http://top40-charts.com/song.php?sid=3861 \"S Club Juniors \u2013 One Step Closer: Charts\"].

Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart.

Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

''[[Wordshaker]]'' (2009) was the band's follow-up studio album and also charted within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and went on to gain a Silver selling status, with singles \"[[Forever Is Over]]\" and \"[[Ego (The Saturdays song)|Ego]]\" charting within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. ''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart. The Saturdays third studio album, ''[[On Your Radar]]'' (2011) contained three highly successful selling singles and two of which\u2014\"[[Notorious (The Saturdays song)|Notorious]]\" and \"[[All Fired Up (The Saturdays song)|All Fired Up]]\" charted within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. \"[[My Heart Takes Over]]\" was also released from ''On Your Radar''.\n\nThe band released another extended play, ''[[Chasing The Saturdays (EP)|Chasing The Saturdays]]'' which was only released in North America.

Its Cleveland FM sister [[WMJI]] also uses the \"Majic\" branding for its 1960s/70s oldies station.  WYNT was also formerly an oldies station under the same branding.\n\nThe station had for years, served as a full-service adult contemporary/country music station serving Upper Sandusky, the seat of Wyandot County, as well as the communities surrounding Upper Sandusky, which is not to be confused with the town of Sandusky, Ohio...about 50 miles due north in Erie County, best known as the home of [[Cedar Point]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to the 1981 Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook, WYNT first went on the air on December 11, 1973 with the original call letters WYAN, licensed to Upper Sandusky.\n\nThe station was founded by Wendell A. Triplett, president of Triplett Broadcasting of [[Bellefontaine, Ohio]]; which also owned the former WTOO (now [[WBLL]]) in Bellefontaine, founded the former WPNM (currently [[WBUK]]) in Ottawa and the former WAXT (later WHTI, now [[WBKQ]]) in Alexandria, Indiana.  Triplett's brother and company vice president Robert S. Triplett served as the station's first general manager.  T.P. Communications, a company headed by Charles Earl, then acquired WYAN in October 1979.  Forest Whitehead, who would become a driving force in the station's future rescue from financial turmoil, became the station's general manager in 1980.\n\nBy 1981 the company had run into financial trouble and WYNT was silenced.  However, the license was already in the planning stages of a return to the air by the end of 1982.\n\n[[Image:WXML-WYNT.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The original studio-office building and transmitter tower of WYAN, today used by [[WXML]], a non-profit Christian radio station, on the outskirts of Upper Sandusky.

WYAN would return to the air as WYNT at a site about a mile west of this site later.]]\n\nDetermined to keep the radio station in local hands, then-general manager and morning DJ Forest Whitehead and a local funeral director formed an ownership group, which subsequently returned the station to the air under the name U.S. Broadcasting in 1986.  The funeral director stated he would invest in the station on the condition that it would provide the community with local high school sports game broadcasts, especially football.\n\nAccording to [http://www.radio-locator.com the Radio Locator website], a construction permit has been granted to move the transmitter and city of license from Upper Sandusky to Caledonia located northeast of [[Marion, Ohio]].  Concurrent with the move, the station moved from an [[oldies]] to a [[Soft AC]] format, which has since been switched to Hot AC.  Most of the station's programming comes from Clear Channel's [[List of programming syndicated by Clear Channel#Premium Choice|Premium Choice]] Hot AC format, except for the locally originating morning show.  Clear Channel ran a similar format previously on 94.3 WDIF (now the home of [[WMRN-FM]] after [[WZCB|the original WMRN-FM]] was moved into the Columbus market).\n\nAs of November 20, 2006, this station was advertised for sale, along with other Clear Channel-owned radio stations operating out of Marion, Ohio.

It is commonly used by video cameras, video monitors, video recording devices (including general purpose computers), and in video processors that perform functions such as image resizing, image rotation, deinterlacing, and text and graphics overlay. It is conveyed over various types of baseband digital video interfaces, such as [[HDMI]], [[DVI]], [[DisplayPort]] and [[Serial digital interface|SDI]]. Standards also exist for carriage of uncompressed video over [[computer network]]s.\n\nSome [[HD video]] cameras output uncompressed video, whereas others compress the video using a lossy compression method such as [[MPEG]] or [[H.264]]. In any lossy compression process, some of the video information is removed, which creates [[compression artifact]]s and reduces the quality of the resulting decompressed video. When editing video, it is preferred to work with video that has never been compressed (or was losslessly compressed) as this maintains the best possible quality, with compression performed after completion of editing.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd743961(v=vs.85).aspx Using Uncompressed Audio and Video Streams] Microsoft</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nA standalone video recorder is a device that receives uncompressed video and stores it in either uncompressed or compressed form. These devices typically have a video output which can be used to monitor or playback recorded video.

Such devices may also have a communication interface, such as Ethernet or USB, which can used to exchange video files with an external computer, and in some cases control the recorder from an external computer as well.\n\nRecording to a computer is a relatively inexpensive alternative to implementing a digital video recorder, but the computer and its video storage device (e.g., [[solid-state drive]], [[RAID]]) must be fast enough to keep up with the high video data rate, which in some cases may be [[HD video]] or multiple video sources, or both.

On the strength of an amazing precocity for music, he was admitted to the Li\u00e8ge Conservatoire at the extraordinarily young age of seven, and spent the next sixteen years there. Jongen won a First Prize for Fugue in 1895, an honors diploma in piano the next year, and another for organ in 1896. In 1897, he won the Belgian [[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Prix de Rome]], which allowed him to travel to Italy, Germany and France.\n\nHe began composing at the age of 13, and immediately exhibited exceptional talent in that field too. By the time he published his Opus 1, he already had dozens of works to his credit. His monumental and massive First String Quartet was composed in 1894 and was submitted for the annual competition for fine arts held by the Royal Academy of Belgium, where it was awarded the top prize by the jury.\n\nIn 1902, he returned to his native land, and in the following year he was named a professor of [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] at his old Li\u00e8ge college. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], he and his family moved to England, where he founded a piano quartet. When peace returned, he came back to Belgium and was named professor of [[fugue]] at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. From 1925 until 1939, he served as director of that institution; he was succeeded by his brother [[L\u00e9on Jongen]]. Fourteen years after leaving the directorship, Joseph Jongen died at [[Sart-lez-Spa]], Belgium.\n\n==Compositions==\nFrom his teens to his seventies Jongen composed a great deal, including [[symphony|symphonies]], [[concerto]]s (for cello, for piano and for harp), [[chamber music]] (notably a late [[string trio]] and three [[string quartet]]s), and songs, some with piano, others with orchestra. (His list of opus numbers eventually reached 241, but he destroyed many pieces.) Today, the only part of his ''oeuvre'' performed with any regularity is his output for organ, much of it solo, some of it in combination with other instruments.\n\nHis monumental ''Symphonie Concertante'' of 1926 is a ''tour de force'', considered by many to be among the greatest works ever written for organ and orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laphil.com/music/piece_detail.cfm?id=1466|title=Symphonie concertante|website=www.laphil.com}}</ref> Numerous eminent organists of modern times (such as [[Virgil Fox]], [[Alexander Frey]], [[Jean Guillou]], [[Michael Murray (organist)|Michael Murray]] and [[Olivier Latry]]) have championed and recorded it.
