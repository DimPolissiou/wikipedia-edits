It is mainly caused by [[Plasticity (physics)|non-elastic]] effects; that is, not all the energy needed for deformation (or movement) of the wheel, roadbed, etc., is recovered when the pressure is removed. Two forms of this are [[hysteresis]] losses (see [[rolling resistance#Primary cause|below]]), and permanent [[plastic deformation|(plastic) deformation]] of the object or the surface (e.g. soil). Another cause of rolling resistance lies in the [[frictional contact mechanics|slippage]] between the wheel and the surface, which dissipates energy. Note that only the last of these effects involves [[friction]], therefore the name \"rolling friction\" is to an extent a misnomer.\n\nIn analogy with [[sliding friction]], rolling resistance is often expressed as a coefficient times the normal force. This coefficient of rolling resistance is generally much smaller than the coefficient of sliding friction.<ref name=\"Peck\">{{cite book\n| last = Peck\n| first = William Guy\n| year = 1859\n| url = https://archive.org/details/elementsmechani02peckgoog\n| quote = rolling friction less than sliding friction.\n| title = Elements of Mechanics: For the Use of Colleges, Academies, and High Schools\n| publisher = A.S.

The losses due to [[hysteresis]] also depend strongly on the material properties of the wheel or tire and the surface.

Also, [[sand]] on the ground will give more rolling resistance than [[concrete]].

The rubber compound in a tire exhibits hysteresis. As the tire rotates under the weight of the vehicle, it experiences repeated cycles of deformation and recovery, and it dissipates the hysteresis energy loss as heat. Hysteresis is the main cause of energy loss associated with rolling resistance and is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the rubber.\n:\u2014 National Academy of Sciences<ref name = \"NAS286\">{{cite web\n| url = http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr286.pdf\n| title = Tires and Passenger Vehicle Fuel Economy: Informing Consumers, Improving Performance -- Special Report 286. National Academy of Sciences, Transportation Research Board, 2006\n| accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis main principle is illustrated in the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.\n\nThe resulting pressure distribution is asymmetrical and is shifted to the right. The [[line of action]] of the (aggregate) [[Force#Normal force|vertical force]] no longer passes through the centers of the cylinders. This means that a [[moment (physics)|moment]] occurs that tends to retard the rolling motion.\n\nMaterials that have a large hysteresis effect, such as rubber, which bounce back slowly, exhibit more rolling resistance than materials with a small hysteresis effect that bounce back more quickly and more completely, such as steel or silica. [[Low rolling resistance tires]] typically incorporate silica in place of carbon black in their tread compounds to reduce low-frequency hysteresis without compromising traction.<ref>[http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres Tyres-Online: The Benefits of Silica in Tyre Design<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204065301/http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres |date=2013-02-04 }}</ref> Note that railroads also have hysteresis in the roadbed structure.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p.85</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the broad sense, specific \"rolling resistance\" (for vehicles) is the force per unit vehicle weight required to move the vehicle on level ground at a constant slow speed where aerodynamic drag (air resistance) is insignificant and also where there are no traction (motor) forces or brakes applied. In other words, the vehicle would be coasting if it were not for the force to maintain constant speed.<ref>An example of such usage for railroads is [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf here].</ref> This broad sense includes wheel bearing resistance, the energy dissipated by vibration and oscillation of both the roadbed and the vehicle, and sliding of the wheel on the roadbed surface (pavement or a rail).\n\nBut there is an even broader sense that would include energy wasted by wheel slippage due to the [[#Depends on applied torque|torque applied from the engine]]. This includes the increased power required due to the increased velocity of the wheels where the tangential velocity of the driving wheel(s) becomes greater than the vehicle speed due to slippage. Since [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power is equal to force times velocity]] and the wheel velocity has increased, the power required has increased accordingly.\n\nThe pure \"rolling resistance\" for a train is that which happens due to deformation and possible minor sliding at the wheel-road contact.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p. 79. Hay, p. 68</ref> For a rubber tire, an analogous energy loss happens over the entire tire, but it is still called \"rolling resistance\". In the broad sense, \"rolling resistance\" includes wheel bearing resistance, energy loss by shaking both the roadbed (and the earth underneath) and the vehicle itself, and by sliding of the wheel, road/rail contact. Railroad textbooks seem to cover all these resistance forces but do not call their sum \"rolling resistance\" (broad sense) as is done in this article. They just sum up all the resistance forces (including aerodynamic drag) and call the sum basic train resistance (or the like).<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Chapt. IV, p. 73+; \u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, Sect. 5.2 p. 78+; Hay, Chapt. 6 \"Train Resistance\" p. 67+</ref>\n\nSince railroad rolling resistance in the broad sense may be a few times larger than just the pure rolling resistance<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig. 4.14, p. 107</ref> reported values may be in serious conflict since they may be based on different definitions of \"rolling resistance\". The train's engines must, of course, provide the energy to overcome this broad-sense rolling resistance.\n\nFor tires, rolling resistance is defined as the energy consumed by a tire per unit distance covered. It is also called rolling friction or rolling drag. It is one of the forces that act to oppose the motion of a driver. The main reason for this is that when the tires are in motion and touch the surface, the surface changes shape and causes deformation of the tire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|title=Rolling Resistance and Fuel Saving|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408115014/http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-08}}</ref>\n\nFor highway motor vehicles, there is obviously some energy dissipated in shaking the roadway (and the earth beneath it), the shaking of the vehicle itself, and the sliding of the tires. But, other than the [[#Depends on applied torque|additional power required due to torque]] and wheel bearing friction, non-pure rolling resistance doesn't seem to have been investigated, possibly because the \"pure\" rolling resistance of a rubber tire is several times higher than the neglected resistances.<ref>If one were to assume that the resistance coefficients (Crr) for motor vehicles were the same as for trains, then for trains the neglected resistances taken together have a Crr of about 0.0004 (see \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig. 4.14, p.107 at 20km/hr and assume a total Crr =0.0010 based on Fig. 3.8, p.50 (plain bearings) and adjust for roller bearings based on a delta Crr of 0.00035 as read from Figs. 4.2 and 4.4 on pp. 74, 76). Compare this Crr of 0.0004 to motor vehicle tire Crr's of at least 10 times higher per \"Rolling resistance coefficient examples\" in this article</ref>\n\n==Rolling resistance coefficient==\nThe \"rolling resistance coefficient\" is defined by the following equation:<ref name = \"NAS286\" />\n:<math>\\ F = C_{rr} N </math>\n:where\n:: <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force (shown as <math>R</math> in figure 1),\n:: <math>C_{rr}</math> is the dimensionless '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' ('''CRF'''), and\n:: <math>N</math> is the [[normal force]], the force perpendicular to the surface on which the wheel is rolling.\n\n<math>C_{rr}</math> is the force needed to push (or tow) a wheeled vehicle forward (at constant speed on a level surface, or zero grade, with zero air resistance) per unit force of weight. It is assumed that all wheels are the same and bear identical weight. Thus: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.01 </math> means that it would only take 0.01 pounds to tow a vehicle weighing one pound. For a 1000-pound vehicle, it would take 1000 times more tow force, i.e. 10 pounds. One could say that <math>C_{rr}</math> is in lb(tow-force)/lb(vehicle weight). Since this lb/lb is force divided by force, <math>C_{rr}</math> is dimensionless. Multiply it by 100 and you get the percent (%) of the weight of the vehicle required to maintain slow steady speed. <math>C_{rr}</math> is often multiplied by 1000 to get the parts per thousand, which is the same as kilograms (kg force) per metric ton (tonne = 1000&nbsp;kg ),<ref>kgf/tonne is used by \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 throughout his book</ref> which is the same as pounds of resistance per 1000 pounds\nof load or Newtons/kilo-Newton, etc. For the US railroads, lb/ton has been traditionally used; this is just <math>2000 C_{rr}</math>. Thus, they are all just measures of resistance per unit vehicle weight. While they are all \"specific resistances\", sometimes they are just called \"resistance\" although they are really a coefficient (ratio)or a multiple thereof. If using pounds or kilograms as force units, mass is equal to weight (in earth's gravity a kilogram a mass weighs a kilogram and exerts a kilogram of force) so one could claim that <math>C_{rr}</math> is also the force per unit mass in such units. The SI system would use N/tonne (N/T, N/t), which is <math>1000 g C_{rr}</math> and is force per unit mass, where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity in SI units (meters per second square).<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432 uses N/T notation. See pp. 78-84.</ref>\n\nThe above shows resistance proportional to <math> C_{rr}</math> but does not explicitly show any variation with speed, [[#Dependence on wheel load|loads]], [[#Dependence on applied torque|torque]], surface roughness, [[#Dependence on diameter|diameter]], tire inflation/wear, etc. because <math>C_{rr}</math> itself varies with those factors. It might seem from the above definition of <math> C_{rr}</math> that the rolling resistance is directly proportional to vehicle weight but [[#Dependence on wheel load|it is not]].\n\n== Measurement ==\nThere are at least two popular models for calculating rolling resistance.\n\n#\"Rolling resistance coefficient (RRC). The value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests ([[SAE J1269]] and [[SAE J2452]]) are usually performed{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} on new tires. When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.\"<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/AFM_tire_crr.htm|title=Roller Data|last=Willett|first=Kraig|website=www.biketechreview.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref> These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with [[coast-down test]]s. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.\n#The coefficient of rolling resistance ''b'', which has the dimension of [[length]], is approximately (due to the [[small-angle approximation]] of <math>\\cos(\\theta) = 1</math>) equal to the value of the rolling resistance force times the [[radius]] of the wheel divided by the wheel load.<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />\n# [[ISO 18164:2005]] is used to test rolling resistance in Europe.\n\nThe results of these tests can be hard for the general public to obtain as manufacturers prefer to publicize \"comfort\" and \"performance\".\n\n==Physical formulae==\nThe coefficient of rolling resistance for a slow rigid wheel on a perfectly elastic surface, not adjusted for velocity, can be calculated by {{cn|date=September 2018}}\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = \\sqrt {z/d} </math>\n:where\n:: <math>z</math> is the sinkage depth\n:: <math>d</math> is the diameter of the rigid wheel \n\nEmpirical formula for <math>\\ C_{rr} </math> for cast iron mine car wheels on steel rails.<ref>Hersey, equation (2), p. 83</ref>\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.0048 (18/D)^{\\frac{1}{2}}(100/W)^{\\frac{1}{4}} </math>\n:where\n::<math>D</math> is the wheel diameter in in.\n::<math>W</math> is the load on the wheel in lbs.\n\nAs an alternative to using [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|<math>\\ C_{rr}</math>]] one can use <math>\\ b</math>, which is a different '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length. It is defined by the following formula:<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />\n:<math>\\ F = \\frac{N b}{r} </math>\n:where\n:: <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force (shown in figure 1),\n:: <math>r</math> is the wheel radius,\n:: <math>b</math> is the '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length, and\n:: <math>N</math> is the normal force (equal to ''W'', not ''R'', as shown in figure 1).\n\nThe above equation, where resistance is inversely proportional to radius r. seems to be based on the discredited \"Coulomb's law\" (Neither Coulomb's inverse square law nor Coulomb's law of friction) (needs citation). See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]]. Equating this equation with the force per the [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|rolling resistance coefficient]], and solving for b, gives b = C<sub>rr</sub>\u00b7r. Therefore, if a source gives rolling resistance coefficient (C<sub>rr</sub>) as a dimensionless coefficient, it can be converted to b, having units of length, by multiplying C<sub>rr</sub> by wheel radius r.\n\n==Rolling resistance coefficient examples==\n\nTable of rolling resistance coefficient examples: [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/tire4.htm]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n|'''''C'''''<sub>''rr''</sub> ||'''''b'''''|| '''Description'''\n|-\n| 0.0003 ''to'' 0.0004<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p. 81.</ref>|| ||[[#Definitions|\"Pure rolling resistance\"]] Railroad steel wheel on steel rail\n|-\n| 0.0010 ''to'' 0.0015<ref>{{cite web|title=Coefficients of Friction in Bearing|url=http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/cof.htm|work=Coefficients of Friction|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref>\n|| 0.1&nbsp;mm<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />||Hardened steel ball bearings on steel\n|-\n| 0.0010 ''to'' 0.0024<ref>Hay, Fig. 6-2 p.72(worst case shown of 0.0036 not used since it is likely erroneous)</ref><ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55; Figs. 2.3, 2.4 pp. 35-36.

In some laboratory tests, however, such as [http://www.legslarry.beerdrinkers.co.uk/tech/GS.htm Greenspeed test results (accessdate = 2007-10-27)], smaller wheels appeared to have similar or lower losses than large wheels, but these tests were done rolling the wheels against a small-diameter drum, which would theoretically remove the advantage of large-diameter wheels, thus making the tests irrelevant for resolving this issue. Another counter example to the claim of smaller wheels having higher rolling resistance can be found in the area of [[Soap Box Derby|ultimate speed]] soap box derby racing. In this race, the speeds have increased as wheel diameters have decreased by up to 50%. This might suggest that rolling resistance may not be increasing significantly with smaller diameter within a practical range, if any other of the many variables involved have been controlled for.

Such torques results in energy dissipation (above that due to the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, non-driven, non-braked wheel). This additional loss is in part due to the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.\n\nA small percentage slip can result in a much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% slip can translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance.<ref name=Roberts-torque/> This is partly because the [[tractive force]] applied during this slip is many times greater than the rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power]] = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a small percentage increase in circumferential velocity due to slip can translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nIn order to apply any [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] to the wheels, some slippage of the wheel is required.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p.30 including eq. (2.7) and Fig. 2.3</ref> For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.\n\nSlip (also known as [[Rail adhesion#Forces on wheels|creep]]) is normally roughly directly proportional to [[Tractive force|tractive effort]]. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort and is no longer linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the wheel spins out of control and the [[Rail adhesion|adhesion]] drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye\u2014the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nRolling resistance greatly increases with applied torque. At high torques, which apply a tangential force to the road of about half the weight of the vehicle, the rolling resistance may triple (a 200% increase).<ref name=Roberts-torque>Roberts, Fig. 17: \"Effect of torque transmission on rolling resistance\", p. 71</ref> This is in part due to a slip of about 5%. The rolling resistance increase with applied torque is not linear, but increases at a faster rate as the torque becomes higher.\n\n==Dependence on wheel load==\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nThe rolling resistance coefficient, Crr, significantly decreases as the weight of the rail car per wheel increases.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55. Hay, Fig. 60-2, p. 72 shows the same phenomena but has higher values for Crr and not reported here since the railroads in 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf].\n were claiming about the same value as \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432</ref> For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001). This same \"economy of scale\" shows up in testing of mine rail cars.<ref>Hersey, Table 6., p. 267</ref> The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.<ref name=Williams />\n\nIf Crr is itself dependent on wheel load per an inverse square-root rule, then for an increase in load of 2% only a 1% increase in rolling resistance occurs.<ref>Per this assumption, <math>F=k N^{0.5}</math> where <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force and <math>N</math> is the normal load force on the wheel due to vehicle weight, and <math>k</math> is a constant. It can be readily shown by differentiation of <math>F</math> with respect to <math>N</math> using [[Differentiation rules#The polynomial or elementary power rule|this rule]] that <math>{\\operatorname{d}N\\over N}=2{\\operatorname{d}F\\over F}</math></ref>\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nFor pneumatic tires, the direction of change in Crr (rolling resistance coefficient) depends on whether or not tire inflation is increased with increasing load.<ref>Roberts, pp. 60-61.</ref> It is reported that, if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) \"schedule\", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But, if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course, this will increase the rolling resistance by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in rolling resistance.\n\n==Dependence on curvature of roadway==\n\n===General===\nWhen a vehicle ([[motor vehicle]] or railroad [[train]]) goes around a curve, rolling resistance usually increases. If the curve is not [[Banked curve#Frictionless banked curve|banked]] so as to exactly counter the [[centrifugal force]] with an equal and opposing [[centripetal force]] due to the banking, then there will be a net unbalanced sideways force on the vehicle.\nThis will result in increased rolling resistance. [[Banked curve|Banking]] is also known as [[Cant (road/rail)|\"superelevation\" or \"cant\"]] (not to be confused with [[Cant (road/rail)#Rail|rail cant]] of a [[Track (rail transport)#Rail|rail]]). For railroads, this is called [[curve resistance]] but for [[road]]s it has (at least once) been called rolling resistance due to [[Cornering force|cornering]].\n\n==Sound effects==\nRolling friction generates sound (vibrational) energy, as mechanical energy is converted to this form of energy due to the friction. One of the most common examples of rolling friction is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[roadway]], a process which generates [[roadway noise|sound]] as a by-product.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00159677] C. Michael Hogan, ''Analysis of Highway Noise'', Journal of Soil, Air and Water Pollution, Springer Verlag Publishers, Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 3 / September, 1973</ref> The sound generated by automobile and truck tires as they roll (especially noticeable at highway speeds) is mostly due to the percussion of the tire treads, and compression (and subsequent decompression) of air temporarily captured within the treads.<ref>Gwidon W. Stachowiak, Andrew William Batchelor, ''Engineering Tribology'', Elsevier Publisher, 750 pages (2000) {{ISBN|0-7506-7304-4}}</ref>\n\n==Factors that contribute in tires==\nSeveral factors affect the magnitude of rolling resistance a tire generates:\n* As mentioned in the introduction: wheel radius, forward speed, surface adhesion, and relative micro-sliding.\n* Material - different fillers and polymers in tire composition can improve traction while reducing hysteresis. The replacement of some carbon black with higher-priced silica\u2013silane is one common way of reducing rolling resistance.<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> The use of exotic materials including nano-clay has been shown to reduce rolling resistance in high performance rubber tires.<ref>http://144.206.159.178/ft/200/607426/12614863.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Solvents may also be used to swell solid tires, decreasing the rolling resistance.<ref>http://www.rubberchemtechnol.org/resource/1/rctea4/v3/i1/p19_s1?isAuthorized=no{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Dimensions - rolling resistance in tires is related to the flex of sidewalls and the contact area of the tire<ref name = \"schwalbe\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.schwalbetires.com/tech_info/rolling_resistance\n| title = Schwalbe Tires: Rolling Resistance}}</ref> For example, at the same pressure, wider [[bicycle tire]]s flex less in the sidewalls as they roll and thus have lower rolling resistance (although higher air resistance).<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/>  \n* Extent of inflation - Lower pressure in tires results in more flexing of the sidewalls and higher rolling resistance.<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> This energy conversion in the sidewalls increases resistance and can also lead to overheating and may have played a part in the infamous [[Ford Explorer]] [[Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy|rollover accidents]].\n* Over inflating tires (such a bicycle tires) may not lower the overall rolling resistance as the tire may skip and hop over the road surface. Traction is sacrificed, and overall rolling friction may not be reduced as the wheel rotational speed changes and slippage increases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n* Sidewall deflection is not a direct measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a \"fuel saving\" casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a \"fuel saving\" tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.\n* In tires, [[Tire tread|tread]] thickness and shape has much to do with rolling resistance. The thicker and more contoured the tread, the higher the rolling resistance<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> Thus, the \"fastest\" bicycle tires have very little tread and heavy duty trucks get the best fuel economy as the tire tread wears out.\n* Diameter effects seem to be negligible, provided the pavement is hard and the range of diameters is limited. See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]].\n* Virtually all world speed records have been set on relatively narrow wheels,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} probably because of their aerodynamic advantage at high speed, which is much less important at normal speeds.\n* Temperature: with both solid and pneumatic tires, rolling resistance has been found to decrease as temperature increases (within a range of temperatures: i.e. there is an upper limit to this effect)<ref>[http://www.recumbents.com/mars/pages/proj/tetz/other/Crr.html The Recumbent Bicycle and Human Powered Vehicle Information Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>U.S National Bureau of Standards p.? and Williams p.?</ref> For a rise in temperature from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 70&nbsp;\u00b0C the rolling resistance decreased by 20-25%.<ref>Roberts, \"Effect of temperature\", p.59</ref> It is claimed that racers heat their tire before racing.\n\n==Railroads: Components of rolling resistance==\nIn a broad sense rolling resistance can be defined as the sum of components<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p. 74, Although \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 list these components, he doesn't give the sum a name.</ref>): \n# Wheel bearing torque losses. \n# Pure rolling resistance.\n# Sliding of the wheel on the rail.\n# Loss of energy to the roadbed (and earth). \n# Loss of energy to oscillation of railway rolling stock.\n\nWheel bearing torque losses can be measured as a rolling resistance at the wheel rim, [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|Crr]].

Section 14: \"Axle journals and bearings\". Almost all of the ads in this section are for the tapered type of bearing.</ref> The specific rolling resistance in Russian bearings varies with both wheel loading and speed.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig 4.2, p. 76</ref> Wheel bearing rolling resistance is lowest with high axle loads and intermediate speeds of 60\u201380&nbsp;km/h with a Crr of 0.00013 (axle load of 21 tonnes). For empty freight cars with axle loads of 5.5 tonnes, Crr goes up to 0.00020 at 60&nbsp;km/h but at a low speed of 20&nbsp;km/h it increases to 0.00024 and at a high speed (for freight trains) of 120&nbsp;km/h it is 0.00028. The Crr obtained above is added to the Crr of the other components to obtain the total Crr for the wheels.\n\n==Comparing rolling resistance of highway vehicles and trains==\nThe rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail of a train is far less than that of the rubber tires wheels of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.\n\nAs an example of a very heavy passenger train, in 1975, Amtrak passenger trains weighed a little over 7 tonnes per passenger,<ref name=rr_stat>Statistics of railroads of class I in the United States, Years 1965 to 1975: Statistical summary. Washington DC, Association of American Railroads, Economics and Finance Dept. See table for Amtrak, p.16. To get the tons per passenger divide ton-miles (including locomotives) by passenger-miles. To get tons-gross/tons-net, divide gross ton-mi (including locomotives) (in the \"operating statistics\" table by the revenue ton-miles (from the \"Freight traffic\" table)</ref> which is much heavier than an average of a little over one ton per passenger for an automobile. This means that for an Amtrak passenger train in 1975, much of the energy savings of the lower rolling resistance was lost to its greater weight.\n\nAn example of a very light high-speed passenger train is the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], which weighs 715 tonnes and carries 1323 passengers, resulting in a per-passenger weight of about half a tonne. This lighter weight per passenger, combined with the lower rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail means that an N700 Shinkansen is much more energy efficient than a typical automobile.\n\nIn the case of freight, CSX ran an advertisement campaign in 2013 claiming that their freight trains move \"a ton of freight 436 miles on a gallon of fuel\", whereas some sources claim trucks move a ton of freight about 130 miles per gallon of fuel, indicating trains are more efficient overall.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coefficient of friction]]\n* [[Low-rolling resistance tires]]\n* [[Maglev (transport)|Maglev]] ([[Magnetic]] [[Levitation]], the elimination of rolling and thus rolling resistance)\n* [[Rolling element bearing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n*\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 \u041f.\u041d. {{in lang|ru}} \"\u0421\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\" (Resistance to motion of railway rolling stock) \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0426\u041d\u0418\u0418 \u041c\u041f\u0421 (ISSN 0372-3305). \u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a 311 (Vol. 311). - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, 1966. \u2013 178 pp. [http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b12003170~S1 perm. record at UC Berkeley] (In 2012, full text was on the Internet but the U.S. was blocked)\n*\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432 \u0412.\u0412., \u0418\u043b\u044c\u0438\u043d \u0413.\u0410., \u0410\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0413.\u0421. {{in lang|ru}} \"\u0422\u044f\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0432\" (Traction of trains) \u0423\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435. - \u041c.: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, 1987. - 264 pp.\n*Hay, William W. \"Railroad Engineering\" New York, Wiley 1953\n*[[Mayo D.

It is mainly caused by [[Plasticity (physics)|non-elastic]] effects; that is, not all the energy needed for deformation (or movement) of the wheel, roadbed, etc. Is recovered when the pressure is removed. Two forms of this are [[hysteresis]] losses (see [[rolling resistance#Primary cause|below]]), and permanent [[plastic deformation|(plastic) deformation]] of the object or the surface (e.g. soil). Another cause of rolling resistance lies in the [[frictional contact mechanics|slippage]] between the wheel and the surface, which dissipates energy. Note that only the last of these effects involves [[friction]], therefore the name \"rolling friction\" is to an extent a misnomer.\n\nIn analogy with [[sliding friction]], rolling resistance is often expressed as a coefficient times the normal force. This coefficient of rolling resistance is generally much smaller than the coefficient of sliding friction.<ref name=\"Peck\">{{cite book\n| last = Peck\n| first = William Guy\n| year = 1859\n| url = https://archive.org/details/elementsmechani02peckgoog\n| quote = rolling friction less than sliding friction.\n| title = Elements of Mechanics: For the Use of Colleges, Academies, and High Schools\n| publisher = A.S.

Additional contributing factors include [[#Dependence on diameter|wheel diameter]],<ref name = \"Hibbeler\">{{cite book\n| title = Engineering Mechanics: Statics & Dynamics\n| edition = Eleventh\n| last = Hibbeler\n| first = R.C.\n| year = 2007\n| pages = 441\u2013442\n| publisher = Pearson, Prentice Hall\n}}</ref> [[#Dependence on wheel load|load on wheel]], surface adhesion, sliding, and relative micro-sliding between the surfaces of contact. The losses due to [[hysteresis]] also depend strongly on the material properties of the wheel or tire and the surface. For example, a [[tire|rubber tire]] will have higher rolling resistance on a paved road than a [[steel]] [[Wheelset (rail transport)|railroad wheel]] on a steel rail. Also, [[sand]] on the ground will give more rolling resistance than [[concrete]]. Sole rolling resistance factor is not dependent on speed.\n\n==Primary cause==\n[[File:Pressure distribution for viscoelastic rolling cylinders.png|thumb|Asymmetrical pressure distribution between rolling cylinders due to viscoelastic material behavior (rolling to the right).<ref name = \"CONTACT\">{{cite web | url = http://www.kalkersoftware.org/downloads/user-guide.pdf\n| title = User guide for CONTACT, Rolling and sliding contact with friction.

The rubber compound in a tire exhibits hysteresis. As the tire rotates under the weight of the vehicle, it experiences repeated cycles of deformation and recovery, and it dissipates the hysteresis energy loss as heat. Hysteresis is the main cause of energy loss associated with rolling resistance and is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the rubber.\n:\u2014 National Academy of Sciences<ref name = \"NAS286\">{{cite web\n| url = http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr286.pdf\n| title = Tires and Passenger Vehicle Fuel Economy: Informing Consumers, Improving Performance -- Special Report 286. National Academy of Sciences, Transportation Research Board, 2006\n| accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis main principle is illustrated in the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.\n\nThe resulting pressure distribution is asymmetrical and is shifted to the right. The [[line of action]] of the (aggregate) [[Force#Normal force|vertical force]] no longer passes through the centers of the cylinders. This means that a [[moment (physics)|moment]] occurs that tends to retard the rolling motion.\n\nMaterials that have a large hysteresis effect, such as rubber, which bounce back slowly, exhibit more rolling resistance than materials with a small hysteresis effect that bounce back more quickly and more completely, such as steel or silica. [[Low rolling resistance tires]] typically incorporate silica in place of carbon black in their tread compounds to reduce low-frequency hysteresis without compromising traction.<ref>[http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres Tyres-Online: The Benefits of Silica in Tyre Design<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204065301/http://www.tyrepriceadvisor.co.uk/en/top-tyre-brands/falken-tyres |date=2013-02-04 }}</ref> Note that railroads also have hysteresis in the roadbed structure.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p.85</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the broad sense, specific \"rolling resistance\" (for vehicles) is the force per unit vehicle weight required to move the vehicle on level ground at a constant slow speed where aerodynamic drag (air resistance) is insignificant and also where there are no traction (motor) forces or brakes applied. In other words, the vehicle would be coasting if it were not for the force to maintain constant speed.<ref>An example of such usage for railroads is [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf here].</ref> This broad sense includes wheel bearing resistance, the energy dissipated by vibration and oscillation of both the roadbed and the vehicle, and sliding of the wheel on the roadbed surface (pavement or a rail).\n\nBut there is an even broader sense that would include energy wasted by wheel slippage due to the [[#Depends on applied torque|torque applied from the engine]]. This includes the increased power required due to the increased velocity of the wheels where the tangential velocity of the driving wheel(s) becomes greater than the vehicle speed due to slippage. Since [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power is equal to force times velocity]] and the wheel velocity has increased, the power required has increased accordingly.\n\nThe pure \"rolling resistance\" for a train is that which happens due to deformation and possible minor sliding at the wheel-road contact.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p. 79. Hay, p. 68</ref> For a rubber tire, an analogous energy loss happens over the entire tire, but it is still called \"rolling resistance\". In the broad sense, \"rolling resistance\" includes wheel bearing resistance, energy loss by shaking both the roadbed (and the earth underneath) and the vehicle itself, and by sliding of the wheel, road/rail contact. Railroad textbooks seem to cover all these resistance forces but do not call their sum \"rolling resistance\" (broad sense) as is done in this article. They just sum up all the resistance forces (including aerodynamic drag) and call the sum basic train resistance (or the like).<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Chapt. IV, p. 73+; \u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, Sect. 5.2 p. 78+; Hay, Chapt. 6 \"Train Resistance\" p. 67+</ref>\n\nSince railroad rolling resistance in the broad sense may be a few times larger than just the pure rolling resistance<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig. 4.14, p. 107</ref> reported values may be in serious conflict since they may be based on different definitions of \"rolling resistance\". The train's engines must, of course, provide the energy to overcome this broad-sense rolling resistance.\n\nFor tires, rolling resistance is defined as the energy consumed by a tire per unit distance covered. It is also called rolling friction or rolling drag. It is one of the forces that act to oppose the motion of a driver. The main reason for this is that when the tires are in motion and touch the surface, the surface changes shape and causes deformation of the tire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|title=Rolling Resistance and Fuel Saving|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408115014/http://indiatransportportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/india-rolling-resistance-itp-feb-2016.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-08}}</ref>\n\nFor highway motor vehicles, there is obviously some energy dissipated in shaking the roadway (and the earth beneath it), the shaking of the vehicle itself, and the sliding of the tires. But, other than the [[#Depends on applied torque|additional power required due to torque]] and wheel bearing friction, non-pure rolling resistance doesn't seem to have been investigated, possibly because the \"pure\" rolling resistance of a rubber tire is several times higher than the neglected resistances.<ref>If one were to assume that the resistance coefficients (Crr) for motor vehicles were the same as for trains, then for trains the neglected resistances taken together have a Crr of about 0.0004 (see \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig. 4.14, p.107 at 20km/hr and assume a total Crr =0.0010 based on Fig. 3.8, p.50 (plain bearings) and adjust for roller bearings based on a delta Crr of 0.00035 as read from Figs. 4.2 and 4.4 on pp. 74, 76). Compare this Crr of 0.0004 to motor vehicle tire Crr's of at least 10 times higher per \"Rolling resistance coefficient examples\" in this article</ref>\n\n==Rolling resistance coefficient==\nThe \"rolling resistance coefficient\" is defined by the following equation:<ref name = \"NAS286\" />\n:<math>\\ F = C_{rr} N </math>\n:where\n:: <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force (shown as <math>R</math> in figure 1),\n:: <math>C_{rr}</math> is the dimensionless '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' ('''CRF'''), and\n:: <math>N</math> is the [[normal force]], the force perpendicular to the surface on which the wheel is rolling.\n\n<math>C_{rr}</math> is the force needed to push (or tow) a wheeled vehicle forward (at constant speed on a level surface, or zero grade, with zero air resistance) per unit force of weight. It is assumed that all wheels are the same and bear identical weight. Thus: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.01 </math> means that it would only take 0.01 pounds to tow a vehicle weighing one pound. For a 1000-pound vehicle, it would take 1000 times more tow force, i.e. 10 pounds. One could say that <math>C_{rr}</math> is in lb(tow-force)/lb(vehicle weight). Since this lb/lb is force divided by force, <math>C_{rr}</math> is dimensionless. Multiply it by 100 and you get the percent (%) of the weight of the vehicle required to maintain slow steady speed. <math>C_{rr}</math> is often multiplied by 1000 to get the parts per thousand, which is the same as kilograms (kg force) per metric ton (tonne = 1000&nbsp;kg ),<ref>kgf/tonne is used by \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 throughout his book</ref> which is the same as pounds of resistance per 1000 pounds\nof load or Newtons/kilo-Newton, etc. For the US railroads, lb/ton has been traditionally used; this is just <math>2000 C_{rr}</math>. Thus, they are all just measures of resistance per unit vehicle weight. While they are all \"specific resistances\", sometimes they are just called \"resistance\" although they are really a coefficient (ratio)or a multiple thereof. If using pounds or kilograms as force units, mass is equal to weight (in earth's gravity a kilogram a mass weighs a kilogram and exerts a kilogram of force) so one could claim that <math>C_{rr}</math> is also the force per unit mass in such units. The SI system would use N/tonne (N/T, N/t), which is <math>1000 g C_{rr}</math> and is force per unit mass, where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity in SI units (meters per second square).<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432 uses N/T notation. See pp. 78-84.</ref>\n\nThe above shows resistance proportional to <math> C_{rr}</math> but does not explicitly show any variation with speed, [[#Dependence on wheel load|loads]], [[#Dependence on applied torque|torque]], surface roughness, [[#Dependence on diameter|diameter]], tire inflation/wear, etc. because <math>C_{rr}</math> itself varies with those factors. It might seem from the above definition of <math> C_{rr}</math> that the rolling resistance is directly proportional to vehicle weight but [[#Dependence on wheel load|it is not]].\n\n== Measurement ==\nThere are at least two popular models for calculating rolling resistance.\n\n#\"Rolling resistance coefficient (RRC). The value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests ([[SAE J1269]] and [[SAE J2452]]) are usually performed{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} on new tires. When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014.\"<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/AFM_tire_crr.htm|title=Roller Data|last=Willett|first=Kraig|website=www.biketechreview.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref> These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with [[coast-down test]]s. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.\n#The coefficient of rolling resistance ''b'', which has the dimension of [[length]], is approximately (due to the [[small-angle approximation]] of <math>\\cos(\\theta) = 1</math>) equal to the value of the rolling resistance force times the [[radius]] of the wheel divided by the wheel load.<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />\n# [[ISO 18164:2005]] is used to test rolling resistance in Europe.\n\nThe results of these tests can be hard for the general public to obtain as manufacturers prefer to publicize \"comfort\" and \"performance\".\n\n==Physical formulae==\nThe coefficient of rolling resistance for a slow rigid wheel on a perfectly elastic surface, not adjusted for velocity, can be calculated by {{cn|date=September 2018}}\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = \\sqrt {z/d} </math>\n:where\n:: <math>z</math> is the sinkage depth\n:: <math>d</math> is the diameter of the rigid wheel \n\nEmpirical formula for <math>\\ C_{rr} </math> for cast iron mine car wheels on steel rails.<ref>Hersey, equation (2), p. 83</ref>\n: <math>\\ C_{rr} = 0.0048 (18/D)^{\\frac{1}{2}}(100/W)^{\\frac{1}{4}} </math>\n:where\n::<math>D</math> is the wheel diameter in in.\n::<math>W</math> is the load on the wheel in lbs.\n\nAs an alternative to using [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|<math>\\ C_{rr}</math>]] one can use <math>\\ b</math>, which is a different '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length. It is defined by the following formula:<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />\n:<math>\\ F = \\frac{N b}{r} </math>\n:where\n:: <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force (shown in figure 1),\n:: <math>r</math> is the wheel radius,\n:: <math>b</math> is the '''rolling resistance coefficient''' or '''coefficient of rolling friction''' with dimension of length, and\n:: <math>N</math> is the normal force (equal to ''W'', not ''R'', as shown in figure 1).\n\nThe above equation, where resistance is inversely proportional to radius r. seems to be based on the discredited \"Coulomb's law\" (Neither Coulomb's inverse square law nor Coulomb's law of friction) (needs citation). See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]]. Equating this equation with the force per the [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|rolling resistance coefficient]], and solving for b, gives b = C<sub>rr</sub>\u00b7r. Therefore, if a source gives rolling resistance coefficient (C<sub>rr</sub>) as a dimensionless coefficient, it can be converted to b, having units of length, by multiplying C<sub>rr</sub> by wheel radius r.\n\n==Rolling resistance coefficient examples==\n\nTable of rolling resistance coefficient examples: [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/tire4.htm]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n|'''''C'''''<sub>''rr''</sub> ||'''''b'''''|| '''Description'''\n|-\n| 0.0003 ''to'' 0.0004<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p. 81.</ref>|| ||[[#Definitions|\"Pure rolling resistance\"]] Railroad steel wheel on steel rail\n|-\n| 0.0010 ''to'' 0.0015<ref>{{cite web|title=Coefficients of Friction in Bearing|url=http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/cof.htm|work=Coefficients of Friction|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref>\n|| 0.1&nbsp;mm<ref name = \"Hibbeler\" />||Hardened steel ball bearings on steel\n|-\n| 0.0010 ''to'' 0.0024<ref>Hay, Fig. 6-2 p.72(worst case shown of 0.0036 not used since it is likely erroneous)</ref><ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55; Figs. 2.3, 2.4 pp. 35-36.

In some laboratory tests, however, such as [http://www.legslarry.beerdrinkers.co.uk/tech/GS.htm Greenspeed test results (accessdate = 2007-10-27)], smaller wheels appeared to have similar or lower losses than large wheels, but these tests were done rolling the wheels against a small-diameter drum, which would theoretically remove the advantage of large-diameter wheels, thus making the tests irrelevant for resolving this issue. Another counter example to the claim of smaller wheels having higher rolling resistance can be found in the area of [[Soap Box Derby|ultimate speed]] soap box derby racing. In this race, the speeds have increased as wheel diameters have decreased by up to 50%. This might suggest that rolling resistance may not be increasing significantly with smaller diameter within a practical range, if any other of the many variables involved have been controlled for. See [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}#Pneumatic tires, effect of diameter|talk page]].</ref>\n\n==Dependence on applied torque==\n\nThe driving [[torque]] <math>T</math> to overcome rolling resistance <math>R_{r}</math> and maintain steady speed on level ground (with no air resistance) can be calculated by:\n:<math> T = \\frac{V_{s}}{\\Omega} R_r </math>\n:where\n:: <math>V_s</math> is the linear speed of the body (at the axle), and\n:: <math>\\Omega</math> its rotational speed.\nIt is noteworthy that <math>V_{s}/\\Omega</math> is usually not equal to the radius of the rolling body.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.11.020|lay-url=http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/rollingresistance/|title=Three-dimensional boundary element formulation of an incompressible viscoelastic layer of finite thickness applied to the rolling resistance of a rigid sphere|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume=50|issue=6|pages=833\u2013842|year=2013|last1=Z\u00e9hil|first1=G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2=Gavin|first2=Henri P.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.11.021|title= Simple algorithms for solving steady-state frictional rolling contact problems in two and three dimensions|journal= International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume= 50|issue= 6|pages= 843\u2013852|year= 2013|last1= Z\u00e9hil|first1= G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2= Gavin|first2= Henri P.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.09.025|title=Simplified approaches to viscoelastic rolling resistance|journal=International Journal of Solids and Structures|volume=50|issue=6|pages=853\u2013862|year=2013|last1=Z\u00e9hil|first1=G\u00e9rard-Philippe|last2=Gavin|first2=Henri P.}}</ref>\n\n===All wheels===\n\"Applied torque\" may either be driving torque applied by a motor (often through a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]) or a braking torque applied by [[brake]]s (including [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]). Such torques results in energy dissipation (above that due to the basic rolling resistance of a freely rolling, non-driven, non-braked wheel). This additional loss is in part due to the fact that there is some slipping of the wheel, and for pneumatic tires, there is more flexing of the sidewalls due to the torque. Slip is defined such that a 2% slip means that the circumferential speed of the driving wheel exceeds the speed of the vehicle by 2%.\n\nA small percentage slip can result in a much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% slip can translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance.<ref name=Roberts-torque/> This is partly because the [[tractive force]] applied during this slip is many times greater than the rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall [[Power (physics)#Mechanical power|power]] = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a small percentage increase in circumferential velocity due to slip can translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nIn order to apply any [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] to the wheels, some slippage of the wheel is required.<ref>\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432, p.30 including eq. (2.7) and Fig. 2.3</ref> For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.\n\nSlip (also known as [[Rail adhesion#Forces on wheels|creep]]) is normally roughly directly proportional to [[Tractive force|tractive effort]]. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort and is no longer linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the wheel spins out of control and the [[Rail adhesion|adhesion]] drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye\u2014the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nRolling resistance greatly increases with applied torque. At high torques, which apply a tangential force to the road of about half the weight of the vehicle, the rolling resistance may triple (a 200% increase).<ref name=Roberts-torque>Roberts, Fig. 17: \"Effect of torque transmission on rolling resistance\", p. 71</ref> This is in part due to a slip of about 5%. The rolling resistance increase with applied torque is not linear, but increases at a faster rate as the torque becomes higher.\n\n==Dependence on wheel load==\n\n===Railroad steel wheels===\nThe rolling resistance coefficient, Crr, significantly decreases as the weight of the rail car per wheel increases.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, pp. 50-55. Hay, Fig. 60-2, p. 72 shows the same phenomena but has higher values for Crr and not reported here since the railroads in 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045718/http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf].\n were claiming about the same value as \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432</ref> For example, an empty Russian freight car had about twice the Crr as loaded car (Crr=0.002 vs. Crr=0.001). This same \"economy of scale\" shows up in testing of mine rail cars.<ref>Hersey, Table 6., p. 267</ref> The theoretical Crr for a rigid wheel rolling on an elastic roadbed shows Crr inversely proportional to the square root of the load.<ref name=Williams />\n\nIf Crr is itself dependent on wheel load per an inverse square-root rule, then for an increase in load of 2% only a 1% increase in rolling resistance occurs.<ref>Per this assumption, <math>F=k N^{0.5}</math> where <math>F</math> is the rolling resistance force and <math>N</math> is the normal load force on the wheel due to vehicle weight, and <math>k</math> is a constant. It can be readily shown by differentiation of <math>F</math> with respect to <math>N</math> using [[Differentiation rules#The polynomial or elementary power rule|this rule]] that <math>{\\operatorname{d}N\\over N}=2{\\operatorname{d}F\\over F}</math></ref>\n\n===Pneumatic tires===\nFor pneumatic tires, the direction of change in Crr (rolling resistance coefficient) depends on whether or not tire inflation is increased with increasing load.<ref>Roberts, pp. 60-61.</ref> It is reported that, if inflation pressure is increased with load according to an (undefined) \"schedule\", then a 20% increase in load decreases Crr by 3%. But, if the inflation pressure is not changed, then a 20% increase in load results in a 4% increase in Crr. Of course, this will increase the rolling resistance by 20% due to the increase in load plus 1.2 x 4% due to the increase in Crr resulting in a 24.8% increase in rolling resistance.\n\n==Dependence on curvature of roadway==\n\n===General===\nWhen a vehicle ([[motor vehicle]] or railroad [[train]]) goes around a curve, rolling resistance usually increases. If the curve is not [[Banked curve#Frictionless banked curve|banked]] so as to exactly counter the [[centrifugal force]] with an equal and opposing [[centripetal force]] due to the banking, then there will be a net unbalanced sideways force on the vehicle.\nThis will result in increased rolling resistance. [[Banked curve|Banking]] is also known as [[Cant (road/rail)|\"superelevation\" or \"cant\"]] (not to be confused with [[Cant (road/rail)#Rail|rail cant]] of a [[Track (rail transport)#Rail|rail]]). For railroads, this is called [[curve resistance]] but for [[road]]s it has (at least once) been called rolling resistance due to [[Cornering force|cornering]].\n\n==Sound effects==\nRolling friction generates sound (vibrational) energy, as mechanical energy is converted to this form of energy due to the friction. One of the most common examples of rolling friction is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[roadway]], a process which generates [[roadway noise|sound]] as a by-product.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00159677] C. Michael Hogan, ''Analysis of Highway Noise'', Journal of Soil, Air and Water Pollution, Springer Verlag Publishers, Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 3 / September, 1973</ref> The sound generated by automobile and truck tires as they roll (especially noticeable at highway speeds) is mostly due to the percussion of the tire treads, and compression (and subsequent decompression) of air temporarily captured within the treads.<ref>Gwidon W. Stachowiak, Andrew William Batchelor, ''Engineering Tribology'', Elsevier Publisher, 750 pages (2000) {{ISBN|0-7506-7304-4}}</ref>\n\n==Factors that contribute in tires==\nSeveral factors affect the magnitude of rolling resistance a tire generates:\n* As mentioned in the introduction: wheel radius, forward speed, surface adhesion, and relative micro-sliding.\n* Material - different fillers and polymers in tire composition can improve traction while reducing hysteresis. The replacement of some carbon black with higher-priced silica\u2013silane is one common way of reducing rolling resistance.<ref name = \"NAS286\" /> The use of exotic materials including nano-clay has been shown to reduce rolling resistance in high performance rubber tires.<ref>http://144.206.159.178/ft/200/607426/12614863.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Solvents may also be used to swell solid tires, decreasing the rolling resistance.<ref>http://www.rubberchemtechnol.org/resource/1/rctea4/v3/i1/p19_s1?isAuthorized=no{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Dimensions - rolling resistance in tires is related to the flex of sidewalls and the contact area of the tire<ref name = \"schwalbe\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.schwalbetires.com/tech_info/rolling_resistance\n| title = Schwalbe Tires: Rolling Resistance}}</ref> For example, at the same pressure, wider [[bicycle tire]]s flex less in the sidewalls as they roll and thus have lower rolling resistance (although higher air resistance).<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/>  \n* Extent of inflation - Lower pressure in tires results in more flexing of the sidewalls and higher rolling resistance.<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> This energy conversion in the sidewalls increases resistance and can also lead to overheating and may have played a part in the infamous [[Ford Explorer]] [[Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy|rollover accidents]].\n* Over inflating tires (such a bicycle tires) may not lower the overall rolling resistance as the tire may skip and hop over the road surface. Traction is sacrificed, and overall rolling friction may not be reduced as the wheel rotational speed changes and slippage increases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n* Sidewall deflection is not a direct measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a \"fuel saving\" casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a \"fuel saving\" tread design will only benefit until the tread wears down.\n* In tires, [[Tire tread|tread]] thickness and shape has much to do with rolling resistance. The thicker and more contoured the tread, the higher the rolling resistance<ref name=\"schwalbe\"/> Thus, the \"fastest\" bicycle tires have very little tread and heavy duty trucks get the best fuel economy as the tire tread wears out.\n* Diameter effects seem to be negligible, provided the pavement is hard and the range of diameters is limited. See [[#Dependence on diameter|dependence on diameter]].\n* Virtually all world speed records have been set on relatively narrow wheels,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} probably because of their aerodynamic advantage at high speed, which is much less important at normal speeds.\n* Temperature: with both solid and pneumatic tires, rolling resistance has been found to decrease as temperature increases (within a range of temperatures: i.e. there is an upper limit to this effect)<ref>[http://www.recumbents.com/mars/pages/proj/tetz/other/Crr.html The Recumbent Bicycle and Human Powered Vehicle Information Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>U.S National Bureau of Standards p.? and Williams p.?</ref> For a rise in temperature from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 70&nbsp;\u00b0C the rolling resistance decreased by 20-25%.<ref>Roberts, \"Effect of temperature\", p.59</ref> It is claimed that racers heat their tire before racing.\n\n==Railroads: Components of rolling resistance==\nIn a broad sense rolling resistance can be defined as the sum of components<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, p. 74, Although \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 list these components, he doesn't give the sum a name.</ref>): \n# Wheel bearing torque losses. \n# Pure rolling resistance.\n# Sliding of the wheel on the rail.\n# Loss of energy to the roadbed (and earth). \n# Loss of energy to oscillation of railway rolling stock.\n\nWheel bearing torque losses can be measured as a rolling resistance at the wheel rim, [[#Rolling resistance coefficient|Crr]]. Railroads normally use roller bearings which are either [[Rolling-element bearing#Cylindrical roller|cylindrical]] (Russia)<ref name=cars-Russia>\u0428\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0440. \u041b. \u0410.

Section 14: \"Axle journals and bearings\". Almost all of the ads in this section are for the tapered type of bearing.</ref> The specific rolling resistance in Russian bearings varies with both wheel loading and speed.<ref>\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, Fig 4.2, p. 76</ref> Wheel bearing rolling resistance is lowest with high axle loads and intermediate speeds of 60\u201380&nbsp;km/h with a Crr of 0.00013 (axle load of 21 tonnes). For empty freight cars with axle loads of 5.5 tonnes, Crr goes up to 0.00020 at 60&nbsp;km/h but at a low speed of 20&nbsp;km/h it increases to 0.00024 and at a high speed (for freight trains) of 120&nbsp;km/h it is 0.00028. The Crr obtained above is added to the Crr of the other components to obtain the total Crr for the wheels.\n\n==Comparing rolling resistance of highway vehicles and trains==\nThe rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail of a train is far less than that of the rubber tires wheels of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.\n\nAs an example of a very heavy passenger train, in 1975, Amtrak passenger trains weighed a little over 7 tonnes per passenger,<ref name=rr_stat>Statistics of railroads of class I in the United States, Years 1965 to 1975: Statistical summary. Washington DC, Association of American Railroads, Economics and Finance Dept. See table for Amtrak, p.16. To get the tons per passenger divide ton-miles (including locomotives) by passenger-miles. To get tons-gross/tons-net, divide gross ton-mi (including locomotives) (in the \"operating statistics\" table by the revenue ton-miles (from the \"Freight traffic\" table)</ref> which is much heavier than an average of a little over one ton per passenger for an automobile. This means that for an Amtrak passenger train in 1975, much of the energy savings of the lower rolling resistance was lost to its greater weight.\n\nAn example of a very light high-speed passenger train is the [[N700 Series Shinkansen]], which weighs 715 tonnes and carries 1323 passengers, resulting in a per-passenger weight of about half a tonne. This lighter weight per passenger, combined with the lower rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail means that an N700 Shinkansen is much more energy efficient than a typical automobile.\n\nIn the case of freight, CSX ran an advertisement campaign in 2013 claiming that their freight trains move \"a ton of freight 436 miles on a gallon of fuel\", whereas some sources claim trucks move a ton of freight about 130 miles per gallon of fuel, indicating trains are more efficient overall.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coefficient of friction]]\n* [[Low-rolling resistance tires]]\n* [[Maglev (transport)|Maglev]] ([[Magnetic]] [[Levitation]], the elimination of rolling and thus rolling resistance)\n* [[Rolling element bearing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n*\u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 \u041f.\u041d. {{in lang|ru}} \"\u0421\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\" (Resistance to motion of railway rolling stock) \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0426\u041d\u0418\u0418 \u041c\u041f\u0421 (ISSN 0372-3305). \u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a 311 (Vol. 311). - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, 1966. \u2013 178 pp. [http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b12003170~S1 perm. record at UC Berkeley] (In 2012, full text was on the Internet but the U.S. was blocked)\n*\u0414\u0435\u0435\u0432 \u0412.\u0412., \u0418\u043b\u044c\u0438\u043d \u0413.\u0410., \u0410\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0413.\u0421. {{in lang|ru}} \"\u0422\u044f\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0432\" (Traction of trains) \u0423\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435. - \u041c.: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, 1987. - 264 pp.\n*Hay, William W. \"Railroad Engineering\" New York, Wiley 1953\n*[[Mayo D.

It is 30 minutes from [[Nice]] airport and 15 minutes from the centre of [[Cannes]].\n\nThe MACM opened to the public in June 2011. The museum has won several international awards and has loaned dozens of objects to other museums and university exhibitions all over the world.\n\nThe museum\u2019s large and diverse collection of antiquities includes Roman, Greek and Egyptian sculpture, vases, coins, and jewellery, and the world\u2019s largest private collection of ancient arms and armour .\n\nThe ancient artworks are interspersed with paintings, drawings, and sculptures by artists such as [[Henri Matisse]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Marc Quinn]], [[Antony Gormley]], and [[Damien Hirst]], and others. The collection also includes works by artists who spent time in Mougins, such as [[Francis Picabia]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Man Ray]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] (who spent the final 12 years of his life in Mougins village).\n\nThe founder of the museum is Christian Levett, a British investment manager with an interest in history and art. A collector since childhood, in 2009 he formed the museum to place his antiquity and classical art collection on public display. The Mus\u00e9e de Mougins was created by remodelling a 600m<sup>2</sup> medieval edifice to house his collection. The building itself used to be the village prison in medieval times, it was then turned into a mill before becoming a private residence in the 1950s.  The interior was entirely renovated to display the collection while the fa\u00e7ade remains in its original style. \n\nThe museum\u2019s director is Leisa Paoli.\n\n== Concept ==\nAlthough the majority of objects on display are antiquities, the museum embraces a concept of displaying ancient, neo-classical, modern and contemporary art side by side to show the pervasive and lasting influence of the ancient world. Thus works by Sir [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Damien Hirst]] and others are included in the museum alongside their ancient inspirations.\n\nThis dialogue and fusion between ancient and modern is particularly clear in the museum where, for example, depictions of the Greek Goddess [[Aphrodite]] by [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed|Dal\u00ed]] and [[Yves Klein]] accompany 1st and 2nd Century AD depictions of the Goddess, in marble and in bronze.\n\n== History ==\nFounder, Christian Levett, a philanthropist in the field, sponsored multiple exhibitions at [[British Museum|The British Museum]], [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]], [[National Gallery]], [[Sir John Soane's Museum|Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum]] and the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]]. He has funded archaeological works in the UK, Spain, Italy and Egypt and sponsored academic scholarships at Wolfson College and The Ruskin School of Art in Oxford. He has aided curatorial funding at The Ashmolean, The British Museum, and The British School at Rome.\n\nAs well as this, he has funded renovation works at The Charterhouse Museum London, Charterhouse School Surrey, The National Gallery and the chapel Notre Dame de Vie in Mougins, and has sponsored conferences at King\u2019s College London, Senate House UCL and at The Mougins Museum. He is a member of the Arms and Armour Committee at The Metropolitan Museum of New York and member of The Board of Visitors at The Ashmolean Museum Oxford and is a past board member of The Hadrian\u2019s Wall Trust. Levett is also an Honorary Fellow of The Ashmolean Museum, an honorary fellow of Wolfson College Oxford and a member of the Oxford University Chancellors Court of Benefactors.\n\nOn 29 October 2019 Levett consigned for sale at Christie's a marble statue of the Emperor Hadrian from his collection, known as the Cobham Hall Hadrian, to benefit the Museum.<ref>[https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/a-roman-marble-statue-of-the-emperor-6229109-details.aspx Christies information]</ref>\n\n== Collection ==\nThe MACM is spread over four floors chronologically from the crypt to the second floor as follows: The Egyptian Gallery, in the crypt, depicts the theme of the afterlife with funerary masks, numerous other ancient artefacts and two sarcophagi, punctuated with works from Chagall, Calder, Rubens and Cocteau. The People and Personalities Gallery on the ground floor presents busts and statues of historical figures from ancient Greece and Rome, their influence highlighted by sculptures of [[Sacha Sosno|Sosno]], [[Arman]], [[Marc Quinn|Quinn]] and [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]. The Gods and Goddesses Gallery, on the first floor displays Greek and Roman bronze and marble statues, heads and busts, pottery, glass and silverware, an extensive collection of coins and an antique jewellery display case. Works by neo-classical and modern artists such as [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Yves Klein|Klein]], [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed|Dal\u00ed]] are also exhibited in the museum.
