In 2005, he became an emeritus professor of politics at the [[University of Oxford]] and an emeritus fellow of [[St Antony's College, Oxford]], where he served as a professor of politics and director of [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's]] Russian and East European Centre. He has written widely on Soviet and Russian politics, on communist politics more generally, on the [[Cold War]], and on political [[leadership]].\n\n== Career ==\nBrown was born in [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway|Annan, Scotland]], and educated at [[Annan Academy]] and at [[Dumfries Academy]], before studying as both undergraduate and graduate student at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). He taught at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1964 to 1971, during which time he was a [[British Council]] exchange scholar at [[Moscow State University]] for the academic year 1967-68.<ref name=Bio>[http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/russian/brown.html Archie Brown's St Antony's College Biography] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609083425/http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/russian/brown.html |date=9 June 2011 }}</ref> \n\nHe has been a visiting professor at [[Yale University]], the [[University of Connecticut]] and [[Columbia University]].

In 1998, he was a distinguished visiting fellow of the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]]<ref name=Bio/> in Indiana.\n\nAt [[Oxford University]], Brown was [[university lecturer]] in Soviet institutions from 1971 until 1989, when he became professor of politics. He held that position from 1989 to 2005. Concurrently, he was a sub-warden of [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]] between 1995 and 1997 and director of the Russian and East European Centre twice (from 1991 to 1994, and again from 1998 to 2001). He was director of graduate studies in politics for Oxford University between 2001 and 2003.<ref name=Bio/>\n\n== Publications ==\nBrown has written and edited numerous books on Soviet and Communist politics, and his articles have covered a wide range of subjects, including the end of the Cold War, British politics, post-Soviet Russian politics, political leadership, political culture, and 18th-century political and social thought. Several of his books deal with the Soviet [[perestroika]] and the role of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the transformation of the Soviet system and the ending of the [[Cold War]]. They focus both on the power of ideas and on the power of institutions, putting Gorbachev's innovative leadership in its political context. For the ''The Gorbachev Factor'' (1996), the [[Political Studies Association]] of the UK  awarded Brown the [[W. J. M. Mackenzie | W.J.M. Mackenzie]] Prize for \"best political science book of the year\". That book also shared the [[Alec Nove|Alec Nove Prize]] of the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies (BASEES) for \"best book or article in any discipline on Russia, Communism or Postcommunism\". In ''Seven Years that Changed the World: Perestroika in Perspective'' (2007; paperback 2008), Brown returned to these themes, making use of new and extensive archival material, including the records of [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Politburo]] meetings.\n\nArchie Brown's book, ''The Rise and Fall of Communism'' (2009; UK paperback 2010; US paperback 2011) deals with communism worldwide \u2013 from its 19th-century origins to the fall of communism in Europe in 1989 and its adaptation and mutation in China. This book earned Brown the 2010 Mackenzie Prize of the Political Studies Association, making him the recipient of \"best political science book of the year\" award for a second time. It also won the Nove Prize awarded by BASEES. In addition to its separate American, British and Canadian editions, the work has been published in translation in nine other countries.\n\nBrown followed that with a still broader comparative-historical book \u2013 on political leadership worldwide since the dawn of the 20th century \u2013 ''The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age'' (2014; paperback, 2015).<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Brown\n| first1 = Archie\n| author-link1 = Archie Brown\n| orig-year = 2014\n| title = The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sM5UAgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Random House\n| publication-date = 2015\n| isbn = 9781448156986\n| access-date = 2017-08-22\n}}\n</ref>\n[[Bill Gates]] named it as one of the five best books he read in 2016.<ref>https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2016?WT.mc_id=00_00_00_share_em </ref><ref>\nCompare: \nhttps://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Myth-of-the-Strong-Leader\n</ref> It has been translated into Arabic, Chinese (Taiwan), Czech, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Spanish.\n\nHis most recent book addresses the part played by political leadership in ending the Cold War.

In 1999 he was chosen as a founding member of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]], and has been an international honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 2003. He was appointed as a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] list in 2005 \"for services to UK-Russian relations and to the study of political science and international affairs\".<ref name=Bio/> In 2010 he became one of three scholars to receive the Diamond Jubilee Award for Lifetime Achievement in Political Studies. The Political Studies Association of the UK made the awards to mark the sixtieth anniversary of its foundation.

Brown|the Welsh rugby player|Archie Brown (rugby)|the British racing driver|Archie Scott Brown}}\n'''Archibald Haworth Brown''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CMG|FBA|}} (born 10 May 1938), commonly known as '''Archie Brown''', is a British [[political science | political scientist]] and [[historian]]. In 2005, he became an emeritus professor of politics at the [[University of Oxford]] and an emeritus fellow of [[St Antony's College, Oxford]], where he served as a professor of politics and director of [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's]] Russian and East European Centre. He has written widely on Soviet and Russian politics, on communist politics more generally, on the [[Cold War]], and on political [[leadership]].\n\n== Career ==\nBrown was born in [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway|Annan, Scotland]], and educated at [[Annan Academy]] and at [[Dumfries Academy]], before studying as both undergraduate and graduate student at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). He taught at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1964 to 1971, during which time he was a [[British Council]] exchange scholar at [[Moscow State University]] for the academic year 1967-68.<ref name=Bio>[http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/russian/brown.html Archie Brown's St Antony's College Biography] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609083425/http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/russian/brown.html |date=9 June 2011 }}</ref> \n\nHe has been a visiting professor at [[Yale University]], the [[University of Connecticut]] and [[Columbia University]]. He was also a visiting professor and holder of the Frank C. Erwin, Jr. Centennial Chair of Government at the [[University of Texas|University of Texas, Austin]]. In 1998, he was a distinguished visiting fellow of the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]]<ref name=Bio/> in Indiana.\n\nAt [[Oxford University]], Brown was [[university lecturer]] in Soviet institutions from 1971 until 1989, when he became professor of politics. He held that position from 1989 to 2005. Concurrently, he was a sub-warden of [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]] between 1995 and 1997 and director of the Russian and East European Centre twice (from 1991 to 1994, and again from 1998 to 2001). He was director of graduate studies in politics for Oxford University between 2001 and 2003.<ref name=Bio/>\n\n== Publications ==\nBrown has written and edited numerous books on Soviet and Communist politics, and his articles have covered a wide range of subjects, including the end of the Cold War, British politics, post-Soviet Russian politics, political leadership, political culture, and 18th-century political and social thought. Several of his books deal with Soviet [[perestroika]] and the role of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the transformation of the Soviet system and the ending of the [[Cold War]]. They focus both on the power of ideas and on the power of institutions, putting Gorbachev's innovative leadership in its political context. For the ''The Gorbachev Factor'' (1996), the [[Political Studies Association]] of the UK  awarded Brown the [[W. J. M. Mackenzie | W.J.M. Mackenzie]] Prize for \"best political science book of the year\". That book also shared the [[Alec Nove|Alec Nove Prize]] of the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies for \"best book or article in any discipline on Russia, Communism or Postcommunism\". In ''Seven Years that Changed the World: Perestroika in Perspective'' (2007; paperback 2008), Brown returned to these themes, making use of new and extensive archival material, including the records of [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Politburo]] meetings.\n\nArchie Brown's book, ''The Rise and Fall of Communism'' (2009; UK paperback 2010; US paperback 2011) deals with communism worldwide \u2013 from its 19th-century origins to the fall of communism in Europe in 1989 and its adaptation and mutation in China. This book earned Brown the 2010 Mackenzie Prize of the Political Studies Association, making him the recipient of \"best political science book of the year\" award for a second time. It also won the Nove Prize awarded by the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies. In addition to its American, British and Canadian editions, the work has been published in translation in nine other countries.\n\nBrown followed that with a still broader comparative-historical book \u2013 on political leadership worldwide since the dawn of the 20th century \u2013 ''The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age'' (2014; paperback, 2015).<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Brown\n| first1 = Archie\n| author-link1 = Archie Brown\n| orig-year = 2014\n| title = The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sM5UAgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Random House\n| publication-date = 2015\n| isbn = 9781448156986\n| access-date = 2017-08-22\n}}\n</ref>\n[[Bill Gates]] named it as one of the five best books he read in 2016.<ref>https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2016?WT.mc_id=00_00_00_share_em </ref><ref>\nCompare: \nhttps://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Myth-of-the-Strong-Leader\n</ref> It has been translated into Arabic, Chinese (Taiwan), Czech, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Spanish.\n\nHis most recent book addresses the part played by political leadership in ending the Cold War. ''The Human Factor: Gorbachev, Reagan, and Thatcher, and the End of the Cold War'' was published in 2020.\u2019\n\n==Honours==\nElected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA) in 1991, Brown chaired the Academy's Political Studies Section from 1999 to 2002 and was a member of the Council of the British Academy, 2014\u20132017. In 1999 he was chosen as a founding member of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]], before being elected as a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2003. Her Majesty appointed him as a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] list in 2005 \"for services to UK-Russian relations and to the study of political science and international affairs\".<ref name=Bio/> In 2010 he became one of three scholars to receive the Diamond Jubilee Award for Lifetime Achievement in Political Studies. The Political Studies Association of the UK made the award to mark the sixtieth anniversary of its foundation. In 2015 he received the Distinguished Contributions to Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies Award from [[Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies | ASEEES]] at their annual convention in Philadelphia.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Brown, A., ''Soviet Politics and Political Science'', 1974 ([[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]), {{ISBN|0-333-13751-5}}\n* Brown, A., Kaser, M., ''The Soviet Union Since the Fall of Khrushchev'', 1975, 2nd ed., 1978 (Macmillan), {{ISBN|0-333-23337-9}}\n* Brown, A., Gray, J., ''Political Culture and Political Change in Communist States'', 1977 (Macmillan), {{ISBN|0-333-21429-3}}\n* Rigby, T.H., Brown, A. and Reddaway, P.

It is chiefly remembered for the batting performances of [[Denis Compton]] and [[Bill Edrich]] who established seasonal records that, with the subsequent reduction in the number of [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches, will probably never be broken. Their form was key to their team [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] winning the [[County Championship]] for the first time since 1921, although they were involved in a tight contest for the title with the eventual runners-up [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], for whom [[Tom Goddard]] was the most outstanding bowler of the season. Compton and Edrich were assisted by the fact that it was the driest and sunniest English summer for a generation, ensuring plenty of good batting wickets.\n\nThe [[South African national cricket team|South Africans]], captained by [[Alan Melville]], toured the British Isles for the first time since 1935 and played a [[Test cricket|Test series]] of five matches against [[England cricket team|England]], who won the series 3\u20130 with two matches drawn, again largely thanks to the batting of Compton and Edrich. The South Africans enjoyed greater success in first-class matches against the English county teams, losing only one and winning eleven. Other notable fixtures played include [[The University Match (cricket)|the University Match]], [[Gentlemen v Players]] (twice) and [[North v South]] (three matches). The [[Minor Counties Championship]] was won by [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire II]], one of six first-class teams who entered their second elevens in the competition. Unusually, there were two [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tied matches]] in 1947, compared with two in the previous 21 years. [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] v [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] v [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] were the 20th and 21st tied matches in the history of first-class cricket worldwide since the earliest known instance in 1783.\n\nThe main source for information about the season is ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', in its 85th edition published in April 1948. This announced the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] for 1947: [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[Alan Melville]], [[Dudley Nourse]], [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] and [[Norman Yardley]]. 1947 was the first season to be reviewed by ''[[Playfair Cricket Annual]]'', which began publication in April 1948.\n\n==Background==\nThe main sources for the 1947 season are the 85th edition of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' and the inaugural edition of ''[[Playfair Cricket Annual]]'', both published in April 1948. The 1947 season was therefore the first to be reviewed by ''Playfair''.\n\nThe [[winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]] was harsh with heavy snowfalls disrupting communication and supply for about six weeks from January to March. February was one of the coldest months on record and the winter culminated in the wettest March for 300 years.<ref name=\"met\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/anniversary/winter1946-47.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091210010121/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/anniversary/winter1946-47.html |url-status=dead|archive-date=10 December 2009 |title=The winter of 1946/47 |last=Met Office |author-link=Met Office |accessdate=18 August 2016 }}</ref> Yet it was followed by what ''Playfair'' called a \"glorious summer\"<ref name=\"Playfair, p. 8\">''Playfair'', p. 8.</ref> in which fine weather prevailed and, as ''Wisden'' says, \"the sun shone throughout\".<ref name=\"WA48\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155566.html?years=1948 |title=Wisden Almanack \u2013 1948 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref> This was in sharp contrast to the wet summer of 1946.

As ''Wisden'' reports, \"crowds thronged the grounds (and) [[Lord's]] was often full for county games\".<ref name=\"WA48\"/>\n\n''Wisden'' editor [[Hubert Preston]] commented in his 1948 editorial that \"the season of 1947 bears favourable comparison with any year within living memory\".<ref name=\"Wisden82\">''Wisden 1948'', p. 82.</ref> He had expected the continuous fine weather to produce pitch conditions favourable to batsmen and hence the predominance of drawn matches but, as he wrote, \"actually about three-quarters of the [[County Championship]] matches were won outright\".<ref name=\"Wisden82\"/>\n\n''Playfair'' editor [[Peter West]] wrote that \"a grand and glorious summer\" had been \"a feast amidst austerity indeed, a fine reward for months of waiting through a chill and infamous winter\". West went on to claim that \"nearly three million people\", with the younger generation strongly represented, attended first-class cricket matches in 1947.

This was the first South African tour of England since 1935, the team captained by [[Alan Melville]] who had played in England for [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]. ''Wisden'' commented that despite their lack of success in the Test series, South Africa \"gave indication of real ability at all points of the game\" and \"little more experience is necessary to make them really powerful\" in international cricket.<ref name=\"Wisden82\"/> ''Playfair'' acclaimed the South Africans as a \"most popular team (who) enriched the game and set an excellent example\", the tour realising a profit of \u00a310,000.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 45.</ref>\n\nSouth Africa fared very well in their matches against the county clubs, winning eleven of the eighteen matches and losing only one, which was the opening match of the tour against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] by 39 runs. They lost to [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in May by 158 runs, but in September they had a convincing nine wicket win against the [[South of England cricket team|South]] who included [[Denis Compton]], [[Bill Edrich]] and [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]].<ref>''Playfair'', p. 62.</ref>\n\nThe outstanding South African players were the three best batsmen: Melville, [[Bruce Mitchell (cricketer)|Bruce Mitchell]] and [[Dudley Nourse]]. [[Ken Viljoen]] had a good tour and made six centuries but none in the Tests. The bowling was moderate as no one took more than 15 wickets in the series or averaged under forty. [[Athol Rowan]] with 102 was the only tourist to take a century of wickets in the season. The team badly lacked pace bowlers and included only two medium-fast seamers, [[Jack Plimsoll]] and [[Lindsay Tuckett]], the majority of bowlers being spinners: Rowan, [[Tufty Mann]], [[Ian Smith (South African cricketer)|Ian Smith]] and [[Leslie Payn]]. South Africa had three wicketkeepers in the party: [[Johnny Lindsay]], [[Douglas Ovenstone]] and [[George Fullerton (cricketer)|George Fullerton]]. [[Ossie Dawson]] was an all-rounder and the remaining batsmen were [[Denis Begbie]], [[Dennis Dyer]] and [[Tony Harris (cricketer)|Tony Harris]].

[[Wally Hammond]] captained the side in his final Test series. The other batsmen were [[Len Hutton]], [[Cyril Washbrook]], [[Denis Compton]], [[Bill Edrich]], [[James Langridge]], [[Laurie Fishlock]] and [[Joe Hardstaff junior]]. [[Jack Ikin]] and [[Norman Yardley]] were essentially all-rounders. [[Godfrey Evans]] and [[Paul Gibb]] were the wicketkeepers and the bowlers were [[Alec Bedser]], [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]], [[Dick Pollard]], [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] and [[Bill Voce]]. Gibb, Hardstaff, Hutton and Langridge did not play in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWith Hammond having retired from international cricket, Yardley was appointed captain for the home series against South Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In the first Test, England recalled [[Eric Hollies]] and selected three debutants: [[Sam Cook (Gloucestershire cricketer)|Sam Cook]], [[Tom Dollery]] and [[Jack Martin (cricketer)|Jack Martin]]. Hutton, Washbrook, Edrich, Compton, Evans and Bedser were retained from the winter tour and these six with Yardley were the mainstays of the England team in 1947. There were changes again for the second Test with [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]] replacing Dollery, [[George Pope (cricketer)|George Pope]] replacing Martin and Wright coming back in place of Cook. Bedser missed the third Test and was replaced by [[Cliff Gladwin]] while  [[Ken Cranston]] was brought in to replace Pope. In the fourth Test, [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]] was introduced in place of Hollies and [[Harold Butler (cricketer)|Harold Butler]] for Gladwin. Edrich missed the last Test, as again did Bedser, and there were yet more changes elsewhere with [[Dick Howorth]] coming in to replace Barnett and [[Bill Copson]] replacing Butler. [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] took Edrich's place. It all meant that, in a five-match series they won 3\u20130, England used 21 different players.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWith so many players under consideration, it was difficult to predict who would go to the West Indies in the winter and that question became even more complex when several players decided not to go. Bedser, Compton, Edrich, Hutton, Wright and Yardley from the 1947 series all declined the tour before the squad was selected, as did [[Trevor Bailey]] who was in contention for a place.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With Yardley missing, MCC reappointed pre-war captain [[Gubby Allen]] to lead the party but he was the first in a spate of injuries when he damaged a leg muscle on the outward voyage.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following further injuries to [[Dennis Brookes]] and [[Joe Hardstaff junior]], Allen asked MCC to send reinforcements and Hutton then changed his mind, flying out just in time to play against [[Guyana national cricket team|British Guiana]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOf the players who went to the West Indies, the only ones who had played against South Africa in the summer were Hutton, Evans, Cranston, Robertson, Howorth and Butler. Hardstaff and Ikin had been to Australia and New Zealand the previous winter. The other eight were Allen and seven newcomers: [[Dennis Brookes]], [[Billy Griffith]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Winston Place]], [[Gerald Smithson]], [[Maurice Tremlett]] and [[Johnny Wardle]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''Playfair'' was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series. The team, it said, \"could not be called great by any standards\" as it was too \"experimental\" but it at least seemed \"workmanlike\" and in Laker a new star had been discovered.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 11.</ref> ''Playfair'' ominously concluded its review by reference to the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|1948 Australian team]] being \"about to descend upon us well armed in all key departments (and) we shall have to do better than this\".<ref>''Playfair'', p. 13.</ref>\n\n==County Championship==\n[[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] won the [[County Championship]] under the captaincy of [[Walter Robins]], who stood down at the end of the season.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He was well supported by slow left-arm [[spin bowling|spinner]] [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]], who took 159 wickets in all matches; [[off break]] bowler [[Jim Sims]]; pace bowler [[Laurie Gray]]; [[wicketkeeper]] [[Leslie Compton]]; and their quartet of high-scoring batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Bill Edrich]], [[Syd Brown]] and [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The ''Wisden'' editorial drew attention to an additional feat by Middlesex in defeating \"[[Non-international England cricket teams|The Rest]]\" by nine wickets in the last match of the season at [[The Oval]]. Previously, only [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] (1905 and 1935) had beaten The Rest, the fixture having lapsed from 1936 to 1946.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Yorkshire had won the County Championship in 1946 but slipped to seventh place in 1947 and ''Wisden'' remarked on the retirement of \"several veterans\" after the 1946 season, although the highest innings score of the 1947 season, 270 [[not out]], was achieved by Yorkshire's [[Len Hutton]].<ref name=\"Wisden83\">''Wisden 1948'', p. 83.</ref>\n\n''Playfair'' described the championship as \"a great tussle\" between Middlesex and [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] that was not settled until 28 August when Middlesex won their penultimate match, defeating bottom team [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] at Lord's by 355 runs.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The key match, however, took place earlier in the month when Middlesex defeated Gloucestershire at Cheltenham by 68 runs. Middlesex had finished runners-up five times in succession: 1936 to 1939 and again in 1946. Since Middlesex's previous title in 1921, no southern team had won the championship and so their 1947 triumph ended 25 seasons of northern domination.<ref name=\"PF63\">''Playfair'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Gloucestershire v Middlesex, August 1947===\nThe Gloucestershire v Middlesex match at the [[College Ground, Cheltenham]] was the ultimate decider of a close-fought championship. It began on Saturday, 16 August on the same day as the fifth Test at The Oval and ''Playfair'' remarked that \"even the final Test seemed a matter of secondary importance\".<ref name=\"PF63\"/> There was no play on Sundays in 1947 and the match continued into Monday, 18 August, when it was concluded with Tuesday to spare.<ref name=\"CA18240\">[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18240.html CricketArchive \u2013 Gloucestershire v Middlesex 1947].

Edrich went on to score 50 but, apart from some resistance by tailenders Sims and Young, Middlesex's batting collapsed as Gloucestershire's great [[off break|off spinner]] [[Tom Goddard]] took seven for 70. Middlesex were all out for 180 but Sims (six for 65) and Young (four for 55) turned the tables and bowled out Gloucestershire for 153. At close of play on Saturday, Middlesex had reached 9 for 1 in their second innings, Goddard having taken the key wicket of Edrich, so Monday's play began with Middlesex ahead by 36 and nine wickets standing. The decisive phase of the match was a third wicket partnership on Monday morning between [[Harry Sharp]] and the captain Robins. Scoring 46 and 45 respectively, they shared a stand of 70 runs which ''Playfair'' described as \"vital\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Otherwise, Middlesex again collapsed and Goddard took eight for 86 to complete an outstanding match analysis of fifteen for 156. So Gloucestershire with a day and a half remaining needed 169 to win. [[Jack Crapp]] tried to hold the innings together and scored 40 but Gloucestershire were rolled over for only 100 to lose by 68 runs. Young took five for 27 but an important role was again played by Sharp, this time as an off spinner, taking the wickets of three of Gloucestershire's top six batsmen, two of them without scoring. ''Playfair'' points out that Sharp at the time was still only a member of the Lord's ground staff but he played the key part in winning the match that ultimately settled the championship.<ref name=\"CA18240\"/><ref name=\"PF64\"/>\n\n===Season finale===\nGloucestershire had gone into the Cheltenham match with a lead of four points in the championship table and the immediate outcome was that Middlesex overtook them to lead by eight points, both teams having four matches still to be played. Middlesex had to play [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] away, \"always difficult to beat\", and three home matches against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and third-placed [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] whom ''Playfair'' termed \"the toughest nut to crack\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''Playfair'' considered Gloucestershire's programme to be easier as they faced four moderate teams: [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] at Cheltenham, [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] away, and [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] at [[County Cricket Ground, Bristol|Bristol]].<ref name=\"PF64\"/>\n\nThere was no change after the first two matches as Gloucestershire beat Glamorgan in two days and Middlesex won the difficult encounter at [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|Derby]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It all went wrong for Gloucestershire at [[Dean Park Cricket Ground|Dean Park]], [[Bournemouth]] where stubborn Hampshire batting forced a draw while Middlesex were defeating Surrey with some ease. This gave Middlesex a twenty-point lead and only two matches each to be played.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Middlesex's victory over the bottom team Northants settled it, especially as Gloucestershire surprisingly lost to Sussex by nine wickets.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Even so, there was a slight sting in the tail as Middlesex then lost their final match to a determined Lancashire by 64 runs while Gloucestershire rallied to defeat Essex.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The final table showed Middlesex winning by twenty points, on the face of it a handsome margin, but in reality it was a much closer contest than the figures would suggest.<ref name=\"PF64\"/>\n\n===Final table===\nThe seventeen first-class county teams played a total of 26 matches each. Twelve points were awarded for a win and six to each team if the result was a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]], as happened twice in 1947. Teams leading on first innings who subsequently drew or lost the match were awarded four points. Essex were awarded two points in one match they lost after a tie on first innings.<ref name=\"PF83\">''Playfair'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nThe final championship table was as follows:<ref

''Playfair'' noted that these were the 20th and 21st tied matches in the history of first-class cricket worldwide since the earliest known instance in 1783.<ref name=\"PF111\">''Playfair'', p. 111.</ref>\n\nThe Essex v Northamptonshire match was played at [[Valentines Park]], [[Ilford]] 17 to 20 May. Northamptonshire won the toss and decided to bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by [[Vince Broderick]] while Essex's Test [[leg break]] and [[googly]] bowler [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener [[Chick Cray]] on 90 [[not out]]. He completed his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out. Northamptonshire were 219 for 5 at the close on Monday evening with their veteran batsman [[John Timms]] on 90 [[not out]]. Timms was out for 112 on Tuesday morning and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day. They had a good stand of 103 for the fourth wicket between [[Frank Vigar]] (60) and [[Len Clark]] (64) but spinners Broderick and [[Bertie Clarke]] kept picking up the wickets and Essex were still ten behind when the ninth went down. The last pair were captain [[Tom Pearce (cricketer)|Tom Pearce]] and wicketkeeper [[Tom Wade (cricketer)|Tom Wade]] who managed to level the scores before Wade was bowled by Clarke to tie the match.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18012.html CricketArchive \u2013 Essex v Northamptonshire 1947].

Hampshire batted first and scored 363, the innings continuing into the Thursday morning, [[Jim Bailey (cricketer)|Jim Bailey]] with 95 the top scorer. Lancashire captain [[Ken Cranston]] had taken four for 73 and he led the Lancashire reply with 155 [[not out]] before declaring the innings closed at 367 for 9. Hampshire safely negotiated the last few overs on Thursday evening to close on 18 for 0 before totalling 224 for 7 declared on Friday, Jim Bailey again the top scorer with 63. This was a sporting declaration by the Hampshire captain [[Desmond Eagar]] as there was time to bowl only 47 overs before the close. [[Cyril Washbrook]] led the chase with 105 while Jim Bailey, having twice starred with the bat, took six for 82. When the last over began, Lancashire had reached 220 for 8 with [[Jack Ikin]] and wicketkeeper [[Alfred Barlow]] batting, but this was the last wicket as [[William Roberts (cricketer, born 1914)|William Roberts]] had been taken to hospital with a broken finger and could not bat. Ikin and Barlow came together at 204 for 8 and so had added 16 for the final wicket to level the scores. Barlow was on strike and facing off spinner [[Gerry Hill]].

The three main bowlers were Gray, Young and the veteran Sims. [[Ian Bedford]], aged seventeen, made his debut and took twelve wickets in his first two matches. Middlesex also made effective use as bowlers of Robins, Edrich and Denis Compton. ''Playfair'' noted the consistently high standard of the Middlesex fielding, especially by Brown, while Leslie Compton as wicket-keeper was a great success.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 84\u201385.</ref> Middlesex made exclusive use of [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in [[St John's Wood]], north [[London]], for their thirteen home matches.<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n\n===Gloucestershire===\nGloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of [[Wally Hammond]] but in [[Tom Goddard]] they had the best bowler in the country.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by [[Sam Cook (Gloucestershire cricketer)|Sam Cook]] who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with [[George Lambert (cricketer)|George Lambert]] largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]]. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain [[Basil Allen]], Barnett, [[Jack Crapp]], [[George Emmett]] and wicket-keeper [[Andy Wilson (cricketer)|Andy Wilson]]. ''Playfair'' recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. [[Ken Graveney]] made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and [[Tom Graveney|his brother Tom]] was waiting in the wings. Other players included [[Monty Cranfield]], [[Bev Lyon]], [[Clifford Monks]], [[William Neale]], [[Grahame Parker]], [[Colin Scott (cricketer)|Colin Scott]] and [[Alfred Wilcox (cricketer)|Alfred Wilcox]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nGloucestershire generally used their headquarters in [[Bristol]], playing nine of their fourteen home matches there.

They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers [[Cyril Washbrook]] and [[Winston Place]] who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only [[Geoff Edrich]] performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, [[Jack Ikin]] and captain [[Ken Cranston]] scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman [[Dick Pollard]] who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer [[William Roberts (cricketer, born 1914)|William Roberts]] bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but ''Playfair'' remarked that he was short of Test class.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper [[Alfred Barlow]] and there were good reports of [[Alan Wharton]] who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Batsman [[Barry Howard (cricketer)|Barry Howard]] played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain [[Nigel Howard]], [[Tom Brierley]], [[Phil King (cricketer)|Phil King]] in his final season, future Test umpire [[Eddie Phillipson]], [[Eric Price (cricketer)|Eric Price]], and [[Gordon Garlick]] who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nLancashire played the majority of their home matches at their Old Trafford headquarters and played two matches elsewhere in the county:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Aigburth Cricket Ground, Liverpool]]\n* [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]], [[Manchester]]\n* [[Stanley Park, Blackpool]]\n\n===Kent===\nKent improved from seventh to fourth and were able to announce increased attendances and membership.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The team was again captained by [[Bryan Valentine]] and featured England stars [[Godfrey Evans]] and [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]], though they missed several championship matches for Test calls. Kent were particularly well served by their batsmen, although Valentine had problems with loss of form at times. [[Les Ames]], [[Les Todd]] and [[Arthur Fagg]] all scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. The young left-hander [[Peter Hearn]] was regarded as a fine prospect and was awarded his county cap. Wright was the main bowler and was supported by off spinner [[Ray Dovey]], all-rounder [[Jack Davies (cricketer)|Jack Davies]] and the two pacemen [[Fred Ridgway]] and [[Norman Harding (cricketer)|Norman Harding]]. Harding died unexpectedly in September, aged 31.<ref>''Wisden 1948 \u2013 obituary'', p. 783.</ref> Other players included [[Geoffrey Anson]], [[Brian Edrich]], the veteran [[Hopper Levett]] in his final season, [[Tony Mallett]], future captain [[Bill Murray-Wood]] and [[Tony Pawson (cricketer)|Tony Pawson]]. A curious case was pace bowler [[Jack Martin (cricketer)|Jack Martin]], who played for Kent only twice in 1947 and yet was selected to play for England in the [[Trent Bridge]] Test.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 89\u201390.</ref>\n\nKent's policy was to play home matches throughout the county and they used seven venues:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Bat and Ball Ground]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]]\n* [[Crabble Athletic Ground]], [[Dover]]\n* [[Garrison Ground 2]], [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]]\n* [[Mote Park]], [[Maidstone]]\n* [[St Lawrence Ground]], [[Canterbury]]\n* [[Nevill Ground]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]]\n* [[Rectory Field]], [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]\n\n===Derbyshire===\n{{Main|Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1947}}\nDerbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen [[Bill Copson]], [[Cliff Gladwin]] and [[George Pope (cricketer)|George Pope]] all playing for England. [[Dusty Rhodes (cricketer)|Dusty Rhodes]], bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer [[Eric Marsh (cricketer, born 1920)|Eric Marsh]] provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by [[Edward Gothard]], played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to [[Stan Worthington]], in his final season, and [[Denis Smith (cricketer)|Denis Smith]]. [[Charlie Elliott]] and [[Arnold Townsend]] topped 1,000 runs but ''Playfair'' noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[John Eggar]], who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until [[George Dawkes]], formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Another notable debutant was fast bowler [[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]]. Other players included [[Albert Alderman]], 55-year-old [[Harry Elliott (English cricketer)|Harry Elliott]] in his final season, [[Alan Revill]] and [[Pat Vaulkhard]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nMost of Derbyshire's home matches were played at one of their two main venues in [[Derby]] and [[Chesterfield]] but they occasionally played elsewhere. The five venues used were:<ref name=\"CCML\">[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/0/County_Championship_1947.html CricketArchive \u2013 County Championship Match List].

Another good start was made by opening batsman [[David Fletcher (cricketer)|David Fletcher]] who was awarded his county cap with Laker and [[Eric Bedser]]. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain [[Errol Holmes]], [[Tom Barling]], [[John Parker (cricketer, born 1913)|John Parker]] and [[Stan Squires]]. [[Laurie Fishlock]] had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were [[Alec Bedser]], Jim Laker and the retiring [[Alf Gover]], who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer [[Eddie Watts]] could make only a few appearances due to injury. [[Geoffrey Whittaker]] made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays [[Bernie Constable]] and [[Stuart Surridge]] also played.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 92\u201394.</ref>\n\nSurrey played twelve of their thirteen home matches at [[The Oval]] and one in [[Guildford]]. Two first-class matches not involving the Surrey XI were played in [[Kingston-upon-Thames]]. All venues:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[The Oval]], [[Kennington]], south [[London]]\n* [[Sports Ground, Woodbridge Road, Guildford|Woodbridge Road]], [[Guildford]]\n* [[Hawker's Sports Ground|Leyland Motors Ground]], [[Kingston-upon-Thames]]\n\n===Worcestershire===\nFollowing the emigration of [[Sandy Singleton]] to [[Rhodesia]] after the 1946 season, [[Allan White]] succeeded him as Worcestershire captain.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The team lacked batting strength and did well to improve their championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder [[Dick Howorth]] who was, as in 1946, the first player to complete the [[double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with [[Peter Jackson (cricketer)|Peter Jackson]] who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player [[Roly Jenkins]] made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman [[Reg Perks]] took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper [[Hugo Yarnold]] who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, [[Eddie Cooper (cricketer)|Eddie Cooper]] and, in his first full season, [[Don Kenyon]] all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were [[Charles Palmer (cricketer)|Charles Palmer]] and the veteran [[Bob Wyatt]] and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. [[Laddie Outschoorn]] qualified for the championship for the first time and showed promise. Other players included [[Ronald Bird]], [[Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921)|Fred Cooper]] (brother of Eddie), [[Norman Whiting]] and [[Martin Young (cricketer)|Martin Young]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nWorcestershire played nine of their thirteen home matches at their County Ground headquarters in [[Worcester]] and used five venues in all:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Chester Road North Ground, Kidderminster]]\n* [[New Road, Worcester]]\n* [[Tipton Road]], [[Dudley]]\n* [[War Memorial Athletic Ground|War Memorial Ground]], [[Amblecote]]\n* [[Racecourse Ground, Hereford]]\n\n===Yorkshire===\nYorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper [[Don Brennan (cricketer)|Don Brennan]], batsmen [[Willie Watson (England cricketer)|Willie Watson]] and [[Gerald Smithson]], fast bowler [[Alec Coxon]] and left arm spinner [[Johnny Wardle]]. In addition, future stalwart [[Ted Lester]] began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] made a few appearances. [[Brian Sellers]] captained the team for the final time before handing over to [[Norman Yardley]] for the 1948 season. [[Bill Bowes]] in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He was supported by Wardle, off spinner [[Ellis Robinson]], seamer [[Frank Smailes]] and new pace bowlers Coxon and [[Ron Aspinall]]. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer [[Arthur Booth (cricketer, born 1902)|Arthur Booth]], who had been their outstanding player in 1946.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 82.</ref> The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great [[Len Hutton]] who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other players included [[Harry Crick]], [[Harry Halliday]], [[Freddie Jakeman]], [[Geoffrey Keighley]] and pace bowler [[John Whitehead (cricketer)|John Whitehead]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 95\u201397.</ref>\n\nYorkshire used seven venues in various parts of the county:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]]\n* [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield]]\n* [[Headingley Cricket Ground]], [[Leeds]]\n* [[North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough]]\n* [[Park Avenue (stadium)|Park Avenue]], [[Bradford]]\n* [[St George's Road Cricket Ground, Harrogate]]\n* [[The Circle, Kingston upon Hull]]\n\n===Glamorgan===\nGlamorgan never had a settled team and there were a number of new arrivals at the end of the season including [[Gilbert Parkhouse]], [[Jim Eaglestone]], [[Norman Hever]] and [[Phil Clift]]. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler [[Peter Judge (cricketer)|Peter Judge]] was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain [[Wilf Wooller]] had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with [[Len Muncer]] and the veteran [[Johnnie Clay]] bowling off breaks and opening batsman [[Emrys Davies]] helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with [[Arnold Dyson]], both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player [[Allan Watkins]] exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by [[Wat Jones]] and [[George Lavis]]. The main wicketkeeper was [[Haydn Davies (cricketer)|Haydn Davies]] who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran [[Austin Matthews]] in his final season, [[Jim Pleass]], [[Arthur Porter (cricketer)|Arthur Porter]] and [[Maurice Robinson (cricketer)|Maurice Robinson]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 97\u201398.</ref>\n\nMost of Glamorgan' home matches were played at one of their two main venues in [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]] but they occasionally played elsewhere. The four venues used were:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Cardiff Arms Park]], [[Cardiff]]\n* [[Eugene Cross Park]], [[Ebbw Vale]]\n* [[Rodney Parade]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]\n* [[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|St Helen's Cricket Ground]], [[Swansea]]\n\n===Sussex===\n''Playfair'' emphasised the contrast between strong batting and weak bowling at Sussex who recovered from bottom place in 1946 to finish a creditable equal ninth.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Only [[Jim Cornford]] performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: [[John Langridge]], [[George Cox junior|George Cox]] and [[Harry Parks (cricketer)|Harry Parks]]. [[James Langridge]] reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to [[appendicitis]]. [[Charles Oakes (cricketer)|Charles Oakes]] and new captain [[Hugh Bartlett]] were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary [[Billy Griffith]] had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other players who appeared were [[Paul Carey (cricketer)|Paul Carey]], [[Donald Smith (cricketer, born 1923)|Donald Smith]], [[Jim Wood (Sussex cricketer)|Jim Wood]], [[Jack Oakes (cricketer)|Jack Oakes]], [[John Nye (cricketer)|John Nye]] and two future Test players [[Alan Oakman]] and [[David Sheppard]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\nSussex generally played home matches at their County Ground headquarters in [[Hove]] and used five venues in all:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Central Recreation Ground, Hastings]]\n* [[Priory Park, Chichester]]\n* [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]]\n* [[Horsham Cricket Club|Cricketfield Road Ground]], [[Horsham]]\n* [[The Saffrons]], [[Eastbourne]]\n\n===Essex===\nEssex matches were noted for high scores as Essex themselves scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Their two outstanding players were the cousins [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter]] and [[Ray Smith (cricketer)|Ray Smith]] who both completed the [[double (cricket)|double]]. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect [[Trevor Bailey]] was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder [[Frank Vigar]] took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain [[Tom Pearce (cricketer)|Tom Pearce]], [[Chick Cray]], [[Dickie Dodds]] and [[Doug Insole]]. Wicketkeeper [[Tom Wade (cricketer)|Tom Wade]] had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped. Essex were also represented by [[Bill Dines]], [[Bill Morris (cricketer)|Bill Morris]], [[Denys Wilcox]], [[Dick Horsfall]], [[Frank Rist]], [[Harry Crabtree]], [[Len Clark]] and [[Sonny Avery]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 100\u2013102.</ref>\n\nEssex continued their policy of playing matches throughout the county and home venues used in 1947 were:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n*[[Castle Park Cricket Ground]], [[Colchester]]\n*[[Chalkwell Park]], [[Westcliff-on-Sea]]\n*[[County Ground, Chelmsford]]\n*[[Old County Ground, Brentwood]]\n*[[Southchurch Park]], [[Southend-on-Sea]]\n*[[Valentine's Park]], [[Ilford]]\n*[[Vista Road Recreation Ground]], [[Clacton-on-Sea]]\n\n===Nottinghamshire===\nNottinghamshire, captained for the first time by [[William Sime]], drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost [[Bill Voce]] early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers [[Arthur Jepson]] and [[Harold Butler (cricketer)|Harold Butler]]. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer [[Harry Winrow]] who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's [[Joe Hardstaff junior]] who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. [[Walter Keeton]], [[Reg Simpson]] and [[Tom Reddick]] all topped 1,000 runs while [[Charles Harris (cricketer)|Charles Harris]] was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper [[Eric Meads]] claimed 52 victims in championship matches. [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] captain [[Guy Willatt]] batted well when available and young [[Peter Harvey (cricketer, born 1923)|Peter Harvey]], leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but [[Frederick Stocks junior|Freddie Stocks]] did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at [[Trent Bridge]] in [[Nottingham]] for their thirteen home matches.<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n\n===Somerset===\nSomerset were captained for the only time by educator [[Jack Meyer (educator and cricketer)|Jack Meyer]] but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only [[Harold Gimblett]] reliable through the season. [[Michael Walford]] played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and ''Playfair'' called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The main bowler was veteran [[Arthur Wellard]] who was supported by all-rounders [[Bertie Buse]] and [[Johnny Lawrence]], slow left armer [[Horace Hazell]], captain Meyer and new pace bowler [[Maurice Tremlett]]. The veteran [[Wally Luckes]] kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims. Other players were [[Bill Andrews (cricketer)|Bill Andrews]] in his final season, [[Frank Lee (cricketer)|Frank Lee]] in his final season before becoming an umpire, [[Hugh Watts]], [[George Woodhouse]], [[Mandy Mitchell-Innes]] and [[Miles Coope]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 104\u2013105.</ref>\n\nSomerset generally played home matches at their County Ground headquarters in [[Taunton]] and used five venues in all:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Agricultural Showgrounds, Frome]]\n* [[Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare]]\n* [[County Ground, Taunton]]\n* [[Recreation Ground (Bath)|Recreation Ground, Bath]]\n* [[Rowdens Road Cricket Ground, Wells|Rowdens Road, Wells]]\n\n===Leicestershire===\nLeicestershire had fourteen defeats and finished fourteenth. In [[Les Berry]], they had the only professional{{clarify |date=August 2016 |reason=what is significance of this?}} captain in the County Championship.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, [[Vic Jackson]], [[Gerry Lester]], [[Francis Prentice]], [[Maurice Tompkin]] and [[George Watson (cricketer, born 1907)|George Watson]] all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder [[Anthony Riddington]] scored over 800. Wicketkeeper [[Percy Corrall]] claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was [[Jack Walsh (cricketer)|Jack Walsh]], a great exponent of the \"[[Left-arm unorthodox spin|chinaman]]\", who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran [[James Sperry]] bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler. Other players were [[Thomas Chapman (cricketer)|Thomas Chapman]], [[Jack Howard (cricketer)|Jack Howard]] and [[Harry Pickering]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 106\u2013107.</ref>\n\nLeicestershire played the majority of their home matches at their [[Grace Road]] headquarters in [[Leicester]] and used four venues in all:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Egerton Park]], [[Melton Mowbray]]\n* [[Grace Road]], [[Leicester]]\n* [[Kirkby Road]], [[Barwell]]\n* [[Park Road, Loughborough]]\n\n===Warwickshire===\nWarwickshire, let down by unreliable batting, were captained by attacking batsman [[Peter Cranmer]]. Despite their lack of success, they attracted large crowds to [[Edgbaston]]. Their best players were Test spinner [[Eric Hollies]] and batsman [[Tom Dollery]], who was to become captain as a professional in 1948, though Dollery had a relatively poor season in 1947. Warwickshire were well served by their bowlers. In addition to Hollies, these were three new caps in the two seamers [[Victor Cannings]] and [[Charles Grove]]; and the New Zealand pace bowler [[Tom Pritchard]]. Dollery had to play as wicketkeeper in several matches when [[Cyril Goodway]] was unavailable. ''Playfair'' commented on advantages gained by the bowlers being \"squandered\" by inconsistent and unreliable batsmen. Five batsmen did exceed 1,000 runs but none had a good average: Cranmer, Dollery, [[Aubrey Hill (cricketer)|Aubrey Hill]], [[Jimmy Ord]] and [[Ken Taylor (cricketer, born 1916)|Ken Taylor]]. Other players were [[Bill Fantham]], [[John Hossell]] and [[Ron Maudsley]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Warwickshire played eleven home matches at their [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] headquarters in [[Birmingham]] and two matches at the [[Courtaulds Ground]] in [[Coventry]].<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n\n===Hampshire===\nHampshire, a very ordinary side who bowled badly, were captained by [[Desmond Eagar]]. The batting was occasionally good and top of the county's averages was wicketkeeper [[Neil McCorkell]] who scored 1,539 championship runs and claimed 49 victims. [[Neville Rogers]] and [[Johnny Arnold]] played some good innings to both comfortably exceed 1,000 runs. Eagar and [[Gerry Hill]] both reached 1,000 with low averages and the all-rounder [[Jim Bailey (cricketer)|Jim Bailey]], who took 53 wickets, fell just short of 1,000 runs. ''Playfair'' considered \"the steady and loyal [[George Heath (cricketer)|George Heath]]\" to be the best of the bowlers who included Bailey, Hill, [[Victor Ransom]], [[Lofty Herman]] and the injury-plagued [[Charles Knott]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other players included [[Gilbert Dawson]], [[Thomas Dean]], [[Arthur Holt (sportsman)|Arthur Holt]], [[Alan Shirreff]] and future stalwart [[Leo Harrison]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 110\u2013111.</ref>\n\nHampshire's home matches were shared between three venues:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[County Ground, Southampton]]\n* [[Dean Park Cricket Ground]], [[Bournemouth]]\n* [[United Services Recreation Ground]], [[Portsmouth]]\n\n===Northamptonshire===\nNorthamptonshire slipped from sixteenth to bottom and were captained by [[Arthur Childs-Clarke]]. [[Dennis Brookes]] was the pick of the batsmen and earned a trip to the West Indies in the winter.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Bill Barron]], [[Percy Davis (Northamptonshire cricketer)|Percy Davis]] and [[John Timms]] also topped 1,000 runs but with low averages. [[Vince Broderick]] put in a sound all-round effort with 860 runs and 87 wickets while the best bowler was West Indian Test player [[Bertie Clarke]] with 89 wickets. The attack was hampered by injuries to [[Nobby Clark (cricketer)|Nobby Clark]] who did not play often. Wicketkeeper [[Kenneth Fiddling]] claimed 40 victims. Other players included [[Leo Bennett]], [[Robert Clarke (cricketer)|Robert Clarke]], [[Arthur Cox (cricketer)|Arthur Cox]], [[Eddie Davis (cricketer)|Eddie Davis]], [[William Nevell]] and [[Jack Webster (cricketer)|Jack Webster]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\nNorthamptonshire played nine of their thirteen home matches at their County Ground headquarters in [[Northampton]] and used five venues in all:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[County Cricket Ground, Northampton]]\n* [[Town Ground, Kettering]]\n* [[Town Ground, Peterborough]]\n* [[Town Ground, Rushden]]\n* [[Wellingborough School (cricket ground)|Wellingborough School Ground, Wellingborough]]\n\n==Other major fixtures==\n===MCC v Yorkshire===\nAt the beginning of the season, on 3, 5 and 6 May, [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) played a three-day match at [[Lord's]] against the 1946 county champions, Yorkshire.

The MCC team in batting order was [[Dennis Brookes]] (Northamptonshire), [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] (Middlesex), [[Bob Wyatt]] (Worcestershire), [[Denis Compton]] (Middlesex), [[Bryan Valentine]] (Kent, captain), [[Leslie Compton]] (Middlesex, wicketkeeper), [[Wilf Wooller]] (Glamorgan), [[Haydn Davies (cricketer)|Haydn Davies]] (Glamorgan), [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]] (Middlesex), [[Rowland Shaddick]] (Middlesex) and [[Jack Martin (cricketer)|Jack Martin]] (Kent). MCC won the toss and chose to bat first but were bowled out in 57 overs for 134, Denis Compton making 73. Yorkshire got off to a very bad start when [[Len Hutton]] was dismissed by Jack Martin for nought. This began an outstanding spell for Martin who finished with six for 23 from 12.1 overs as Yorkshire collapsed to 81 all out. At close of play on the Saturday, MCC were 67 for one with Jack Robertson 36 [[not out]]. On the Monday, Robertson built a big innings and scored 164 of a declared total of 343 for 9. Yorkshire's hopes slumped when Hutton was again dismissed cheaply and at close of play they were 69 for two.

Middlesex won by 9 wickets. The Rest was a very strong team entirely consisting of players who had played or would play for England at Test level. In batting order, they were [[Cyril Washbrook]], [[Winston Place]], [[Dick Howorth]], [[George Emmett]], [[Norman Yardley]] (captain), [[Ken Cranston]], [[Godfrey Evans]] (wicketkeeper), [[Alec Bedser]], [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]], [[Tom Goddard]] and [[Harold Butler (cricketer)|Harold Butler]]. Middlesex won the toss and decided to bat first but were soon reduced to 8 for two as Bedser dismissed both openers [[Syd Brown]] and [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]]. [[Bill Edrich]] and [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]] took the score on to 53 for three when Mann, who had scored 33, was stumped by Evans off Wright. This brought Edrich and [[Denis Compton]] together. In keeping with their form throughout the season, they amassed 426 runs between them and enabled skipper [[Walter Robins]] to declare at 543 for nine. Edrich made 180 which was just enough for him to surpass [[Tom Hayward]]'s old record season aggregate, which Compton had already beaten. Compton retired hurt when he had scored 55 and the total was 191 for three. He returned with his knee strapped when the score was 274 for four and, despite his injury, he went on to make 246, his highest score of the season. Robins made 33 while Compton was off the field but the tailenders did not score many. The Rest were bowled out for 246 and followed on. They made 317 in their second innings, leaving Middlesex to win the match with 21 for one.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 114.</ref><ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/18/18288.html CricketArchive \u2013 The Rest v Middlesex 1947].

Teams played each other irregularly and a league table was compiled on the basis of average points per match played. A win was worth ten points with lesser awards given in certain specific circumstances. All teams played at least eight matches, the most being fourteen by [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire II]]. The leading teams in the table were [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey II]], Yorkshire II, [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire II]], [[Staffordshire County Cricket Club|Staffordshire]], [[Suffolk County Cricket Club|Suffolk]] and [[Oxfordshire County Cricket Club|Oxfordshire]] who each exceeded five points per match.<ref name=\"PF127\"/>\n\nTo decide the championship, a challenge match took place at [[The Oval]] on 4 to 6 September and Yorkshire II defeated Surrey II by 111 runs.<ref name=\"PF127\">''Playfair'', p. 127.</ref> Future first-class players taking part included [[Tony Lock]], [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]], [[Stuart Surridge]], [[Ron Aspinall]] and [[Bernie Constable]].<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/90/90198.html CricketArchive \u2013 Surrey II v Yorkshire II 1947].

It is improbable that the records achieved by Compton of most runs and most centuries in a season will ever be broken, especially since the reduction in first-class matches which began in 1969. What will be remembered is not the statistics but the style because Compton and Edrich scored quickly and played attacking cricket.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n''Playfair'' described Compton as \"a genius\" who was brilliant at improvisation; Edrich on the other hand was \"not a genius but a wonderfully efficient batsman\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Both men were hampered by injuries. Compton had a bad knee caused by a piece of chipped bone which was removed after the season ended. Edrich suffered a pulled shoulder muscle in early August which impeded his batting and prevented him from bowling again. When the season began in May, Edrich scored a century in his first innings and followed up with two more, including a score of 225, before the end of the month. Compton did not score his first century until his eleventh innings. Edrich scored 1,047 runs in the calendar month of July and Compton 1,039 runs in August. Edrich's highest score was 267 not out for Middlesex against Northamptonshire and Compton's was 246 for Middlesex against The Rest.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 115\u2013122.</ref>\n\n''Wisden'' published an appreciation of Compton and Edrich written by [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow]] who began by opining that \"they go together in English cricket as [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] go together in English opera\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Robertson-Glasgow made further comparisons, strictly cricket ones this time, with [[Jack Hobbs]] and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] for England and with [[Don Bradman]] and [[Bill Ponsford]] for Australia. However, he tempered his praise by pointing out that Compton and Edrich had yet to \"quell the fiercest Test attack\" as, although they had dominated the South African bowling in 1947, Australia remained another matter with \"fulfilment awaited\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} While ''Playfair'' spoke of \"brilliance and efficiency\", Robertson-Glasgow eulogised about \"genius and talent\" and then \"poetry and prose\" in comparing Compton with Edrich.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He concluded by describing them as \"fitting adornments and exponents\" of cricket, itself a \"refreshment from worldly struggle\".<ref>''Wisden 1948'', pp. 45\u201347.</ref>\n\n==''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year==\nIn its 1948 edition, ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' announced that its five cricketers of the 1947 season were [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[Alan Melville]], [[Dudley Nourse]], [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] and [[Norman Yardley]].<ref name=WCY>''Wisden 1948'', pp. 55\u201366.</ref> As a rule, though it has occasionally been broken, ''Wisden'' never selects a player more than once.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153105.html |title=The first century, 1989 \u2013 Wisden's cricketers of the year| author=Anthony Bradbury |work=Wisden Almanack 1989 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Among players of 1947 who had been selected previously were [[Les Ames]] in 1929; [[Walter Robins]] in 1930; [[Bill Bowes]] in 1932; [[Bruce Mitchell (cricketer)|Bruce Mitchell]] in 1936; [[Tom Goddard]], [[Joe Hardstaff junior]] and [[Len Hutton]] in 1938; [[Denis Compton]] in 1939; [[Bill Edrich]] and [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] in 1940; [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] and [[Cyril Washbrook]] in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/209422.html |title=Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |work=Wisden Almanack |accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMartin Donnelly was rated by ''Wisden'' as \"the world's best present-day left-handed batsman\".<ref name=MD/> Although small in stature, Donnelly was noted for powerful stroke play using the drive, pull and cut shots.

It is chiefly remembered for the batting performances of [[Denis Compton]] and [[Bill Edrich]] who established seasonal records that, with the subsequent reduction in the number of [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches, will probably never be broken. Their form was key to their team [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] winning the [[County Championship]] for the first time since 1921, although they were involved in a tight contest for the title with the eventual runners-up [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], for whom [[Tom Goddard]] was the most outstanding bowler of the season. Compton and Edrich were assisted by the fact that it was the driest and sunniest English summer for a generation, ensuring plenty of good batting wickets.\n\nThe [[South African national cricket team|South Africans]], captained by [[Alan Melville]], toured the British Isles for the first time since 1935 and played a [[Test cricket|Test series]] of five matches against [[England cricket team|England]], who won the series 3\u20130 with two matches drawn, again largely thanks to the batting of Compton and Edrich. The South Africans enjoyed greater success in first-class matches against the English county teams, losing only one and winning eleven. Other notable fixtures played include [[The University Match (cricket)|the University Match]], [[Gentlemen v Players]] (twice) and [[North v South]] (three matches). The [[Minor Counties Championship]] was won by [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire II]], one of six first-class teams who entered their second elevens in the competition. Unusually, there were two [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tied matches]] in 1947, compared with two in the previous 21 years. [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] v [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] v [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] were the 20th and 21st tied matches in the history of first-class cricket worldwide since the earliest known instance in 1783.\n\nThe main source for information about the season is ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', in its 85th edition published in April 1948. This announced the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] for 1947: [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[Alan Melville]], [[Dudley Nourse]], [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] and [[Norman Yardley]]. 1947 was the first season to be reviewed by ''[[Playfair Cricket Annual]]'', which began publication in April 1948.\n\n==Background==\nThe main sources for the 1947 season are the 85th edition of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' and the inaugural edition of ''[[Playfair Cricket Annual]]'', both published in April 1948. The 1947 season was therefore the first to be reviewed by ''Playfair''.\n\nThe [[winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]] was harsh with heavy snowfalls disrupting communication and supply for about six weeks from January to March.

This was the first South African tour of England since 1935, the team captained by [[Alan Melville]] who had played in England for [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]. ''Wisden'' commented that despite their lack of success in the Test series, South Africa \"gave indication of real ability at all points of the game\" and \"little more experience is necessary to make them really powerful\" in international cricket.<ref name=\"Wisden82\"/> ''Playfair'' acclaimed the South Africans as a \"most popular team (who) enriched the game and set an excellent example\", the tour realising a profit of \u00a310,000.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 45.</ref>\n\nSouth Africa fared very well in their matches against the county clubs, winning eleven of the eighteen matches and losing only one, which was the opening match of the tour against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] by 39 runs. They lost to [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in May by 158 runs, but in September they had a convincing nine wicket win against the [[South of England cricket team|South]] who included [[Denis Compton]], [[Bill Edrich]] and [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]].<ref>''Playfair'', p. 62.</ref>\n\nThe outstanding South African players were the three best batsmen: Melville, [[Bruce Mitchell (cricketer)|Bruce Mitchell]] and [[Dudley Nourse]]. [[Ken Viljoen]] had a good tour and made six centuries but none in the Tests. The bowling was moderate as no one took more than 15 wickets in the series or averaged under forty. [[Athol Rowan]] with 102 was the only tourist to take a century of wickets in the season. The team badly lacked pace bowlers and included only two medium-fast seamers, [[Jack Plimsoll]] and [[Lindsay Tuckett]], the majority of bowlers being spinners: Rowan, [[Tufty Mann]], [[Ian Smith (South African cricketer)|Ian Smith]] and [[Leslie Payn]]. South Africa had three wicketkeepers in the party: [[Johnny Lindsay]], [[Douglas Ovenstone]] and [[George Fullerton (cricketer)|George Fullerton]]. [[Ossie Dawson]] was an all-rounder and the remaining batsmen were [[Denis Begbie]], [[Dennis Dyer]] and [[Tony Harris (cricketer)|Tony Harris]].

[[Wally Hammond]] captained the side in his final Test series. The other batsmen were [[Len Hutton]], [[Cyril Washbrook]], [[Denis Compton]], [[Bill Edrich]], [[James Langridge]], [[Laurie Fishlock]] and [[Joe Hardstaff junior]]. [[Jack Ikin]] and [[Norman Yardley]] were essentially all-rounders. [[Godfrey Evans]] and [[Paul Gibb]] were the wicketkeepers and the bowlers were [[Alec Bedser]], [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]], [[Dick Pollard]], [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] and [[Bill Voce]]. Gibb, Hardstaff, Hutton and Langridge did not play in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWith Hammond having retired from international cricket, Yardley was appointed captain for the home series against South Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In the first Test, England recalled [[Eric Hollies]] and selected three debutants: [[Sam Cook (Gloucestershire cricketer)|Sam Cook]], [[Tom Dollery]] and [[Jack Martin (cricketer)|Jack Martin]]. Hutton, Washbrook, Edrich, Compton, Evans and Bedser were retained from the winter tour and these six with Yardley were the mainstays of the England team in 1947. There were changes again for the second Test with [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]] replacing Dollery, [[George Pope (cricketer)|George Pope]] replacing Martin and Wright coming back in place of Cook. Bedser missed the third Test and was replaced by [[Cliff Gladwin]] while  [[Ken Cranston]] was brought in to replace Pope. In the fourth Test, [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]] was introduced in place of Hollies and [[Harold Butler (cricketer)|Harold Butler]] for Gladwin. Edrich missed the last Test, as again did Bedser, and there were yet more changes elsewhere with [[Dick Howorth]] coming in to replace Barnett and [[Bill Copson]] replacing Butler. [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] took Edrich's place. It all meant that, in a five-match series they won 3\u20130, England used 21 different players.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nWith so many players under consideration, it was difficult to predict who would go to the West Indies in the winter and that question became even more complex when several players decided not to go. Bedser, Compton, Edrich, Hutton, Wright and Yardley from the 1947 series all declined the tour before the squad was selected, as did [[Trevor Bailey]] who was in contention for a place.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With Yardley missing, MCC reappointed pre-war captain [[Gubby Allen]] to lead the party but he was the first in a spate of injuries when he damaged a leg muscle on the outward voyage.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Following further injuries to [[Dennis Brookes]] and [[Joe Hardstaff junior]], Allen asked MCC to send reinforcements and Hutton then changed his mind, flying out just in time to play against [[Guyana national cricket team|British Guiana]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOf the players who went to the West Indies, the only ones who had played against South Africa in the summer were Hutton, Evans, Cranston, Robertson, Howorth and Butler. Hardstaff and Ikin had been to Australia and New Zealand the previous winter. The other eight were Allen and seven newcomers: [[Dennis Brookes]], [[Billy Griffith]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Winston Place]], [[Gerald Smithson]], [[Maurice Tremlett]] and [[Johnny Wardle]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''Playfair'' was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series. The team, it said, \"could not be called great by any standards\" as it was too \"experimental\" but it at least seemed \"workmanlike\" and in Laker a new star had been discovered.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 11.</ref> ''Playfair'' ominously concluded its review by reference to the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|1948 Australian team]] being \"about to descend upon us well armed in all key departments (and) we shall have to do better than this\".<ref>''Playfair'', p. 13.</ref>\n\n==County Championship==\n[[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] won the [[County Championship]] under the captaincy of [[Walter Robins]], who stood down at the end of the season.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He was well supported by slow left-arm [[spin bowling|spinner]] [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]], who took 159 wickets in all matches; [[off break]] bowler [[Jim Sims]]; pace bowler [[Laurie Gray]]; [[wicketkeeper]] [[Leslie Compton]]; and their quartet of high-scoring batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Bill Edrich]], [[Syd Brown]] and [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The ''Wisden'' editorial drew attention to an additional feat by Middlesex in defeating \"[[Non-international England cricket teams|The Rest]]\" by nine wickets in the last match of the season at [[The Oval]]. Previously, only [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] (1905 and 1935) had beaten The Rest, the fixture having lapsed from 1936 to 1946.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Yorkshire had won the County Championship in 1946 but slipped to seventh place in 1947 and ''Wisden'' remarked on the retirement of \"several veterans\" after the 1946 season, although the highest innings score of the 1947 season, 270 [[not out]], was achieved by Yorkshire's [[Len Hutton]].<ref name=\"Wisden83\">''Wisden 1948'', p. 83.</ref>\n\n''Playfair'' described the championship as \"a great tussle\" between Middlesex and [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] that was not settled until 28 August when Middlesex won their penultimate match, defeating bottom team [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] at Lord's by 355 runs.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The key match, however, took place earlier in the month when Middlesex defeated Gloucestershire at Cheltenham by 68 runs. Middlesex had finished runners-up five times in succession: 1936 to 1939 and again in 1946. Since Middlesex's previous title in 1921, no southern team had won the championship and so their 1947 triumph ended 25 seasons of northern domination.<ref name=\"PF63\">''Playfair'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Gloucestershire v Middlesex, August 1947===\nThe Gloucestershire v Middlesex match at the [[College Ground, Cheltenham]] was the ultimate decider of a close-fought championship. It began on Saturday, 16 August on the same day as the fifth Test at The Oval and ''Playfair'' remarked that \"even the final Test seemed a matter of secondary importance\".<ref name=\"PF63\"/> There was no play on Sundays in 1947 and the match continued into Monday, 18 August, when it was concluded with Tuesday to spare.<ref name=\"CA18240\">[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18240.html CricketArchive \u2013 Gloucestershire v Middlesex 1947]. Retrieved 30 October 2013.</ref> Middlesex were without Compton and Robertson who were both playing for England but they did have Edrich, rested by England.<ref name=\"PF64\">''Playfair'', p. 64.</ref>\n\nMiddlesex won the toss and decided to bat, Brown and Edrich opening with a stand of 50 before Brown was out [[leg before wicket|lbw]] to the seamer [[Colin Scott (cricketer)|Colin Scott]]. Edrich went on to score 50 but, apart from some resistance by tailenders Sims and Young, Middlesex's batting collapsed as Gloucestershire's great [[off break|off spinner]] [[Tom Goddard]] took seven for 70. Middlesex were all out for 180 but Sims (six for 65) and Young (four for 55) turned the tables and bowled out Gloucestershire for 153. At close of play on Saturday, Middlesex had reached 9 for 1 in their second innings, Goddard having taken the key wicket of Edrich, so Monday's play began with Middlesex ahead by 36 and nine wickets standing. The decisive phase of the match was a third wicket partnership on Monday morning between [[Harry Sharp]] and the captain Robins. Scoring 46 and 45 respectively, they shared a stand of 70 runs which ''Playfair'' described as \"vital\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Otherwise, Middlesex again collapsed and Goddard took eight for 86 to complete an outstanding match analysis of fifteen for 156. So Gloucestershire with a day and a half remaining needed 169 to win. [[Jack Crapp]] tried to hold the innings together and scored 40 but Gloucestershire were rolled over for only 100 to lose by 68 runs. Young took five for 27 but an important role was again played by Sharp, this time as an off spinner, taking the wickets of three of Gloucestershire's top six batsmen, two of them without scoring. ''Playfair'' points out that Sharp at the time was still only a member of the Lord's ground staff but he played the key part in winning the match that ultimately settled the championship.<ref name=\"CA18240\"/><ref name=\"PF64\"/>\n\n===Season finale===\nGloucestershire had gone into the Cheltenham match with a lead of four points in the championship table and the immediate outcome was that Middlesex overtook them to lead by eight points, both teams having four matches still to be played. Middlesex had to play [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] away, \"always difficult to beat\", and three home matches against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and third-placed [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] whom ''Playfair'' termed \"the toughest nut to crack\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''Playfair'' considered Gloucestershire's programme to be easier as they faced four moderate teams: [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] at Cheltenham, [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] away, and [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] at [[County Cricket Ground, Bristol|Bristol]].<ref name=\"PF64\"/>\n\nThere was no change after the first two matches as Gloucestershire beat Glamorgan in two days and Middlesex won the difficult encounter at [[County Cricket Ground, Derby|Derby]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It all went wrong for Gloucestershire at [[Dean Park Cricket Ground|Dean Park]], [[Bournemouth]] where stubborn Hampshire batting forced a draw while Middlesex were defeating Surrey with some ease. This gave Middlesex a twenty-point lead and only two matches each to be played.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Middlesex's victory over the bottom team Northants settled it, especially as Gloucestershire surprisingly lost to Sussex by nine wickets.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Even so, there was a slight sting in the tail as Middlesex then lost their final match to a determined Lancashire by 64 runs while Gloucestershire rallied to defeat Essex.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The final table showed Middlesex winning by twenty points, on the face of it a handsome margin, but in reality it was a much closer contest than the figures would suggest.<ref name=\"PF64\"/>\n\n===Final table===\nThe seventeen first-class county teams played a total of 26 matches each. Twelve points were awarded for a win and six to each team if the result was a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]], as happened twice in 1947. Teams leading on first innings who subsequently drew or lost the match were awarded four points. Essex were awarded two points in one match they lost after a tie on first innings.<ref name=\"PF83\">''Playfair'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nThe final championship table was as follows:<ref

matches===\n[[Result (cricket)#Tie|Tied matches]] are a rarity in cricket and there had been only two County Championship ties in the previous 21 years. Essex and Somerset had tied in 1926,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/11/11905.html| title=Essex v Somerset 1926| publisher=CricketArchive}}</ref> then Worcestershire and Somerset in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17074.html| title=Worcestershire v Somerset 1939| publisher=CricketArchive}}</ref> In 1947, there were two tied matches: Essex v Northamptonshire and Hampshire v Lancashire. ''Playfair'' noted that these were the 20th and 21st tied matches in the history of first-class cricket worldwide since the earliest known instance in 1783.<ref name=\"PF111\">''Playfair'', p. 111.</ref>\n\nThe Essex v Northamptonshire match was played at [[Valentines Park]], [[Ilford]] 17 to 20 May. Northamptonshire won the toss and decided to bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by [[Vince Broderick]] while Essex's Test [[leg break]] and [[googly]] bowler [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener [[Chick Cray]] on 90 [[not out]]. He completed his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out. Northamptonshire were 219 for 5 at the close on Monday evening with their veteran batsman [[John Timms]] on 90 [[not out]]. Timms was out for 112 on Tuesday morning and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day. They had a good stand of 103 for the fourth wicket between [[Frank Vigar]] (60) and [[Len Clark]] (64) but spinners Broderick and [[Bertie Clarke]] kept picking up the wickets and Essex were still ten behind when the ninth went down. The last pair were captain [[Tom Pearce (cricketer)|Tom Pearce]] and wicketkeeper [[Tom Wade (cricketer)|Tom Wade]] who managed to level the scores before Wade was bowled by Clarke to tie the match.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18012.html CricketArchive \u2013 Essex v Northamptonshire 1947]. Retrieved 30 October 2013.</ref>\n\nHampshire v Lancashire was played at [[Dean Park Cricket Ground|Dean Park]], [[Bournemouth]] on 27 to 29 August. Hampshire batted first and scored 363, the innings continuing into the Thursday morning, [[Jim Bailey (cricketer)|Jim Bailey]] with 95 the top scorer. Lancashire captain [[Ken Cranston]] had taken four for 73 and he led the Lancashire reply with 155 [[not out]] before declaring the innings closed at 367 for 9. Hampshire safely negotiated the last few overs on Thursday evening to close on 18 for 0 before totalling 224 for 7 declared on Friday, Jim Bailey again the top scorer with 63. This was a sporting declaration by the Hampshire captain [[Desmond Eagar]] as there was time to bowl only 47 overs before the close. [[Cyril Washbrook]] led the chase with 105 while Jim Bailey, having twice starred with the bat, took six for 82. When the last over began, Lancashire had reached 220 for 8 with [[Jack Ikin]] and wicketkeeper [[Alfred Barlow]] batting, but this was the last wicket as [[William Roberts (cricketer, born 1914)|William Roberts]] had been taken to hospital with a broken finger and could not bat. Ikin and Barlow came together at 204 for 8 and so had added 16 for the final wicket to level the scores. Barlow was on strike and facing off spinner [[Gerry Hill]]. The first three balls produced no run and then Barlow was [[run out]] as he tried for a quick single to end the match in a tie.<ref name=\"PF111\"/><ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18265.html CricketArchive \u2013 Hampshire v Lancashire 1947]. Retrieved 30 October 2013.</ref>\n\n===Middlesex===\nAs ''Playfair'' put it, \"few will dispute that the best side won the championship\".<ref name=\"PF64\"/> Middlesex's first four batsmen \u2014 Robertson, Brown, Edrich and Compton \u2014 scored between them 12,193 runs in all first-class matches, a level of success unprecedented in county cricket.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The other batting positions were contested by [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]], who was heir-apparent to Robins as club captain and succeeded him in 1948; [[Alan Fairbairn]], a 1947 debutant who scored centuries in each of his first two county matches; [[Harry Sharp]] and [[Alec Thompson]]. The three main bowlers were Gray, Young and the veteran Sims. [[Ian Bedford]], aged seventeen, made his debut and took twelve wickets in his first two matches. Middlesex also made effective use as bowlers of Robins, Edrich and Denis Compton. ''Playfair'' noted the consistently high standard of the Middlesex fielding, especially by Brown, while Leslie Compton as wicket-keeper was a great success.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 84\u201385.</ref> Middlesex made exclusive use of [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in [[St John's Wood]], north [[London]], for their thirteen home matches.<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n\n===Gloucestershire===\nGloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of [[Wally Hammond]] but in [[Tom Goddard]] they had the best bowler in the country.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}} He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by [[Sam Cook (Gloucestershire cricketer)|Sam Cook]] who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with [[George Lambert (cricketer)|George Lambert]] largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]]. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain [[Basil Allen]], Barnett, [[Jack Crapp]], [[George Emmett]] and wicket-keeper [[Andy Wilson (cricketer)|Andy Wilson]]. ''Playfair'' recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. [[Ken Graveney]] made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and [[Tom Graveney|his brother Tom]] was waiting in the wings. Other players included [[Monty Cranfield]], [[Bev Lyon]], [[Clifford Monks]], [[William Neale]], [[Grahame Parker]], [[Colin Scott (cricketer)|Colin Scott]] and [[Alfred Wilcox (cricketer)|Alfred Wilcox]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nGloucestershire generally used their headquarters in [[Bristol]], playing nine of their fourteen home matches there. All the venues were:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[County Cricket Ground, Bristol|Ashley Down Ground]], [[Bristol]]\n* [[College Ground, Cheltenham]]\n* [[Wagon Works Ground]], [[Gloucester]]\n\n===Lancashire===\nLancashire finished third for the second season in succession. They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers [[Cyril Washbrook]] and [[Winston Place]] who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only [[Geoff Edrich]] performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, [[Jack Ikin]] and captain [[Ken Cranston]] scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman [[Dick Pollard]] who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer [[William Roberts (cricketer, born 1914)|William Roberts]] bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but ''Playfair'' remarked that he was short of Test class.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper [[Alfred Barlow]] and there were good reports of [[Alan Wharton]] who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Batsman [[Barry Howard (cricketer)|Barry Howard]] played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain [[Nigel Howard]], [[Tom Brierley]], [[Phil King (cricketer)|Phil King]] in his final season, future Test umpire [[Eddie Phillipson]], [[Eric Price (cricketer)|Eric Price]], and [[Gordon Garlick]] who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nLancashire played the majority of their home matches at their Old Trafford headquarters and played two matches elsewhere in the county:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Aigburth Cricket Ground, Liverpool]]\n* [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]], [[Manchester]]\n* [[Stanley Park, Blackpool]]\n\n===Kent===\nKent improved from seventh to fourth and were able to announce increased attendances and membership.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The team was again captained by [[Bryan Valentine]] and featured England stars [[Godfrey Evans]] and [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]], though they missed several championship matches for Test calls. Kent were particularly well served by their batsmen, although Valentine had problems with loss of form at times. [[Les Ames]], [[Les Todd]] and [[Arthur Fagg]] all scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. The young left-hander [[Peter Hearn]] was regarded as a fine prospect and was awarded his county cap. Wright was the main bowler and was supported by off spinner [[Ray Dovey]], all-rounder [[Jack Davies (cricketer)|Jack Davies]] and the two pacemen [[Fred Ridgway]] and [[Norman Harding (cricketer)|Norman Harding]]. Harding died unexpectedly in September, aged 31.<ref>''Wisden 1948 \u2013 obituary'', p. 783.</ref> Other players included [[Geoffrey Anson]], [[Brian Edrich]], the veteran [[Hopper Levett]] in his final season, [[Tony Mallett]], future captain [[Bill Murray-Wood]] and [[Tony Pawson (cricketer)|Tony Pawson]]. A curious case was pace bowler [[Jack Martin (cricketer)|Jack Martin]], who played for Kent only twice in 1947 and yet was selected to play for England in the [[Trent Bridge]] Test.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 89\u201390.</ref>\n\nKent's policy was to play home matches throughout the county and they used seven venues:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Bat and Ball Ground]], [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]]\n* [[Crabble Athletic Ground]], [[Dover]]\n* [[Garrison Ground 2]], [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]]\n* [[Mote Park]], [[Maidstone]]\n* [[St Lawrence Ground]], [[Canterbury]]\n* [[Nevill Ground]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]]\n* [[Rectory Field]], [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]\n\n===Derbyshire===\n{{Main|Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1947}}\nDerbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen [[Bill Copson]], [[Cliff Gladwin]] and [[George Pope (cricketer)|George Pope]] all playing for England. [[Dusty Rhodes (cricketer)|Dusty Rhodes]], bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer [[Eric Marsh]] provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by [[Edward Gothard]], played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to [[Stan Worthington]], in his final season, and [[Denis Smith (cricketer)|Denis Smith]]. [[Charlie Elliott]] and [[Arnold Townsend]] topped 1,000 runs but ''Playfair'' noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[John Eggar]], who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until [[George Dawkes]], formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Another notable debutant was fast bowler [[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]]. Other players included [[Albert Alderman]], 55-year-old [[Harry Elliott (English cricketer)|Harry Elliott]] in his final season, [[Alan Revill]] and [[Pat Vaulkhard]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nMost of Derbyshire's home matches were played at one of their two main venues in [[Derby]] and [[Chesterfield]] but they occasionally played elsewhere. The five venues used were:<ref name=\"CCML\">[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/0/County_Championship_1947.html CricketArchive \u2013 County Championship Match List]. Retrieved 15 November 2013.</ref>\n* [[County Ground, Derby]]\n* [[Queen's Park, Chesterfield]]\n* [[Abbeydale Park]], [[Dore]]\n* [[Rutland Recreation Ground, Ilkeston]]\n* [[Park Road, Buxton]]\n\n===Surrey===\nSurrey showed improvements on 1946 but ''Playfair'' remarked on \"the need for new blood\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Having said that, the arrival of [[Jim Laker]] certainly resolved any problems in spin bowling and his future partner [[Tony Lock]] was already making progress at second eleven level. Another good start was made by opening batsman [[David Fletcher (cricketer)|David Fletcher]] who was awarded his county cap with Laker and [[Eric Bedser]]. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain [[Errol Holmes]], [[Tom Barling]], [[John Parker (cricketer, born 1913)|John Parker]] and [[Stan Squires]]. [[Laurie Fishlock]] had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]] played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were [[Alec Bedser]], Jim Laker and the retiring [[Alf Gover]], who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer [[Eddie Watts]] could make only a few appearances due to injury. [[Geoffrey Whittaker]] made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays [[Bernie Constable]] and [[Stuart Surridge]] also played.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 92\u201394.</ref>\n\nSurrey played twelve of their thirteen home matches at [[The Oval]] and one in [[Guildford]]. Two first-class matches not involving the Surrey XI were played in [[Kingston-upon-Thames]]. All venues:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[The Oval]], [[Kennington]], south [[London]]\n* [[Sports Ground, Woodbridge Road, Guildford|Woodbridge Road]], [[Guildford]]\n* [[Hawker's Sports Ground|Leyland Motors Ground]], [[Kingston-upon-Thames]]\n\n===Worcestershire===\nFollowing the emigration of [[Sandy Singleton]] to [[Rhodesia]] after the 1946 season, [[Allan White]] succeeded him as Worcestershire captain.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The team lacked batting strength and did well to improve their championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder [[Dick Howorth]] who was, as in 1946, the first player to complete the [[double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with [[Peter Jackson (cricketer)|Peter Jackson]] who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player [[Roly Jenkins]] made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman [[Reg Perks]] took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper [[Hugo Yarnold]] who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, [[Eddie Cooper (cricketer)|Eddie Cooper]] and, in his first full season, [[Don Kenyon]] all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were [[Charles Palmer (cricketer)|Charles Palmer]] and the veteran [[Bob Wyatt]] and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. [[Laddie Outschoorn]] qualified for the championship for the first time and showed promise. Other players included [[Ronald Bird]], [[Fred Cooper (cricketer, born 1921)|Fred Cooper]] (brother of Eddie), [[Norman Whiting]] and [[Martin Young (cricketer)|Martin Young]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nWorcestershire played nine of their thirteen home matches at their County Ground headquarters in [[Worcester]] and used five venues in all:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Chester Road North Ground, Kidderminster]]\n* [[New Road, Worcester]]\n* [[Tipton Road]], [[Dudley]]\n* [[War Memorial Athletic Ground|War Memorial Ground]], [[Amblecote]]\n* [[Racecourse Ground, Hereford]]\n\n===Yorkshire===\nYorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper [[Don Brennan (cricketer)|Don Brennan]], batsmen [[Willie Watson (England cricketer)|Willie Watson]] and [[Gerald Smithson]], fast bowler [[Alec Coxon]] and left arm spinner [[Johnny Wardle]]. In addition, future stalwart [[Ted Lester]] began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] made a few appearances. [[Brian Sellers]] captained the team for the final time before handing over to [[Norman Yardley]] for the 1948 season. [[Bill Bowes]] in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He was supported by Wardle, off spinner [[Ellis Robinson]], seamer [[Frank Smailes]] and new pace bowlers Coxon and [[Ron Aspinall]]. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer [[Arthur Booth (cricketer, born 1902)|Arthur Booth]], who had been their outstanding player in 1946.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 82.</ref> The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great [[Len Hutton]] who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other players included [[Harry Crick]], [[Harry Halliday]], [[Freddie Jakeman]], [[Geoffrey Keighley]] and pace bowler [[John Whitehead (cricketer)|John Whitehead]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 95\u201397.</ref>\n\nYorkshire used seven venues in various parts of the county:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]]\n* [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield]]\n* [[Headingley Cricket Ground]], [[Leeds]]\n* [[North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough]]\n* [[Park Avenue (stadium)|Park Avenue]], [[Bradford]]\n* [[St George's Road Cricket Ground, Harrogate]]\n* [[The Circle, Kingston upon Hull]]\n\n===Glamorgan===\nGlamorgan never had a settled team and there were a number of new arrivals at the end of the season including [[Gilbert Parkhouse]], [[Jim Eaglestone]], [[Norman Hever]] and [[Phil Clift]]. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler [[Peter Judge (cricketer)|Peter Judge]] was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain [[Wilf Wooller]] had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with [[Len Muncer]] and the veteran [[Johnnie Clay]] bowling off breaks and opening batsman [[Emrys Davies]] helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with [[Arnold Dyson]], both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player [[Allan Watkins]] exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by [[Wat Jones]] and [[George Lavis]]. The main wicketkeeper was [[Haydn Davies (cricketer)|Haydn Davies]] who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran [[Austin Matthews]] in his final season, [[Jim Pleass]], [[Arthur Porter (cricketer)|Arthur Porter]] and [[Maurice Robinson (cricketer)|Maurice Robinson]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 97\u201398.</ref>\n\nMost of Glamorgan' home matches were played at one of their two main venues in [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]] but they occasionally played elsewhere. The four venues used were:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Cardiff Arms Park]], [[Cardiff]]\n* [[Eugene Cross Park]], [[Ebbw Vale]]\n* [[Rodney Parade]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]\n* [[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|St Helen's Cricket Ground]], [[Swansea]]\n\n===Sussex===\n''Playfair'' emphasised the contrast between strong batting and weak bowling at Sussex who recovered from bottom place in 1946 to finish a creditable equal ninth.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Only [[Jim Cornford]] performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: [[John Langridge]], [[George Cox junior|George Cox]] and [[Harry Parks (cricketer)|Harry Parks]]. [[James Langridge]] reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to [[appendicitis]]. [[Charles Oakes (cricketer)|Charles Oakes]] and new captain [[Hugh Bartlett]] were the other two. His predecessor turned club secretary [[Billy Griffith]] had a poor season with the bat but kept wicket well enough to be selected for England's winter tour.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other players who appeared were [[Paul Carey (cricketer)|Paul Carey]], [[Donald Smith (cricketer, born 1923)|Donald Smith]], [[Jim Wood (Sussex cricketer)|Jim Wood]], [[Jack Oakes (cricketer)|Jack Oakes]], [[John Nye (cricketer)|John Nye]] and two future Test players [[Alan Oakman]] and [[David Sheppard]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\nSussex generally played home matches at their County Ground headquarters in [[Hove]] and used five venues in all:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[Central Recreation Ground, Hastings]]\n* [[Priory Park, Chichester]]\n* [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]]\n* [[Horsham Cricket Club|Cricketfield Road Ground]], [[Horsham]]\n* [[The Saffrons]], [[Eastbourne]]\n\n===Essex===\nEssex matches were noted for high scores as Essex themselves scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Their two outstanding players were the cousins [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter]] and [[Ray Smith (cricketer)|Ray Smith]] who both completed the [[double (cricket)|double]]. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect [[Trevor Bailey]] was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder [[Frank Vigar]] took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain [[Tom Pearce (cricketer)|Tom Pearce]], [[Chick Cray]], [[Dickie Dodds]] and [[Doug Insole]]. Wicketkeeper [[Tom Wade (cricketer)|Tom Wade]] had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped. Essex were also represented by [[Bill Dines]], [[Bill Morris (cricketer)|Bill Morris]], [[Denys Wilcox]], [[Dick Horsfall]], [[Frank Rist]], [[Harry Crabtree]], [[Len Clark]] and [[Sonny Avery]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 100\u2013102.</ref>\n\nEssex continued their policy of playing matches throughout the county and home venues used in 1947 were:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n*[[Castle Park Cricket Ground]], [[Colchester]]\n*[[Chalkwell Park]], [[Westcliff-on-Sea]]\n*[[County Ground, Chelmsford]]\n*[[Old County Ground, Brentwood]]\n*[[Southchurch Park]], [[Southend-on-Sea]]\n*[[Valentine's Park]], [[Ilford]]\n*[[Vista Road Recreation Ground]], [[Clacton-on-Sea]]\n\n===Nottinghamshire===\nNottinghamshire, captained for the first time by [[William Sime]], drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost [[Bill Voce]] early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers [[Arthur Jepson]] and [[Harold Butler (cricketer)|Harold Butler]]. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer [[Harry Winrow]] who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's [[Joe Hardstaff junior]] who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. [[Walter Keeton]], [[Reg Simpson]] and [[Tom Reddick]] all topped 1,000 runs while [[Charles Harris (cricketer)|Charles Harris]] was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper [[Eric Meads]] claimed 52 victims in championship matches. [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] captain [[Guy Willatt]] batted well when available and young [[Peter Harvey (cricketer, born 1923)|Peter Harvey]], leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but [[Frederick Stocks junior|Freddie Stocks]] did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at [[Trent Bridge]] in [[Nottingham]] for their thirteen home matches.<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n\n===Somerset===\nSomerset were captained for the only time by educator [[Jack Meyer (educator and cricketer)|Jack Meyer]] but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only [[Harold Gimblett]] reliable through the season. [[Michael Walford]] played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and ''Playfair'' called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The main bowler was veteran [[Arthur Wellard]] who was supported by all-rounders [[Bertie Buse]] and [[Johnny Lawrence]], slow left armer [[Horace Hazell]], captain Meyer and new pace bowler [[Maurice Tremlett]].

In [[Les Berry]], they had the only professional{{clarify |date=August 2016 |reason=what is significance of this?}} captain in the County Championship.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, [[Vic Jackson]], [[Gerry Lester]], [[Francis Prentice]], [[Maurice Tompkin]] and [[George Watson (cricketer, born 1907)|George Watson]] all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder [[Anthony Riddington]] scored over 800. Wicketkeeper [[Percy Corrall]] claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was [[Jack Walsh (cricketer)|Jack Walsh]], a great exponent of the \"[[Left-arm unorthodox spin|chinaman]]\", who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran [[James Sperry]] bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler.

Despite their lack of success, they attracted large crowds to [[Edgbaston]]. Their best players were Test spinner [[Eric Hollies]] and batsman [[Tom Dollery]], who was to become captain as a professional in 1948, though Dollery had a relatively poor season in 1947. Warwickshire were well served by their bowlers. In addition to Hollies, these were three new caps in the two seamers [[Victor Cannings]] and [[Charles Grove]]; and the New Zealand pace bowler [[Tom Pritchard]]. Dollery had to play as wicketkeeper in several matches when [[Cyril Goodway]] was unavailable. ''Playfair'' commented on advantages gained by the bowlers being \"squandered\" by inconsistent and unreliable batsmen. Five batsmen did exceed 1,000 runs but none had a good average: Cranmer, Dollery, [[Aubrey Hill (cricketer)|Aubrey Hill]], [[Jimmy Ord]] and [[Ken Taylor (cricketer, born 1916)|Ken Taylor]].

The batting was occasionally good and top of the county's averages was wicketkeeper [[Neil McCorkell]] who scored 1,539 championship runs and claimed 49 victims. [[Neville Rogers]] and [[Johnny Arnold]] played some good innings to both comfortably exceed 1,000 runs. Eagar and [[Gerry Hill]] both reached 1,000 with low averages and the all-rounder [[Jim Bailey (cricketer)|Jim Bailey]], who took 53 wickets, fell just short of 1,000 runs. ''Playfair'' considered \"the steady and loyal [[George Heath (cricketer)|George Heath]]\" to be the best of the bowlers who included Bailey, Hill, [[Victor Ransom]], [[Lofty Herman]] and the injury-plagued [[Charles Knott]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other players included [[Gilbert Dawson]], [[Thomas Dean]], [[Arthur Holt (sportsman)|Arthur Holt]], [[Alan Shirreff]] and future stalwart [[Leo Harrison]].<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 110\u2013111.</ref>\n\nHampshire's home matches were shared between three venues:<ref name=\"CCML\"/>\n* [[County Ground, Southampton]]\n* [[Dean Park Cricket Ground]], [[Bournemouth]]\n* [[United Services Recreation Ground]], [[Portsmouth]]\n\n===Northamptonshire===\nNorthamptonshire slipped from sixteenth to bottom and were captained by [[Arthur Childs-Clarke]].

[[Vince Broderick]] put in a sound all-round effort with 860 runs and 87 wickets while the best bowler was West Indian Test player [[Bertie Clarke]] with 89 wickets. The attack was hampered by injuries to [[Nobby Clark (cricketer)|Nobby Clark]] who did not play often. Wicketkeeper [[Kenneth Fiddling]] claimed 40 victims.

MCC won by 163 runs. The MCC team in batting order was [[Dennis Brookes]] (Northamptonshire), [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] (Middlesex), [[Bob Wyatt]] (Worcestershire), [[Denis Compton]] (Middlesex), [[Bryan Valentine]] (Kent, captain), [[Leslie Compton]] (Middlesex, wicketkeeper), [[Wilf Wooller]] (Glamorgan), [[Haydn Davies (cricketer)|Haydn Davies]] (Glamorgan), [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]] (Middlesex), [[Rowland Shaddick]] (Middlesex) and [[Jack Martin (cricketer)|Jack Martin]] (Kent). MCC won the toss and chose to bat first but were bowled out in 57 overs for 134, Denis Compton making 73. Yorkshire got off to a very bad start when [[Len Hutton]] was dismissed by Jack Martin for nought. This began an outstanding spell for Martin who finished with six for 23 from 12.1 overs as Yorkshire collapsed to 81 all out. At close of play on the Saturday, MCC were 67 for one with Jack Robertson 36 [[not out]]. On the Monday, Robertson built a big innings and scored 164 of a declared total of 343 for 9. Yorkshire's hopes slumped when Hutton was again dismissed cheaply and at close of play they were 69 for two. [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] tried his best and scored 74, which was his highest career score to date, but Jack Young was in fine form and took six for 85 to win the match for MCC.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/17/17990.html CricketArchive \u2013 MCC v Yorkshire 1947].

The Gentlemen slumped to 25 for five as wickets fell to [[Cliff Gladwin]] and [[Harold Butler (cricketer)|Harold Butler]] but were rescued by [[Norman Yardley]] and [[Ken Cranston]], rain ensuring that the result was a draw. The Gentlemen were led by England captain [[Norman Yardley]] and selected three Oxford University players \u2014 Donnelly, [[Tony Pawson (cricketer)|Tony Pawson]] and [[Tony Mallett]] \u2014 and two from Cambridge University: [[Guy Willatt]] and [[Trevor Bailey]]. The team included current England players Edrich and Cranston while [[Billy Griffith]] kept wicket. [[Reg Simpson]] made his first appearance in the fixture but could only score 4 and 0. The Players were captained by [[Les Ames]] who played as a batsman, [[Godfrey Evans]] keeping wicket. Washbrook opened with [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]], the other batsmen being [[Denis Compton]], [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]] and Fletcher.

[[Denys Wilcox]] opened the innings and did well with scores of 25 and 57 while skipper Yardley made 35 and 23, but Edrich and Donnelly did not contribute many against a strong Players attack, particularly [[Dick Howorth]] who took four wickets in each innings. The Players had three England pace bowlers: Butler, [[Alec Bedser]] and [[Dick Pollard]]. Howorth top-scored for the Players too, with 80, and captain [[Len Hutton]] scored 64.<ref name=\"CA18287\"/>\n\n===[[North v South]]===\nThere were three [[North v South]] matches in 1947, involving largely makeshift teams, and ''Playfair'' did not bother to report on them.

Middlesex won by 9 wickets. The Rest was a very strong team entirely consisting of players who had played or would play for England at Test level. In batting order, they were [[Cyril Washbrook]], [[Winston Place]], [[Dick Howorth]], [[George Emmett]], [[Norman Yardley]] (captain), [[Ken Cranston]], [[Godfrey Evans]] (wicketkeeper), [[Alec Bedser]], [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]], [[Tom Goddard]] and [[Harold Butler (cricketer)|Harold Butler]]. Middlesex won the toss and decided to bat first but were soon reduced to 8 for two as Bedser dismissed both openers [[Syd Brown]] and [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]]. [[Bill Edrich]] and [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]] took the score on to 53 for three when Mann, who had scored 33, was stumped by Evans off Wright. This brought Edrich and [[Denis Compton]] together. In keeping with their form throughout the season, they amassed 426 runs between them and enabled skipper [[Walter Robins]] to declare at 543 for nine. Edrich made 180 which was just enough for him to surpass [[Tom Hayward]]'s old record season aggregate, which Compton had already beaten. Compton retired hurt when he had scored 55 and the total was 191 for three. He returned with his knee strapped when the score was 274 for four and, despite his injury, he went on to make 246, his highest score of the season. Robins made 33 while Compton was off the field but the tailenders did not score many. The Rest were bowled out for 246 and followed on. They made 317 in their second innings, leaving Middlesex to win the match with 21 for one.<ref>''Playfair'', p. 114.</ref><ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/18/18288.html CricketArchive \u2013 The Rest v Middlesex 1947].

Teams played each other irregularly and a league table was compiled on the basis of average points per match played. A win was worth ten points with lesser awards given in certain specific circumstances. All teams played at least eight matches, the most being fourteen by [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire II]].

It is improbable that the records achieved by Compton of most runs and most centuries in a season will ever be broken, especially since the reduction in first-class matches which began in 1969. What will be remembered is not the statistics but the style because Compton and Edrich scored quickly and played attacking cricket.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n''Playfair'' described Compton as \"a genius\" who was brilliant at improvisation; Edrich on the other hand was \"not a genius but a wonderfully efficient batsman\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Both men were hampered by injuries. Compton had a bad knee caused by a piece of chipped bone which was removed after the season ended. Edrich suffered a pulled shoulder muscle in early August which impeded his batting and prevented him from bowling again. When the season began in May, Edrich scored a century in his first innings and followed up with two more, including a score of 225, before the end of the month. Compton did not score his first century until his eleventh innings. Edrich scored 1,047 runs in the calendar month of July and Compton 1,039 runs in August. Edrich's highest score was 267 not out for Middlesex against Northamptonshire and Compton's was 246 for Middlesex against The Rest.<ref>''Playfair'', pp. 115\u2013122.</ref>\n\n''Wisden'' published an appreciation of Compton and Edrich written by [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow]] who began by opining that \"they go together in English cricket as [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] go together in English opera\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Robertson-Glasgow made further comparisons, strictly cricket ones this time, with [[Jack Hobbs]] and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] for England and with [[Don Bradman]] and [[Bill Ponsford]] for Australia. However, he tempered his praise by pointing out that Compton and Edrich had yet to \"quell the fiercest Test attack\" as, although they had dominated the South African bowling in 1947, Australia remained another matter with \"fulfilment awaited\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} While ''Playfair'' spoke of \"brilliance and efficiency\", Robertson-Glasgow eulogised about \"genius and talent\" and then \"poetry and prose\" in comparing Compton with Edrich.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He concluded by describing them as \"fitting adornments and exponents\" of cricket, itself a \"refreshment from worldly struggle\".<ref>''Wisden 1948'', pp. 45\u201347.</ref>\n\n==''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year==\nIn its 1948 edition, ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' announced that its five cricketers of the 1947 season were [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[Alan Melville]], [[Dudley Nourse]], [[Jack Robertson (English cricketer)|Jack Robertson]] and [[Norman Yardley]].<ref name=WCY>''Wisden 1948'', pp. 55\u201366.</ref> As a rule, though it has occasionally been broken, ''Wisden'' never selects a player more than once.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153105.html |title=The first century, 1989 \u2013 Wisden's cricketers of the year| author=Anthony Bradbury |work=Wisden Almanack 1989 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Among players of 1947 who had been selected previously were [[Les Ames]] in 1929; [[Walter Robins]] in 1930; [[Bill Bowes]] in 1932; [[Bruce Mitchell (cricketer)|Bruce Mitchell]] in 1936; [[Tom Goddard]], [[Joe Hardstaff junior]] and [[Len Hutton]] in 1938; [[Denis Compton]] in 1939; [[Bill Edrich]] and [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] in 1940; [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] and [[Cyril Washbrook]] in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/209422.html |title=Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |work=Wisden Almanack |accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMartin Donnelly was rated by ''Wisden'' as \"the world's best present-day left-handed batsman\".<ref name=MD/> Although small in stature, Donnelly was noted for powerful stroke play using the drive, pull and cut shots.
