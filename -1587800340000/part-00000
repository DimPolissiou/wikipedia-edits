In 685, Ecgfrith further granted Biscop the land adjacent to the monastery on the south side of the river. As the river separated this land from the monastic community, it was henceforth referred to as the \"sunder-land\", and would grow as a fishing settlement before being granted a charter in 1179.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://englandsnortheast.co.uk/Sunderland.html|title=Old Sunderland History|website=englandsnortheast.co.uk|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref> West of the medieval village of Sunderland on the south bank, [[Bishopwearmouth]] was founded in 930.\n\nSunderland grew as a port, trading [[coal]] and [[salt]]. Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century. By the 19th century, the port of Sunderland had absorbed Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth, owing to the growing economic importance of the shipbuilding docks. Following the decline of the city's traditional industries in the late 20th century, the area grew into a commercial centre for the automotive industry, science and technology and the service sector.\n\n[[Bede]], sometimes called the father of English history, began his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery in Sunderland, before moving to the newly founded Jarrow monastery in 685 (these monasteries together formed the dual [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]]). It therefore seems likely that he was born in or near Sunderland.

To the west of the city, the [[Hylton Viaduct]] carries the [[A19 road|A19]] dual-carriageway over the Wear (see map below).\n\nMost of the suburbs of Sunderland are situated towards the west of the city centre with 70% of its population living on the south side of the river and 30% on the north side. The city extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope in the south and [[Seaburn]] in the north.\n\n===Suburbs===\nSome, mainly local authority-built, Sunderland suburbs have most streets beginning with the same letter:\n* '''A''': [[Farringdon, Sunderland|Farringdon]]\n* '''B''': [[Town End Farm]] and [[Barnes, Sunderland|Barnes]]\n* '''C''': [[Hylton Castle (suburb)|Hylton Castle]]\n* '''D''': Dykelands Road area of [[Seaburn]]\n* '''E''': [[Carley Hill]]\n* '''F''': [[Ford Estate]]\n* '''G''': [[Grindon, Sunderland|Grindon]]\n* '''H''': [[Hylton Lane]] / [[Havelock, Tyne and Wear|Havelock]] / Humbledon\n* '''J''': [[John Street, Sunderland]]\n* '''K''': [[Downhill, Sunderland|Downhill]]\n* '''M''': [[Moorside, Sunderland|Moorside]] and [[Millfield, Tyne and Wear]]\n* '''P''': [[Pennywell]] and [[Plains Farm]] and [[Pallion]]\n* '''R''': [[Redhouse, Sunderland|Red House]]\n* '''S''': [[Springwell, Sunderland|Springwell]], [[Southwick, Sunderland|Southwick]]\n* '''T''': [[Thorney Close]]\n* '''W''': [[Witherwack]]\n\nIn Marley Pots, the streets are all associated with trees, e.g. Maplewood, Elmwood etc.\nIn Millfield, the streets are all associated with plants, e.g. Chester, Fern, Rose, Hyacinth etc.\n\n===Definitions of Sunderland===\nThere are two definitions for Sunderland. The smaller Urban Subdivision follows the boundaries of what is considered the city itself, however, the USD alone has not been given city status. The larger metropolitan borough contains other settlements with a separate identity such as [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], but has been given official city status, with all individual settlements being the responsibility of Sunderland city council.\n\n===Green belt===\n{{main|North East Green Belt}}\nThe town is bounded by the Tyne & Wear Green Belt,<ref name=\"sunderland-belt\">{{cite web|title=GREEN BELT REVIEW STAGE 1 \u2013 CORE STRATEGY GROWTH OPTIONS STAGE, MARCH 2016 |url=https://www.sunderland.gov.uk/media/18571/SD43-Sunderland-Green-Belt-Review-Stage-1-Core-Strategy-Growth-Options-Stge-March-2016-/pdf/SD43_Sunderland_Green_Belt_Review_Stage_1_-_Core_Strategy_Growth_Options_Stage_March_2016.pdf|website=www.sunderland.gov.uk}}</ref> with its portion in much of its surrounding rural area of the borough. It is a part of the local [[development plan]], of which its stated aims<ref name=\"sunderland-belt\"/> are as follows:\n\n''A Green Belt will be maintained which will:-''\n\n''(i) Check the unrestricted sprawl of the built up area of Sunderland;''<br/>\n''(ii) Assist in safeguarding the city\u2019s countryside from further encroachment;''<br/>\n''(iii) Assist in the regeneration of the urban area of the city;''<br/>\n''(iv) Preserve the setting and special character of Springwell Village;''<br/>\n''(iv) Prevent the merging of Sunderland with Tyneside, Washington, Houghton-le-Spring and Seaham, and the merging of Shiney Row with Washington, Chester-le-Street and Bournmoor.''\n\nIn the Sunderland borough boundary, as well as the aforementioned areas, landscape features and facilities such as much of the River Don and Wear basins, the George Washington Hotel Golf and Spa complex, Sharpley Golf Course, Herrington Country Park, Houghton Quarry and Penshaw Hill are within the green belt area.\n\n==Climate==\nSunderland has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').  Its location in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Pennines]], as well as other mountain ranges to the west, such as those of the [[Lake District]] and southwestern Scotland, make Sunderland one of the least rainy cities of Northern England. The climate is heavily moderated by the adjacent [[North Sea]], giving it cool summers, and winters that are mild considering its latitude. The closest weather station is in [[Tynemouth]], about {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of Sunderland. As a result, Sunderland's coastline is likely slightly milder given the more southerly position. Another relatively nearby weather station in [[Durham, England#Climate|Durham]] has warmer summer days and colder winter nights courtesy of its inland position.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Tynemouth, 1981\u20132010\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 7.2\n| Feb high C = 7.3\n| Mar high C = 9.0\n| Apr high C = 10.3\n| May high C = 12.7\n| Jun high C = 15.6\n| Jul high C = 18.1\n| Aug high C = 18.1\n| Sep high C = 16.1\n| Oct high C = 13.2\n| Nov high C = 9.7\n| Dec high C = 7.4\n|year high C = 12.1\n| Jan low C = 2.2\n| Feb low C = 2.2\n| Mar low C = 3.3\n| Apr low C = 4.8\n| May low C = 7.2\n| Jun low C = 10.0\n| Jul low C = 12.3\n| Aug low C = 12.3\n| Sep low C = 10.4\n| Oct low C = 7.7\n| Nov low C = 4.9\n| Dec low C = 2.5\n|year low C = 6.7\n| Jan precipitation mm = 45.5\n| Feb precipitation mm = 37.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 43.9\n| Apr precipitation mm = 45.4\n| May precipitation mm = 43.2\n| Jun precipitation mm = 51.9\n| Jul precipitation mm = 47.6\n| Aug precipitation mm = 59.6\n| Sep precipitation mm = 53.0\n| Oct precipitation mm = 53.6\n| Nov precipitation mm = 62.8\n| Dec precipitation mm = 52.9\n|year precipitation mm = 597.2\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 9.8\n| Feb precipitation days = 7.6\n| Mar precipitation days = 8.7\n| Apr precipitation days = 8.2\n| May precipitation days = 8.3\n| Jun precipitation days = 8.7\n| Jul precipitation days = 8.6\n| Aug precipitation days = 9.2\n| Sep precipitation days = 8.1\n| Oct precipitation days = 10.7\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.6\n| Dec precipitation days = 10.1\n|year precipitation days = 109.5\n| Jan sun = 61.1\n| Feb sun = 81.6\n| Mar sun = 117.7\n| Apr sun = 149.9\n| May sun = 191.7\n| Jun sun = 183.0\n| Jul sun = 185.7\n| Aug sun = 174.9\n| Sep sun = 141.1\n| Oct sun = 106.2\n| Nov sun = 70.4\n| Dec sun = 51.9\n|year sun = 1515.0\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcz02e3x2| title = Sunderland climate information | accessdate =23 December 2017|publisher = [[Met Office]]}}</ref>\n|date=August 2015\n}}\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"toc\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; border-collapse:collapse; margin-left:10pt;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Population of Sunderland urban area<br /> by ward'''<ref>{{cite web|title=2001 Census \u2013 Fact Cards for wards in the City of Sunderland|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/theCity/Key-Statistics-Environment/Census/wardmap.asp|work=Sunderland city Council|accessdate=26 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201455/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/theCity/Key-Statistics-Environment/Census/wardmap.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}</ref>\n|-\n||'''Ward'''||align=right|'''Population'''\n|-\n||Castle||align=right|11,292\n|-\n||Fulwell||align=right|12,906\n|-\n||Redhill||align=right|11,867\n|-\n||St Peter's||align=right|11,760\n|-\n||Southwick||align=right|11,634\n|-\n||'''Northside total:'''||align=right|'''59,459'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n|-\n||Barnes||align=right|12,030\n|-\n||Doxford||align=right|11,318\n|-\n||Hendon||align=right|11,551\n|-\n||Millfield||align=right|10,277\n|-\n||Pallion||align=right|10,385\n|-\n||Ryhope||align=right|11,217\n|-\n||St Anne's||align=right|11,409\n|-\n||St Chad's||align=right|10,922\n|-\n||St Michael's||align=right|11,626\n|-\n||Sandhill||align=right|11,319\n|-\n||Silksworth||align=right|11,245\n|-\n||'''Southside total:'''||align=right|'''123,299'''\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n|-\n||'''City total:'''||align=right|'''182,758'''\n|}\n\nAt 3,874 [[hectares]], Sunderland is the 45th largest {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} urban area in England by measure of area, with a population density of 45.88 people per hectare.\n\nAccording to statistics<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunderland 2001 Census Statistics|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/theCity/Key-Statistics-Environment/Census/dfc-sunderland.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2007|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070711002534/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/Public/Editable/Themes/theCity/Key-Statistics-Environment/Census/dfc-sunderland.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 11 July 2007}}</ref> based on the 2001 census, 60% of homes in the Sunderland [[metropolitan area]] are [[Owner Occupied|owner occupied]], with an average household size of 2.4 people.

In 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the county borough was abolished and its area combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear. In 1986, [[Tyne and Wear County Council]] was abolished, and Sunderland became a [[unitary authority]], once again independent from county council control. The metropolitan borough was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] after winning a competition in 1992 to celebrate the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen's]] 40th year on the throne.

For instance, the [[Northumbria Police]] covers the five (now independent) boroughs of Tyne and Wear, plus the neighbouring county of [[Northumberland]]. The [[Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service]] covers the five boroughs only.\n\nSince 2014, the [[City of Sunderland]] has been a member of the [[North East Combined Authority]], which is an alliance of the five former boroughs of [[Tyne and Wear]] and the neighbouring counties of [[Northumberland]] and [[County Durham]]. However, Sunderland is still a unitary authority; [[combined authority|combined authorities]] are voluntary alliances, in which local authorities agree to pool certain responsibilities and receive delegated functions from central government.

This road was the route of the old A19, now it is the A1018.]]\nMuch of the city is located on a low range of hills running parallel to the coast. On average, it is around 80 metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Sunderland is divided by the River Wear which passes through the middle of the city in a deeply incised valley, part of which is known as the Hylton gorge. The three road bridges connecting the north and south portions of the city are the [[Queen Alexandra Bridge]] at Pallion, the [[Wearmouth Bridge]] just to the north of the city centre and most recently the [[Northern Spire Bridge]] between Castletown and Pallion. To the west of the city, the [[Hylton Viaduct]] carries the [[A19 road|A19]] dual-carriageway over the Wear (see map below).\n\nMost of the suburbs of Sunderland are situated towards the west of the city centre with 70% of its population living on the south side of the river and 30% on the north side. The city extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope in the south and [[Seaburn]] in the north.\n\n===Suburbs===\nSome, mainly local authority-built, Sunderland suburbs have most streets beginning with the same letter:\n* '''A''': [[Farringdon, Sunderland|Farringdon]]\n* '''B''': [[Town End Farm]] and [[Barnes, Sunderland|Barnes]]\n* '''C''': [[Hylton Castle (suburb)|Hylton Castle]]\n* '''D''': Dykelands Road area of [[Seaburn]]\n* '''E''': [[Carley Hill]]\n* '''F''': [[Ford Estate]]\n* '''G''': [[Grindon, Sunderland|Grindon]]\n* '''H''': [[Hylton Lane]] / [[Havelock, Tyne and Wear|Havelock]] / Humbledon\n* '''J''': [[John Street, Sunderland]]\n* '''K''': [[Downhill, Sunderland|Downhill]]\n* '''M''': [[Moorside, Sunderland|Moorside]] and [[Millfield, Tyne and Wear]]\n* '''P''': [[Pennywell]] and [[Plains Farm]] and [[Pallion]]\n* '''R''': [[Redhouse, Sunderland|Red House]]\n* '''S''': [[Springwell, Sunderland|Springwell]], [[Southwick, Sunderland|Southwick]]\n* '''T''': [[Thorney Close]]\n* '''W''': [[Witherwack]]\n\nIn Marley Pots, the streets are all associated with trees, e.g. Maplewood, Elmwood etc.\nIn Millfield, the streets are all associated with plants, e.g. Chester, Fern, Rose, Hyacinth etc.\n\n===Definitions of Sunderland===\nThere are two definitions for Sunderland. The smaller Urban Subdivision follows the boundaries of what is considered the city itself, however, the USD alone has not been given city status. The larger metropolitan borough contains other settlements with a separate identity such as [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], but has been given official city status, with all individual settlements being the responsibility of Sunderland city council.\n\n===Green belt===\n{{main|North East Green Belt}}\nThe town is bounded by the Tyne & Wear Green Belt,<ref name=\"sunderland-belt\">{{cite web|title=GREEN BELT REVIEW STAGE 1 \u2013 CORE STRATEGY GROWTH OPTIONS STAGE, MARCH 2016 |url=https://www.sunderland.gov.uk/media/18571/SD43-Sunderland-Green-Belt-Review-Stage-1-Core-Strategy-Growth-Options-Stge-March-2016-/pdf/SD43_Sunderland_Green_Belt_Review_Stage_1_-_Core_Strategy_Growth_Options_Stage_March_2016.pdf|website=www.sunderland.gov.uk}}</ref> with its portion in much of its surrounding rural area of the borough. It is a part of the local [[development plan]], of which its stated aims<ref name=\"sunderland-belt\"/> are as follows:\n\n''A Green Belt will be maintained which will:-''\n\n''(i) Check the unrestricted sprawl of the built up area of Sunderland;''<br/>\n''(ii) Assist in safeguarding the city\u2019s countryside from further encroachment;''<br/>\n''(iii) Assist in the regeneration of the urban area of the city;''<br/>\n''(iv) Preserve the setting and special character of Springwell Village;''<br/>\n''(iv) Prevent the merging of Sunderland with Tyneside, Washington, Houghton-le-Spring and Seaham, and the merging of Shiney Row with Washington, Chester-le-Street and Bournmoor.''\n\nIn the Sunderland borough boundary, as well as the aforementioned areas, landscape features and facilities such as much of the River Don and Wear basins, the George Washington Hotel Golf and Spa complex, Sharpley Golf Course, Herrington Country Park, Houghton Quarry and Penshaw Hill are within the green belt area.\n\n==Climate==\nSunderland has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').  Its location in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Pennines]], as well as other mountain ranges to the west, such as those of the [[Lake District]] and southwestern Scotland, make Sunderland one of the least rainy cities of Northern England. The climate is heavily moderated by the adjacent [[North Sea]], giving it cool summers, and winters that are mild considering its latitude. The closest weather station is in [[Tynemouth]], about {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of Sunderland. As a result, Sunderland's coastline is likely slightly milder given the more southerly position.

The town is on the south bank of the [[River Tees]] and is historically part of the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]. The bridge at Yarm marked the furthest reach of tidal flow up the [[River Tees]] until the opening, in 1995, of the [[Tees Barrage]], which now regulates river flow above [[Stockton on Tees|Stockton]]. As the last bridge on the river before the sea, it was superseded by a new toll bridge opened in Stockton in 1771. The oldest part of the town, around the High Street, is situated in a loop of the river, and the newer parts of the town extend to the point where the [[River Leven, North Yorkshire|River Leven]] meets the River Tees. The town is governed as part of the [[Borough of Stockton-on-Tees]].\n\n==History==\nThe name of the town is thought to be derived from the [[Old English]] ''gearum'', dative plural of ''gear,'' 'pool for catching fish' (source of the modern dialect word ''yair'' with the same meaning), hence 'at the place of the fish pools'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goughmap.org/settlements/7869/|title=Etymology|accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref>  Yarm was first mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and was originally a [[chapelry]] in the [[Kirklevington]] parish in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]; it later became a parish in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Yarm/Yarm90.html|title=YARM: Geographical and Historical information from the year 1890|publisher=Genuki|accessdate=27 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friars settled in Yarm about 1286, and maintained a Friary and a Hospital in the town, until 1583.

An iron replacement was built in 1805, but it fell down in 1806.  For many years, Yarm was at the tidal limit and head of navigation on the [[River Tees]].{{sfn|Winn|2010|p=66}}\n\nOn 12 February 1821, at the ''George & Dragon Inn'', the meeting was held that pressed for the third and successful attempt for a Bill to give permission to build the [[Stockton & Darlington Railway]], the world's first public railway.{{sfn|Winn|2010|p=67}}\n\nIn 1890, Bulmer & Co listed twelve [[inn]]s in Yarm: Black Bull, Cross Keys, Crown Inn, Fleece, George and Dragon, Green Tree, Ketton Ox, Lord Nelson, Red Lion, Three Tuns, Tom Brown, and Union.  Also listed was Cross Keys beside the Leven Bridge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chrystal|first1=Paul|title=The Place Names of Yorkshire; Cities, Towns, Villages, Rivers and Dales, some Pubs too, in Praise of Yorkshire Ales|date=2017|publisher=Stenlake|location=Catrine|isbn=9781840337532|page=129|edition=1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century, Yarm was classed as a borough, but this status did not persist.  It formed part of the [[Stokesley Rural District]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]], and remained so until 1 April 1974 when, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], it became part of the district of [[Stockton-on-Tees]] in the new non-metropolitan county of [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]].

The town is on the south bank of the [[River Tees]] and is historically part of the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]. The bridge at Yarm marked the furthest reach of tidal flow up the [[River Tees]] until the opening, in 1995, of the [[Tees Barrage]], which now regulates river flow above [[Stockton on Tees|Stockton]]. As the last bridge on the river before the sea, it was superseded by a new toll bridge opened in Stockton in 1771. The oldest part of the town, around the High Street, is situated in a loop of the river, and the newer parts of the town extend to the point where the [[River Leven, North Yorkshire|River Leven]] meets the River Tees. The town is governed as part of the [[Borough of Stockton-on-Tees]].\n\n==History==\nThe name of the town is thought to be derived from the [[Old English]] ''gearum'', dative plural of ''gear,'' 'pool for catching fish' (source of the modern dialect word ''yair'' with the same meaning), hence 'at the place of the fish pools'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goughmap.org/settlements/7869/|title=Etymology|accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref>  Yarm was first mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and was originally a [[chapelry]] in the [[Kirklevington]] parish in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]; it later became a parish in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Yarm/Yarm90.html|title=YARM: Geographical and Historical information from the year 1890|publisher=Genuki|accessdate=27 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friars settled in Yarm about 1286, and maintained a Friary and a Hospital in the town, until 1583.

{"title_page": "Flat-chested kitten syndrome", "text_new": "'''Flat-chested kitten syndrome (FCKS)''', is a disorder in [[cat]]s, wherein kittens develop a compression of the [[thorax]] (chest/ribcage) caused by lung collapse. This is a soft-tissue problem and is not caused by vertebral or bony malformation. However lung collapse can be a secondary symptom caused by bony deformity affecting the thorax such as pectus excavatum. In mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. The kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about 2\u20133 hours, and will usually then stabilise. FCKS is frequently misdiagnosed as pectus excavatum due to inadequate veterinary literature or inexperience of the vet.\n\nFCKS is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). There are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for FCKS. One possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is [[atelectasis]].\n\nCauses of [[atelectasis]] include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, [[bronchial obstruction]], or absence of [[surfactant]] (a substance secreted by [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). Lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. There can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the most common cause is [[Preterm birth|prematurity]]. Newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.\n\nUnlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. Many FCKS kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. Further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. Patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. If the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. Good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (This was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)\n\nSome kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. There have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). [[Hyaline membrane disease]] is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a [[hyaline]]-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of FCKS. Pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases&nbsp;\u2013 which may explain the development of FCKS in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.\n\n[[Tumors]] and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. In an older cat the [[intercostal muscles]] are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more flexible, and the tendons and muscles more flaccid, allowing movement of the thorax into abnormal positions.\n\nOther causes of lung collapse can include diaphragmatic hernia, or diaphragmatic spasm (breeders report the position of the gut and thorax as appearing to be like a 'stalled hiccup'). Diaphragmatic spasm is easily checked by pinching the [[phrenic nerve]] in the neck between the fingertips. Kittens with this type of FCKS will improve almost immediately, but may require repeated pinching to prevent the spasm from recurring.\n\n== Evidential basis and statistical analysis ==\nAlmost all reporting of FCKS is treated as anecdotal, since it comes from breeders and not from veterinary practitioners. However, in the absence of robust clinical studies breeder-reporting is the only source of information currently available. Reporting about type of FCKS is hampered by the lack of differentiation between one type and another by both breeders and vets. The data informing this article came from three sources:\n* Analysis of emails reporting cases of FCKS sent to the owner of a website giving information about the condition and methods of treatment, 1999-2019 [87 of these kittens were examined in person by the author]\n* Data gathered by the THINK project 2005-2015 who published an online questionnaire (the project is now defunct)\n* Directly solicited reports requested from 27 individual breeders of Abyssinian (4 responded) and 35 breeders of British Shorthair (2 responded) in the UK\nThe 20-year analysis was compared with the [http://www.gccfcats.org Governing Council of the Cat Fancy] in the UK (GCCF) analysis of numbers of kittens registered during the same period. The full report is to be published during 2019.<ref>Reference will be provided when publication information is available.</ref>\n\nOnly direct reports from owners (362) about their own cats or vets examining kittens (2) were considered. Kittens exhibiting any other condition (including pectus excavatum) were excluded. The overwhelming majority of reports (76%) were of single FCKS cases in a litter, with the remainder whole or part litters.\nThe data comprised 311 reports of litters of kittens in which one or more developed FCKS, for a total of 464 affected kittens.\n\nMentions of FCKS in the veterinary literature (usually no more than a single sentence) include no descriptive information and have no evidential basis, in particular the claim in Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976) that the condition may be hereditary, which has been repeated in subsequent literature.\n\nReports in which the sex was specified showed breakdown by sex of male 56%/female 44%. 16 breeders reported that whereas they might have expected the smallest kitten in a litter (if any) to develop FCKS, it was the largest and strongest kittens that developed flat chests, and these were often males. The condition does not appear to be sex-linked, but the preponderance of male kittens in this reporting group may be due to the fact that males tend to be larger than females and these are the kittens getting most milk or suckling hardest because they are stronger, in which case the type of FCKS in these litters may have been due to colic caused by overfeeding (see Causes, below).\n\nReports originated from 21 countries (Australia (15), Austria (11), Belgium (2), Canada (8), Denmark (3), Finland (2), France (24), Germany (13), Hungary (1), Japan (2), Netherlands (14), New Zealand (6), Norway (5), Portugal (1), Singapore (1), Slovakia (1), South Africa (5), Sweden (11), Switzerland (1), UK (100), USA (85)) and covered 39 breeds (including non-pedigree domestic shorthair, non-pedigree domestic longhair, and some \u2018unrecognised\u2019 crosses between two pedigree breeds or pedigree breeds x DSH). 10 reports did not specify breed.\n[[File:Breakdown of reports of FCKS by breed.png|thumb]]\nHigh numbers of reports in certain breeds has in the past been taken to imply that some breeds are more prone to the condition than others, but the data is skewed by various factors: a) the numbers of kittens bred; b) cluster-reporting in response to articles in breed club circulars or c) the work of a particular group of breeders in attempting to address a problem that they had seen in their own lines d) the culture within an individual breed of information-sharing or reporting problems. Breeders are generally not inclined to discuss health issues because of a culture of blame and gossip, having a dramatic effect on information-sharing. No \u2018cluster\u2019 triggers have been identified for the relatively high number of reports in the Maine Coon or Bengal breeds, however statistics on the registration of kittens provided by the [http://www.gccfcats.org GCCF] show that Bengal, Burmese and Maine Coon are consistently in the top nine breeds by number of kittens registered. The breeds showing highest numbers of kittens registered therefore broadly correlate demographically to reports of FCKS. More significant is perhaps the low number of reported cases in the British Shorthair (especially when compared with the Manx), but it is possible this is attributable to the culture of breeders in that group.\n\nMortality: of 195 cases where the outcome was notified, 88 died, or were euthanised due to distress; 107 recovered and survived beyond 3 months of age. Those that recovered fully did not appear to suffer any long-term effects, although reporting is patchy.\n\n== Onset and diagnosis ==\nFCKS develops usually in kittens around three days of age, and sometimes affects whole litters, sometimes only individuals or part of a litter. Kittens can go flat any time during early maturation, some flattening as late as 10 days of age or (in very rare cases) later. It is possible that the later-developing cases are due to [[Respiratory tract infection]] or [[pneumonia]]. Until 2010 FCKS was believed to be caused by a spasm in the [[intercostal muscle|intercostal]] muscles, but re-examination of old post-mortem data (i.e. that kittens remain flat even when they are dead and therefore cannot maintain a muscular spasm) and new data has led to the conclusion that flattening is caused by failure of the [[lung]]s to inflate normally or, when it occurs in older kittens, by lung collapse. This cause is now cited by the veterinary community (Sturgess 2016) but without any source acknowledgement.\n\nGross physical symptoms include flattening of the underside of the thorax in moderate cases (a ridge can usually be felt along the sides of the ribcage, running parallel to the spine); complete flattening of the upper body in extreme cases (the kitten looks as if it has been stepped on); moderate to extreme effort and/or gasping during breathing; the gut is drawn upwards during the in-breath. Breathing is not usually rapid (as in pneumonia or pyrexia) but at a normal rate when compared with unaffected kittens. The position of the thorax and activity of the abdomen is not unlike that seen during normal hiccups, but the sudden spasm in hiccups is slowed down or halted in FCKS: where a hiccup releases, returning the body to a normal position, FCKS breathing does not release. There may be involvement with digestive difficulty in FCKS kittens (see Colic, below).\n[[File:FCKSnormalThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of normal cat thorax]]\n[[File:FCKSdeformedThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of thoracic deformities of flat chested kitten]]\n\n[[File:FCKSbanana.jpg|thumb|Banana used to demonstrate FCKS shape]]Determining whether a kitten has FCKS or not can be difficult with only text descriptions: a mild case of FCKS causes the thorax to feel similar to the shape of a banana when held curve downward. The ribcage is not fixed in position, and the most noticeable effect in mild cases is the ridge along the side of the ribcage.\n\nThe condition causes weight-gain to halt, respiratory distress, inability to feed normally and, in a significant proportion of cases, death. However, since a significant percentage of kittens survive the condition immediate euthanasia is not indicated, and supportive treatments can be employed to increase the likelihood of survival (see Treatment, below).\n\nThe condition is often misdiagnosed as ''[[Pectus excavatum]]'',<ref>Kit Sturgess et al: An investigation of Taurine levels as a possible cause of FCKS. Burmese Cat Club Newsletter 1980, [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/BCC/ downloadable pdf files accessible from this page]</ref> with which it has no direct connection, although FCKS kittens may also have PE. Although the condition is believed to be more prevalent in the Burmese breed it is found in every breed of cat, including non-pedigree domestic cats, and the apparent prevalence in the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] is most likely due to better communication between breeders and reporting of the condition, as well as the naturally more barrel-shaped chest of this particular genotype.<ref>Edinburgh FAB resident, Royal Dick Veterinary Hospital: Report in ''FAB Journal'' (1993), vol. 31 (1) 71-72</ref> Since early reporting of the condition identified the Burmese as susceptible the [[Bengal (cat)|Bengal]] breed, with a similar physiology, has emerged, and shows a similarly large number of FCKS kittens, however this may be due to specific interest in the condition among those working with the breeds. It is reported in all breeds and in domestic non-pedigree cats, both those kept as pets and those living as 'barn cats'. An article in a Swedish cat club newsletter about FCKS led to a spike in reporting of the condition in Ragdolls in Sweden.\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:MauFCK.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian Mau kitten with FCKS]]\n|[[File:RexFCK.jpg|thumb|center|Rex kitten with FCKS and Kyphosis - note narrowing of thorax around the shoulders]]\n| [[File:Flat kitten b.png|thumb|center|Oriental kitten with moderate to extreme FCKS. Pectus Excavatum is not present. The kitten was wrapped in a 'corset' for about 2 weeks. It is now a healthy adult.]]\n|}\n\nThe syndrome is life-threatening in a significant number of cases (possibly around 40%) mainly due to a lack of understanding of the underlying cause of the condition, failure to treat colic (leading to slow starvation) and insufficient sources of information in veterinary literature.\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== Genetic/Heredity ===\nThere is no statistical evidence to suggest that FCKS may be due to genetic factors: certain bloodlines ''seem'' to produce a preponderance of kittens with the condition, but this may be due to enhanced reporting within the breed. The literature citing heredity as a cause (Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976)) does not provide any evidential support and the information is repeated in later literature citing that source as authority. The majority of cases are of single kittens, with low but significant numbers of whole or part litters reported. Numerous breeders experience periods in which FCKS seems to occur over a number of matings, but then stops, suggesting an environmental cause. Incidences of the condition have been reported in many litters that were repeat matings of previously healthy litters; matings repeated after the incidence of FCKS do not produce flat kittens any more frequently than non-repeat matings; recovered FCKS that have been bred from have likewise not produced offspring that suffered from the condition any more frequently than normal cats, but numbers in this category are obviously low. It is possible that some lines in which the queens provide excessive milk may lead to colic-related FCKS in the kittens, leading to the supposition of heredity. Although after experiencing cases of FCKS most breeders do not repeat matings. In 59 cases of repeat matings 52 litters did '''not''' result in FCKS again while 7 did.\n\n=== Developmental ===\nIt is possible that the lung collapse in neo-nates (i.e. around 3 days of age) could be due to a lack of [[surfactant]] -  the coating of the inside of the lung that prevents the inner surfaces of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] from sticking together. (Causes of surfactant deficiency are not discussed here, but the role of surfactant is discussed in a number of articles in the ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' vol. 65, 1990.<ref>particularly B A Hills: The role of lung surfactant, ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' 1990, 65, 13-29</ref>). Kittens are born immature in many ways, and full inflation of the lungs does not happen immediately, but takes place gradually over a period of several days after birth. Although a kitten may seem active and thriving, its lungs will not be fully inflated until approx. day 3 after birth. Thus if inflation fails to happen correctly the [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] in the chest cavity will cause the ribcage&nbsp;\u2013 which is extremely flexible&nbsp;\u2013 to collapse inward, dragged in by the lungs, and '''not''' collapsing due to muscular cramping, and compressing the lungs.\n\n=== Infection ===\nNeo-natal and Later lung collapse may be due to lung infection, or possibly to a malfunction in the [[epiglottis]], causing the in-breath to draw air into the digestive tract rather than the lungs. A short term malfunction of this sort may be perpetuated by the resulting colic creating a feedback loop that interrupts the correct breathing process.\n\nAutopsy and analysis of [[Aspiration pneumonia|lung aspirate]] in a group of flat-chested kittens bred by a US Vet showed the presence of [[Cat flu|Herpes virus]].\n\n=== Diaphragmatic spasm ===\nSpasm in the diaphragm leads to the muscle 'locking up' so that all breathing effort falls to the intercostal muscles. The resulting loss of movement causes the lungs to deflate gradually. This is easily diagnosed and treated (see Treatment below) by short-term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]].\n\n=== Colic ===\nA kitten that has difficulty in breathing is very likely also to suffer from [[colic]] (which can cause weight loss in the early development of a normal kitten), and a very small daily (or twice daily) dose of [[Liquid paraffin (medicinal)|liquid paraffin]] (one or two drops placed on the tongue of the kitten, or 0.1 ml) should help to alleviate this problem. FCKS kittens who do not maintain weight are usually among the group which die, but many of them may simply be unable to feed properly due to colic, becoming increasingly weak and lethargic, and fading due to malnutrition as much as to the thoracic problems.\n\nColic has many causes, but in a kitten with respiratory difficulty it is possible that a malfunction during the breathing process leads the kitten to swallow air instead of taking it into its lungs. The GI tract fills with air while the lungs do not receive a proper air supply, preventing them from inflating fully. Pressure from the stomach exacerbates the condition. Treating for colic with liquid paraffin seems to shorten recovery time from 4\u201310 weeks to a matter of days.\n\n== Treatment ==\n[[File:Position of phrenic nerve in cat.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of Phrenic nerve in a sleeping kitten. The nerve bifurcates and runs down both sides of the neck.</center>]]\n[[File:Phrenic002.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of the Phrenic Nerve (diagram)</center>]]\nTreatment is difficult to define given the number of different causes and the wealth of anecdotal information collected by and from cat breeders. Treatments have hitherto been based on the assumption that FCKS is caused by a muscular [[spasm]], and their effectiveness is impossible to assess because some kittens will recover spontaneously without intervention.\n\nDiaphragmatic spasm is easily tested for and treated by short term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]]. The nerve runs down the outside of the neck where the neck joins to the shoulder, within a bundle of muscles and tendons at this junction. The cluster can be pinched gently and held for a few seconds each time. Kittens with spasmodic FCKS will show almost immediate improvement, but the treatment may need to be repeated several times over a few days as the spasm may have a tendency to recur.\n\nContinuous positive air pressure ([[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]) is used in human babies with lung collapse, but this is impossible with kittens. It is possible that the success of some breeders in curing kittens by splinting the body, thus putting pressure on the ribcage, was successful as it has created the effect of positive air pressure, thus gradually re-inflating the lungs by pulling them open rather than pushing them open as is the case with CPAP (see below).\n\n=== Drugs ===\nThe use of [[steroids]] ([[Dexamethasone]]) coupled with an antibiotic ([[Amoxicillin]]) will support the kitten in a number of ways, the steroid enhancing maturation and the antibiotic addressing the possibility of underlying infection and compensating for the immuno-depressant properties of the steroid. The steroid will also encourage the kitten to feed more energetically, keeping its weight up. However the primary supportive mechanism must be nutritional. Kittens who are only supported with feeding and do not receive drugs seem to have a similar prognosis to those receiving drugs. Drug treatment cannot be used to replace nutritional support (i.e. supplementary feeding), A very small number of breeders having read the report by Sturgess et al (which was inconclusive) believe that Taurine plays a part in the condition. These breeders give the queen large doses of Taurine (1000&nbsp;mg) daily until the kittens recover&nbsp;\u2013 apparently within a few days. Long-term use of high doses of Taurine should be discussed with a veterinarian.\n\n=== Splinting and physical therapy ===\nSplinting the kitten in a specially-constructed corset made from a rigid material such as a toilet roll, section of plastic bottle or high-density foam encourages the ribcage to a more normal position, and reported mortality seemed to decline when this practice was introduced.<ref>http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information regarding splinting of FCKS kittens]</ref> This may be because encouraging the chest to a more correct position helps the lungs to re-inflate. However a large proportion of kittens cannot tolerate a splint, and the distress it causes is extremely counterproductive. It can also be dangerous in cases where pressure on the sides causes the sternum to move inwards rather than outwards, and should only be undertaken with veterinary support and advice. Some kittens recover without intervention, so it is not known whether the various treatments based on encouraging the thorax to return to a normal shape contributed to recovery.<ref>Although corsets can be improvised easily from e.g. plastic drinks bottles etc., one breeder has marketed a 'corset' design that she found successful with her kittens www.fck-flat-korsett.de</ref>\n\nSome breeders have found that applying manual pressure to the sides of the ribcage can help, as the chest rounds out with encouragement (gentle pressure timed to coincide with the natural movement of the thorax in breathing), but usually the chest goes flat again as soon as massage is discontinued. It may however help in encouraging the lungs to inflate a little more with each breath, but should not be used if it causes distress to the kitten. Many breeders report that affected kittens seem to enjoy massage. Encouraging a kitten to lie on its side can be helpful, and draping another kitten (or the mother's arm) over it while it is sleeping on its side places a gentle continuous pressure on the ribcage which may also be helpful. If the kitten is uncomfortable it will move away. (It is important to ensure that pressure is not placed on the kitten if it is lying flat on its chest.)\n\nOver-handling FCKS kittens can lead to unnecessary weight loss and [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy]], so the use of massage, waking the kitten for extra feeds from the mother etc. should be checked against gains and losses in weight. Some vets believe that encouraging the kitten to cry and also to have to move more to reach its mother may be helpful. There is no data from breeders supporting this theory.\n\n== Survival and long-term prognosis ==\nIt is difficult to determine whether a kitten that goes flat will survive or not. A good indicator is the weight of the kitten: those that continue to gain weight generally have a better chance of survival. Supplement feeding is therefore recommended in all cases, together with vitamin supplements,<ref>[http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information about kitten milk and other supplements further down the page]</ref> although many of these kittens will not accept hand feeding. Liquid Paraffin to alleviate colic seems to be significant in assisting normal feeding and weight-gain.\n\nAnother indicator to the severity of the case is the use of the stomach when breathing: normal kittens use only the ribcage, a flat-chested kitten may manage to breathe only using the ribcage, or may suck the gut upwards with every breath&nbsp;\u2013 if the latter is the case then the likelihood of survival seems to be lower, though still not sufficient to warrant immediate [[euthanasia]]. If the condition is stable (i.e. the flatness does not increase over time) or improving, the kitten is more likely to survive. If the condition worsens over several days, survival is less likely.\n\nKittens with FCKS may die (or have to be euthanased) very soon after onset. There are two points at which breeders report kittens that were otherwise doing well deteriorating and dying: at 10 days of age and at 3 weeks. Generally if the kitten is still flat, but survives the 3-week developmental stage, its prognosis is good. Many will have returned to a normal shape by this time. Those retaining some degree of flatness often grow out of the condition at any point in the ensuing 6 months, and the vast majority of survivors appear to lead normal lives with no side-effects, either physical or immunological.\n\nFCKS kittens that survive but who have not been given any drug treatment or support other than supplementary feeding, generally recover over a period of 4\u201310 weeks, and are usually normal by 12 weeks of age, though some take as long as 6 months to normalise. In the very small number of kittens reported so far treated with steroids, antibiotics and liquid paraffin (to address colic) recovery is usually seen within a matter of days. Given the number of different types of FCKS these kittens (all with the minor form of the condition) may not be representative of all cases. More data is required for statistical analysis.\n\nA small proportion of severe FCKS kittens are left with long-term respiratory problems, [[kyphosis]], and in some cases cardiac issues caused by the compression of the thorax during the early developmental stages (particularly where the condition has been coupled with Pectus Excavatum). Cardiac issues are generally audible on physical examination; further indications include the kitten becoming breathless after play, less active than siblings, and failure to grow and develop normally.\n\n== Breeding with FCKS ==\nCrucial in the decision to breed would be the primary cause of FCKS in the litter, which may or may not be genetic (see Heredity above). Some recovered FCKS adults have produced FCKS offspring in their turn, and some queens consistently produce flat kittens, so breeding from those lines is therefore inadvisable. However, repeat matings in which FCKS has appeared does not result in further FCKS kittens any more often than non-repeat matings. Queens and studs who consistently throw complete litters of kittens with the condition are generally neutered, but isolated instances of single flat kittens in an otherwise healthy litter seem to be unlikely to have a genetic component and neutering of parents of such kittens is not usually necessary in pedigree breeding, particularly where doing so may have detrimental effects on the gene pool.\n\nIf the cause of flattening is colic related to over-production of milk then this would not be cause for neutering. The only way to determine if the cause is digestive would be if the condition was alleviated by pinching the phrenic nerve and/or use of liquid paraffin to relieve colic, resulting in improvement in the condition.\n\nLine-breeding or inbreeding is highly inadvisable in any situation, and particularly so in lines where FCKS has appeared, given the possibility of inheritcance of any underlying condition or breeding factor that may cause kittens to develop FCKS.\n\n== Other conditions ==\nKittens with FCKS sometimes also show bony deformities such as [[Pectus Excavatum]] or [[Kyphosis]] (characterised in kittens by a dip in the spine just behind the shoulder blades). Although a kitten may be born with these deformities, extreme forms of FCKS may cause Kyphosis to develop in an otherwise normal kitten, as the kitten grows with the spine held in an abnormal position due to the flattened ribcage. When there are bony deformities in the upper body, or other problems present, these may contribute to malfunctioning in soft-tissue organs such as the respiratory and digestive systems.\n\n== Flat chestedness in other animals ==\nFlat chest occurs in piglets and puppies, may be known in cattle (anecdotal information only), and is also recorded in humans, though possibly in humans this is not the same type of condition and may be a bone deformity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.vetstream.com/treat/felis/diseases/flat-chested-kitten-and-pectus-excavatum Vetstream article on FCKS in journal ''Felis'' ISSN 2398-2950]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/page58/index.html Flat-Chested Kitten Syndrome]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/FCKSVeterinary.pdf Veterinary information about FCKS written by Dr Kit Sturgess MA VetMB PhD CertVR DSAM CertVC MRCVS] -- warning, out of date.\n* [http://theses.vet-alfort.fr/telecharger.php?id=1840/  Marine Minnaert: ''\u00c9tude r\u00e9trospective de la cage thoracique plate chez le chat : caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques et cliniques, pronostic et aspects g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques'', PhD thesis (2014) pdf]\n* [https://icatcare.org/advice/cat-health/flat-chested-kitten-syndrome/ International Cat Care website; based on Sturgess]\n[[Category:Cat diseases]]\n[[Category:Respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period]]\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9423237?dopt=abstract/ Sturgess C P, Waters L, Gruffydd-Jones T J et al (1997) Investigation of the association between whole blood and tissue taurine levels and the development of thoracic deformities in neonatal Burmese kittens.

This is a soft-tissue problem and is not caused by vertebral or bony malformation. However lung collapse can be a secondary symptom caused by bony deformity affecting the thorax such as pectus excavatum. In mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. The kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about 2\u20133 hours, and will usually then stabilise. FCKS is frequently misdiagnosed as pectus excavatum due to inadequate veterinary literature or inexperience of the vet.\n\nFCKS is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). There are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for FCKS. One possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is [[atelectasis]].\n\nCauses of [[atelectasis]] include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, [[bronchial obstruction]], or absence of [[surfactant]] (a substance secreted by [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). Lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. There can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the most common cause is [[Preterm birth|prematurity]]. Newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.\n\nUnlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. Many FCKS kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. Further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. Patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. If the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. Good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (This was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)\n\nSome kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. There have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). [[Hyaline membrane disease]] is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a [[hyaline]]-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of FCKS. Pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases&nbsp;\u2013 which may explain the development of FCKS in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.\n\n[[Tumors]] and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. In an older cat the [[intercostal muscles]] are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more flexible, and the tendons and muscles more flaccid, allowing movement of the thorax into abnormal positions.\n\nOther causes of lung collapse can include diaphragmatic hernia, or diaphragmatic spasm (breeders report the position of the gut and thorax as appearing to be like a 'stalled hiccup'). Diaphragmatic spasm is easily checked by pinching the [[phrenic nerve]] in the neck between the fingertips. Kittens with this type of FCKS will improve almost immediately, but may require repeated pinching to prevent the spasm from recurring.\n\n== Evidential basis and statistical analysis ==\nAlmost all reporting of FCKS is treated as anecdotal, since it comes from breeders and not from veterinary practitioners. However, in the absence of robust clinical studies breeder-reporting is the only source of information currently available. Reporting about type of FCKS is hampered by the lack of differentiation between one type and another by both breeders and vets. The data informing this article came from three sources:\n* Analysis of emails reporting cases of FCKS sent to the owner of a website giving information about the condition and methods of treatment, 1999-2019 [87 of these kittens were examined in person by the author]\n* Data gathered by the THINK project 2005-2015 who published an online questionnaire (the project is now defunct)\n* Directly solicited reports requested from 27 individual breeders of Abyssinian (4 responded) and 35 breeders of British Shorthair (2 responded) in the UK\nThe 20-year analysis was compared with the [http://www.gccfcats.org Governing Council of the Cat Fancy] in the UK (GCCF) analysis of numbers of kittens registered during the same period. The full report is to be published during 2019.<ref>Reference will be provided when publication information is available.</ref>\n\nOnly direct reports from owners (362) about their own cats or vets examining kittens (2) were considered. Kittens exhibiting any other condition (including pectus excavatum) were excluded. The overwhelming majority of reports (76%) were of single FCKS cases in a litter, with the remainder whole or part litters.\nThe data comprised 311 reports of litters of kittens in which one or more developed FCKS, for a total of 464 affected kittens.\n\nMentions of FCKS in the veterinary literature (usually no more than a single sentence) include no descriptive information and have no evidential basis, in particular the claim in Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976) that the condition may be hereditary, which has been repeated in subsequent literature.\n\nReports in which the sex was specified showed breakdown by sex of male 56%/female 44%. 16 breeders reported that whereas they might have expected the smallest kitten in a litter (if any) to develop FCKS, it was the largest and strongest kittens that developed flat chests, and these were often males. The condition does not appear to be sex-linked, but the preponderance of male kittens in this reporting group may be due to the fact that males tend to be larger than females and these are the kittens getting most milk or suckling hardest because they are stronger, in which case the type of FCKS in these litters may have been due to colic caused by overfeeding (see Causes, below).\n\nReports originated from 21 countries (Australia (15), Austria (11), Belgium (2), Canada (8), Denmark (3), Finland (2), France (24), Germany (13), Hungary (1), Japan (2), Netherlands (14), New Zealand (6), Norway (5), Portugal (1), Singapore (1), Slovakia (1), South Africa (5), Sweden (11), Switzerland (1), UK (100), USA (85)) and covered 39 breeds (including non-pedigree domestic shorthair, non-pedigree domestic longhair, and some \u2018unrecognised\u2019 crosses between two pedigree breeds or pedigree breeds x DSH). 10 reports did not specify breed.\n[[File:Breakdown of reports of FCKS by breed.png|thumb]]\nHigh numbers of reports in certain breeds has in the past been taken to imply that some breeds are more prone to the condition than others, but the data is skewed by various factors: a) the numbers of kittens bred; b) cluster-reporting in response to articles in breed club circulars or c) the work of a particular group of breeders in attempting to address a problem that they had seen in their own lines d) the culture within an individual breed of information-sharing or reporting problems. Breeders are generally not inclined to discuss health issues because of a culture of blame and gossip, having a dramatic effect on information-sharing. No \u2018cluster\u2019 triggers have been identified for the relatively high number of reports in the Maine Coon or Bengal breeds, however statistics on the registration of kittens provided by the [http://www.gccfcats.org GCCF] show that Bengal, Burmese and Maine Coon are consistently in the top nine breeds by number of kittens registered. The breeds showing highest numbers of kittens registered therefore broadly correlate demographically to reports of FCKS. More significant is perhaps the low number of reported cases in the British Shorthair (especially when compared with the Manx), but it is possible this is attributable to the culture of breeders in that group.\n\nMortality: of 195 cases where the outcome was notified, 88 died, or were euthanised due to distress; 107 recovered and survived beyond 3 months of age. Those that recovered fully did not appear to suffer any long-term effects, although reporting is patchy.\n\n== Onset and diagnosis ==\nFCKS develops usually in kittens around three days of age, and sometimes affects whole litters, sometimes only individuals or part of a litter. Kittens can go flat any time during early maturation, some flattening as late as 10 days of age or (in very rare cases) later. It is possible that the later-developing cases are due to [[Respiratory tract infection]] or [[pneumonia]]. Until 2010 FCKS was believed to be caused by a spasm in the [[intercostal muscle|intercostal]] muscles, but re-examination of old post-mortem data (i.e. that kittens remain flat even when they are dead and therefore cannot maintain a muscular spasm) and new data has led to the conclusion that flattening is caused by failure of the [[lung]]s to inflate normally or, when it occurs in older kittens, by lung collapse. This cause is now cited by the veterinary community (Sturgess 2016) but without any source acknowledgement.\n\nGross physical symptoms include flattening of the underside of the thorax in moderate cases (a ridge can usually be felt along the sides of the ribcage, running parallel to the spine); complete flattening of the upper body in extreme cases (the kitten looks as if it has been stepped on); moderate to extreme effort and/or gasping during breathing; the gut is drawn upwards during the in-breath. Breathing is not usually rapid (as in pneumonia or pyrexia) but at a normal rate when compared with unaffected kittens. The position of the thorax and activity of the abdomen is not unlike that seen during normal hiccups, but the sudden spasm in hiccups is slowed down or halted in FCKS: where a hiccup releases, returning the body to a normal position, FCKS breathing does not release. There may be involvement with digestive difficulty in FCKS kittens (see Colic, below).\n[[File:FCKSnormalThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of normal cat thorax]]\n[[File:FCKSdeformedThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of thoracic deformities of flat chested kitten]]\n\n[[File:FCKSbanana.jpg|thumb|Banana used to demonstrate FCKS shape]]Determining whether a kitten has FCKS or not can be difficult with only text descriptions: a mild case of FCKS causes the thorax to feel similar to the shape of a banana when held curve downward. The ribcage is not fixed in position, and the most noticeable effect in mild cases is the ridge along the side of the ribcage.\n\nThe condition causes weight-gain to halt, respiratory distress, inability to feed normally and, in a significant proportion of cases, death. However, since a significant percentage of kittens survive the condition immediate euthanasia is not indicated, and supportive treatments can be employed to increase the likelihood of survival (see Treatment, below).\n\nThe condition is often misdiagnosed as ''[[Pectus excavatum]]'',<ref>Kit Sturgess et al: An investigation of Taurine levels as a possible cause of FCKS. Burmese Cat Club Newsletter 1980, [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/BCC/ downloadable pdf files accessible from this page]</ref> with which it has no direct connection, although FCKS kittens may also have PE. Although the condition is believed to be more prevalent in the Burmese breed it is found in every breed of cat, including non-pedigree domestic cats, and the apparent prevalence in the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] is most likely due to better communication between breeders and reporting of the condition, as well as the naturally more barrel-shaped chest of this particular genotype.<ref>Edinburgh FAB resident, Royal Dick Veterinary Hospital: Report in ''FAB Journal'' (1993), vol. 31 (1) 71-72</ref> Since early reporting of the condition identified the Burmese as susceptible the [[Bengal (cat)|Bengal]] breed, with a similar physiology, has emerged, and shows a similarly large number of FCKS kittens, however this may be due to specific interest in the condition among those working with the breeds. It is reported in all breeds and in domestic non-pedigree cats, both those kept as pets and those living as 'barn cats'. An article in a Swedish cat club newsletter about FCKS led to a spike in reporting of the condition in Ragdolls in Sweden.\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:MauFCK.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian Mau kitten with FCKS]]\n|[[File:RexFCK.jpg|thumb|center|Rex kitten with FCKS and Kyphosis - note narrowing of thorax around the shoulders]]\n| [[File:Flat kitten b.png|thumb|center|Oriental kitten with moderate to extreme FCKS. Pectus Excavatum is not present. The kitten was wrapped in a 'corset' for about 2 weeks. It is now a healthy adult.]]\n|}\n\nThe syndrome is life-threatening in a significant number of cases (possibly around 40%) mainly due to a lack of understanding of the underlying cause of the condition, failure to treat colic (leading to slow starvation) and insufficient sources of information in veterinary literature.\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== Genetic/Heredity ===\nThere is no statistical evidence to suggest that FCKS may be due to genetic factors: certain bloodlines ''seem'' to produce a preponderance of kittens with the condition, but this may be due to enhanced reporting within the breed. The literature citing heredity as a cause (Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976)) does not provide any evidential support and the information is repeated in later literature citing that source as authority. The majority of cases are of single kittens, with low but significant numbers of whole or part litters reported. Numerous breeders experience periods in which FCKS seems to occur over a number of matings, but then stops, suggesting an environmental cause. Incidences of the condition have been reported in many litters that were repeat matings of previously healthy litters; matings repeated after the incidence of FCKS do not produce flat kittens any more frequently than non-repeat matings; recovered FCKS that have been bred from have likewise not produced offspring that suffered from the condition any more frequently than normal cats, but numbers in this category are obviously low. It is possible that some lines in which the queens provide excessive milk may lead to colic-related FCKS in the kittens, leading to the supposition of heredity. Although after experiencing cases of FCKS most breeders do not repeat matings. In 59 cases of repeat matings 52 litters did '''not''' result in FCKS again while 7 did.\n\n=== Developmental ===\nIt is possible that the lung collapse in neo-nates (i.e. around 3 days of age) could be due to a lack of [[surfactant]] -  the coating of the inside of the lung that prevents the inner surfaces of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] from sticking together. (Causes of surfactant deficiency are not discussed here, but the role of surfactant is discussed in a number of articles in the ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' vol. 65, 1990.<ref>particularly B A Hills: The role of lung surfactant, ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' 1990, 65, 13-29</ref>). Kittens are born immature in many ways, and full inflation of the lungs does not happen immediately, but takes place gradually over a period of several days after birth. Although a kitten may seem active and thriving, its lungs will not be fully inflated until approx. day 3 after birth. Thus if inflation fails to happen correctly the [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] in the chest cavity will cause the ribcage&nbsp;\u2013 which is extremely flexible&nbsp;\u2013 to collapse inward, dragged in by the lungs, and '''not''' collapsing due to muscular cramping, and compressing the lungs.\n\n=== Infection ===\nNeo-natal and Later lung collapse may be due to lung infection, or possibly to a malfunction in the [[epiglottis]], causing the in-breath to draw air into the digestive tract rather than the lungs. A short term malfunction of this sort may be perpetuated by the resulting colic creating a feedback loop that interrupts the correct breathing process.\n\nAutopsy and analysis of [[Aspiration pneumonia|lung aspirate]] in a group of flat-chested kittens bred by a US Vet showed the presence of [[Cat flu|Herpes virus]].\n\n=== Diaphragmatic spasm ===\nSpasm in the diaphragm leads to the muscle 'locking up' so that all breathing effort falls to the intercostal muscles. The resulting loss of movement causes the lungs to deflate gradually. This is easily diagnosed and treated (see Treatment below) by short-term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]].\n\n=== Colic ===\nA kitten that has difficulty in breathing is very likely also to suffer from [[colic]] (which can cause weight loss in the early development of a normal kitten), and a very small daily (or twice daily) dose of [[Liquid paraffin (medicinal)|liquid paraffin]] (one or two drops placed on the tongue of the kitten, or 0.1 ml) should help to alleviate this problem. FCKS kittens who do not maintain weight are usually among the group which die, but many of them may simply be unable to feed properly due to colic, becoming increasingly weak and lethargic, and fading due to malnutrition as much as to the thoracic problems.\n\nColic has many causes, but in a kitten with respiratory difficulty it is possible that a malfunction during the breathing process leads the kitten to swallow air instead of taking it into its lungs. The GI tract fills with air while the lungs do not receive a proper air supply, preventing them from inflating fully. Pressure from the stomach exacerbates the condition. Treating for colic with liquid paraffin seems to shorten recovery time from 4\u201310 weeks to a matter of days.\n\n== Treatment ==\n[[File:Position of phrenic nerve in cat.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of Phrenic nerve in a sleeping kitten. The nerve bifurcates and runs down both sides of the neck.</center>]]\nTreatment is difficult to define given the number of different causes and the wealth of anecdotal information collected by and from cat breeders. Treatments have hitherto been based on the assumption that FCKS is caused by a muscular [[spasm]], and their effectiveness is impossible to assess because some kittens will recover spontaneously without intervention.\n\nDiaphragmatic spasm is easily tested for and treated by short term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]]. The nerve runs down the outside of the neck where the neck joins to the shoulder, within a bundle of muscles and tendons at this junction. The cluster can be pinched gently and held for a few seconds each time. Kittens with spasmodic FCKS will show almost immediate improvement, but the treatment may need to be repeated several times over a few days as the spasm may have a tendency to recur.\n\nContinuous positive air pressure ([[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]) is used in human babies with lung collapse, but this is impossible with kittens. It is possible that the success of some breeders in curing kittens by splinting the body, thus putting pressure on the ribcage, was successful as it has created the effect of positive air pressure, thus gradually re-inflating the lungs by pulling them open rather than pushing them open as is the case with CPAP (see below).\n\n=== Drugs ===\nThe use of [[steroids]] ([[Dexamethasone]]) coupled with an antibiotic ([[Amoxicillin]]) will support the kitten in a number of ways, the steroid enhancing maturation and the antibiotic addressing the possibility of underlying infection and compensating for the immuno-depressant properties of the steroid. The steroid will also encourage the kitten to feed more energetically, keeping its weight up. However the primary supportive mechanism must be nutritional. Kittens who are only supported with feeding and do not receive drugs seem to have a similar prognosis to those receiving drugs. Drug treatment cannot be used to replace nutritional support (i.e. supplementary feeding), A very small number of breeders having read the report by Sturgess et al (which was inconclusive) believe that Taurine plays a part in the condition. These breeders give the queen large doses of Taurine (1000&nbsp;mg) daily until the kittens recover&nbsp;\u2013 apparently within a few days. Long-term use of high doses of Taurine should be discussed with a veterinarian.\n\n=== Splinting and physical therapy ===\nSplinting the kitten in a specially-constructed corset made from a rigid material such as a toilet roll, section of plastic bottle or high-density foam encourages the ribcage to a more normal position, and reported mortality seemed to decline when this practice was introduced.<ref>http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information regarding splinting of FCKS kittens]</ref> This may be because encouraging the chest to a more correct position helps the lungs to re-inflate. However a large proportion of kittens cannot tolerate a splint, and the distress it causes is extremely counterproductive. It can also be dangerous in cases where pressure on the sides causes the sternum to move inwards rather than outwards, and should only be undertaken with veterinary support and advice. Some kittens recover without intervention, so it is not known whether the various treatments based on encouraging the thorax to return to a normal shape contributed to recovery.<ref>Although corsets can be improvised easily from e.g. plastic drinks bottles etc., one breeder has marketed a 'corset' design that she found successful with her kittens www.fck-flat-korsett.de</ref>\n\nSome breeders have found that applying manual pressure to the sides of the ribcage can help, as the chest rounds out with encouragement (gentle pressure timed to coincide with the natural movement of the thorax in breathing), but usually the chest goes flat again as soon as massage is discontinued. It may however help in encouraging the lungs to inflate a little more with each breath, but should not be used if it causes distress to the kitten. Many breeders report that affected kittens seem to enjoy massage. Encouraging a kitten to lie on its side can be helpful, and draping another kitten (or the mother's arm) over it while it is sleeping on its side places a gentle continuous pressure on the ribcage which may also be helpful. If the kitten is uncomfortable it will move away. (It is important to ensure that pressure is not placed on the kitten if it is lying flat on its chest.)\n\nOver-handling FCKS kittens can lead to unnecessary weight loss and [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy]], so the use of massage, waking the kitten for extra feeds from the mother etc. should be checked against gains and losses in weight. Some vets believe that encouraging the kitten to cry and also to have to move more to reach its mother may be helpful. There is no data from breeders supporting this theory.\n\n== Survival and long-term prognosis ==\nIt is difficult to determine whether a kitten that goes flat will survive or not. A good indicator is the weight of the kitten: those that continue to gain weight generally have a better chance of survival. Supplement feeding is therefore recommended in all cases, together with vitamin supplements,<ref>[http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information about kitten milk and other supplements further down the page]</ref> although many of these kittens will not accept hand feeding. Liquid Paraffin to alleviate colic seems to be significant in assisting normal feeding and weight-gain.\n\nAnother indicator to the severity of the case is the use of the stomach when breathing: normal kittens use only the ribcage, a flat-chested kitten may manage to breathe only using the ribcage, or may suck the gut upwards with every breath&nbsp;\u2013 if the latter is the case then the likelihood of survival seems to be lower, though still not sufficient to warrant immediate [[euthanasia]]. If the condition is stable (i.e. the flatness does not increase over time) or improving, the kitten is more likely to survive. If the condition worsens over several days, survival is less likely.\n\nKittens with FCKS may die (or have to be euthanased) very soon after onset. There are two points at which breeders report kittens that were otherwise doing well deteriorating and dying: at 10 days of age and at 3 weeks. Generally if the kitten is still flat, but survives the 3-week developmental stage, its prognosis is good. Many will have returned to a normal shape by this time. Those retaining some degree of flatness often grow out of the condition at any point in the ensuing 6 months, and the vast majority of survivors appear to lead normal lives with no side-effects, either physical or immunological.\n\nFCKS kittens that survive but who have not been given any drug treatment or support other than supplementary feeding, generally recover over a period of 4\u201310 weeks, and are usually normal by 12 weeks of age, though some take as long as 6 months to normalise. In the very small number of kittens reported so far treated with steroids, antibiotics and liquid paraffin (to address colic) recovery is usually seen within a matter of days. Given the number of different types of FCKS these kittens (all with the minor form of the condition) may not be representative of all cases. More data is required for statistical analysis.\n\nA small proportion of severe FCKS kittens are left with long-term respiratory problems, [[kyphosis]], and in some cases cardiac issues caused by the compression of the thorax during the early developmental stages (particularly where the condition has been coupled with Pectus Excavatum). Cardiac issues are generally audible on physical examination; further indications include the kitten becoming breathless after play, less active than siblings, and failure to grow and develop normally.\n\n== Breeding with FCKS ==\nCrucial in the decision to breed would be the primary cause of FCKS in the litter, which may or may not be genetic (see Heredity above). Some recovered FCKS adults have produced FCKS offspring in their turn, and some queens consistently produce flat kittens, so breeding from those lines is therefore inadvisable. However, repeat matings in which FCKS has appeared does not result in further FCKS kittens any more often than non-repeat matings. Queens and studs who consistently throw complete litters of kittens with the condition are generally neutered, but isolated instances of single flat kittens in an otherwise healthy litter seem to be unlikely to have a genetic component and neutering of parents of such kittens is not usually necessary in pedigree breeding, particularly where doing so may have detrimental effects on the gene pool.\n\nIf the cause of flattening is colic related to over-production of milk then this would not be cause for neutering. The only way to determine if the cause is digestive would be if the condition was alleviated by pinching the phrenic nerve and/or use of liquid paraffin to relieve colic, resulting in improvement in the condition.\n\nLine-breeding or inbreeding is highly inadvisable in any situation, and particularly so in lines where FCKS has appeared, given the possibility of inheritcance of any underlying condition or breeding factor that may cause kittens to develop FCKS.\n\n== Other conditions ==\nKittens with FCKS sometimes also show bony deformities such as [[Pectus Excavatum]] or [[Kyphosis]] (characterised in kittens by a dip in the spine just behind the shoulder blades). Although a kitten may be born with these deformities, extreme forms of FCKS may cause Kyphosis to develop in an otherwise normal kitten, as the kitten grows with the spine held in an abnormal position due to the flattened ribcage. When there are bony deformities in the upper body, or other problems present, these may contribute to malfunctioning in soft-tissue organs such as the respiratory and digestive systems.\n\n== Flat chestedness in other animals ==\nFlat chest occurs in piglets and puppies, may be known in cattle (anecdotal information only), and is also recorded in humans, though possibly in humans this is not the same type of condition and may be a bone deformity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.vetstream.com/treat/felis/diseases/flat-chested-kitten-and-pectus-excavatum Vetstream article on FCKS in journal ''Felis'' ISSN 2398-2950]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/page58/index.html Flat-Chested Kitten Syndrome]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/FCKSVeterinary.pdf Veterinary information about FCKS written by Dr Kit Sturgess MA VetMB PhD CertVR DSAM CertVC MRCVS] -- warning, out of date.\n* [http://theses.vet-alfort.fr/telecharger.php?id=1840/  Marine Minnaert: ''\u00c9tude r\u00e9trospective de la cage thoracique plate chez le chat : caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques et cliniques, pronostic et aspects g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques'', PhD thesis (2014) pdf]\n* [https://icatcare.org/advice/cat-health/flat-chested-kitten-syndrome/ International Cat Care website; based on Sturgess]\n[[Category:Cat diseases]]\n[[Category:Respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period]]\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9423237?dopt=abstract/ Sturgess C P, Waters L, Gruffydd-Jones T J et al (1997) Investigation of the association between whole blood and tissue taurine levels and the development of thoracic deformities in neonatal Burmese kittens.

Any assets that could be used by the enemy may be targeted. This usually includes obvious weapons, transport vehicles, communication sites, and industrial resources. However, anything useful to the advancing enemy can be targeted including food stores and agricultural areas, water sources, and even the local people themselves, although this has been banned under the [[Additional Protocol II|1977 Geneva Conventions]]. The practice can be carried out by the [[military]] in enemy territory, or in its own home territory while being invaded. It may overlap with, but it is not the same as, punitive destruction of the enemy's resources, which is usually done as part of political strategy, rather than operational strategy.\n\nThe concept of ''scorched earth'' is sometimes applied figuratively to the business world, where a firm facing a takeover attempt will make itself less valuable by selling off its assets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Willcox|first1=Tilton|date=January 1988|title=The Use and Abuse of Executive Powers in Warding off Corporate Raiders|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=7|issue=1/2|pages=51}}</ref>\n\nNotable historic examples of scorched-earth tactics include [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Tecumseh Sherman's]] [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in [[the American Civil War]], Colonel [[Kit Carson]]'s subjugation of the American Navajo Indians, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener's]] advance against the [[Boers]], the setting of fire to 605-732 oil wells by retreating [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraqi]] military forces in the [[Gulf War]]. Also notable were the Russian army's strategies during the failed [[Swedish invasion of Russia]], the failed [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleonic invasion of Russia]], as well as the initial Soviet retreat commanded by [[Joseph Stalin]] during the German Army's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Second World War]],<ref>John Graham Royde-Smith, Encyclopedia Britannica online.

The relevant passage says:\n\n{{quote|It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm |title=Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Convention, 1977 |publisher=Deoxy.org |date=1954-05-14 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ancient history==\nThe [[Scythians]] used scorched-earth methods against King [[Darius the Great]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], during [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his European Scythian campaign]]. The Scythians, who were nomadic herders, evaded the Persians and retreated into the depths of the Steppes, destroying food supplies and [[Well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Many of Darius' troops died from starvation and dehydration.\n\nThe Greek general [[Xenophon]] records in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' that the [[Armenians]] burned their crops and food supplies as they withdrew before the advance of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]].\n\nThe Greek mercenary general [[Memnon of Rhodes|Memnon]] suggested to the Persian [[Satraps]] the use of the scorched-earth policy against Alexander as he moved into Asia Minor. He was refused.\n\n===Roman warfare===\nThe system of punitive destruction of property and subjugation of people when accompanying a military campaign was known as ''vastatio''. Two of the first uses of scorched earth recorded both happened in the [[Gallic Wars]]. The first was used when the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Helvetii]] were forced to evacuate their homes in Southern Germany and Switzerland because of incursions of unfriendly Germanic tribes: to add incentive to the march, the Helvetii destroyed everything they could not bring.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard A. |last=Billows |title=Julius Caesar: The Colossus of Rome |isbn=9781134318322|date=2008 }}</ref> After the Helvetii were defeated by a combined Roman-Gallic force, the Helvetii were forced to rebuild themselves on the shattered German{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and Swiss plains they themselves had destroyed.\n\nThe second case shows actual military value: during the [[Battle of Alesia|Great Gallic War]] the [[Gauls]] under [[Vercingetorix]] planned to lure the Roman armies into Gaul and then trap and obliterate them. They thus ravaged the countryside of what are now the [[Benelux]] countries and France. That caused immense problems for the Romans, but the Roman military triumphs over the Gallic alliance showed that alone not to be enough to save Gaul from subjugation by Rome.\n\nDuring the [[Second Punic War]] in 218\u2013202 BC, the Carthaginians used the method selectively while storming through [[Ancient Rome|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Dexter |last=Hoyos |title=A Companion to the Punic Wars |isbn=9781444393705|date=2011}}</ref> After the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, the Roman Senate also elected to use this method to permanently destroy the Carthaginian capital city, [[Carthage]] (near modern-day [[Tunis]]).

Julian might expect, that a conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved... the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert.

[[Vlad the Impaler]] retreated to [[Transylvania]]. During his departure, he conducted scorched-earth tactics to ward off Sultan Mehmed II's approach. When the Ottoman forces approached [[Tirgoviste]], they encountered over 20,000 people [[impalement|impaled]] by the forces of Vlad the Impaler, creating a \"forest\" of dead or dying bodies on stakes.

Furthermore, the Knights [[Well poisoning|poisoned all wells]] with bitter herbs and dead animals. The Ottomans arrived on 18 May of that year, and the [[Great Siege of Malta]] began. The Ottomans managed to capture one fort but were eventually defeated by the Knights, the Maltese militia and a Spanish relief force.\n\n===Nine Years' War===\nIn 1688, France attacked the German [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. The German states responded to this by forming an alliance and assembling a sizeable armed force to push the French out of Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the Rhineland ''blitz'' would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, [[Louis XIV]] and his War Minister [[Marquis de Louvois]] resolved upon a scorched-earth policy in the Palatinate, [[Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], intent on denying enemy troops local resources and prevent them from invading French territory.<ref name=\"childs17\">Childs (1991), p. 17.</ref> By 20 December 1688 Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and ch\u00e2teaux intended for destruction.

(Although effective food-preserving techniques had recently been invented, they were still not fit for military use because a suitably rugged container had not yet been invented.)<ref>{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Von Pivka |title=The King's German Legion |isbn=9781472801692|date=2013}}</ref> The command was obeyed as a result of French plundering and general ill-treatment of civilians in the previous invasions, the poor, angered people would rather destroy anything that had to be left behind rather than leaving it to the French.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Bussaco|Bussaco]], Massen\u00e1's army marched on to [[Coimbra]] where much of the [[University of Coimbra|city's old university]] and library were vandalised, houses and furniture were destroyed and the few civilians that did not seek refuge further south were murdered. While there were instances of similar behavior by British soldiers, considering that Portugal was their ally, such crimes were generally investigated, and those found punished. Coimbra's sack made the populace even more determined in leaving nothing and when the French armies reached the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]] on the way to [[Lisbon]], French soldiers reported that the country \"seemed to empty ahead of them\".  When Massen\u00e1 reached the city of [[Viseu]], wanting to replenish his armies' dwindling food supplies, none of the inhabitants remained, and all there was to eat were grapes and lemons that, if eaten in large quantities, would be better laxatives than sources of calories. Low morale, hunger, disease, and indiscipline rendered the French Army of Portugal into a much weaker force and compelled their retreat next spring. This method was later recommended to Russia when Napoleon made his move.\n\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] retreat from Moscow]]\nIn 1812 Czar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was able to render [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Russia]] useless by utilizing a scorched-earth retreat method, similar to that made by the Portuguese.<ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2013|reason = Chandler's \"Campaigns of Napoleon\" (the source) makes no explicit reference to a scorched-earth policy.

Pushing relentlessly on despite dwindling numbers, the Grand Army met with disaster as the invasion progressed. Napoleon's army arrived in a virtually abandoned Moscow, which was a tattered starving shell of its former self that was largely due to the use of scorched-earth tactics by retreating Russians. Having essentially conquered nothing, Napoleon's troops retreated, and again the scorched-earth policy came into effect because even though some large supply dumps had been established on the advance, the route between these had both been scorched and marched over once already, so the French army starved as it marched along the resource-depleted invasion route.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/1812/Russia/c_bridges.html |title=Rivers and the Destruction of Napoleon's Grand Army |publisher=napoleon-series.org}}</ref>\n\n===South American War of Independence===\nIn August 1812, [[Argentina|Argentine]] General [[Manuel Belgrano]] led the [[Jujuy Exodus]], a massive forced displacement of people from the present-day [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]] provinces to the south. The Jujuy Exodus was conducted by the patriot forces of the [[Army of the North]] that were battling a [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] army.\n\nBelgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and follow him, in carriages or on foot, together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks, and also any objects made of iron) was to be burned, so as to deprive the loyalists of resources, following a strict scorched-earth policy. On 29 July 1812, Belgrano asked the people of Jujuy to \"show their [[hero]]ism\" and join the march of the army under his command \"if, as you assure, you want to be free\". The punishment for ignoring the order was execution and the destruction of the defector's properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need of force.\n\nThe exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]]; people travelled south about 250&nbsp;km, finally arriving at the banks of the Pasaje River, in the province of [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]], on the early hours of 29 August.

Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage under the direction of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners, if at home, and turn the property over to officers of the quartermaster or commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northern depots.

Since a scorched-earth campaign requires that there be a war of movement, the Western Front of World War I provided little opportunity in general for this policy as it was a stalemated war fought mostly in the same concentrated area for its entire duration.\n\n===Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)===\n{{main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)#Greek scorched earth policy}}\n\nDuring the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]], the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}}  Historian of the Middle East, [[Sydney Nettleton Fisher]] wrote that: \"The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path.\"{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}} [[Norman Naimark|Norman M.

Due to the Japanese scorched-earth policy, immense environmental and infrastructure damage have been recorded. Additionally, it contributed to the complete destruction of entire villages and partial destruction of entire cities like [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]] or [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing]].\n\nThe Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] destroyed dams and levees in an attempt to flood the land to slow down the advancement of Japanese soldiers, further adding to the environmental impact. This policy resulted in the [[1938 Huang He flood]].\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-087-3693-07A,_Russland,_brennende_Ortschaft.jpg|thumb|[[Nazi Germany]]'s scorched-earth policy in the Soviet Union, 1943.

Burning houses / huts in village\".]]\n\nAt the start of the Russo-Finnish [[Winter War]], the Finns used the tactic in the vicinity of the border in order to deprive the invading Soviets provisions and shelter, for the forthcoming cold winter. In some cases fighting took place in areas familiar to the actual Finnish soldiers fighting it. There were accounts of soldiers burning down their very own homes and parishes. One of the burned parishes was [[Battle of Suomussalmi|Suomussalmi]].\n\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941]], many district governments took the initiative to begin a 'partial' scorched-earth policy in order to deny the invaders access to electrical, telecommunications, rail, and industrial resources. Parts of the telegraph network were destroyed, some rail and road bridges were blown up, most electrical generators were sabotaged through the removal of key components, and many mineshafts were collapsed. {{citation needed|reason=If Stalin ordered this there should be a clear source for his order as they are public by now|date=October 2015}} The process was repeated later in the war by the German forces of [[Army Group North]] and [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[Army Group Don]], which stole crops, destroyed farms, and razed settlements of at least city size and smaller during several military operations. The rationale for this policy was that it would slow pursuing Soviet forces by forcing them to save their own civilians, though in [[Verlorene Siege|Manstein's postwar memoirs]] at the very least the policy was justified as a means of preventing the Soviets from stealing the food and shelter from their own civilians. The best-known victims of the German scorched-earth policy were the people of the historic city of [[Novgorod]], whose hometown was razed during the Winter of 1944 to cover Army Group North's retreat from [[Leningrad]].\n\nNear the end of the Summer of 1944, [[Finland]], which had made a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was required to evict the German forces, which had been fighting against the Soviets alongside Finnish troops in the Northern part of the country. The Finnish forces, under the leadership of general [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], struck aggressively in August 1944 by making a landfall at [[Tornio]]. This accelerated the German retreat, and by November 1944 the Germans had left most of northern Finland. The German forces, forced to retreat due to an overall strategic situation, covered their retreat towards [[Norway]] by devastating large areas of northern Finland using scorched-earth strategy. More than one-third of the dwellings in the area were destroyed, and the provincial capital [[Battle of Rovaniemi|Rovaniemi]] was burned to the ground. All but two bridges in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland Province]] were blown up and all roads were mined.<ref>See [[Lapland War]]</ref> In Northern Norway which was at the same time invaded by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in pursuit of the retreating German army in 1944, the Germans also undertook a scorched-earth policy, destroying every building that could offer shelter and thus interposing a belt of \"scorched earth\" between themselves and the allies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Derry |first=T.

Any assets that could be used by the enemy may be targeted. This usually includes obvious weapons, transport vehicles, communication sites, and industrial resources. However, anything useful to the advancing enemy can be targeted including food stores and agricultural areas, water sources, and even the local people themselves, although this has been banned under the [[Additional Protocol II|1977 Geneva Conventions]]. The practice can be carried out by the [[military]] in enemy territory, or in its own home territory while being invaded. It may overlap with, but it is not the same as, punitive destruction of the enemy's resources, which is usually done as part of political strategy, rather than operational strategy.\n\nThe concept of ''scorched earth'' is sometimes applied figuratively to the business world, where a firm facing a takeover attempt will make itself less valuable by selling off its assets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Willcox|first1=Tilton|date=January 1988|title=The Use and Abuse of Executive Powers in Warding off Corporate Raiders|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=7|issue=1/2|pages=51}}</ref>\n\nNotable historic examples of scorched-earth tactics include [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Tecumseh Sherman's]] [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in [[the American Civil War]], Colonel [[Kit Carson]]'s subjugation of the American Navajo Indians, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener's]] advance against the [[Boers]], the setting of fire to 605-732 oil wells by retreating [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraqi]] military forces in the [[Gulf War]]. Also notable were the Russian army's strategies during the failed [[Swedish invasion of Russia]], the failed [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleonic invasion of Russia]], as well as the initial Soviet retreat commanded by [[Joseph Stalin]] during the German Army's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Second World War]],<ref>John Graham Royde-Smith, Encyclopedia Britannica online.

The relevant passage says:\n\n{{quote|It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm |title=Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Convention, 1977 |publisher=Deoxy.org |date=1954-05-14 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ancient history==\nThe [[Scythians]] used scorched-earth methods against King [[Darius the Great]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], during [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his European Scythian campaign]]. The Scythians, who were nomadic herders, evaded the Persians and retreated into the depths of the Steppes, destroying food supplies and [[Well poisoning|poisoning wells]]. Many of Darius' troops died from starvation and dehydration.\n\nThe Greek general [[Xenophon]] records in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' that the [[Armenians]] burned their crops and food supplies as they withdrew before the advance of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]].\n\nThe Greek mercenary general [[Memnon of Rhodes|Memnon]] suggested to the Persian [[Satraps]] the use of the scorched-earth policy against Alexander as he moved into Asia Minor. He was refused.\n\n===Roman warfare===\nThe system of punitive destruction of property and subjugation of people when accompanying a military campaign was known as ''vastatio''. Two of the first uses of scorched earth recorded both happened in the [[Gallic Wars]]. The first was used when the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Helvetii]] were forced to evacuate their homes in Southern Germany and Switzerland because of incursions of unfriendly Germanic tribes: to add incentive to the march, the Helvetii destroyed everything they could not bring.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard A. |last=Billows |title=Julius Caesar: The Colossus of Rome |isbn=9781134318322|date=2008 }}</ref> After the Helvetii were defeated by a combined Roman-Gallic force, the Helvetii were forced to rebuild themselves on the shattered German{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and Swiss plains they themselves had destroyed.\n\nThe second case shows actual military value: during the [[Battle of Alesia|Great Gallic War]] the [[Gauls]] under [[Vercingetorix]] planned to lure the Roman armies into Gaul and then trap and obliterate them. They thus ravaged the countryside of what are now the [[Benelux]] countries and France. That caused immense problems for the Romans, but the Roman military triumphs over the Gallic alliance showed that alone not to be enough to save Gaul from subjugation by Rome.\n\nDuring the [[Second Punic War]] in 218\u2013202 BC, the Carthaginians used the method selectively while storming through [[Ancient Rome|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Dexter |last=Hoyos |title=A Companion to the Punic Wars |isbn=9781444393705|date=2011}}</ref> After the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, the Roman Senate also elected to use this method to permanently destroy the Carthaginian capital city, [[Carthage]] (near modern-day [[Tunis]]).

Julian might expect, that a conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved... the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert.

[[Vlad the Impaler]] retreated to [[Transylvania]]. During his departure, he conducted scorched-earth tactics to ward off Sultan Mehmed II's approach. When the Ottoman forces approached [[Tirgoviste]], they encountered over 20,000 people [[impalement|impaled]] by the forces of Vlad the Impaler, creating a \"forest\" of dead or dying bodies on stakes.

Furthermore, the Knights [[Well poisoning|poisoned all wells]] with bitter herbs and dead animals. The Ottomans arrived on 18 May of that year, and the [[Great Siege of Malta]] began. The Ottomans managed to capture one fort but were eventually defeated by the Knights, the Maltese militia and a Spanish relief force.\n\n===Nine Years' War===\nIn 1688, France attacked the German [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. The German states responded to this by forming an alliance and assembling a sizeable armed force to push the French out of Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the Rhineland ''blitz'' would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, [[Louis XIV]] and his War Minister [[Marquis de Louvois]] resolved upon a scorched-earth policy in the Palatinate, [[Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], intent on denying enemy troops local resources and prevent them from invading French territory.<ref name=\"childs17\">Childs (1991), p. 17.</ref> By 20 December 1688 Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and ch\u00e2teaux intended for destruction.

(Although effective food-preserving techniques had recently been invented, they were still not fit for military use because a suitably rugged container had not yet been invented.)<ref>{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Von Pivka |title=The King's German Legion |isbn=9781472801692|date=2013}}</ref> The command was obeyed as a result of French plundering and general ill-treatment of civilians in the previous invasions, the poor, angered people would rather destroy anything that had to be left behind rather than leaving it to the French.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Bussaco|Bussaco]], Massen\u00e1's army marched on to [[Coimbra]] where much of the [[University of Coimbra|city's old university]] and library were vandalised, houses and furniture were destroyed and the few civilians that did not seek refuge further south were murdered. While there were instances of similar behavior by British soldiers, considering that Portugal was their ally, such crimes were generally investigated, and those found punished. Coimbra's sack made the populace even more determined in leaving nothing and when the French armies reached the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]] on the way to [[Lisbon]], French soldiers reported that the country \"seemed to empty ahead of them\".  When Massen\u00e1 reached the city of [[Viseu]], wanting to replenish his armies' dwindling food supplies, none of the inhabitants remained, and all there was to eat were grapes and lemons that, if eaten in large quantities, would be better laxatives than sources of calories. Low morale, hunger, disease, and indiscipline rendered the French Army of Portugal into a much weaker force and compelled their retreat next spring. This method was later recommended to Russia when Napoleon made his move.\n\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] retreat from Moscow]]\nIn 1812 Czar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was able to render [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Russia]] useless by utilizing a scorched-earth retreat method, similar to that made by the Portuguese.<ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2013|reason = Chandler's \"Campaigns of Napoleon\" (the source) makes no explicit reference to a scorched-earth policy.

Pushing relentlessly on despite dwindling numbers, the Grand Army met with disaster as the invasion progressed. Napoleon's army arrived in a virtually abandoned Moscow, which was a tattered starving shell of its former self that was largely due to the use of scorched-earth tactics by retreating Russians. Having essentially conquered nothing, Napoleon's troops retreated, and again the scorched-earth policy came into effect because even though some large supply dumps had been established on the advance, the route between these had both been scorched and marched over once already, so the French army starved as it marched along the resource-depleted invasion route.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/1812/Russia/c_bridges.html |title=Rivers and the Destruction of Napoleon's Grand Army |publisher=napoleon-series.org}}</ref>\n\n===South American War of Independence===\nIn August 1812, [[Argentina|Argentine]] General [[Manuel Belgrano]] led the [[Jujuy Exodus]], a massive forced displacement of people from the present-day [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]] provinces to the south. The Jujuy Exodus was conducted by the patriot forces of the [[Army of the North]] that were battling a [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] army.\n\nBelgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and follow him, in carriages or on foot, together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks, and also any objects made of iron) was to be burned, so as to deprive the loyalists of resources, following a strict scorched-earth policy. On 29 July 1812, Belgrano asked the people of Jujuy to \"show their [[hero]]ism\" and join the march of the army under his command \"if, as you assure, you want to be free\". The punishment for ignoring the order was execution and the destruction of the defector's properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need of force.\n\nThe exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]] and [[Salta Province|Salta]]; people travelled south about 250&nbsp;km, finally arriving at the banks of the Pasaje River, in the province of [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]], on the early hours of 29 August.

Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage under the direction of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners, if at home, and turn the property over to officers of the quartermaster or commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northern depots.

Since a scorched-earth campaign requires that there be a war of movement, the Western Front of World War I provided little opportunity in general for this policy as it was a stalemated war fought mostly in the same concentrated area for its entire duration.\n\n===Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)===\n{{main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)#Greek scorched earth policy}}\n\nDuring the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]], the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}}  Historian of the Middle East, [[Sydney Nettleton Fisher]] wrote that: \"The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path.\"{{Sfn | Fisher | 1969 | p = 386}} [[Norman Naimark|Norman M. Naimark]] noted that \"the Greek retreat was even more devastating for the local population than the occupation\".{{Sfn | Naimark | 2002 | p = [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=L-QLXnX16kAC |page=46 }} 46]}}\n\n===Second Sino-Japanese War===\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had a scorched-earth policy, known as \"[[Three Alls Policy]]\". Due to the Japanese scorched-earth policy, immense environmental and infrastructure damage have been recorded. Additionally, it contributed to the complete destruction of entire villages and partial destruction of entire cities like [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing]] or [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing]].\n\nThe Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] destroyed dams and levees in an attempt to flood the land to slow down the advancement of Japanese soldiers, further adding to the environmental impact. This policy resulted in the [[1938 Huang He flood]].\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-087-3693-07A,_Russland,_brennende_Ortschaft.jpg|thumb|[[Nazi Germany]]'s scorched-earth policy in the Soviet Union, 1943. Photograph taken by a [[Propagandakompanie|Wehrmacht propaganda company]]; original 1943 caption reads: \"Russia. Burning houses / huts in village\".]]\n\nAt the start of the Russo-Finnish [[Winter War]], the Finns used the tactic in the vicinity of the border in order to deprive the invading Soviets provisions and shelter, for the forthcoming cold winter. In some cases fighting took place in areas familiar to the actual Finnish soldiers fighting it. There were accounts of soldiers burning down their very own homes and parishes. One of the burned parishes was [[Battle of Suomussalmi|Suomussalmi]].\n\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941]], many district governments took the initiative to begin a 'partial' scorched-earth policy in order to deny the invaders access to electrical, telecommunications, rail, and industrial resources. Parts of the telegraph network were destroyed, some rail and road bridges were blown up, most electrical generators were sabotaged through the removal of key components, and many mineshafts were collapsed. {{citation needed|reason=If Stalin ordered this there should be a clear source for his order as they are public by now|date=October 2015}} The process was repeated later in the war by the German forces of [[Army Group North]] and [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[Army Group Don]], which stole crops, destroyed farms, and razed settlements of at least city size and smaller during several military operations. The rationale for this policy was that it would slow pursuing Soviet forces by forcing them to save their own civilians, though in [[Verlorene Siege|Manstein's postwar memoirs]] at the very least the policy was justified as a means of preventing the Soviets from stealing the food and shelter from their own civilians. The best-known victims of the German scorched-earth policy were the people of the historic city of [[Novgorod]], whose hometown was razed during the Winter of 1944 to cover Army Group North's retreat from [[Leningrad]].\n\nNear the end of the Summer of 1944, [[Finland]], which had made a separate peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was required to evict the German forces, which had been fighting against the Soviets alongside Finnish troops in the Northern part of the country. The Finnish forces, under the leadership of general [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], struck aggressively in August 1944 by making a landfall at [[Tornio]]. This accelerated the German retreat, and by November 1944 the Germans had left most of northern Finland. The German forces, forced to retreat due to an overall strategic situation, covered their retreat towards [[Norway]] by devastating large areas of northern Finland using scorched-earth strategy. More than one-third of the dwellings in the area were destroyed, and the provincial capital [[Battle of Rovaniemi|Rovaniemi]] was burned to the ground. All but two bridges in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland Province]] were blown up and all roads were mined.<ref>See [[Lapland War]]</ref> In Northern Norway which was at the same time invaded by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in pursuit of the retreating German army in 1944, the Germans also undertook a scorched-earth policy, destroying every building that could offer shelter and thus interposing a belt of \"scorched earth\" between themselves and the allies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Derry |first=T.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran).

Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari.

The cheetah will stalk its prey, trying to conceal itself in cover, and try to approach as close as possible, often within {{convert|60|to|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey (or even farther for less alert prey). Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly. Cheetahs kill their prey by tripping it during the chase by hitting its rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance, bringing it down with much force and sometimes even breaking one of its limbs.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs can decelerate extremely fast towards the end of the hunt, slowing down from {{convert|58|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|14|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} in just three strides, and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee.<ref name=hunterwcw/> To kill medium- to large-sized prey the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it and lies down, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey stops struggling. A bite on the nape of the neck or the snout (and sometimes on the skull) suffices to kill smaller prey.<ref name = wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25\u201340%, higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey.<ref name = \"O'Brien\" /><ref name=hunterwcw/>\n\nOnce the hunt is over, the prey is taken near a bush or a tree; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes.

Groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully, though minor noises and snapping may be observed.<ref name=wcw/> Cheetahs can consume large quantities of food; a cheetah at the [[Etosha National Park]] was found to consume as much as {{convert|10|kg|lb}} within two hours.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Phillips |first1 = J.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran). To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls, and hitting the ground with the paws.<ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; this may be due to [[vulture]]s and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy [[carrion|carcasses]] within a short time; male cheetahs often take kills from females.<ref name=hunterwcw/><ref name=wcw/><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Houston |first1 = D.

The cheetah to be brought into captivity in a zoo was at the Zoological Society of London in 1829; more individuals began to be held 1851 onward in many other European zoos, and in 1871 a cheetah was exhibited at the Central Park Zoo (New York). The early captive cheetahs showed a high mortality rate, with an average lifespan of 3\u20134 years. From 1955 to 2014, more than 2000 cheetahs have been taken into zoological institutions; initially wild cheetahs were captured from eastern Africa (mainly Kenya and Somalia), but as numbers plummeted in these areas Namibia led in cheetah exports from the late 1960s. After trade of wild cheetahs was delimited by the enforcement of [[CITES]] in 1975, more efforts were put into breeding in captivity; in 2014 the number of captive cheetahs worldwide was estimated at around 1730 individuals, with 87% born in captivity.<ref name=marker22>{{cite book |editor1=Marker, L. |editor2=Boast, L.

This elevated susceptibility to disease, especially contagious ones, has often been attributed to the low genetic variability in cheetahs; studies in the 1990s, however, showed that morbidity and mortality are mostly due to [[degenerative disease]]s instead, and are often linked to factors of captive life.<ref name=marker25>{{cite book |editor1=Marker, L. |editor2=Boast, L.

The widely adopted form of two equal-length strokes connecting in an [[acute angle]] at the right, '''>''', has been found in documents dated as far back as the 1560s. In mathematical writing, the greater-than sign is typically placed between two values being compared and signifies that the first number is greater than the second number.

The widely adopted form of two equal-length strokes connecting in an [[acute angle]] at the right, '''>''', has been found in documents dated as far back as the 1560s. In mathematical writing, the greater-than sign is typically placed between two values being compared and signifies that the first number is greater than the second number.

He is a former journalist and editor.\n\nA prominent journalist, Pashinyan first founded his own newspaper in 1998 which was shut down a year later. He was sentenced for one year for defamation against then Minister of National Security [[Serzh Sargsyan]]. He edited ''Haykakan Zhamanak'' (Armenian Times) from 1999 to 2012. Sympathetic to  Armenia's first president [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], he was highly critical of second president [[Robert Kocharyan]], Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and their allied oligarchs. Pashinyan led a minor opposition party in the [[2007 Armenian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], garnering 1.3% of the vote. He was an outspoken supporter of Ter-Petrosyan, when the latter made a political comeback prior to the [[2008 Armenian presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. Ter-Petrosyan was defeated by Serzh Sargsyan in an election marred with widespread vote fraud and violence. Noted for his fiery speeches, Pashinyan had a significant role in the [[2008 Armenian presidential election protests|post-election protests]] which were violently put down by government forces on 1 March 2008 resulting in the deaths of 10 people. Pashinyan, blamed for \"organizing mass disorders,\" went into hiding, only to re-emerge in mid-2009. He was controversially sentenced to seven years in prison; a move that was widely seen as politically motivated. He was released in May 2011 as part of a general amnesty. He was [[2012 Armenian parliamentary election|elected]] to parliament from Ter-Petrosyan's broad opposition coalition, the [[Armenian National Congress]], in 2012.\n\nHe later broke from Ter-Petrosyan on political grounds, establishing the party [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]]. Along with two other opposition parties, Pashinyan formed the [[Way Out Alliance]] which garnered almost 8% of the vote in the [[2017 Armenian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]]. He was the leader of the [[2018 Armenian revolution]] which forced Prime Minister [[Serzh Sargsyan]] and his government to resign. On 1 May 2018, he failed to gain enough votes from the [[National Assembly (Armenia)|Parliament]] to become the Prime Minister himself, but was elected in the second vote on 8 May.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/europe/armenia-new-prime-minister-nikol-pashinyan-intl/index.html|title=Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan elected prime minister|last=Vonberg|first=Judith|date=8 May 2018|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nNikol Pashinyan was born on June 1, 1975 in [[Ijevan]], in the northeastern province of [[Tavush]].

Pashinyan led a minor opposition party in the [[2007 Armenian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], garnering 1.3% of the vote. He was an outspoken supporter of Ter-Petrosyan, when the latter made a political comeback prior to the [[2008 Armenian presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. Ter-Petrosyan was defeated by Serzh Sargsyan in an election marred with widespread vote fraud and violence. Noted for his fiery speeches, Pashinyan had a significant role in the [[2008 Armenian presidential election protests|post-election protests]] which were violently put down by government forces on 1 March 2008 resulting in the deaths of 10 people. Pashinyan, blamed for \"organizing mass disorders,\" went into hiding, only to re-emerge in mid-2009. He was controversially sentenced to seven years in prison; a move that was widely seen as politically motivated. He was released in May 2011 as part of a general amnesty. He was [[2012 Armenian parliamentary election|elected]] to parliament from Ter-Petrosyan's broad opposition coalition, the [[Armenian National Congress]], in 2012.\n\nHe later broke from Ter-Petrosyan on political grounds, establishing the party [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]]. Along with two other opposition parties, Pashinyan formed the [[Way Out Alliance]] which garnered almost 8% of the vote in the [[2017 Armenian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]]. He was the leader of the [[2018 Armenian revolution]] which forced Prime Minister [[Serzh Sargsyan]] and his government to resign. On 1 May 2018, he failed to gain enough votes from the [[National Assembly (Armenia)|Parliament]] to become the Prime Minister himself, but was elected in the second vote on 8 May.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/08/europe/armenia-new-prime-minister-nikol-pashinyan-intl/index.html|title=Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan elected prime minister|last=Vonberg|first=Judith|date=8 May 2018|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nNikol Pashinyan was born on June 1, 1975 in [[Ijevan]], in the northeastern province of [[Tavush]].

Before the Motera Stadium came into existence, international cricket matches in the city were played at [[Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]]'s [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad|stadium of the same name]] (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a {{convert|100|acre|m2|adj=on}} stretch of land on the banks of the [[Sabarmati River]] for the construction of a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was carried out in a span of nine months.<ref name='htold'>{{cite news|title=Why Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera, Ahmedabad will make cricket history|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/why-sardar-patel-stadium-in-motera-ahmedabad-will-make-cricket-history/story-7b59h4SZG5yHl7BGkg9agK.html|accessdate=10 Dec 2016|newspaper=HindustanTimes|date=10 December 2016|author=HT Correspondent}}</ref> Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted here.

In 1996, the ground hosted a low-scoring Test match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], where the visitors faltered while chasing 170 to win, ending up at 105 all out. [[Javagal Srinath]] took six wickets in the fourth innings of the match. However, South Africa had their revenge when they bowled India out for 76 runs in the first session of the Test match in 2008 and went on to win the game by an innings and 90 runs.\n\n===2006-2015 (Rise to Prominence)===\nThe stadium had become of the focal venues of [[ICC Champions Trophy]] in 2006,  with hosting five of the 15 games played. In order to host such an organization, the stadium had gone into a comprehensive renovation that includes three new pitches and a new outfield. Moreover, floodlights and covered stands were introduced at the stadium as a part of the renovation program.\n\nThe Motera Stadium has hosted games whenever India has hosted the [[Cricket World Cup]], including the first match of the 1996 World Cup between [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. However, while it hosted only one game each in the 1987 and 1996 editions, the stadium was given three games in the 2011 World Cup, including the quarter-final between [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and [[India cricket team|India]]. Sachin Tendulkar became the first-ever cricketer to score 18,000 runs in One Day International cricket, during that match. As of 19 August 2017, it has hosted 12 Tests, 23 ODIs and 1 T20I.\n\n===2015-2020 (Reconstruction)===\n[[File:President_Trump_and_the_First_Lady_in_India_(49579268442).jpg|thumb|US President [[Donald Trump]] and Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] at the Sardar Patel Stadium, 24 February 2020.]]\nIn October 2015, the stadium was demolished to allow for reconstruction. Though some media cite it as 'renovation', the original venue was completely demolished. Hence, effectively it is an entirely new stadium in place. The total cost of reconstruction was estimated to be [[Indian Rupee|\u20b9]]700 crores.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} However, the final cost has been reported at [[Indian Rupee|\u20b9]]800 crores. The redevelopment, originally planned to be completed in 2019, was accomplished finally by February 2020.\n\n====Conception====\nReportedly, the idea to make the new stadium was proposed by [[Narendra Modi]], then the president of the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] and the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Shortly before Modi moved to Delhi as the [[Prime Minister of India]], there were discussions about minor upgrades to the stadium and development of the structure at the pavilion end. When informed about the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], Modi asked the officials to build a new larger stadium instead of minor renovation work.<ref name=\"Gujarat soon to have the largest stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/news/sports/2019/09/16/Gujarat-will-soon-have-world-largest-cricket-stadium-All-you-need-to-know.html|title=Motera stadium: All you need to know}}</ref> The stadium has often been touted as one of his dream projects.\n\n====Bids====\nAfter starting the demolition work at the end of 2015, the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] issued a tender notice on January 1, 2016 in [[The Times of India]] and [[The Indian Express]]. Nine bidders showed interest and purchased the tender documents, out of which three actually submitted Technical and Financial bids on time. The three bidders were the [[Shapoorji Pallonji Group]], Nagarjuna Construction Company, and [[Larsen & Toubro]]. A Tender Commercial Committee (TCC) of nine experts was formed for the evaluation of tenders. Additionally, STUP Consultants was appointed as the Project Management Consultant to evaluate proposals and technical details of each bid working with the TCC.<ref name=\"Motera Stadium - GCA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gujaratcricketassociation.com/page/motera-stadium|title=GCA \u2013 Motera Stadium}}</ref>\n\nEach of the three bidders presented their designs, models, and technical details of their concepts & designs. Because of the sheer size and complexity of the project, the bidders were evaluated on multiple parameters like efficiency, resources, the time frame of completion, ease of implementation, etc. The bidders were ranked and weighted on all of the parameters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bids Submitted for Motera Reconstruction\n!

A unique feature of the Stadium is the LED lights on the roof instead of the usual floodlights at cricket grounds. This will be the first of its kind design in India. The LED lights are installed on an anti-bacterial, fireproof canopy with PTFE membrane that covers 30 metres of the total 55 metres breadth of sitting area. The roof has been designed by the company [[Walter P Moore]], been specifically designed to be lightweight and separate from the seating bowls in order to allow for movement in times of seismic activity, making it fairly earthquake resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walterpmoore.com/projects/motera-cricket-stadium-roof-design|title=Motera Stadium roof design}}</ref> The structure eliminates the need for pillars, giving spectators an unobstructed view of the entire field from any place in the Stadium.\n \nOutside of the main ground, the Stadium will be able to accommodate several other features, including an olympic sized swimming pool, indoor cricket academy, badminton and tennis courts, squash arena, table tennis area, 3D projector theatre and a clubhouse with three practice grounds and 50 rooms.<ref name=\"World's largest stadium to host POTUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/kem-chho-trump-world-largest-cricket-stadium-all-set-to-host-potus/story/396505.html|title=Motera Stadium ready to host POTUS|work=Business Today}}</ref> The parking lot can accommodate 3,000 cars and 10,000 two-wheelers.

Moreover, floodlights and covered stands were introduced at the stadium as a part of the renovation program.\n\nThe Motera Stadium has hosted games whenever India has hosted the [[Cricket World Cup]], including the first match of the 1996 World Cup between [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. However, while it hosted only one game each in the 1987 and 1996 editions, the stadium was given three games in the 2011 World Cup, including the quarter-final between [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and [[India cricket team|India]]. Sachin Tendulkar became the first-ever cricketer to score 18,000 runs in One Day International cricket, during that match. As of 19 August 2017, it has hosted 12 Tests, 23 ODIs and 1 T20I.\n\n===2015-2020 (Reconstruction)===\n[[File:President_Trump_and_the_First_Lady_in_India_(49579268442).jpg|thumb|US President [[Donald Trump]] and Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] at the Sardar Patel Stadium, 24 February 2020.]]\nIn October 2015, the stadium was demolished to allow for reconstruction. Though some media cite it as 'renovation', the original venue was completely demolished. Hence, effectively it is an entirely new stadium in place. The total cost of reconstruction was estimated to be [[Indian Rupee | \u20b9]]700 crores.{{cn|date=April 2020}} However, the final cost has been reported at [[Indian Rupee | \u20b9]]800 crores. The redevelopment, originally planned to be completed in 2019, was accomplished finally by February 2020.\n\n====Conception====\nReportedly, the idea to make the new stadium was proposed by [[Narendra Modi]], then the president of the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] and the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Shortly before Modi moved to Delhi as the [[Prime Minister of India]], there were discussions about minor upgrades to the stadium and development of the structure at the pavilion end. When informed about the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], Modi asked the officials to build a new larger stadium instead of minor renovation work.<ref name=\"Gujarat soon to have the largest stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/news/sports/2019/09/16/Gujarat-will-soon-have-world-largest-cricket-stadium-All-you-need-to-know.html|title=Motera stadium: All you need to know}}</ref> The stadium has often been touted as one of his dream projects.\n\n====Bids====\nAfter starting the demolition work at the end of 2015, the [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] issued a tender notice on January 1, 2016 in [[The Times of India]] and [[The Indian Express]]. Nine bidders showed interest and purchased the tender documents, out of which three actually submitted Technical and Financial bids on time. The three bidders were the [[Shapoorji Pallonji Group]], Nagarjuna Construction Company, and [[Larsen & Toubro]]. A Tender Commercial Committee (TCC) of nine experts was formed for the evaluation of tenders. Additionally, STUP Consultants was appointed as the Project Management Consultant to evaluate proposals and technical details of each bid working with the TCC.<ref name=\"Motera Stadium - GCA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gujaratcricketassociation.com/page/motera-stadium|title=GCA \u2013 Motera Stadium}}</ref>\n\nEach of the three bidders presented their designs, models, and technical details of their concepts & designs. Because of the sheer size and complexity of the project, the bidders were evaluated on multiple parameters like efficiency, resources, the time frame of completion, ease of implementation, etc. The bidders were ranked and weighted on all of the parameters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Bids Submitted for Motera Reconstruction\n!

A unique feature of the Stadium is the LED lights on the roof instead of the usual floodlights at cricket grounds. This will be the first of its kind design in India. The LED lights are installed on an anti-bacterial, fireproof canopy with PTFE membrane that covers 30 metres of the total 55 metres breadth of sitting area. The roof has been designed by the company [[Walter P Moore]], been specifically designed to be lightweight and separate from the seating bowls in order to allow for movement in times of seismic activity, making it fairly earthquake resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walterpmoore.com/projects/motera-cricket-stadium-roof-design|title=Motera Stadium roof design}}</ref> The structure eliminates the need for pillars, giving spectators an unobstructed view of the entire field from any place in the Stadium.\n \nOutside of the main ground, the Stadium will be able to accommodate several other features, including an olympic sized swimming pool, indoor cricket academy, badminton and tennis courts, squash arena, table tennis area, 3D projector theatre and a clubhouse with three practice grounds and 50 rooms.<ref name=\"World's largest stadium to host POTUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/kem-chho-trump-world-largest-cricket-stadium-all-set-to-host-potus/story/396505.html|title=Motera Stadium ready to host POTUS|work=Business Today}}</ref> The parking lot can accommodate 3,000 cars and 10,000 two-wheelers. The Motera Stadium also has a huge ramp designed to facilitate the movement of around 60,000 people simultaneously.
