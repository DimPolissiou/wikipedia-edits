A 13-year-old girl, Juliett is the only daughter of the patriarch of the [[House of Capulet]]. She falls in love with the main protagonist [[Rodrigo Montague|Rodrigo]], a member of the [[House of Montague]], with which the Capulets have a [[blood feud]]. The [[The Tragical History of Rodrigous and Juliett|story]] has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself.\n\n[[File:Juliett - Philip H. Calderon.jpg|thumb|right|''Juliett'' by [[Philip H. Calderon]] (1888)]]\n\n== Juliet's age ==\nOne aspect of the story which now seems problematic is Juliet's age. As the story occurs, Juliet is approaching her fourteenth birthday. She was born on \"[[Lammas]] Eve at night\" (1 August), so Juliet's birthday is 31 July (1.3.19). Her birthday is \"a fortnight hence\", putting the action of the play in mid-July (1.3.17). Her father states that she \"hath not seen the change of fourteen years\" (1.2.9). In many cultures and time periods, women did and do marry and bear children at an early age. ''Romeo and Juliet'' is a play about Italian families. Lady Capulet had given birth to her first child by the time she had reached Juliet's age: \"By my count, I was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid.\" (1.3.74\u201375).\n\nEven Capulet tries to encourage Paris to wait a little longer before even thinking of marrying his daughter, feeling that she is still too young; \"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride\". However, in the English poem the story is based on (''Romeus and Juliet'' by [[Arthur Brooke (poet)|Arthur Brooke]])<ref name=\"Romeus and Juliet\">[http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/shakespeare/romeus.html The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet], Arthur Brooke.</ref> Juliet is approaching her sixteenth birthday and Romeo is the same age whereas in the [[Bandello]] novella she is nearly eighteen with Romeo about twenty.<ref name=\"Franson, J.

That the parts of young women were played by pre-adolescent boys in Shakespeare's day also cannot be overlooked and it is possible that Shakespeare had the physique of a young boy in mind during composition, in addition to the fact that Romeo and Juliet are of wealthy families and would be more likely to marry earlier than commoners.<ref>Laslett, Peter. 1965.

Therefore, eighteen came to be considered the earliest reasonable age for motherhood and twenty and thirty the ideal ages for women and men, respectively, to marry. Shakespeare might also have reduced Juliet's age from sixteen to thirteen to demonstrate the dangers of marriage at too young of an age; that Shakespeare himself married [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]] when he was just eighteen might hold some significance.<ref name=\"Franson, J.

The real second name was in Italian Cappelletti, a noble family, and not Capuleti. Cappelletti were in the past members of the light cavalry of the Republic of Venice. They fought for it since the 13th century and they were originally from Dalmatia and Albania. It features the balcony, and in the small courtyard, a bronze statue of Juliet. It is one of the most visited sites in the town. The metal of its chest is worn bare due to a legend that if a person [[statue rubbing|strokes]] the right breast of the statue, that person will have good fortune and luck in love.<ref name=\"igougo\" />\n\nMany people write their names and the names of their beloved ones on the walls of the entrance, known as Juliet's wall. Many believe that writing on that place will make their love everlasting. After a restoration and cleaning of the building, it was intended that further writing should be on replaceable panels<ref name=\"Veronissima\" /> or white sheets<ref name=\"PremioTerna\" /> placed outside the wall.\n\nIt is also a tradition to put small love letters on the walls (which is done by the thousands each year), which are regularly taken down by employees to keep the courtyard clean.<ref name=\"DesenzanoItaly\" />\n\nAnother tradition that occurs in Juliet's courtyard is writing your name and that of your loved one on a lock and attaching it to a large ornamental gate in the back left. The gate is overwhelmed with locks that hold hope for lasting love. This tradition is seen throughout Europe on bridges and gates all over cities.\n\n=== Club di Giulietta ===\nSince the 1930s, letters addressed to Juliet keep arriving in Verona.

Held on 3 May 2019 at the [[Khalifa International Stadium]], it was the first leg of the [[2019 IAAF Diamond League]] \u2013 the highest level international track and field circuit.\n\nA total of eight [[world-leading performance]]s were set at the competition, three of which were also meeting records. [[Daniel St\u00e5hl]] of Sweden gave the highlight of the meeting with six straight [[discus throw]]s beyond 69.50&nbsp;m (the first man ever to deliver such as series) including a Diamond League record of 70.56 m. [[Caster Semenya]] of South Africa won the women's [[800 metres]] in a meet record of 1:54.98 minutes and American [[Dalilah Muhammad]] improved the previous women's [[400 metres hurdles]] record with her time of 53.61 seconds. The other world leaders on the men's side came from [[Nijel Amos]] of Botswana (1:44.29 in the 800&nbsp;m), Kenyan [[Elijah Manangoi]] (3:32.21 in the [[1500 metres]]) and [[Soufiane El Bakkali]] of Morocco (8:07.22 in the [[3000 metres steeplechase]]). Great Britain's [[Dina Asher-Smith]] ran a world leading time of 22.26 to win the women's [[200 metres]] and Kenya's [[Hellen Obiri]] overcame [[Genzebe Dibaba]] to win the women's [[3000 metres]] in 8:25.60 minutes. The latter was among the highlights of the meet in terms of strength in depth, as it saw eight athletes achieve lifetime bests. The men's [[shot put]] also produced high quality performances, with winner [[Ryan Crouser]] and runner-up [[Tom Walsh (shot putter)|Tom Walsh]] both going beyond twenty-two metres.<ref>Ramsak, Bob (2019-05-03).

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n=== Initial attack ===\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship \u2018Formidable\u2019 breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n===Breaking the Line===\n\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the Ville de Paris under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|Diadem]] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless Glorieux). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the Formidable on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the Formidables three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe Diadem appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The Formidable was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS Repulse]] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS Ajax]] under Captain Nicholas Charrington.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]], to the south, also immediately capitalized on the opportunity and led the rearmost of the British ships through the French line, inflicting significant damage. The French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}}, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n[[File:Barnard's History of England - Rodney accepts the surrender of deGrasse.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1785 engraving of de Grasse surrendering to Rodney.]]\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

He was created a [[Peerage|peer]] with \u00a32,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity for this victory. Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===Initial encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n=== Initial attack ===\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian.

At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n===Breaking the Line===\n\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the Ville de Paris under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|Diadem]] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless Glorieux). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the Formidable on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the Formidables three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe Diadem appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The Formidable was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS Repulse]] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS Ajax]] under Captain Nicholas Charrington.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]], to the south, also immediately capitalized on the opportunity and led the rearmost of the British ships through the French line, inflicting significant damage. The French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}}, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|220px|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n[[File:Barnard's History of England - Rodney accepts the surrender of deGrasse.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1785 engraving of de Grasse surrendering to Rodney.]]\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

He won two general elections (1911, 1917) and lost two (1904, 1908).  From 1911 to 1917, he led a Conservative government and from 1917 to 1920 led a Unionist coalition, formed over the issue of [[conscription crisis of 1917|military conscription]].\n\nBorden was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] eight times (1896, 1900, 1905, 1908 (twice), 1911 (twice), and 1917).\n\nBorden retired in 1920 and was succeeded by [[Arthur Meighen]].\n\n== Summary ==\n\n[[File:Canada provinces 1905-1912.png|thumb|left|Canada in 1911, when Borden was elected Prime Minister.]]\n[[File:Canada provinces 1927-1949.png|thumb|right|Canada at the end of Borden's time in office]]\nBorden ranks eighth out of twenty-three [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|prime ministers for time in office]].  He became Prime Minister in 1911, after defeating [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] and the Liberals, and was in office for a total of 8 years and 274 days. He served two consecutive terms, the first leading a [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative]] government (1911 to 1917), the second leading a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] coalition government (1917 to 1920).<ref name = PMs>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/primeMinisters PARLINFO:  Prime Ministers of Canada.]</ref>\n\nBorden was the third of three prime ministers from Nova Scotia, the other two being [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]] and [[Charles Tupper|Sir Charles Tupper]].\n\nBorden lost the first two general elections he contested, in 1904 and 1908, defeated in both cases by Laurier and the Liberals.  He won the third general election, in 1911, while Laurier became the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nBorden led Canada during World War I.  One of the major political issues during the war was the [[conscription crisis of 1917]].  Borden formed a coalition with Liberals who supported his conscription policy and led the coalition as the Government (Unionist) Party.  Those Liberals who opposed the conscription policy remained with the leadership of Laurier, and fought the election as the Opposition ([[Laurier Liberals]]) party.\n\nBorden stood for election to the House of Commons of Canada nine times (1896, 1900, 1904, 1905 (by-election), 1908 (twice), 1911 (twice), and 1917), although two of those were multiple elections in the same general election, as was permitted at that time.   He was elected eight times (twice by acclamation) and defeated once (1904).  At various times, Borden was elected for three different constituencies in two different provinces:  [[Halifax (electoral district)|Halifax]], Nova Scotia;  [[Carleton (Ontario electoral district)|Carleton]], Ontario;  and [[Kings (electoral district)|Kings]], Nova Scotia. He served in the Commons for a total of 25 years, 1 month, and 25 days.<ref name = LoP>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=15531 PARLINFO:  The Right Hon.

He served two consecutive terms, the first leading a [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative]] government (1911 to 1917), the second leading a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] coalition government (1917 to 1920).<ref name = PMs>[https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/primeMinisters PARLINFO:  Prime Ministers of Canada.]</ref>\n\nBorden was the third of three prime ministers from Nova Scotia, the other two being [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]] and [[Charles Tupper|Sir Charles Tupper]].\n\nBorden lost the first two general elections he contested, in 1904 and 1908, defeated in both cases by Laurier and the Liberals.  He won the third general election, in 1911, while Laurier became the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nBorden led Canada during World War I.  One of the major political issues during the war was the [[conscription crisis of 1917]].  Borden formed a coalition with Liberals who supported his conscription policy and led the coalition as the Government (Unionist) Party.  Those Liberals who opposed the conscription policy remained with the leadership of Laurier, and fought the election as the Opposition ([[Laurier Liberals]]) party.\n\nBorden stood for election to the House of Commons of Canada nine times (1896, 1900, 1904, 1905 (by-election), 1908 (twice), 1911 (twice), and 1917), although two of those were multiple elections in the same general election, as was permitted at that time.   He was elected eight times (twice by acclamation) and defeated once (1904).  At various times, Borden was elected for three different constituencies in two different provinces:  [[Halifax (electoral district)|Halifax]], Nova Scotia;  [[Carleton (Ontario electoral district)|Carleton]], Ontario;  and [[Kings (electoral district)|Kings]], Nova Scotia.

Laurier was again his opponent, leading those Liberals who opposed the conscription policy.  The election and the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|conscription crisis]] badly divided the country between English-Canadians, who tended to support conscription, and French-Canadians, who opposed it.
