He also contested the Jewish [[blood libel]] during the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair|Hilsner trial]].\n\n==Early career==\nMasaryk served in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]] from 1891 to 1893 with the [[Young Czech Party]] and from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1900. At that time, he was not yet campaigning for Czech and Slovak independence from Austria-Hungary. Masaryk helped [[Hinko Hinkovi\u0107]] defend the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] during their 1909 Vienna [[political trial]]; its members were sentenced to a total of over 150 years in prison, with a number of death sentences.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter, Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States and Japan. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote a number of articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk was pivotal in establishing the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] in Russia as an effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held a Serbian passport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430|website=www.novosti.rs}}</ref> In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]), where the student society and senior common room are named after him.

He published \"Racial Problems in Hungary\", with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the French government of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend professor [[Pavel Miliukov]] an origin{{clarify|reason=what is origin?|date=January 2020}} and a state of Czechoslovak legions in Russia in London in that time. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] he proceeded to Russia to help organize the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], a group dedicated to Slavic resistance to the Austrians.\n\nOn 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914, and was attached to the Russian Third Army.\n\nFrom its start, Masaryk wanted to develop the legion from a battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. In early 1916, it was reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. After the Czechoslovak troops' performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]] (when they overran Austrian trenches), the Russian provisional government granted Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (\u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd sbor na Rusi, also known as the Czechoslovak Legion \u2013 \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 legie). A second division of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 by 1918.\n\nMasaryk formed a good connection with supreme commanders Russian army, [[Mikhail Alekseyev]], [[Aleksei Brusilov]], [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] and [[Mikhail Diterikhs]], in [[Mogilev]], from May 1917.\n\nMasaryk traveled to the United States in 1918, where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. On 5&nbsp;May 1918, over 150,000 [[Chicago]]ans filled the streets to welcome him; Chicago was the center of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States, and the city's reception echoed his earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902 (Masaryk had lectured at the university in 1902 and 1907). He also had strong links to the United States, with his marriage to an American citizen and his friendship with Chicago industrialist [[Charles R. Crane]], who had Masaryk invited to the University of Chicago and introduced to the highest political circles (including Wilson). Except of the president Wilson and the secretary of the state [[Robert Lansing]] this was [[Ray Stannard Baker]] , W. Phillips, Polk, Long, Lane, D. F. Houston, [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], [[Harry Pratt Judson]] and the French ambassador [[Jean Jules Jusserand]]. And [[Bernard Baruch]], Vance McCormick, [[Edward N. Hurley]], Samuel M. Vauclain, [[Colonel House]] too. On Chicago meeting in 8 October 1918 Chicago industrialist [[Samuel Insull]] introduced him as the president of future Czechoslovak Republik de facto and mentioned his legions.<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

On 14 November of that year, he was [[1918 Czechoslovak presidential election|elected]] president of Czechoslovakia by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. On 22 December, Masaryk publicly denounced the Germans in Czechoslovakia as settlers and colonists.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=140}}\n\nMasaryk was re-elected three times: in May [[1920 Czechoslovak presidential election|1920]], [[1927 Czechoslovak presidential election|1927]], and [[1934 Czechoslovak presidential election]]. A provision in the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]] exempted him from its two-term limit.\n\nOn paper, Masaryk's presidential power was limited; the framers of the constitution intended to create a parliamentary system in which the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|prime minister]] and cabinet hold actual power. However, a complex system of [[proportional representation]] made it all but impossible for one party to win a majority; no party ever won more than 25 percent of the vote. Usually, ten or more parties received the 2.6 percent of votes needed for seats in the National Assembly. These factors resulted in frequent changes of government; there were ten cabinets, headed by nine statesmen, during Masaryk's tenure. His presence gave Czechoslovakia a large measure of stability. This stability, combined with his domestic and international prestige, gave Masaryk's presidency more power and influence than the framers of the constitution intended.\n\nHe used his authority in Czechoslovakia to create the [[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]] (the Castle), an extensive, informal political network. Under Masaryk's watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in Central Europe.\n\nMasaryk visited France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Hoover]], he sponsored the first Prague International Management Congress, a July 1924 gathering of 120 global labour experts (of which 60 were from the [[United States]]), organized with Masaryk Academy of Labour.<ref>Proceedings from 1.PIMCO \"Encyclopedy of Performance\", 2500 pages (3 volumes \"Man\", \"Production\", \"Business\") Masaryk Academy of Labour, Prague 1924 - 1926</ref> After the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], Masaryk was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern.

He also contested the Jewish [[blood libel]] during the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair|Hilsner trial]].\n\n==Early career==\nMasaryk served in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]] from 1891 to 1893 with the [[Young Czech Party]] and from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Czech Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1900. At that time, he was not yet campaigning for Czech and Slovak independence from Austria-Hungary. Masaryk helped [[Hinko Hinkovi\u0107]] defend the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] during their 1909 Vienna [[political trial]]; its members were sentenced to a total of over 150 years in prison, with a number of death sentences.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter, Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States and Japan. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote a number of articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk was pivotal in establishing the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] in Russia as an effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held a Serbian passport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430|website=www.novosti.rs}}</ref> In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (now part of [[University College London]]), where the student society and senior common room are named after him.

He published \"Racial Problems in Hungary\", with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the French government of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend professor [[Pavel Miliukov]] an origin{{clarify|reason=what is origin?|date=January 2020}} and a state of Czechoslovak legions in Russia in London in that time. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] he proceeded to Russia to help organize the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], a group dedicated to Slavic resistance to the Austrians.\n\nOn 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914, and was attached to the Russian Third Army.\n\nFrom its start, Masaryk wanted to develop the legion from a battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. In early 1916, it was reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. After the Czechoslovak troops' performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]] (when they overran Austrian trenches), the Russian provisional government granted Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (\u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd sbor na Rusi, also known as the Czechoslovak Legion \u2013 \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 legie). A second division of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 by 1918.\n\nMasaryk formed a good connection with supreme commanders Russian army, [[Mikhail Alekseyev]], [[Aleksei Brusilov]], [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] and [[Mikhail Diterikhs]], in [[Mogilev]], from May 1917.\n\nMasaryk traveled to the United States in 1918, where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. On 5&nbsp;May 1918, over 150,000 [[Chicago]]ans filled the streets to welcome him; Chicago was the center of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States, and the city's reception echoed his earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902 (Masaryk had lectured at the university in 1902 and 1907). He also had strong links to the United States, with his marriage to an American citizen and his friendship with Chicago industrialist [[Charles R. Crane]], who had Masaryk invited to the University of Chicago and introduced to the highest political circles (including Wilson). Except of the president Wilson and the secretary of the state [[Robert Lansing]] this was [[Ray Stannard Baker]] , W. Phillips, Polk, Long, Lane, D. F. Houston, [[Sir William Wiseman, 10th Baronet|William Wiseman]], [[Harry Pratt Judson]] and the French ambassador [[Jean Jules Jusserand]]. And [[Bernard Baruch]], Vance McCormick, [[Edward N. Hurley]], Samuel M. Vauclain, [[Colonel House]] too.

Stearn]] and Czech Jaroslav C\u00edsa\u0159) as the basic document for the foundation of a new independent Czechoslovak state. Speaking on 26 October 1918 as head of the [[Mid-European Union]] in Philadelphia, Masaryk called for the independence of Czechoslovaks and the other oppressed peoples of central Europe.\n\n==Leader of Czechoslovakia==\n[[File:TGM Tabor 21.12.1918 3462a.jpg|thumb|alt=A serious-looking Masaryk and his daughter getting off a train, surrounded by people|Masaryk and his daughter, Olga, returning from exile in 21 December 1918]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13623, Tom\u00e1- Garrigue Masaryk.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Masaryk, seated with his legs crossed and saluting the photographer|Masaryk at Prague Old Town Square in 1932]]\n{{expand section|date=June 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2019}}\nWith the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the Allies recognized Masaryk as head of the provisional Czechoslovak government. On 14 November of that year, he was [[1918 Czechoslovak presidential election|elected]] president of Czechoslovakia by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. On 22 December, Masaryk publicly denounced the Germans in Czechoslovakia as settlers and colonists.{{sfn|Orzoff|2009|p=140}}\n\nMasaryk was re-elected three times: in May [[1920 Czechoslovak presidential election|1920]], [[1927 Czechoslovak presidential election|1927]], and [[1934 Czechoslovak presidential election]]. A provision in the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|1920 constitution]] exempted him from its two-term limit.\n\nOn paper, Masaryk's presidential power was limited; the framers of the constitution intended to create a parliamentary system in which the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|prime minister]] and cabinet hold actual power. However, a complex system of [[proportional representation]] made it all but impossible for one party to win a majority; no party ever won more than 25 percent of the vote. Usually, ten or more parties received the 2.6 percent of votes needed for seats in the National Assembly. These factors resulted in frequent changes of government; there were ten cabinets, headed by nine statesmen, during Masaryk's tenure. His presence gave Czechoslovakia a large measure of stability. This stability, combined with his domestic and international prestige, gave Masaryk's presidency more power and influence than the framers of the constitution intended.\n\nHe used his authority in Czechoslovakia to create the [[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]] (the Castle), an extensive, informal political network. Under Masaryk's watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in Central Europe.\n\nMasaryk visited France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Hoover]], he sponsored the first Prague International Management Congress, a July 1924 gathering of 120 global labour experts (of which 60 were from the [[United States]]), organized with Masaryk Academy of Labour.<ref>Proceedings from 1.PIMCO \"Encyclopedy of Performance\", 2500 pages (3 volumes \"Man\", \"Production\", \"Business\") Masaryk Academy of Labour, Prague 1924 - 1926</ref> After the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], Masaryk was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern. He resigned from office on 14 December 1935 because of old age and poor health, and was succeeded by [[Edvard Bene\u0161]].\n\n=={{anchor|Recognition}}Death and legacy==\n[[File:Statue of Masaryk in Prague, Apr 2012.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Urban statue of Masaryk|[[Statue of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, Prague|Statue]] of Masaryk in Prague]]\nMasaryk died less than two years after leaving office, at the age of 87, in [[L\u00e1ny (Kladno District)|L\u00e1ny]], Czechoslovakia (present-day [[Czech Republic]]). He did not live to see the [[Munich Agreement]] or the Nazi occupation of his country, and was known as the Grand (Great) Old Man of Europe.\n\n===Commemoration and awards===\nAs the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of Czechoslovakia, Masaryk is revered as [[George Washington]] is in the [[United States]]. Czechs and Slovaks regard him as a symbol of democracy.\n\nCommemorations of Masaryk have been held annually in the L\u00e1ny cemetery on his birthday and day of death (7 March and 14 September) since 1989.\n\nThe Czechoslovak, then Czech [[Order of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]], established in 1990, is an [[order (distinction)|honour]] awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to humanity, democracy and human rights.\n\n[[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]], founded in 1919 as Czechoslovakia's second university, was named after him when it was founded; after 30 years as Univerzita [[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b|Jana Evangelisty Purkyn\u011b]] v Brn\u011b, it was renamed for Masaryk in 1990.\n\nHe is commemorated by a number of statues, busts and plaques. Although most are in the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]], Masaryk has a [[Statue of Tomas Masaryk (Washington, D.C.)|statue]] on [[Embassy Row]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and in the [[Midway Plaisance]] park in [[Chicago]] and {{citation needed span|date=June 2019|text=is memorialised in [[San Francisco]]'s Golden Gate Park [[rose garden]].}} A plaque with a portrait of Masaryk is on the wall of a Rachiv, [[Ukraine]] hotel where he reportedly resided from 1917 to 1918, and a bust was erected in 2002 on Druzhba Narodiv Square (Friendship of Nations Square) in [[Uzhhorod]], Ukraine. Yugoslavia awarded him [[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star]].<ref>{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Acovi\u0107|first=Dragomir|title=Slava i \u010dast: Odlikovanja me\u0111u Srbima, Srbi me\u0111u odlikovanjima|year=2012|location=Belgrade|publisher=Slu\u017ebeni Glasnik|pages=369}}</ref>\n\n[[Avenida Presidente Masaryk]] (President Masaryk Avenue) is a main thoroughfare in [[Mexico City]], and [[Masaryktown, Florida]] is named for him.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H6xaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xk8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5126%2C1819266 | title=Into center of state | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=Mar 23, 1952 | accessdate=1 November 2015 | author=Blackstone, Lillian | page=19}}</ref> \n\nIn Israel, Masaryk is considered an important figure and a national friend. A village was named after him - [[Kfar Masaryk|Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk]] near Haifa, which was largely founded by Jewish immigrants from Czechoslovakia. One of the main squares in [[Tel Aviv]] is [[Masaryk Square]] (he had visited the city in 1927). In [[Haifa]], one of the junctions in the city was named after him as well. \nMany cities in Israel named streets after his name, including [[Jerusalem]], [[Petach Tikva]], [[Netanya]], [[Nahariya]] and others. A Masaryk forest was planted in the Western Galilee.<ref>https://www.kkl-jnf.org/about-kkl-jnf/green-israel-news/february-2019/kkl-czech-republic-michael-pakowski-birthday/</ref>.\n\nStreets in [[Zagreb]], [[Belgrade]], [[Dubrovnik]], [[Daruvar]], [[Vara\u017edin]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]] are named Masarykova ulica, and a main thoroughfare in [[Ljubljana]] is named after Masaryk.

A photograph of Masaryk leaning out of a train window, waving to and shaking hands with supporters, is the front cover for [[Faith No More]]'s 1997 album ''[[Album of the Year (Faith No More album)|Album of the Year]]''. Its [[liner notes]] include the funeral of an old man, with the words ''\"[[Truth prevails|pravda v\u00edt\u011bz\u00ed]]\"'' (\"Truth prevails\") adorning the coffin. The statement is the [[national motto|motto]] of the Czech Republic.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMasaryk's motto was \"Do not fear, and do not steal\" ({{lang-cz|Neb\u00e1t se a nekr\u00e1st}}). A philosopher and an outspoken [[rationalist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], he emphasised practical [[ethics]] reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philosophy and\u2014in particular\u2014the work of 18th-century German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who is considered the founder of nationalism. Masaryk was critical of [[German idealism]] and [[Marxism]].<ref>Masaryk, T.

[[Karel \u010capek]] wrote a series of articles, ''Hovory s T.G.M.'' (\"Conversations with T.G.M.\"), which were later collected as Masaryk's [[autobiography]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMasaryk married [[Charlotte Garrigue]] in 1878, and took her family name as his middle name. They met in [[Leipzig]], Germany, and became engaged in 1877. Garrigue was born in [[Brooklyn]] to a Protestant family with French [[Huguenots]] among their ancestors. She became fluent in Czech, and published articles in a Czech magazine.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Hardships during the war took their toll, and she died in 1923. Their son, [[Jan Masaryk|Jan]], was Czechoslovak ambassador in London, [[foreign minister]] in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile (1940\u20131945) and in the governments from 1945 to 1948.

He spent childhood holidays in [[County Sligo]] and studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by [[Irish mythology|Irish legends]] and the [[occult]]. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the poets of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and [[Literary realism|realistic]].

Soon after William's birth, the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo, to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his \"country of the heart\".{{sfn|Yeats|1994|p=vii}} So too did its location by the sea; John Yeats stated that \"by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs\".<ref>W.

While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty \"is manifestly true of W.B.Y.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxviii}} Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and the [[home rule]] movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxvii}}\n\nIn 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby [[Slough]] countryside.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=24}} On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the [[Godolphin and Latymer School|Godolphin school]],{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=28}} which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as \"only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject.

In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin's [[The High School, Dublin|Erasmus Smith High School]].{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=33}} His father's studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city's artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the ''Dublin University Review'' published Yeats's first poems, as well as an essay entitled \"The Poetry of [[Samuel Ferguson|Sir Samuel Ferguson]]\".

Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, \"utterly unIrish\", seeming to come out of a \"vast murmurous gloom of dreams\".{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=37}} Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, [[Edmund Spenser]], and on the diction and colouring of [[pre-Raphaelite]] verse, he soon turned to [[Irish mythology|Irish mythology and folklore]] and the writings of [[William Blake]].

The piece was serialized in the ''Dublin University Review''. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact, was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]] and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F.

''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899).

He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding.<ref>{{harvnb|Jordan|2003|pp=139\u2013153}}; {{harvnb|Jordan|1997|pp=83\u201388}}</ref>\n\nGonne's marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.{{sfn|Jordan|2000|pp=13\u2013141}}\n\n[[File:Portrait drawing of WB Yeats by JS Sargent.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Charcoal portrait of Yeats by [[John Singer Sargent]] (1908)]]\n\nYeats's friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. \"The long years of fidelity rewarded at last\" was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.\"<ref name=\"Cahill\" /> The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=394}} By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem \"A Man Young and Old\":{{sfn|Malins|Purkis|1994|page=124}}\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">My arms are like the twisted thorn\nAnd yet there beauty lay;\nThe first of all the tribe lay there\nAnd did such pleasure take;\nShe who had brought great [[Hector]] down\nAnd put all Troy to wreck.</poem>\n\nIn 1896, Yeats was introduced to [[Lady Gregory]] by their mutual friend [[Edward Martyn]]. Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], and [[Padraic Colum]], Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"[[Irish Literary Revival]]\" movement.<ref>Corcoran, Neil. ''After Yeats and Joyce: Reading Modern Irish Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. viii</ref> Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was [[Douglas Hyde]], later the first President of Ireland, whose ''Love Songs of Connacht'' was widely admired.\n\n=== Abbey Theatre ===\n{{main|Abbey Theatre}}\n[[File:WBYeats1908.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Yeats photographed in 1908 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] began the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] to present Irish plays.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=486, 662}} The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager ''\u00e0 l'anglais''.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=183}}<ref>Text reproduced from Yeats's own handwritten draft.</ref> The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory&nbsp;... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=184}}\n\nThe collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]], Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary [[Annie Horniman]], and the leading [[West End theatre|West End]] actress [[Florence Farr]], the group established the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the [[Abbey Theatre]]. Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen ni Houlihan (play)|Cathleen ni Houlihan]]'' and Lady Gregory's ''Spreading the News'' were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the [[Dun Emer Press]] to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the [[Cuala Press]] in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\"<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PR0203/PRirishgenius.htm \"Irish Genius: The Yeats Family and The Cuala Press\"]. [[Trinity College Dublin]], 12 February 2004. Retrieved on 2 June 2007.</ref> From then until its closure in 1946, the press\u2014which was run by the poet's sisters\u2014produced over 70 titles; 48 of them books by Yeats himself.\n\nYeats met the American poet [[Ezra Pound]] in 1909. Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered \"the only poet worthy of serious study.\"<ref>Monroe, Harriet (1913). \"Poetry\". (Chicago) Modern Poetry Association. 123</ref> From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at [[Ashdown Forest]], with Pound nominally acting as Yeats's secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese [[Noh]] plays that Pound had obtained from [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was ''At the Hawk's Well'', the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.<ref>Sands, Maren. \"[http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/phantasmagoria/sands.htm The Influence of Japanese Noh Theater on Yeats]\". Colorado State University. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThe emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"[[Easter, 1916]]\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]], due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=59\u201366}}\n\nYeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"[[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|The Wild Swans at Coole]]\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\n\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]]: ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902), and ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"<ref>{{citation |title= Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the Tuatha de Danann and of the Fianna of Ireland |first= Augusta |last= Lady Gregory |authorlink= Augusta, Lady Gregory |year= 1904 |url= https://archive.org/details/godsfightingmens00gregrich | page = xiv}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nYeats was an [[Irish Nationalist]], who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the [[Irish War of Independence|intense political landscape]] until [[Irish Civil War|1922]], when he was appointed Senator for the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Roy Foster: Yeats emerged as poet of Irish Revolution, despite past political beliefs|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/foster-418.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=18 April 2001}}</ref>{{sfn|Ellmann|1948|p=244}}\n\nIn the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].<ref>Sternlicht, Sanford V. ''A Reader's Guide to Modern Irish Drama'', Syracuse University Press, 1998, p. 48</ref> Due to the escalating tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the [[Easter Rising]], even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.\n\nIn the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the [[Blueshirts]], although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.<ref>Nally, Claire. 2010. ''Envisioning Ireland: W. B.

F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.\n\nYeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster, \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" [[Iseult Gonne]] was Maud's second child with [[Lucien Millevoye]], and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry, Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride.<ref>Gonne MacBride, Maud. ''A Servant of the Queen''. Gollanz, 1938 pp. 287\u2013289</ref> When Gonne took action to divorce MacBride in 1905, the court heard allegations that he had sexually assaulted Iseult, then eleven. At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult but was rejected.\n\nThat September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]] (1892\u20131968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends\u2014\"George&nbsp;... you can't. He must be dead\"\u2014Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October.<ref name=\"Cahill\" /> Their marriage was a success, in spite of the age difference, and in spite of Yeats's feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, [[Anne Yeats|Anne]] and [[Michael Yeats|Michael]]. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"<ref>Brown, Terence.

The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history, which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes: phases, cones, and gyres.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=105, 383}} Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as ''[[A Vision]]'' (1925). In 1924, he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie, admitting: \"I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books\".<ref name=\"Mann2\">Mann, Neil.

His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as ''The Isle of Statues'' and ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]]''.<ref>Howes, Marjorie. ''Yeats's nations: gender, class, and Irishness''. Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 28\u201331</ref> His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=153}} and attempt to turn himself into a [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]-style social ironist.<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Yeats''. Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 168 {{ISBN|0-19-501603-3}}</ref>\n\nCritics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of [[spiritualism]]. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of ''The Wanderings of Oisin'', is reproduced in ''A Dialogue Between Self and Soul''.<ref>[[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]]. ''Yeats the Initiate''. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1990, pp. 327\u2013329. {{ISBN|0-389-20951-1}}</ref>\n\nSome critics claim that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as [[Pablo Picasso]] did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] variety.<ref>Holdeman, David. ''The Cambridge Introduction to W. B. Yeats''. Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|9780521547376}}, p. 80</ref>\n\nModernists read the well-known poem \"[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]\" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with ''The Green Helmet'' (1910) and ''Responsibilities'' (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. ''The Tower'' (1928), ''The Winding Stair'' (1933), and ''New Poems'' (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.<ref>Spanos, William. \u2033Sacramental Imagery in the Middle and Late Poetry of W.

G. ''Transforming the Center, Eroding the Margins''. University of Rochester Press, 2004, p. 282. {{ISBN|1-58046-175-1}}</ref> which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility.

A pillar of the Irish literary establishment, he helped to found the [[Abbey Theatre]], and in his later years served two terms as a [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] of the [[Irish Free State]].

He spent childhood holidays in [[County Sligo]] and studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by [[Irish mythology|Irish legends]] and the [[occult]]. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the poets of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and [[Literary realism|realistic]]. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life.

Soon after William's birth, the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo, to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his \"country of the heart\".{{sfn|Yeats|1994|p=vii}} So too did its location by the sea; John Yeats stated that \"by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs\".<ref>W.

While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty \"is manifestly true of W.B.Y.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxviii}} Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and the [[home rule]] movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxvii}}\n\nIn 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby [[Slough]] countryside.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=24}} On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the [[Godolphin and Latymer School|Godolphin school]],{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=28}} which he attended for four years.

Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, \"utterly unIrish\", seeming to come out of a \"vast murmurous gloom of dreams\".{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=37}} Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, [[Edmund Spenser]], and on the diction and colouring of [[pre-Raphaelite]] verse, he soon turned to [[Irish mythology|Irish mythology and folklore]] and the writings of [[William Blake]].

The piece was serialized in the ''Dublin University Review''. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact, was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]] and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]], \"obscure Gaelic names, striking repetitions [and] an unremitting rhythm subtly varied as the poem proceeded through its three sections\":{{sfn|Foster|1997|pp=82\u201385}}\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">We rode in sorrow, with strong hounds three,\nBran, Sceolan, and Lomair,\nOn a morning misty and mild and fair.\nThe mist-drops hung on the fragrant trees,\nAnd in the blossoms hung the bees.\nWe rode in sadness above Lough Lean,\nFor our best were dead on Gavra's green.</poem>\n\n\"The Wanderings of Oisin\" is based on the lyrics of the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]] and displays the influence of both Sir Samuel Ferguson and the Pre-Raphaelite poets.<ref>Alspach, Russell K. \"The Use by Yeats and Other Irish Writers of the Folklore of Patrick Kennedy\".

''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899).

The society held its first meeting on 16 June, with Yeats acting as its chairman. The same year, the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin [[Mohini Mohun Chatterji|Mohini Chatterjee]], who travelled from the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]] in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first [[s\u00e9ance]] the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophy and with [[hermeticism]], particularly with the eclectic [[Rosicrucianism]] of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. During s\u00e9ances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself \"Leo Africanus\" apparently claimed it was Yeats's ''[[Daemon (mythology)|Daemon]]'' or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in ''Per Amica Silentia Lunae''.<ref>Nally, Claire V. \"National Identity Formation in W.

Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults, he was attracted to the type of people he met at the Golden Dawn.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=103}} He was involved in the Order's power struggles, both with Farr and [[Macgregor Mathers]], and was involved when Mathers sent [[Aleister Crowley]] to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the \"Battle of Blythe Road\".

He was horrified by Gonne's marriage, at losing his muse to another man; in addition, her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended him; Yeats was Protestant/agnostic. He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding.<ref>{{harvnb|Jordan|2003|pp=139\u2013153}}; {{harvnb|Jordan|1997|pp=83\u201388}}</ref>\n\nGonne's marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.{{sfn|Jordan|2000|pp=13\u2013141}}\n\n[[File:Portrait drawing of WB Yeats by JS Sargent.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Charcoal portrait of Yeats by [[John Singer Sargent]] (1908)]]\n\nYeats's friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. \"The long years of fidelity rewarded at last\" was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.\"<ref name=\"Cahill\" /> The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=394}} By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem \"A Man Young and Old\":{{sfn|Malins|Purkis|1994|page=124}}\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">My arms are like the twisted thorn\nAnd yet there beauty lay;\nThe first of all the tribe lay there\nAnd did such pleasure take;\nShe who had brought great [[Hector]] down\nAnd put all Troy to wreck.</poem>\n\nIn 1896, Yeats was introduced to [[Lady Gregory]] by their mutual friend [[Edward Martyn]]. Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], and [[Padraic Colum]], Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"[[Irish Literary Revival]]\" movement.<ref>Corcoran, Neil. ''After Yeats and Joyce: Reading Modern Irish Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. viii</ref> Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was [[Douglas Hyde]], later the first President of Ireland, whose ''Love Songs of Connacht'' was widely admired.\n\n=== Abbey Theatre ===\n{{main|Abbey Theatre}}\n[[File:WBYeats1908.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Yeats photographed in 1908 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] began the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] to present Irish plays.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=486, 662}} The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager ''\u00e0 l'anglais''.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=183}}<ref>Text reproduced from Yeats's own handwritten draft.</ref> The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory&nbsp;... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=184}}\n\nThe collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]], Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary [[Annie Horniman]], and the leading [[West End theatre|West End]] actress [[Florence Farr]], the group established the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the [[Abbey Theatre]]. Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen ni Houlihan (play)|Cathleen ni Houlihan]]'' and Lady Gregory's ''Spreading the News'' were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the [[Dun Emer Press]] to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the [[Cuala Press]] in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\"<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PR0203/PRirishgenius.htm \"Irish Genius: The Yeats Family and The Cuala Press\"].

Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered \"the only poet worthy of serious study.\"<ref>Monroe, Harriet (1913). \"Poetry\". (Chicago) Modern Poetry Association. 123</ref> From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at [[Ashdown Forest]], with Pound nominally acting as Yeats's secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese [[Noh]] plays that Pound had obtained from [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was ''At the Hawk's Well'', the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.<ref>Sands, Maren. \"[http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/phantasmagoria/sands.htm The Influence of Japanese Noh Theater on Yeats]\". Colorado State University. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThe emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"[[Easter, 1916]]\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]], due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=59\u201366}}\n\nYeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"[[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|The Wild Swans at Coole]]\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\n\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]]: ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902), and ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"<ref>{{citation |title= Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the Tuatha de Danann and of the Fianna of Ireland |first= Augusta |last= Lady Gregory |authorlink= Augusta, Lady Gregory |year= 1904 |url= https://archive.org/details/godsfightingmens00gregrich | page = xiv}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nYeats was an [[Irish Nationalist]], who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the [[Irish War of Independence|intense political landscape]] until [[Irish Civil War|1922]], when he was appointed Senator for the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Roy Foster: Yeats emerged as poet of Irish Revolution, despite past political beliefs|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/foster-418.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=18 April 2001}}</ref>{{sfn|Ellmann|1948|p=244}}\n\nIn the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].<ref>Sternlicht, Sanford V. ''A Reader's Guide to Modern Irish Drama'', Syracuse University Press, 1998, p. 48</ref> Due to the escalating tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the [[Easter Rising]], even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.\n\nIn the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the [[Blueshirts]], although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.<ref>Nally, Claire. 2010. ''Envisioning Ireland: W. B.

F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.\n\nYeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster, \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" [[Iseult Gonne]] was Maud's second child with [[Lucien Millevoye]], and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry, Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride.<ref>Gonne MacBride, Maud. ''A Servant of the Queen''. Gollanz, 1938 pp. 287\u2013289</ref> When Gonne took action to divorce MacBride in 1905, the court heard allegations that he had sexually assaulted Iseult, then eleven. At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult but was rejected.\n\nThat September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]] (1892\u20131968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends\u2014\"George&nbsp;... you can't.

The couple went on to have two children, [[Anne Yeats|Anne]] and [[Michael Yeats|Michael]]. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"<ref>Brown, Terence.

During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule.{{sfn|Foster|2003|p=468}} His later association with Pound drew him towards [[Benito Mussolini]], for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Moses\" /> He wrote three \"marching songs\"\u2014never used\u2014for the Irish General [[Eoin O'Duffy]]'s [[Blueshirts]].\n\n[[File:Chantry House, Steyning.jpg|thumb|[[Chantry House, Steyning|Chantry House]], [[Steyning]].

Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes.

The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France.

B. Yeats bibliography|:Category:Works by W. B. Yeats}}\n\nYeats is considered one of the key twentieth-century English-language poets. He was a [[Symbolist]] poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols<ref>[[Barry Ulanov|Ulanov, Barry]]. ''Makers of the Modern Theater''. McGraw-Hill, 1961</ref> is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.<ref>Gale Research International. ''Twentieth Century Literary Criticism'', No. 116''. Gale Cengage Learning, 2002, p. 303</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[modernism|modernists]] who experimented with [[free verse]], Yeats was a master of the traditional forms.<ref>Finneran, Richard. ''Yeats: An Annual of Critical and Textual Studies 1995''. University of Michigan Press, 1997. 82</ref> The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes ''In the Seven Woods'', ''Responsibilities'' and ''The Green Helmet''.<ref>Logenbach, James. ''Stone Cottage: Pound, Yeats, and Modernism''. Oxford University Press, 1988, pp. 13\u201314</ref> His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein, and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter,<ref>Bell, Vereen. ''Yeats and the logic of formalism''. University of Missouri Press, 2006. 132</ref> as well as meditations on the experience of growing old.{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=179}} In his poem, \"[[The Circus Animals' Desertion]]\", he describes the inspiration for these late works:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">Now that my ladder's gone\nI must lie down where all the ladders start\nIn the foul [[rag and bone]] shop of the heart.{{sfnp|O'Neill|2003|p=6}}</poem>\n\nDuring 1929, he stayed at [[Thoor Ballylee]] near [[Gort]] in [[County Galway]] (where Yeats had his summer home since 1919) for the last time. Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease [[Riversdale]] house in the Dublin suburb of [[Rathfarnham]] in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play ''[[Purgatory (drama)|Purgatory]]''. His ''Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats'' was published that same year.<ref>Martin, Wallace. Review of \"Tragic Knowledge: Yeats' \"Autobiography\" and Hermeneutics\" by Daniel T. O'Hara. ''Contemporary Literature''.

His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as ''The Isle of Statues'' and ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]]''.<ref>Howes, Marjorie. ''Yeats's nations: gender, class, and Irishness''. Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 28\u201331</ref> His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=153}} and attempt to turn himself into a [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]-style social ironist.<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Yeats''. Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 168 {{ISBN|0-19-501603-3}}</ref>\n\nCritics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of [[spiritualism]]. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of ''The Wanderings of Oisin'', is reproduced in ''A Dialogue Between Self and Soul''.<ref>[[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]]. ''Yeats the Initiate''. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1990, pp. 327\u2013329. {{ISBN|0-389-20951-1}}</ref>\n\nSome critics claim that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as [[Pablo Picasso]] did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] variety.<ref>Holdeman, David. ''The Cambridge Introduction to W. B. Yeats''. Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|9780521547376}}, p. 80</ref>\n\nModernists read the well-known poem \"[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]\" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with ''The Green Helmet'' (1910) and ''Responsibilities'' (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. ''The Tower'' (1928), ''The Winding Stair'' (1933), and ''New Poems'' (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.<ref>Spanos, William. \u2033Sacramental Imagery in the Middle and Late Poetry of W. B. Yeats.\u2033 ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language.''

G. ''Transforming the Center, Eroding the Margins''. University of Rochester Press, 2004, p. 282. {{ISBN|1-58046-175-1}}</ref> which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility.
