The repeated d in the first bar is the pedal point.<ref>Zinn, David (1981). ''The Structure & Analysis of the Modern Improvised Line'', p.\u00a0118. {{ISBN|978-0-935016-03-1}}.</ref> {{audio|Pedal tone example.mid|Play}}]]\n\nIn music, a '''pedal point''' (also '''pedal note''', '''organ point''', pedal tone, or pedal) is a [[sustain]]ed [[Musical note|tone]], typically in the [[bass note|bass]], during which at least one foreign (i.e. [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]]) harmony is sounded in the other [[part (music)|parts]]. A pedal point sometimes functions as a \"[[non-chord tone]]\", placing it in the categories alongside [[Suspension (music)|suspension]]s, [[Suspension (music)|retardation]]s, and [[passing tone]]s. However, the pedal point is unique among non-chord tones, \"in that it begins on a consonance, sustains (or [[repetition (music)|repeats]]) through another chord as a dissonance until the [[harmony]]\", not the non-chord tone, \"resolves back to a consonance\".<ref name=\"smu\">Frank, Robert J. (2000). [http://www.smu.edu/totw/nct.htm \"Non-Chord Tones\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703095155/http://www.smu.edu/TOTW/nct.htm |date=2007-07-03 }}, ''Theory on the Web'', Southern Methodist University.</ref>\n\n[[File:pedalpoint.gif|thumb|center|400px|Pedal point example. {{audio|Pedalpoint.mid|Play}}]]\n\nPedal points \"have a strong tonal effect, 'pulling' the harmony back to its [[root (chord)|root]]\".<ref name=\"smu\" /> When a pedal point occurs in a [[voice (music)|voice]] other than the bass, it is usually referred to as an '''inverted pedal point'''<ref name=\"B&S\">Benward & Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.\u00a099. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref> (see [[inversion (music)|inversion]]). Pedal points are usually on either the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] (fifth note of the [[scale (music)|scale]]) tones. The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a [[nonchord tone]] during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an [[added tone]] than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal [[pitch center]]s.\n\nThe term comes from the [[organ (music)|organ]] for its ability to sustain a note indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ's [[pedal keyboard]]. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual keyboards.\n\n==Types==\nA '''double pedal''' is two pedal tones played simultaneously.\nAn '''inverted pedal''' is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest part.)  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] included numerous inverted pedals in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his [[concerto]]s. An '''internal pedal''' is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.\n\nA [[drone (music)|drone]] differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a [[nonchord tone]] and thus required to [[Resolution (music)|resolve]], unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.\n\n==Use in classical music==\n\nThere are numerous examples of pedal points in European classical music. Pedal points often appear in early baroque music \"alla battaglia\", notably prolonged in [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]'s ''Es steh Gott auf'' (SWV 356) and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''Altri canti di Marte''.<ref>Gerald Drebes: \"Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \u201eVollkommenheit der Musik\u201c \u2013 \u201eEs steh Gott auf\u201c aus den \u201eSymphoniae sacrae\u201c II (1647)\".

(1996).

Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals.  A pedal tone can also be realized with a [[trill (music)|trill]]; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen [[harpsichord#Other|pedal harpsichord]], a harpsichord with a [[pedal keyboard]], makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.\n\nWith the development of the piano, composers began exploring the potential of a pedal-point in creating mood and atmosphere.  An example is the inverted pedal that pervades the right hand part of the piano accompaniment in [[Schubert]]\u2019s song [[Erlk\u00f6nig (Goethe)|''The Erl King'']]:\n[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 01.wav|thumb|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n\nAccording to Eugene Narmour (1987, p.&nbsp;101) \"There is no instrument on which a pedal point sounds better than the piano (with its ready-made damper mechanism), and, safe to say, no composer more fond of harmonic pedals than [[Chopin]].\"<ref>Narmour, E. (1987)  \"Melodic structuring of harmonic dissonance\" in Samson, J. (ed.) ''Chopin Studies''. Cambridge University Press.</ref>  An example is the Prelude in D{{music|flat}}, Op. 28, No. 15, (the \"Raindrop Prelude\") which, like the Purcell, features one repeated note throughout.  The piece is in [[ternary form]], with its serene outer \"A\" sections contrasting the brooding middle \"B\" section:\n[[File:Chopin, Prelude in D flat Major, Op. 28, No. 15, bars 20-31.wav|thumb|Chopin, Prelude in D{{music|flat}} Major, Op. 28, No. 15, bars 24\u201331]]\n[[File:Chopin Raindrop Prelude.png|thumb|center|500px|Chopin, Prelude in D{{music|flat}} Major, Op. 28, No. 15, bars 24\u201331]]\n\nIn this prelude, the repeated bass A{{music|flat}} that pervades the outer section becomes, through an [[enharmonic change]], a G{{music|sharp}} in the minor key middle section, where it moves from the bass to the top part.

A pedal point sometimes functions as a \"[[non-chord tone]]\", placing it in the categories alongside [[Suspension (music)|suspension]]s, [[Suspension (music)|retardation]]s, and [[passing tone]]s. However, the pedal point is unique among non-chord tones, \"in that it begins on a consonance, sustains (or [[repetition (music)|repeats]]) through another chord as a dissonance until the [[harmony]]\", not the non-chord tone, \"resolves back to a consonance\".<ref name=\"smu\">Frank, Robert J. (2000). [http://www.smu.edu/totw/nct.htm \"Non-Chord Tones\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703095155/http://www.smu.edu/TOTW/nct.htm |date=2007-07-03 }}, ''Theory on the Web'', Southern Methodist University.</ref>\n\n[[File:pedalpoint.gif|thumb|center|400px|Pedal point example. {{audio|Pedalpoint.mid|Play}}]]\n\nPedal points \"have a strong tonal effect, 'pulling' the harmony back to its [[root (chord)|root]]\".<ref name=\"smu\" /> When a pedal point occurs in a [[voice (music)|voice]] other than the bass, it is usually referred to as an '''inverted pedal point'''<ref name=\"B&S\">Benward & Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.\u00a099. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref> (see [[inversion (music)|inversion]]). Pedal points are usually on either the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] (fifth note of the [[scale (music)|scale]]) tones. The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a [[nonchord tone]] during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an [[added tone]] than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal [[pitch center]]s.\n\nThe term comes from the [[organ (music)|organ]] for its ability to sustain a note indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ's [[pedal keyboard]]. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual keyboards.\n\n==Types==\nA '''double pedal''' is two pedal tones played simultaneously.\nAn '''inverted pedal''' is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest part.)  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] included numerous inverted pedals in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his [[concerto]]s. An '''internal pedal''' is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.\n\nA [[drone (music)|drone]] differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a [[nonchord tone]] and thus required to [[Resolution (music)|resolve]], unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.\n\n==Use in classical music==\n\nThere are numerous examples of pedal points in European classical music. Pedal points often appear in early baroque music \"alla battaglia\", notably prolonged in [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]'s ''Es steh Gott auf'' (SWV 356) and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''Altri canti di Marte''.<ref>Gerald Drebes: \"Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \u201eVollkommenheit der Musik\u201c \u2013 \u201eEs steh Gott auf\u201c aus den \u201eSymphoniae sacrae\u201c II (1647)\".

Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals.  A pedal tone can also be realized with a [[trill (music)|trill]]; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen [[harpsichord#Other|pedal harpsichord]], a harpsichord with a [[pedal keyboard]], makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.\n\nWith the development of the piano, composers began exploring the potential of a pedal-point in creating mood and atmosphere.  An example is the inverted pedal that pervades the right hand part of the piano accompaniment in [[Schubert]]\u2019s song [[Erlk\u00f6nig (Goethe)|''The Erl King'']]:\n[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 01.wav|thumb|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n\nAccording to Eugene Narmour (1987, p.&nbsp;101) \"There is no instrument on which a pedal point sounds better than the piano (with its ready-made damper mechanism), and, safe to say, no composer more fond of harmonic pedals than [[Chopin]].\"<ref>Narmour, E. (1987)  \"Melodic structuring of harmonic dissonance\" in Samson, J. (ed.) ''Chopin Studies''. Cambridge University Press.</ref>  An example is the Prelude in D{{music|flat}}, Op. 28, No. 15, (the \"Raindrop Prelude\") which, like the Purcell, features one repeated note throughout.  The piece is in [[ternary form]], with its serene outer \"A\" sections contrasting the brooding middle \"B\" section:\n[[File:Chopin, Prelude in D flat Major, Op. 28, No. 15, bars 20-31.wav|thumb|Chopin, Prelude in D{{music|flat}} Major, Op. 28, No. 15, bars 24\u201331]]\n[[File:Chopin Raindrop Prelude.png|thumb|center|500px|Chopin, Prelude in D{{music|flat}} Major, Op. 28, No. 15, bars 24\u201331]]\n\nIn this prelude, the repeated bass A{{music|flat}} that pervades the outer section becomes, through an [[enharmonic change]], a G{{music|sharp}} in the minor key middle section, where it moves from the bass to the top part. There are other examples of piano music where a single note pervades almost the entire piece: a persistent B{{music|flat}} features in both [[Debussy]]\u2019s piano prelude [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVV0jkZC4jI \"Voiles\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhpX-CyTvfw \"Le Gibet\"] from [[Ravel]]\u2019s ''[[Gaspard de la Nuit]]''.\n\nThe term \"pedal point\" is also used to describe a bass note that is held for a long period in orchestral music, as in the symphonies of [[Jean Sibelius]].

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.

As a result, the organization initiated a long-term project that saw NBA players committing to play for the team long before the start of the 2008 Olympics (instead of hastily accepting invitations merely weeks prior to the start of the tournament). Many 2008 Olympians participated in the 2007 Americas championships, where the US won gold, thus qualifying for the Olympics.

Many 2008 Olympians participated in the 2007 Americas championships, where the US won gold, thus qualifying for the Olympics.

Led by \u00c9den Pastora, the Sandinistan forces captured the National Palace while the legislature was in session, taking 2,000 hostages. Pastora demanded money, the release of Sandinistan prisoners, and, \"a means of publicizing the Sandinista cause.\"<ref name=\"brown.edu\" /> After two days, the government agreed to pay $500,000 and to release certain prisoners, marking a major victory for the FSLN.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/> Revolts against the state continued as the Sandinistas received material support from Venezuela and Panama.

The country had suffered both war and, earlier, natural disaster in the devastating [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]]. In 1979, approximately 600,000 Nicaraguans were homeless and 150,000 were either refugees or in exile,<ref>[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Nicaragua, State-based conflict, In depth, Nicaragua under Sandinista rule, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=117&regionSelect=4-Central_Americas# [link is not working]</ref> out of a total population of just 2.8 million.<ref>evolution of demography in [[Nicaragua]] (1961\u20132003), Data FAOSTAT, http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/help-copyright/copyright-e.htm (last updated 11 February 2005)</ref>\n\nIn response to these issues, a state of emergency was declared. President Carter sent US$99 million in aid. Land and businesses of the Somoza regime were expropriated, the old courts were abolished, and workers were organized into Civil Defense Committees. The new regime also declared that \"elections are unnecessary\", which led to criticism from the Catholic Church, among others.<ref name=\"brown.edu\" />\n\n===Economic reforms===\n{{Expand section|date=September 2013}}\nThe Revolution ended the burden the Somocista regime had imposed upon the Nicaraguan economy and which had seriously deformed the country, creating a big and modern center, Managua, where Somoza's power had emanated to all corners of the territory. Somoza had developed an almost semifeudalist rural economy with few productive goods, such as cotton, sugar and other tropical agricultural products. All sectors of the economy of Nicaragua were determined, in great part if not entirely, by the Somozas or the officials and others surrounding the regime, whether by directly owning agricultural brands and trusts, or actively putting them into local or foreign hands. It is famously stated that Somoza himself owned 1/5 of all profitable land in Nicaragua. While this is not correct, Somoza or his adepts did own or give away banks, ports, communications, services and massive amounts of land.<ref>''SOL\u00c1 MONSERRAT, Roser. ''\"Geograf\u00eda y Estructura Econ\u00f3micas de Nicaragua\"'' (Nicaragua's Geography and Economical Structure). Universidad Centroamericana. Managua, Nicaragua, 1989. Second Edition.''</ref>\n\nThe Nicaraguan Revolution brought immense restructuring and reforms to all three sectors of the economy, directing it towards a [[mixed economy]] system. The biggest economic impact was on the primary sector, agriculture, in the form of the [[Agrarian Reform]], which was not proposed as something that could be planned in advanced from the beginning of the Revolution but as a process that would develop pragmatically along with the other changes (economic, political, etc.) that would arise during the Revolution period.<ref name=\"Sol\u00e1\">\"Agrarian Productive Structure in Nicaragua\", ''SOL\u00c1 MONSERRAT, Roser. 1989. Pag 69 and ss''.</ref>\n\nEconomic reforms overall needed to rescue out of limbo the inefficient and helpless Nicaraguan economy. As a \"[[third-world]]\" country, Nicaragua had, and has, an agriculture-based economy, undeveloped and susceptible to the flow of market prices for its agricultural goods, such as coffee and cotton. The Revolution faced a rural economy well behind in technology and, at the same time, devastated by the guerrilla warfare and the soon to come civil war against the [[Contras]].\n\n<blockquote>\nArticle 1 of the Agrarian Reform Law says that property is guaranteed if it laboured efficiently and that there could be different forms of property:\n*''state property'' (with the confiscated land from somocistas)\n*''cooperative property'' (part of confiscated land, but without individual certificates of ownership, to be laboured efficiently)\n*''communal property'' (in response to reinvindication from people and communities from [[Miskito people|Miskito]] regions in the [[Atlantic]])\n*''individual property'' (as long as this is efficiently exploited and integrated to national plans of development)<ref name=\"Sol\u00e1\"/>\n\nThe principles that presided Agrarian Reform were the same ones for the Revolution: pluralism, national unity and economic democracy.<ref name=\"Sol\u00e1\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Nicaraguan Agrarian Reform developed into four phases:\n# phase (1979): confiscation of property owned by Somocistas and its adepts\n# phase (1981): Agrarian Reform Law of 19 July 1981\n# phase (1984\u201385): massive cession of land individually, responding to demands from peasantry\n# phase (1986): Agrarian Reform Law of 1986, or \"reform to the 1981 Law\"\n\nIn 1985, the Agrarian Reform distributed {{convert|235000|acre|km2}} of land to the peasantry. This represented about 75 percent of all land distributed to peasants since 1980. According to Project, the agrarian reform had the twofold purpose of increasing the support for the government among the campesinos, and guaranteeing ample food delivery into the cities. During 1985, ceremonies were held throughout the countryside in which Daniel Ortega would give each peasant a title to the land and a rifle to defend it.<ref>Louis Proyect, ''Nicaragua'', about 4/5 of the way down.</ref>\n\n===Cultural Revolution===\nThe Nicaraguan Revolution brought many cultural improvements and developments. Undoubtedly, the most important was the planning and execution of the [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign]] ''(Cruzada Nacional de Alfabetizaci\u00f3n)''. The literacy campaign used secondary school students, university students as well as teachers as volunteer teachers. Within five months they reduced the overall [[illiteracy]] rate from 50.3% to 12.9%.<ref name=\"NLC\">{{cite news |first=Ulrike |last=Hanemann |title=Nicaragua's Literacy Campaign |url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/file_download.php/67b39f3aaf8f20da06be3c6a4e4c6dfeHanemann_U.doc|work=UNESCO|accessdate=2 July 2007 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703020810/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/file_download.php/67b39f3aaf8f20da06be3c6a4e4c6dfeHanemann_U.doc<!--Bot retrieved archive-->|archivedate=3 July 2007}}</ref> As a result, in September 1980, [[UNESCO]] awarded Nicaragua with the \"[[Nadezhda K.

It also founded an ''Instituto de Estudios del Sandinismo'' (Institute for Studies of [[Sandinismo]]) where it printed all of the work and papers of [[Augusto C. Sandino]] and those that cemented the ideologies of FSLN as well, such as [[Carlos Fonseca]], Ricardo Morales Avil\u00e9s and others.

Jewish citizens faced physical attacks, confiscation of property without cause, and arbitrary arrests. However, investigations conducted by the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]] and [[Pax Christi]] between 1979 and 1983 refuted allegations of anti-Semitism. Some Jewish people were expropriated for their collaboration with the [[Somoza]] regime, but not because they were Jewish. Moreover, there was the example of the high ranking Sandinista and mayor of [[Managua]], [[Herty Lewites]], who was of Jewish descent.<ref>https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1984/06/A/38020</ref>\n\n==Contra War==\n{{Further|Sandinista National Liberation Front#Sandinistas vs. Contras|Nicaraguan Democratic Force|Democratic Revolutionary Alliance|Contras|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#Nicaragua}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Contra commandas 1987.jpg|thumb|Contra Commandos from [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force|FDN]] and ARDE Frente Sur, [[Nueva Guinea]] area in 1987]]\n[[File:Smoke break el serrano 1987.jpg|thumb|Members of ARDE Frente Sur taking a smoke break after routing the [[FSLN]] garrison at El Serrano in southeast Nicaragua in 1987.]]\n\nAlthough the [[Carter Administration]] had attempted to work with FSLN in 1979 and 1980, the more [[right-wing]] [[Reagan Administration]] supported a strong anti-communist strategy for dealing with Latin America, and so it attempted to isolate the Sandinista regime.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Nicaragua, State-based conflict, In depth, Contras/FDN, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=117&regionSelect=4-Central_Americas# [link is not working]</ref> As early as 1980\u20131981 an anti-Sandinista movement, the ''Contrarrevoluci\u00f3n'' (Counter-revolution) or just ''[[Contras]]'', was forming along the border with [[Honduras]].

The US Congress lobbying efforts were helped by one of Capitol Hill's top lobbyists, [[William C.

Led by \u00c9den Pastora, the Sandinistan forces captured the National Palace while the legislature was in session, taking 2,000 hostages. Pastora demanded money, the release of Sandinistan prisoners, and, \"a means of publicizing the Sandinista cause.\"<ref name=\"brown.edu\" /> After two days, the government agreed to pay $500,000 and to release certain prisoners, marking a major victory for the FSLN.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/> Revolts against the state continued as the Sandinistas received material support from Venezuela and Panama.

However, these broke down when it became clear that the Somoza regime had no intention of allowing democratic elections to take place.\n\nBy June 1979 the FSLN controlled all of the country except the capital, and on 17 July President Somoza resigned and the FSLN entered Managua,<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/> giving full control of the government to the revolutionary movements.\n\n==Sandinista regime==\nImmediately following the fall of the Somoza regime, Nicaragua was largely in ruins. The country had suffered both war and, earlier, natural disaster in the devastating [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]]. In 1979, approximately 600,000 Nicaraguans were homeless and 150,000 were either refugees or in exile,<ref>[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Nicaragua, State-based conflict, In depth, Nicaragua under Sandinista rule, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=117&regionSelect=4-Central_Americas# [link is not working]</ref> out of a total population of just 2.8 million.<ref>evolution of demography in [[Nicaragua]] (1961\u20132003), Data FAOSTAT, http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/help-copyright/copyright-e.htm (last updated 11 February 2005)</ref>\n\nIn response to these issues, a state of emergency was declared. President Carter sent US$99 million in aid. Land and businesses of the Somoza regime were expropriated, the old courts were abolished, and workers were organized into Civil Defense Committees. The new regime also declared that \"elections are unnecessary\", which led to criticism from the Catholic Church, among others.<ref name=\"brown.edu\" />\n\n===Economic reforms===\n{{Expand section|date=September 2013}}\nThe Revolution ended the burden the Somocista regime had imposed upon the Nicaraguan economy and which had seriously deformed the country, creating a big and modern center, Managua, where Somoza's power had emanated to all corners of the territory. Somoza had developed an almost semifeudalist rural economy with few productive goods, such as cotton, sugar and other tropical agricultural products. All sectors of the economy of Nicaragua were determined, in great part if not entirely, by the Somozas or the officials and others surrounding the regime, whether by directly owning agricultural brands and trusts, or actively putting them into local or foreign hands. It is famously stated that Somoza himself owned 1/5 of all profitable land in Nicaragua. While this is not correct, Somoza or his adepts did own or give away banks, ports, communications, services and massive amounts of land.<ref>''SOL\u00c1 MONSERRAT, Roser. ''\"Geograf\u00eda y Estructura Econ\u00f3micas de Nicaragua\"'' (Nicaragua's Geography and Economical Structure). Universidad Centroamericana. Managua, Nicaragua, 1989. Second Edition.''</ref>\n\nThe Nicaraguan Revolution brought immense restructuring and reforms to all three sectors of the economy, directing it towards a [[mixed economy]] system. The biggest economic impact was on the primary sector, agriculture, in the form of the [[Agrarian Reform]], which was not proposed as something that could be planned in advanced from the beginning of the Revolution but as a process that would develop pragmatically along with the other changes (economic, political, etc.) that would arise during the Revolution period.<ref name=\"Sol\u00e1\">\"Agrarian Productive Structure in Nicaragua\", ''SOL\u00c1 MONSERRAT, Roser. 1989. Pag 69 and ss''.</ref>\n\nEconomic reforms overall needed to rescue out of limbo the inefficient and helpless Nicaraguan economy. As a \"[[third-world]]\" country, Nicaragua had, and has, an agriculture-based economy, undeveloped and susceptible to the flow of market prices for its agricultural goods, such as coffee and cotton. The Revolution faced a rural economy well behind in technology and, at the same time, devastated by the guerrilla warfare and the soon to come civil war against the [[Contras]].\n\n<blockquote>\nArticle 1 of the Agrarian Reform Law says that property is guaranteed if it laboured efficiently and that there could be different forms of property:\n*''state property'' (with the confiscated land from somocistas)\n*''cooperative property'' (part of confiscated land, but without individual certificates of ownership, to be laboured efficiently)\n*''communal property'' (in response to reinvindication from people and communities from [[Miskito people|Miskito]] regions in the [[Atlantic]])\n*''individual property'' (as long as this is efficiently exploited and integrated to national plans of development)<ref name=\"Sol\u00e1\"/>\n\nThe principles that presided Agrarian Reform were the same ones for the Revolution: pluralism, national unity and economic democracy.<ref name=\"Sol\u00e1\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Nicaraguan Agrarian Reform developed into four phases:\n# phase (1979): confiscation of property owned by Somocistas and its adepts\n# phase (1981): Agrarian Reform Law of 19 July 1981\n# phase (1984\u201385): massive cession of land individually, responding to demands from peasantry\n# phase (1986): Agrarian Reform Law of 1986, or \"reform to the 1981 Law\"\n\nIn 1985, the Agrarian Reform distributed {{convert|235000|acre|km2}} of land to the peasantry. This represented about 75 percent of all land distributed to peasants since 1980. According to Project, the agrarian reform had the twofold purpose of increasing the support for the government among the campesinos, and guaranteeing ample food delivery into the cities. During 1985, ceremonies were held throughout the countryside in which Daniel Ortega would give each peasant a title to the land and a rifle to defend it.<ref>Louis Proyect, ''Nicaragua'', about 4/5 of the way down.</ref>\n\n===Cultural Revolution===\nThe Nicaraguan Revolution brought many cultural improvements and developments. Undoubtedly, the most important was the planning and execution of the [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign]] ''(Cruzada Nacional de Alfabetizaci\u00f3n)''. The literacy campaign used secondary school students, university students as well as teachers as volunteer teachers. Within five months they reduced the overall [[illiteracy]] rate from 50.3% to 12.9%.<ref name=\"NLC\">{{cite news |first=Ulrike |last=Hanemann |title=Nicaragua's Literacy Campaign |url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/file_download.php/67b39f3aaf8f20da06be3c6a4e4c6dfeHanemann_U.doc|work=UNESCO|accessdate=2 July 2007 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703020810/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/file_download.php/67b39f3aaf8f20da06be3c6a4e4c6dfeHanemann_U.doc<!--Bot retrieved archive-->|archivedate=3 July 2007}}</ref> As a result, in September 1980, [[UNESCO]] awarded Nicaragua with the \"[[Nadezhda K.

It also founded an ''Instituto de Estudios del Sandinismo'' (Institute for Studies of [[Sandinismo]]) where it printed all of the work and papers of [[Augusto C. Sandino]] and those that cemented the ideologies of FSLN as well, such as [[Carlos Fonseca]], Ricardo Morales Avil\u00e9s and others.

Jewish citizens faced physical attacks, confiscation of property without cause, and arbitrary arrests. However, investigations conducted by the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]] and [[Pax Christi]] between 1979 and 1983 refuted allegations of anti-Semitism. Some Jewish people were expropriated for their collaboration with the [[Somoza]] regime, but not because they were Jewish. Moreover, there was the example of the high ranking Sandinista and mayor of [[Managua]], [[Herty Lewites]], who was of Jewish descent.<ref>https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1984/06/A/38020</ref>\n\n==Contra War==\n{{Further|Sandinista National Liberation Front#Sandinistas vs. Contras|Nicaraguan Democratic Force|Democratic Revolutionary Alliance|Contras|Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration#Nicaragua}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Contra commandas 1987.jpg|thumb|Contra Commandos from [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force|FDN]] and ARDE Frente Sur, [[Nueva Guinea]] area in 1987]]\n[[File:Smoke break el serrano 1987.jpg|thumb|Members of ARDE Frente Sur taking a smoke break after routing the [[FSLN]] garrison at El Serrano in southeast Nicaragua in 1987.]]\n\nAlthough the [[Carter Administration]] had attempted to work with FSLN in 1979 and 1980, the more [[right-wing]] [[Reagan Administration]] supported a strong anti-communist strategy for dealing with Latin America, and so it attempted to isolate the Sandinista regime.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Nicaragua, State-based conflict, In depth, Contras/FDN, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=117&regionSelect=4-Central_Americas# [link is not working]</ref> As early as 1980\u20131981 an anti-Sandinista movement, the ''Contrarrevoluci\u00f3n'' (Counter-revolution) or just ''[[Contras]]'', was forming along the border with [[Honduras]].

It built upon groundwork laid by the [[Contadora Group]] from 1983 to 1985. The agreement was named for [[Esquipulas]], [[Guatemala]], where the initial meetings took place. The US Congress lobbying efforts were helped by one of Capitol Hill's top lobbyists, [[William C. Chasey]].\n\nIn May 1986, a summit meeting, \"Esquipulas I,\" took place, attended by the five Central American presidents. On 15 February 1987, [[Costa Rica]]n [[President of Costa Rica|President]] [[\u00d3scar Arias]] submitted a Peace Plan which evolved{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} from this meeting. During 1986 and 1987, the \"Esquipulas Process\" was established, in which the Central American heads of state agreed on economic cooperation and a framework for peaceful conflict resolution. The \"Esquipulas II Accord\" emerged from this and was signed in [[Guatemala City]] by the five presidents on 7 August 1987.\n\nEsquipulas II defined a number of measures to promote national reconciliation, an end to hostilities, [[democratization]], [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]], the termination of all assistance to [[irregular military|irregular forces]], negotiations on arms controls, and assistance to [[refugee]]s.
