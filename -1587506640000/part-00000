The assessment must include consideration of any information provided by the supplier of a substance (CHIPS) (reg.6(2)(b)) and must be reviewed regularly, and also when there is reason to think the assessment is no longer valid, if the system of work is changed or if necessary because of the results of health monitoring (reg.6(3)). The assessment must also consider any [[occupational exposure limit]], in particular, those mandated by the HSE (reg.6(2)(f))<ref>{{cite book | title=EH40, Occupational Exposure Limits | year=2007 | publisher=HSE Books | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/eh40.htm}}</ref> or by the workplace activities <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.lrbconsulting.co.uk/blog/coshh-and-the-small-business/ |title = COSHH for small business - consideration of COSHH Assessments, etc|date = 28 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Prevention or control of exposure===\nRegulation 7 requires that an employer prevent exposure to hazardous substances or, if this is not [[reasonably practicable]], that he adequately controls exposure.\nOne of the main points of the COSHH risk assessment is to identify the measures that are to be used to avoid a hazard or reduce the level of risk associated with a hazard. Employers must ensure that exposure to hazardous substances is prevented or, if this is not reasonably practicable, adequately controlled. Ideally, this will mean preventing exposure by:\n\n* removing hazardous substance, by changing the process;\n* substituting it with a safe or safer substance, or using it in a safer form.\nWhere this is not reasonably practicable, controlling exposure by, for example:\n* totally enclosing the process (such as a shot-blasting box);\n* using partial enclosure and/or extraction equipment (such as a spray painting booth);\n* general ventilation;\n* using safe systems of work and handling procedures (written procedures, etc.).\nIt is for the employer to decide on the method of controlling exposure. The regulations, however, limit the use of personal protective equipment (e.g. respirators, dust marks, protective clothing), as the means of protection to only those situations where other measures cannot adequately control exposure.\n\n===Use of control measures===\nEmployers must take all [[reasonable man|reasonable]] steps to ensure that control measures, and any necessary equipment of facilities, are properly used or applied (reg.8(1)). Employees must use the control measures properly, return them after use and report any defective equipment (reg.8(2)).\n\n===Maintenance and testing of control measures===\nRegulation 9 requires that employers maintain control measures in efficient working order and in good repair, with thorough examination and testing of local exhaust ventilation plant generally every 14 months, and for other controls \"at suitable intervals\".<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2677/regulation/9/made Regulation 9(2)]</ref>\n\n===Monitoring exposure===\nWhere the risk assessment indicates that workplace monitoring of exposure is necessary, the employer must perform such monitoring unless he can demonstrate another means of preventing or controlling exposure (reg.10). Monitoring must be at regular intervals in addition to when a change occurs that may affect exposure (reg.10(3)). There is mandatory monitoring for (reg.10(4)):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"20%\"|Substance or process\n!width=\"30%\"|Minimum frequency\n|-\n|Vinyl chloride monomer\n|Continuous or in accordance with a procedure approved by the HSE\n|-\n|[[Spray (liquid drop)|Spray]] given off from vessels at which an [[Chrome plating|electrolytic chromium process]] is carried on, except [[trivalent chromium]]\n| Every 14 days\n|-\n|}\n\n===Exposure monitoring===\nThere are many methods for monitoring a persons exposure to inhalation risks, the most common is to use personal air sampling pumps. These are usually flow controlled, rechargeable pumps worn by the operator, which pull a known volume of air through a sampling media such as filters or charcoal tubes. Pumps are generally worn for 8 hours or for a full working shift. The sample media is then sent for weighing if sampling for simple dusts, or for more in depth analysis via accredited laboratory.\n\n===Health surveillance===\nRegulation 11 requires that health surveillance of employees is carried out where:\n*An identifiable [[disease]] or adverse health effect may be related to the exposure;\n*There is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that the disease or health effect may occur under the particular conditions of work;\n*Valid techniques exist for detecting [[indication (medicine)|indication]]s of the disease of health effect; and\n*The technique presents a low risk to the employee;\n&mdash; or where there is exposure to any of the following substances in the specified occupations:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"20%\"|Substance\n!width=\"30%\"|Process\n|-\n| Vinyl chloride monomer\n| Manufacture, production, reclamation, storage, discharge, transport, use or [[polymerisation]]\n|-\n| [[Phenols|Nitro or amino derivatives]] of [[phenol]] and of [[benzene]] or its [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]]\n| Manufacture of nitro or amino derivatives of phenol and of benzene or its homologues, and the making of [[explosives]] with the use of any of these substances\n|-\n| [[Potassium chromate]], [[potassium dichromate]], [[sodium chromate]] or [[sodium dichromate]]\n| Manufacturing\n|-\n| [[Ortho-tolidine]], [[O-Dianisidine|dianisidine]] and [[dichlorobenzidine]], and their salts\n| Manufacturing\n|-\n| [[Auramine]] and [[magenta]]\n| Manufacturing\n|-\n| Carbon disulphide, [[disulphur dichloride]], benzene, including [[benzole]], [[carbon tetrachloride]] and [[trichlorethylene]]\n| Processes in which these substances are used, or given off as [[vapour]], in the manufacture of [[indiarubber]] or of articles or goods made wholly or partially of indiarubber\n|-\n| [[Pitch (resin)|Pitch]]\n| Manufacture of blocks of fuel consisting of [[coal]], coal dust, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or slurry with pitch as a binding substance\n|-\n|}\n\n===Information, instruction and training===\nRegulation 12 demands that all employees liable to exposure to hazardous substances are provided with suitable and sufficient [[information]], [[Education|instruction]] and [[training]], including:\n*Details of the hazardous substances including:\n**Names of substances and the risk that they present to health;\n**Any relevant occupational exposure standard, maximum exposure limit or similar occupational exposure limit;\n**Access to any relevant safety data sheet;\n*Other legislative provisions which concern the hazardous properties of those substances;\n*Significant findings of risk assessment;\n*Appropriate precautions and actions to be taken by the employee in order to safeguard himself and other employees at the workplace;\n*Results of any monitoring of exposure and, in particular, in the case of a substance hazardous to health for which a maximum exposure limit has been approved, the employee or his representatives shall be informed forthwith, if the results of such monitoring show that the maximum exposure limit has been exceeded; and\n*Collective results of any health surveillance undertaken in a form calculated to prevent those results from being identified as relating to a particular person.\n\nSome biological agents can cause severe human disease and be a serious hazard to employees. Further diseases may be likely to spread to the community and there may be no effective [[prophylaxis]] or treatment available. Where employees are working with such an agent, or material that may contain such an agent, they must be provided with written instructions and, if appropriate, notices must be displayed that outline the procedures for handling such an agent or material.\n\n===Accidents, incidents and emergencies===\nRegulation 13 requires that employers prepare for possible accidents, incidents and emergencies involving hazardous substances by:\n*Preparing emergency procedures, including provision of [[first aid]];\n*Making available technical information on possible accidents and hazards and bringing it to the attention of the [[emergency services]]; and\n*Installing [[alarm]]s and other warnings and communication systems.\n\n==Fumigation==\nRegulation 14 requires that appropriate warning notices are affixed to premises that are to be [[fumigation|fumigated]] with [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[phosphine]] or [[methyl bromide]]. In most cases, notice must be given to any [[harbour authority]] in whose area the fumigation is to take place.\n\n==Exemptions==\nThe HSE may issue certificates of exemption to certain employers so long as they are satisfied that the health and safety of workers will not be compromised (reg.15). The [[Secretary of State for Defence]] may issue certificates of exemption on the grounds of [[national security]] to the UK and visiting [[armed forces]] (reg.16).\n\n==Record keeping==\nAn employer with five or more employees must record the results of the risk assessment (reg.6(4)).\n\n[[File:COSHH yellow bin-lambeth.jpg|thumb|right|A roadside bin with a COSHH notice]]\n\n==Regulations on labelling of containers and pipes==\n*Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 (CHIP)(SI 2002/1689);\n*[[Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996]] (SI 1996/341);\n*Radioactive Material (Road Transport) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/1093);\n*Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2089);\n*Packaging, Labelling and Carriage of Radioactive Material by Rail Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2099);\n*Carriage of Dangerous Goods (Classification, Packaging and Labelling) and Use of Transportable Pressure Receptacles Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2092);\n*Carriage of Explosives by Road Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2093);\n*Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2095); and\n*[[Good Laboratory Practice Regulations 1999]] (SI 1999/3106).\n* Acetylene Regulations 2014\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | author=[Various authors] | year=2007 | title=Tolley's Health and Safety at Work Handbook 2008 | location=London | publisher=Butterworths | isbn=978-0-7545-3318-4 }}\n*{{cite book | title=COSHH essentials: Easy steps to control chemicals.

The assessment must include consideration of any information provided by the supplier of a substance (CHIPS) (reg.6(2)(b)) and must be reviewed regularly, and also when there is reason to think the assessment is no longer valid, if the system of work is changed or if necessary because of the results of health monitoring (reg.6(3)). The assessment must also consider any [[occupational exposure limit]], in particular, those mandated by the HSE (reg.6(2)(f))<ref>{{cite book | title=EH40, Occupational Exposure Limits | year=2007 | publisher=HSE Books | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/eh40.htm}}</ref> or by the workplace activities <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.lrbconsulting.co.uk/blog/coshh-and-the-small-business/ |title = COSHH for small business - consideration of COSHH Assessments, etc|date = 28 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Prevention or control of exposure===\nRegulation 7 requires that an employer prevent exposure to hazardous substances or, if this is not [[reasonably practicable]], that he adequately controls exposure.\nOne of the main points of the COSHH risk assessment is to identify the measures that are to be used to avoid a hazard or reduce the level of risk associated with a hazard. Employers must ensure that exposure to hazardous substances is prevented or, if this is not reasonably practicable, adequately controlled. Ideally, this will mean preventing exposure by:\n\n* removing hazardous substance, by changing the process;\n* substituting it with a safe or safer substance, or using it in a safer form.\nWhere this is not reasonably practicable, controlling exposure by, for example:\n* totally enclosing the process (such as a shot-blasting box);\n* using partial enclosure and/or extraction equipment (such as a spray painting booth);\n* general ventilation;\n* using safe systems of work and handling procedures (written procedures, etc.).\nIt is for the employer to decide on the method of controlling exposure. The regulations, however, limit the use of personal protective equipment (e.g. respirators, dust marks, protective clothing), as the means of protection to only those situations where other measures cannot adequately control exposure.\n\n===Use of control measures===\nEmployers must take all [[reasonable man|reasonable]] steps to ensure that control measures, and any necessary equipment of facilities, are properly used or applied (reg.8(1)). Employees must use the control measures properly, return them after use and report any defective equipment (reg.8(2)).\n\n===Maintenance and testing of control measures===\nRegulation 9 requires that employers maintain control measures in efficient working order and in good repair, with thorough examination and testing of local exhaust ventilation plant generally every 14 months, and for other controls \"at suitable intervals\".<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2677/regulation/9/made Regulation 9(2)]</ref>\n\n===Monitoring exposure===\nWhere the risk assessment indicates that workplace monitoring of exposure is necessary, the employer must perform such monitoring unless he can demonstrate another means of preventing or controlling exposure (reg.10). Monitoring must be at regular intervals in addition to when a change occurs that may affect exposure (reg.10(3)). There is mandatory monitoring for (reg.10(4)):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"20%\"|Substance or process\n!width=\"30%\"|Minimum frequency\n|-\n|Vinyl chloride monomer\n|Continuous or in accordance with a procedure approved by the HSE\n|-\n|[[Spray (liquid drop)|Spray]] given off from vessels at which an [[Chrome plating|electrolytic chromium process]] is carried on, except [[trivalent chromium]]\n| Every 14 days\n|-\n|}\n\n===Exposure monitoring===\nThere are many methods for monitoring a persons exposure to inhalation risks, the most common is to use personal air sampling pumps. These are usually flow controlled, rechargeable pumps worn by the operator, which pull a known volume of air through a sampling media such as filters or charcoal tubes. Pumps are generally worn for 8 hours or for a full working shift. The sample media is then sent for weighing if sampling for simple dusts, or for more in depth analysis via accredited laboratory.\n\n===Health surveillance===\nRegulation 11 requires that health surveillance of employees is carried out where:\n*An identifiable [[disease]] or adverse health effect may be related to the exposure;\n*There is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that the disease or health effect may occur under the particular conditions of work;\n*Valid techniques exist for detecting [[indication (medicine)|indication]]s of the disease of health effect; and\n*The technique presents a low risk to the employee;\n&mdash; or where there is exposure to any of the following substances in the specified occupations:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"20%\"|Substance\n!width=\"30%\"|Process\n|-\n| Vinyl chloride monomer\n| Manufacture, production, reclamation, storage, discharge, transport, use or [[polymerisation]]\n|-\n| [[Phenols|Nitro or amino derivatives]] of [[phenol]] and of [[benzene]] or its [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]]\n| Manufacture of nitro or amino derivatives of phenol and of benzene or its homologues, and the making of [[explosives]] with the use of any of these substances\n|-\n| [[Potassium chromate]], [[potassium dichromate]], [[sodium chromate]] or [[sodium dichromate]]\n| Manufacturing\n|-\n| [[Ortho-tolidine]], [[O-Dianisidine|dianisidine]] and [[dichlorobenzidine]], and their salts\n| Manufacturing\n|-\n| [[Auramine]] and [[magenta]]\n| Manufacturing\n|-\n| Carbon disulphide, [[disulphur dichloride]], benzene, including [[benzole]], [[carbon tetrachloride]] and [[trichlorethylene]]\n| Processes in which these substances are used, or given off as [[vapour]], in the manufacture of [[indiarubber]] or of articles or goods made wholly or partially of indiarubber\n|-\n| [[Pitch (resin)|Pitch]]\n| Manufacture of blocks of fuel consisting of [[coal]], coal dust, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or slurry with pitch as a binding substance\n|-\n|}\n\n===Information, instruction and training===\nRegulation 12 demands that all employees liable to exposure to hazardous substances are provided with suitable and sufficient [[information]], [[Education|instruction]] and [[training]], including:\n*Details of the hazardous substances including:\n**Names of substances and the risk that they present to health;\n**Any relevant occupational exposure standard, maximum exposure limit or similar occupational exposure limit;\n**Access to any relevant safety data sheet;\n*Other legislative provisions which concern the hazardous properties of those substances;\n*Significant findings of risk assessment;\n*Appropriate precautions and actions to be taken by the employee in order to safeguard himself and other employees at the workplace;\n*Results of any monitoring of exposure and, in particular, in the case of a substance hazardous to health for which a maximum exposure limit has been approved, the employee or his representatives shall be informed forthwith, if the results of such monitoring show that the maximum exposure limit has been exceeded; and\n*Collective results of any health surveillance undertaken in a form calculated to prevent those results from being identified as relating to a particular person.\n\nSome biological agents can cause severe human disease and be a serious hazard to employees. Further diseases may be likely to spread to the community and there may be no effective [[prophylaxis]] or treatment available. Where employees are working with such an agent, or material that may contain such an agent, they must be provided with written instructions and, if appropriate, notices must be displayed that outline the procedures for handling such an agent or material.\n\n===Accidents, incidents and emergencies===\nRegulation 13 requires that employers prepare for possible accidents, incidents and emergencies involving hazardous substances by:\n*Preparing emergency procedures, including provision of [[first aid]];\n*Making available technical information on possible accidents and hazards and bringing it to the attention of the [[emergency services]]; and\n*Installing [[alarm]]s and other warnings and communication systems.\n\n==Fumigation==\nRegulation 14 requires that appropriate warning notices are affixed to premises that are to be [[fumigation|fumigated]] with [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[phosphine]] or [[methyl bromide]]. In most cases, notice must be given to any [[harbour authority]] in whose area the fumigation is to take place.\n\n==Exemptions==\nThe HSE may issue certificates of exemption to certain employers so long as they are satisfied that the health and safety of workers will not be compromised (reg.15). The [[Secretary of State for Defence]] may issue certificates of exemption on the grounds of [[national security]] to the UK and visiting [[armed forces]] (reg.16).\n\n==Record keeping==\nAn employer with five or more employees must record the results of the risk assessment (reg.6(4)).\n\n[[File:COSHH yellow bin-lambeth.jpg|thumb|right|A roadside bin with a COSHH notice]]\n\n==Regulations on labelling of containers and pipes==\n*Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 (CHIP)(SI 2002/1689);\n*[[Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996]] (SI 1996/341);\n*Radioactive Material (Road Transport) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/1093);\n*Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2089);\n*Packaging, Labelling and Carriage of Radioactive Material by Rail Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2099);\n*Carriage of Dangerous Goods (Classification, Packaging and Labelling) and Use of Transportable Pressure Receptacles Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2092);\n*Carriage of Explosives by Road Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2093);\n*Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2095); and\n*[[Good Laboratory Practice Regulations 1999]] (SI 1999/3106).\n* Acetylene Regulations 2014\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | author=[Various authors] | year=2007 | title=Tolley's Health and Safety at Work Handbook 2008 | location=London | publisher=Butterworths | isbn=978-0-7545-3318-4 }}\n*{{cite book | title=COSHH essentials: Easy steps to control chemicals.

A former member of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]], he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD) after [[World War II]]. He served as Federal [[Minister of Intra-German Relations]] from 1966 to 1969 and thereafter as chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in the [[Bundestag]] until 1983.\n\nDuring his tenure in the Bundestag from 1949 to 1983, Wehner became (in-)famous for his caustic rhetoric and [[heckler|heckling]] style, often hurling personal insults at MPs with whom he disagreed. He holds the record for official censures (77 by one count, 78 or 79 by others) handed down by the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|presiding]] officer.\n\n==Life==\nHerbert Wehner was born in [[Dresden]], the son of a [[shoemaking|shoemaker]]. His father was active in his [[trade union]] and a member of the Social Democratic Party. More radical than his father, Wehner engaged in [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] circles around [[Erich M\u00fchsam]], driven by the 1923 invasion of [[Reichswehr]] troops into the [[Saxony|Free State of Saxony]] at the behest of the [[German People's Party|DVP]]&ndash;SPD [[German Reich|Reich]] government of Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]]. He also fell out with M\u00fchsam, whose [[pacifism|pacifist]] manners he rejected, and finally joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1927, becoming an official of the party's ''[[Rote Hilfe]]'' organisation the same year.\n\nWehner rose quickly and was elected to the ''[[Landtag]]'' state legislature of Saxony in 1930. Nevertheless, he resigned one year later to work at the KPD [[politburo]] in [[Berlin]] with [[Walter Ulbricht]]. After Hitler's [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]] in January 1933, he participated in the communist [[German resistance|resistance]] against the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime from the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar Protectorate]]. When the Saar was re-incorporated in 1935, Wehner went into [[exile]], first to [[Paris]], then in 1937 to [[Moscow]], where he lived at [[Hotel Lux]], wrote for the ''[[Deutsche Zentral Zeitung]]'' and had to face [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937-38.<ref name=\"geo\">[http://www.geo.de/GEO/heftreihen/geo_epoche/61487.html \u201eEmigranten: Hotel Lux\u201c] ''Geo Epoche'', No. 38 (August 2009). Retrieved 12 November 2011 {{in lang|de}}</ref> After Wehner's death, German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine documented accusations that he informed the [[NKVD]] on several party fellows like [[Hugo Eberlein]], presumably to save his own life.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13503270.html \"Menschlicher Abschaum\"] ''Der Spiegel'' (31 December 1990). Retrieved 15 November 2011 {{in lang|de}}</ref> After being sent to neutral [[Sweden]] in 1941 in order to re-enter Germany, he was arrested at [[Stockholm]] and interned for [[espionage]] in 1942. If he deliberately went into custody has not been conclusively established, at least he was excluded from the Communist Party by politburo chief [[Wilhelm Pieck]].\n\nUpon his return to Germany in 1946, Wehner joined the Social Democratic Party in [[Hamburg]] and soon became an aide of Chairman [[Kurt Schumacher]]. After the [[1949 West German federal election|1949 federal election]] he entered the [[Bundestag]] parliament and remained an MP until his retirement from politics in 1983, from 1952 to 1958 also as a member of the [[European Parliament]]. In 1957/58 and again from 1964 to 1966 he served as deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentary group. Wehner was instrumental in the party's adoption of the [[Godesberg Program]] in which the Social Democrats repudiated a fixation on [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology and broadened its appeal. In 1966 he was named Federal Minister for All-German Affairs in the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]&ndash;SPD [[grand coalition]] government of Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]. The cooperation between the ex-communist and the former member of the [[Nazi Party]] went well; Wehner even promised the CDU partners to stabilize the coalition by backing the implementation of a [[plurality voting system]], which he later denoted as \"nonsense\".\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F039406-0011, Hannover, SPD-Bundesparteitag, Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Wehner (left), Brandt and Schmidt (right) at a SPD convention in [[Hanover]], 1973]]\nWhen the SPD assumed the [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] of government under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] upon the [[1969 West German federal election|1969 federal election]], Wehner became chairman of the SPD parliamentary faction.

A former member of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]], he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD) after [[World War II]]. He served as Federal [[Minister of Intra-German Relations]] from 1966 to 1969 and thereafter as chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in the [[Bundestag]] until 1983.\n\nDuring his tenure in the Bundestag from 1949 to 1983, Wehner became (in-)famous for his caustic rhetoric and [[heckler|heckling]] style, often hurling personal insults at MPs with whom he disagreed. He holds the record for official censures (77 by one count, 78 or 79 by others) handed down by the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|presiding]] officer.\n\n==Life==\nHerbert Wehner was born in [[Dresden]], the son of a [[shoemaking|shoemaker]]. His father was active in his [[trade union]] and a member of the Social Democratic Party. More radical than his father, Wehner engaged in [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] circles around [[Erich M\u00fchsam]], driven by the 1923 invasion of [[Reichswehr]] troops into the [[Saxony|Free State of Saxony]] at the behest of the [[German People's Party|DVP]]&ndash;SPD [[German Reich|Reich]] government of Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]]. He also fell out with M\u00fchsam, whose [[pacifism|pacifist]] manners he rejected, and finally joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1927, becoming an official of the party's ''[[Rote Hilfe]]'' organisation the same year.\n\nWehner rose quickly and was elected to the ''[[Landtag]]'' state legislature of Saxony in 1930. Nevertheless, he resigned one year later to work at the KPD [[politburo]] in [[Berlin]] with [[Walter Ulbricht]]. After Hitler's [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]] in January 1933, he participated in the communist [[German resistance|resistance]] against the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime from the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar Protectorate]]. When the Saar was re-incorporated in 1935, Wehner went into [[exile]], first to [[Paris]], then in 1937 to [[Moscow]], where he lived at [[Hotel Lux]], wrote for the ''[[Deutsche Zentral Zeitung]]'' and had to face [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937-38.<ref name=\"geo\">[http://www.geo.de/GEO/heftreihen/geo_epoche/61487.html \u201eEmigranten: Hotel Lux\u201c] ''Geo Epoche'', No. 38 (August 2009). Retrieved 12 November 2011 {{in lang|de}}</ref> After Wehner's death, German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine documented accusations that he informed the [[NKVD]] on several party fellows like [[Hugo Eberlein]], presumably to save his own life.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13503270.html \"Menschlicher Abschaum\"] ''Der Spiegel'' (31 December 1990).

If he deliberately went into custody has not been conclusively established, at least he was excluded from the Communist Party by politburo chief [[Wilhelm Pieck]].\n\nUpon his return to Germany in 1946, Wehner joined the Social Democratic Party in [[Hamburg]] and soon became an aide of Chairman [[Kurt Schumacher]]. After the [[1949 West German federal election|1949 federal election]] he entered the [[Bundestag]] parliament and remained an MP until his retirement from politics in 1983, from 1952 to 1958 also as a member of the [[European Parliament]]. In 1957/58 and again from 1964 to 1966 he served as deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentary group. Wehner was instrumental in the party's adoption of the [[Godesberg Program]] in which the Social Democrats repudiated a fixation on [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology and broadened its appeal. In 1966 he was named Federal Minister for All-German Affairs in the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]&ndash;SPD [[grand coalition]] government of Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]. The cooperation between the ex-communist and the former member of the [[Nazi Party]] went well; Wehner even promised the CDU partners to stabilize the coalition by backing the implementation of a [[plurality voting system]], which he later denoted as \"nonsense\".\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F039406-0011, Hannover, SPD-Bundesparteitag, Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|Wehner (left), Brandt and Schmidt (right) at a SPD convention in [[Hanover]], 1973]]\nWhen the SPD assumed the [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] of government under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] upon the [[1969 West German federal election|1969 federal election]], Wehner became chairman of the SPD parliamentary faction.

Today most artificial stone consists of fine [[Portland cement]]-based [[concrete]] placed to set in wooden, rubber-lined fiberglass or iron moulds. It is cheaper and more uniform than natural stone, and widely used. In engineering projects, it allows transporting the bulk materials and casting near the place of use, which is cheaper than transporting and carving very large pieces of stone.\n\nAccording to Rupert Gunnis<ref>Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851, p22</ref> a Dutchman named Van Spangen set up an artificial stone manufactury at Bow in London in 1800. Having later gone into partnership with a Mr. Powell the firm was broken up in 1828, and the moulds sold to a sculptor, Felix Austin, who had a premises in New Road (now Euston Road), in the city. Although he is known to have copied old ceramic [[Coade stone]] designs of Mrs. Coade, his product made from '[[Portland cement]], broken natural stone, pounded marble and coarse sand' (''The Builder'', 1868, now ''[[Building (magazine)|Building]]'').  Around 1840 Austin entered into partnership with John Seeley, who had trained at the [[Royal Academy]] Schools and also made an artificial stone, which he called 'artificial limestone', before joining with Austin. In 1841 the pair published their first catalogue, 'Collection of Ornaments at Austin & Seeley's Artificial Stone Works for Gardens, Parks and Pleasure Grounds'. The firm continued in production until about 1872.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Cast Stone|url=http://www.ukcsa.co.uk/history-of-cast-stone.php|publisher=UK Cast Stone Association|accessdate=21 August 2011|location=Northampton, England}}</ref>\n\nAnother well-known variety was Victoria stone, which is composed of three parts finely crushed Mount Sorrel (Leicestershire) granite to one of [[Portland cement]], carefully mechanically mixed  and filled into moulds. After setting the blocks are placed in a solution of [[sodium_silicate#Concrete_and_general_masonry_treatment|silicate of soda]] to [[indurate]] and harden them.\n\nMany manufacturers turned out a very non-porous product able to resist corrosive [[sea air]] and industrial and residential air pollution.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Stone |volume=25 |pages=958\u2013960 |first=James |last=Bartlett}}</ref>\n\n==Physical properties==\nToday, cast stone is a [[Portland cement]]-based architectural [[precast concrete]] product manufactured using high quality fine and coarse aggregate as its primary constituents. The use of a high percentage of fine aggregate creates a very smooth, consistent texture for the building elements being cast, resembling natural cut stone. Other ingredients such as chemical [[Admixture (concrete)|admixtures]], [[pozzolan]]s, and [[pigment]]s also may be added.\n\nCast stone frequently is produced with a low water-to-cement ratio mixture with a \"dry\" (or \"earth moist\") consistency.  The mixture is consolidated into a [[Molding (process)|mould]] using an air-driven, or electric, [[Tamp|tamping device]] or [[vibration]] under [[pressure]], which is much like the formation of natural [[sedimentary rock]].  Products manufactured in this manner are referred to as vibrant-dry-tamped (VDT) cast stone.  For cast stone mixtures produced with a [[concrete slump test|slumpable]] consistency mixture, the concrete typically is consolidated using internal or external vibration applied to the production mould, or increasingly by the use of self-compacting additives.\n\nOver the last decade, new types of admixtures have been developed for VDT concrete products. These new admixtures do not normally work with \"wet cast\" concrete. These new [[plasticizer]]s are more efficient than using air-entraining agents to increase compaction in VDT concrete.  Some plasticizers have chemical properties that react with the cement to increase ultimate strengths of semi-dry concrete.  Another important type of admixture for VDT concrete is integral [[waterproofing]] formulas.  Tests have shown that some of these integral waterproofing admixtures have improved strength by as much as 20% while reducing the absorption by 40%. The increased strength and reduced absorption results in improved freeze/thaw durability.\n\nOn recent commercial testing laboratory results, the freeze-thaw for VDT concrete using integral waterproofing admixtures was 0.23% weight loss after 300 cycles. Air entraining agents have been the salvation of wet cast concrete as it pertains to its durability. Wet cast concrete with 4% to 6% entrained air normally can withstand numerous freeze-thaw cycles without failing.  Other types of admixtures such as water-reducers, super plasticizers and the new self-compacting additives can add to improving the strength and durability of wet cast concrete products. Cast stone products manufactured by the wet cast method are required to meet the same standards as VDT cast products.\n\nToday, the industry standard for physical properties and raw materials constituents is ASTM C 1364, the Standard Specification for Architectural Cast Stone.  Membership in [[ASTM International]] (founded in 1898 as the American Chapter of the International Association for Testing and Materials and most recently known as the American Society for Testing and Materials) exceeds 30,000 technical experts from more than 100 countries who comprise a worldwide standards forum.  The ASTM method of developing standards has been based on consensus of both users and producers of all kinds of materials.  The ASTM process ensures that interested individuals and organizations representing industry, academia, consumers, and governments alike, all have an equal vote in determining a standard's content.\n\nIn the UK and Europe, it is more normal to use the Standard \"BS 1217 Cast stone - Specification\" from the [[BSI Group]].  The [[European Commission]]'s \"Construction Products Regulations\" legislation states that by mid-2013 [[CE marking]] becomes mandatory for certain construction products sold in Europe, including some Cast Stone items\".<ref>{{cite web|title=CE Marking of Cast Stone|url=http://www.ukcsa.co.uk/technical/ce-marking-of-cast-stone.php|publisher=UK Cast Stone Association|accessdate=23 March 2013|location=Northampton, England}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial stone]] <!--merge needed?  -->\n*[[Geopolymers]]\n*[[Anthropic rock]]\n*[[Coade stone]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_raisonn%C3%A9_de_l%E2%80%99architecture_fran%C3%A7aise_du_XIe_au_XVIe_si%C3%A8cle/B%C3%A9ton Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle/B\u00e9ton]\n\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cast Stone}}\n[[Category:Concrete]]\n[[Category:Building materials]]\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Building stone]]\n[[Category:Artificial stone]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n[[File:Betonsteinwerk 02 Hildastrasse Freiburg i.

Other types of admixtures such as water-reducers, super plasticizers and the new self-compacting additives can add to improving the strength and durability of wet cast concrete products. Cast stone products manufactured by the wet cast method are required to meet the same standards as VDT cast products.\n\nToday, the industry standard for physical properties and raw materials constituents is ASTM C 1364, the Standard Specification for Architectural Cast Stone.  Membership in [[ASTM International]] (founded in 1898 as the American Chapter of the International Association for Testing and Materials and most recently known as the American Society for Testing and Materials) exceeds 30,000 technical experts from more than 100 countries who comprise a worldwide standards forum.  The ASTM method of developing standards has been based on consensus of both users and producers of all kinds of materials.  The ASTM process ensures that interested individuals and organizations representing industry, academia, consumers, and governments alike, all have an equal vote in determining a standard's content.\n\nIn the UK and Europe, it is more normal to use the Standard \"BS 1217 Cast stone - Specification\" from the [[BSI Group]].  The [[European Commission]]'s \"Construction Products Regulations\" legislation states that by mid-2013 [[CE marking]] becomes mandatory for certain construction products sold in Europe, including some Cast Stone items\".<ref>{{cite web|title=CE Marking of Cast Stone|url=http://www.ukcsa.co.uk/technical/ce-marking-of-cast-stone.php|publisher=UK Cast Stone Association|accessdate=23 March 2013|location=Northampton, England}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial stone]] <!--merge needed?  -->\n*[[Geopolymers]]\n*[[Anthropic rock]]\n*[[Coade stone]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_raisonn%C3%A9_de_l%E2%80%99architecture_fran%C3%A7aise_du_XIe_au_XVIe_si%C3%A8cle/B%C3%A9ton Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle/B\u00e9ton]\n\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cast Stone}}\n[[Category:Concrete]]\n[[Category:Building materials]]\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Building stone]]\n[[Category:Artificial stone]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMolding (process)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_stone"}

Social media marketing then connects these consumers and audiences to businesses that share the same needs, wants, and values. Through social networking sites, companies can keep in touch with individual followers. This personal interaction can instill a feeling of [[loyalty]] into followers and potential customers. Also, by choosing whom to follow on these sites, products can reach a very narrow target audience.<ref name=\"Assaad\"/> Social networking sites also include much information about what products and services prospective clients might be interested in. Through the use of new [[Semantics|semantic]] analysis technologies, marketers can detect buying signals, such as content shared by people and questions posted online.

Over the years, the Internet has continually gained more and more users, jumping from 738 million in 2000 all the way to 3.2 billion in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/3896219/internet-users-worldwide/|title=Here's How Many Internet Users There Are|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> Roughly 81% of the current population in the United States has some type of social media profile that they engage with frequently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/273476/percentage-of-us-population-with-a-social-network-profile/|title=U.S. population with a social media profile 2017 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because of their web browsing capabilities which allow individuals immediate access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have altered the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ryu|first1=Jay Sung|title=Mobile Marketing Communications in the Retail Environment: A comparison of QR code users and non users|journal=International Journal of Mobile Marketing|date=2013}}</ref> They have also allowed companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, and any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, [[Real-time bidding]] use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising due to its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-real-time-bidding-ad-ecosystem-2013-5|title=INFOGRAPHIC: Inside The Mobile Real-Time Bidding Ad Ecosystem|accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nMobile devices have become increasingly popular, where 5.7 billion people are using them worldwide <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/|title=Number of mobile phone users worldwide 2013-2019 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>. This has played a role in the way consumers interact with media and has many further implications for TV ratings, advertising, [[mobile commerce]], and more. Mobile [[media consumption]] such as mobile audio streaming or mobile video are on the rise \u2013 In the United States, more than 100 million users are projected to access online video content via mobile device. Mobile video revenue consists of [[pay-per-view]] downloads, advertising and subscriptions. As of 2013, worldwide mobile phone Internet user penetration was 73.4%. In 2017, figures suggest that more than 90% of Internet users will access online content through their phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/|title=Mobile Internet|work=www.statista.com|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Strategies==\nThere are two basic strategies for using social media as a marketing tool:\n\n===Passive approach===\nSocial media can be a useful source of market information and a way to hear customer perspectives. Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes;<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\">{{cite book|author1=Constantinides E. |author2=Lorenzo C. |author3=G\u00f3mez M.A. |year= 2008|title= Social Media: A New Frontier for Retailers?|journal= European Retail Research|volume= 22|issue= 1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.1007/978-3-8349-8099-1_1|isbn=978-3-8349-8099-1|url=https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/social-media-a-new-frontier-for-retailers(2042de4c-cf4d-4f0f-a9d6-43ae725bf513).html }}</ref> in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of [[market intelligence]] which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 \"bend test\" which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure. The so-called \"bend gate\" controversy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844943/apple-says-iphone-bending-extremely-rare|title=Apple says iPhone 6 Plus bending through normal use is 'extremely rare'|author=Welch, Chris|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=12 September 2015|date=2014-09-25}}</ref> created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or \"[[Real-time computing|real time]]\" information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.\n\n===Active approach===\nSocial media can be used not only as [[public relations]] and [[direct marketing]] tools, but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities as effective [[customer engagement]] tools.<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/>  This tactic is widely known as [[influencer marketing]]. Influencer marketing allows brands the opportunity to reach their target audience in a more genuine, authentic way via a special group of selected [[Internet celebrity|influencers]] advertising their product or service. In fact, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022, per [[Business Insider Intelligence]] estimates, based on Mediakix data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report|title=Influencer Marketing: State of the social media influencer market in 2020|last=Schomer|first=Audrey|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nTechnologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper is likely to be read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target [[niche market]]s even more precisely. Using digital tools such as [[Google Adsense]], advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in [[social entrepreneurship]], [[political activism]] associated with a particular political party, or [[video gaming]]. Google Adsense does this by looking for [[Index term|keywords]] in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with \"special issue\" sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).\n\nSocial networks are, in many cases, viewed as a great tool for avoiding costly market research. They are known for providing a short, fast, and direct way to reach an audience through a person who is widely known. For example, an [[athlete]] who gets endorsed by a sporting goods company also brings their support base of millions of people who are interested in what they do or how they play and now they want to be a part of this athlete through their endorsements with that particular company. At one point consumers would visit stores to view their products with famous athletes, but now you can view a famous athlete's, such as [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], latest apparel online with the click of a button. He advertises them to you directly through his [[Twitter|Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts]].\n\n[[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] are leading social media platforms where users can [[Hypertargeting|hyper-target]] their ads. Hypertargeting not only uses public profile information but also information users submit but hide from others.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Facebook Era: Tapping Online Social Networks to Market, Sell, and Innovate|last = Shih|first = Clara|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-13-708512-5|location = Boston|pages = 111}}</ref> There are several examples of firms initiating some form of online dialog with the public to foster relations with customers. According to Constantinides, Lorenzo and G\u00f3mez Borja (2008) \"Business executives like Jonathan Swartz, President and CEO of Sun Microsystems, Steve Jobs CEO of Apple Computers, and McDonald's Vice President Bob Langert post regularly in their CEO blogs, encouraging customers to interact and freely express their feelings, ideas, suggestions, or remarks about their postings, the company or its products\".<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/> Using customer influencers (for example popular bloggers) can be a very efficient and cost-effective method to launch new products or services<ref>Gillin, P.

An example of these are [[consumer advocacy group]]s and groups that criticize companies (e.g., [[lobby group]]s or [[advocacy organization]]s). [[Social media]] use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services, business practices, or a government's actions. Each participating customer, non-customer, or citizen who is participating online via social media becomes a part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort) as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers, potential consumers or citizens to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evans, Dave |title=Social Media Marketing: The Next Generation of Business Engagement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7l2OR6giC6AC&pg=PT15|accessdate=28 July 2013|date=16 September 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-94421-9|pages=15\u2013}}</ref> With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services. This can eventually be translated into buying behavior, or voting and donating behavior in a political context. New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Social Media Marketing|last=Evans|first=Dave|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Sybex|isbn=9781118194492}}</ref>\n\nEngagement in social media for the purpose of a social media strategy is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content. This can be seen through [[digital photo]]s, [[digital video]]s, text, and conversations. It is also represented through sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging.<ref>Schaffer, Neal.

Traditional media such as physical newspapers, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor. Though, this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open; Participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer or citizen.\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===Local businesses===\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites as a promotional technique. Businesses can follow individuals social networking site uses in the local area and advertise specials and deals. These can be exclusive and in the form of \"get a free drink with a copy of this tweet\". This type of message encourages other locals to follow the business on the sites in order to obtain the promotional deal. In the process, the business is getting seen and promoting itself (brand visibility).\n\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites to develop their own market research on new products and services.  By encouraging their customers to give feedback on new product ideas, businesses can gain valuable insights on whether a product may be accepted by their target market enough to merit full production, or not. In addition, customers will feel the company has engaged them in the process of co-creation\u2014the process in which the business uses customer feedback to create or modify a product or service the filling a need of the target market.  Such feedback can present in various forms, such as surveys, contests, polls, etc.\n\nSocial networking sites such as LinkedIn, also provide an opportunity for small businesses to find candidates to fill staff positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/survey-96-of-recruiters-use-social-media-to-find-high-quality-candidates/627040|title=Survey: 92% of Recruiters Use Social Media to Find High-Quality Candidates|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nOf course, review sites, such as Yelp, also help small businesses to build their reputation beyond just brand visibility.

This has changed the ways that companies approach to interact with customers, as a substantial percentage of consumer interactions are now being carried out over online platforms with much higher visibility.

Moreover, it can be accessed by the Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public, especially the younger target group. On top of this, marketers do not only use social media for traditional Internet advertising, but they also encourage users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goor|first1=Marion aan 't|title=Instagram: A Content Analysis into Marketing on Instagram.

Many big names have already jumped on board: [[Starbucks]], [[MTV]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Marc Jacobs]], and [[Red Bull]] are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with ''Harper's Bazaar'' to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose \"outfit of the day\" photos on [[Snapchat]] get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture.

The company can present a more personal picture of their brand, and by doing so the company conveys a better and true picture of itself. The idea of Instagram pictures lies on on-the-go, a sense that the event is happening right now, and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company. In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed. \"It's not an editorial photo,\" he explained, \"We're not trying to be a magazine. We're trying to create a moment.\"<ref name=\"Harper's Bazaar\"/> Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect a true picture of the brand from the perspective of the customers, for instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bj\u00f6rkgren|first1=Caroline|title=Guide: Kommunicera r\u00e4tt med Instagram (Communicate Right on Instagram)|url=http://internetworld.idg.se/2.1006/1.455713|website=Internet World|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> Other than the filters and hashtags functions, the Instagram's 15-second videos and the recently added ability to send private messages between users have opened new opportunities for brands to connect with customers in a new extent, further promoting effective marketing on Instagram.\n\n=== Snapchat ===\nSnapchat is a popular messaging and picture exchanging application that was created in 2011 by three students at Stanford University named Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. The application was first developed to allow users to message back and forth and to also send photographs that are only available from 1\u201310 seconds until they are no longer available.

The type of language used in the commercials and the ideas used to promote the product reflect the audience's style and taste. Also, the ads on this platform are usually in sync with the content of the video requested, this is another advantage YouTube brings for advertisers. Certain ads are presented with certain videos since the content is relevant. Promotional opportunities such as sponsoring a video is also possible on YouTube, \"for example, a user who searches for a YouTube video on dog training may be presented with a sponsored video from a dog toy company in results along with other videos.\"<ref name=\"kincy\">{{cite journal|last=Kincy|first=Jason|title=Advertising and social media|journal=ABA Bank Marketing|year=2011|volume=43|issue=7|page=40}}</ref> YouTube also enable publishers to earn money through its [[YouTube Partner Program]].

In 1999, Misner said that word-of mouth marketing is, \"the world's most effective, yet least understood marketing strategy\" (Trusov, Bucklin, & Pauwels, 2009, p.&nbsp;3).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trusov | first1 = M. | last2 = Bucklin | first2 = R.

Businesses and marketers have noticed that, \"a persons behaviour is influenced by many small groups\" (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). These small groups rotate around social networking accounts that are run by influential people (opinion leaders or \"thought leaders\") who have followers of groups. The types of groups (followers) are called:<ref>Kotler, P., Burton, S., Deans, K., Brown, L., & Armstrong, G. (2013). marketing (9th ed.). NSW, Australia: Pearson Australia</ref> reference groups (people who know each other either face-to-face or have an indirect influence on a persons attitude or behaviour); membership groups (a person has a direct influence on a person's attitude or behaviour); and aspirational groups (groups which an individual wishes to belong to).\n\n=== Influencer Marketing ===\n[[Influencer marketing|Marketers target influential people]], referred to as [[Internet celebrity|influencers]], on social media who are recognized as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify the impact of their message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or \"liking\" of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that \"consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals\" who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.&nbsp;216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sepp | first1 = M. | last2 = Liljander | first2 = V. | last3 = Gummerus | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Private bloggers' motivations to produce content \u2013 a gratifications theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Management | volume = 27 | issue = 13/14| pages = 1479\u20131503 | doi = 10.1080/0267257X.2011.624532 }}</ref><ref>Fill, C., Hughes, G., & De Francesco, S.

The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.)  (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.&nbsp;39).<ref>Dahlen, M., Lange, F., & Smith, T.

Brand must seek to create their brand image on each platform, and cater to the type of consumer demographics on each respective platform. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled all aspects of the ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heath | first1 = R. | last2 = Brandt | first2 = D. | last3 = Narin | first3 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Brand relationships: Strengthened by emotion, weakened by attention | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising Research | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 410\u2013419 | doi=10.2501/s002184990606048x}}</ref>\n\nPlanned content begins with the creative/marketing team generating their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they send them off for approval. There is two general ways of doing so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ depending on the size and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) to sign off or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\">Brito, M.

Retrieved from http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2143149&seqNum=3</ref> Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department.\n\nUnplanned content is an 'in the moment' idea, \"a spontaneous, tactical reaction.\" (Cramer, 2014, p.&nbsp;6). The content could be trending and not have the time to take the planned content route. The unplanned content is posted sporadically and is not calendar/date/time arranged (Deshpande, 2014).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cramer | first1 = T | year = 2014 | title = The rise of content marketing | url = | journal = EContent | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 6\u201310 }}</ref><ref>Deshpande, P. (2014, August 24). The content marketing pyramid: Create more with less. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://contentmarketinginstitute.com</ref> Issues with unplanned content revolve around legal issues and whether the message being sent out represents the business/brand accordingly. If a company sends out a Tweet or Facebook message too hurriedly, the company may unintentionally use insensitive language or messaging that could alienate some consumers. For example, celebrity chef [[Paula Deen]] was criticized after she made a social media post commenting about [[HIV-AIDS]] and [[South Africa]]; her message was deemed to be offensive by many observers. The main difference between planned and unplanned is the time to approve the content. Unplanned content must still be approved by marketing managers, but in a much more rapid manner e.g. 1\u20132 hours or less. Sectors may miss errors because of being hurried. When using unplanned content Brito (2013) says, \"be prepared to be reactive and respond to issues when they arise.\"<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/> Brito (2013) writes about having a, \"crisis escalation plan\", because, \"It will happen\". The plan involves breaking down the issue into topics and classifying the issue into groups. Colour coding the potential risk \"identify and flag potential risks\" also helps to organise an issue. The problem can then be handled by the correct team and dissolved more effectively rather than any person at hand trying to solve the situation.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/>\n\n==Implications on traditional advertising==\n\n===Minimizing use===\nTraditional advertising techniques include print and [[television]] advertising. The [[Internet]] has already overtaken television as the largest advertising market.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/30/internet-biggest-uk-advertising-sector Internet overtakes television to become biggest advertising sector in the UK]. ''The Guardian'' (2009-09-30)</ref>\n[[Websites|Web sites]] often include the banner or pop-up ads. Social networking sites don't always have ads. In exchange, products have entire pages and are able to interact with users. [[Television commercials]] often end with a [[spokesperson]] asking viewers to check out the product website for more information. While briefly popular, print ads included [[QR code]]s on them. These QR codes can be scanned by cell phones and [[computers]], sending viewers to the product website. Advertising is beginning to move viewers from the traditional outlets to the electronic ones.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.business.com/articles/how-technology-is-changing-online-advertising/ |title = How Technology is Changing Online Advertising}}</ref>\nWhile traditional media, like newspapers and television advertising, are largely overshadowed by the rise of social media marketing, there is still a place for traditional marketing. For example, with newspapers, readership over the years has shown a decline. However, readership with newspapers is still fiercely loyal to print-only media. 51% of newspaper readers only read the newspaper in its print form,<ref>{{cite web|title=Newspapers: Fact Sheet|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> making well-placed ads valuable.\n\n===Leaks===\nThe Internet and social networking leaks are one of the issues facing traditional advertising. Video and print ads are often leaked to the world via the Internet earlier than they are scheduled to [[premiere]]. Social networking sites allow those leaks to go [[viral marketing|viral]], and be seen by many users more quickly.\n[[Time difference|The time difference]] is also a problem facing traditional advertisers. When social events occur and are [[broadcast]] on television, there is often a [[Broadcast delay|time delay]] between airings on the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] of the [[United States]]. Social networking sites have become a hub of comment and interaction concerning the event. This allows individuals watching the event on the west coast (time-delayed) to know the outcome before it airs. The [[2011 Grammy Awards]] highlighted this problem. [[Television viewer|Viewer]]s on the west coast learned who won different awards based on comments made on social networking sites by individuals watching live on the east coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostremote.com/2011/02/13/hey-grammys-you-cant-tape-delay-social-media/ |title=Hey Grammys, you can't tape-delay social media |publisher=Lostremote.com |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref> Since viewers knew who won already, many tuned out and [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were lower. All the advertisement and promotion put into the event was lost because viewers didn't have a reason to watch. {{According to whom|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Mishaps===\nSocial media marketing provides organizations with a way to connect with their customers.  However, organizations must protect their information as well as closely watch comments and concerns on the social media they use. A flash poll done on 1225 [[Information technology|IT]] executives from 33 countries revealed that social media mishaps caused organizations a combined $4.3 million in damages in 2010.<ref name=r1/> The top three social media incidents an organization faced during the previous year included employees sharing too much information in public forums, loss or exposure of confidential information, and increased exposure to litigation.<ref name=r1 /> Due to the viral nature of the Internet, a mistake by a single employee has in some cases shown to result in devastating consequences for organizations. An example of a social media mishap includes designer [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]]'s Twitter mishap in 2011. When Kenneth Cole tweeted, \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor has they heard our new spring collection is now available online at [Kenneth Cole's website]\".<ref name=\"ibtimes\">[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/108811/20110204/kenneth-cole-tweets-egypt-cairo-politically-incorrect-inappropriate-kc-pr-twitter-facebook-apology-h.htm Twitter account dedicated to poke fun at Kenneth Cole for #Cairo tweet].

However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers like to hear from advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Mateo|title=The Ethics of Social Media Marketing|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mateo-gutierrez/social-media-marketing_b_2206357.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=2012-12-03}}</ref> The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Melissa S.

Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.\n\nIn addition, social media platforms have become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their viewers to connect with them in various ways.  Social-networking website Facebook Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Saravanakumar, M.  |author2=SuganthaLakshmi, T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012|title= Social media marketing|journal= Life Science Journal|volume= 9|pages= 4444\u20134451}}</ref>  This may be an unethical or ethical feature to some individuals.  Some people may react negatively because they believe it is an invasion of privacy.  On the other hand, some individuals may enjoy this feature because their social network recognizes their interests and sends them particular advertisements pertaining to those interests.  Consumers like to network with people who share their interests and desires.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mangold, W.G.  |author2=Faulds, D.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009|title =Social media: The new hybrid element of the promotion mix|journal=Business Horizons |volume= 52|issue=4  |pages= 357\u2013365|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2009.03.002}}</ref>  Individuals who agree to have their social media profile public, should be aware that advertisers have the ability to take information that interests them to be able to send them information and advertisements to boost their sales.

For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites.

Google Analytics<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/|title=Web Analytics Tools, Event Tracking & More \u2013 Google Analytics Features }}</ref> is a free tool that shows the behavior and other information, such as demographics and device type used, of website visitors from social networks.

Although social media is a useful marketing tool, it is often difficult to quantify to what extent it is contributing to profit.

This has played a role in the way consumers interact with media and has many further implications for TV ratings, advertising, [[mobile commerce]], and more. Mobile [[media consumption]] such as mobile audio streaming or mobile video are on the rise \u2013 In the United States, more than 100 million users are projected to access online video content via mobile device. Mobile video revenue consists of [[pay-per-view]] downloads, advertising and subscriptions. As of 2013, worldwide mobile phone Internet user penetration was 73.4%. In 2017, figures suggest that more than 90% of Internet users will access online content through their phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/|title=Mobile Internet|work=www.statista.com|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Strategies==\nThere are two basic strategies for using social media as a marketing tool:\n\n===Passive approach===\nSocial media can be a useful source of market information and a way to hear customer perspectives. Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes;<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\">{{cite book|author1=Constantinides E. |author2=Lorenzo C. |author3=G\u00f3mez M.A. |year= 2008|title= Social Media: A New Frontier for Retailers?|journal= European Retail Research|volume= 22|issue= 1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.1007/978-3-8349-8099-1_1|isbn=978-3-8349-8099-1|url=https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/social-media-a-new-frontier-for-retailers(2042de4c-cf4d-4f0f-a9d6-43ae725bf513).html }}</ref> in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of [[market intelligence]] which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 \"bend test\" which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure. The so-called \"bend gate\" controversy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844943/apple-says-iphone-bending-extremely-rare|title=Apple says iPhone 6 Plus bending through normal use is 'extremely rare'|author=Welch, Chris|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=12 September 2015|date=2014-09-25}}</ref> created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or \"[[Real-time computing|real time]]\" information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.\n\n===Active approach===\nSocial media can be used not only as [[public relations]] and [[direct marketing]] tools, but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities as effective [[customer engagement]] tools.<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/>  This tactic is widely known as [[influencer marketing]]. Influencer marketing allows brands the opportunity to reach their target audience in a more genuine, authentic way via a special group of selected [[Internet celebrity|influencers]] advertising their product or service. In fact, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022, per [[Business Insider Intelligence]] estimates, based on Mediakix data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report|title=Influencer Marketing: State of the social media influencer market in 2020|last=Schomer|first=Audrey|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nTechnologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper is likely to be read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target [[niche market]]s even more precisely. Using digital tools such as [[Google Adsense]], advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in [[social entrepreneurship]], [[political activism]] associated with a particular political party, or [[video gaming]]. Google Adsense does this by looking for [[Index term|keywords]] in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with \"special issue\" sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).\n\nSocial networks are, in many cases, viewed as a great tool for avoiding costly market research. They are known for providing a short, fast, and direct way to reach an audience through a person who is widely known. For example, an [[athlete]] who gets endorsed by a sporting goods company also brings their support base of millions of people who are interested in what they do or how they play and now they want to be a part of this athlete through their endorsements with that particular company. At one point consumers would visit stores to view their products with famous athletes, but now you can view a famous athlete's, such as [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], latest apparel online with the click of a button. He advertises them to you directly through his [[Twitter|Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts]].\n\n[[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] are leading social media platforms where users can [[Hypertargeting|hyper-target]] their ads. Hypertargeting not only uses public profile information but also information users submit but hide from others.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Facebook Era: Tapping Online Social Networks to Market, Sell, and Innovate|last = Shih|first = Clara|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-13-708512-5|location = Boston|pages = 111}}</ref> There are several examples of firms initiating some form of online dialog with the public to foster relations with customers. According to Constantinides, Lorenzo and G\u00f3mez Borja (2008) \"Business executives like Jonathan Swartz, President and CEO of Sun Microsystems, Steve Jobs CEO of Apple Computers, and McDonald's Vice President Bob Langert post regularly in their CEO blogs, encouraging customers to interact and freely express their feelings, ideas, suggestions, or remarks about their postings, the company or its products\".<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/> Using customer influencers (for example popular bloggers) can be a very efficient and cost-effective method to launch new products or services<ref>Gillin, P.

An example of these are [[consumer advocacy group]]s and groups that criticize companies (e.g., [[lobby group]]s or [[advocacy organization]]s). [[Social media]] use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services, business practices, or a government's actions. Each participating customer, non-customer, or citizen who is participating online via social media becomes a part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort) as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers, potential consumers or citizens to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evans, Dave |title=Social Media Marketing: The Next Generation of Business Engagement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7l2OR6giC6AC&pg=PT15|accessdate=28 July 2013|date=16 September 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-94421-9|pages=15\u2013}}</ref> With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services. This can eventually be translated into buying behavior, or voting and donating behavior in a political context. New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Social Media Marketing|last=Evans|first=Dave|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Sybex|isbn=9781118194492}}</ref>\n\nEngagement in social media for the purpose of a social media strategy is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content. This can be seen through [[digital photo]]s, [[digital video]]s, text, and conversations. It is also represented through sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging.<ref>Schaffer, Neal.

Traditional media such as physical newspapers, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor. Though, this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open; Participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer or citizen.\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===Local businesses===\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites as a promotional technique. Businesses can follow individuals social networking site uses in the local area and advertise specials and deals. These can be exclusive and in the form of \"get a free drink with a copy of this tweet\". This type of message encourages other locals to follow the business on the sites in order to obtain the promotional deal. In the process, the business is getting seen and promoting itself (brand visibility).\n\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites to develop their own market research on new products and services.  By encouraging their customers to give feedback on new product ideas, businesses can gain valuable insights on whether a product may be accepted by their target market enough to merit full production, or not. In addition, customers will feel the company has engaged them in the process of co-creation\u2014the process in which the business uses customer feedback to create or modify a product or service the filling a need of the target market.  Such feedback can present in various forms, such as surveys, contests, polls, etc.\n\nSocial networking sites such as LinkedIn, also provide an opportunity for small businesses to find candidates to fill staff positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/survey-96-of-recruiters-use-social-media-to-find-high-quality-candidates/627040|title=Survey: 92% of Recruiters Use Social Media to Find High-Quality Candidates|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nOf course, review sites, such as Yelp, also help small businesses to build their reputation beyond just brand visibility.

This has changed the ways that companies approach to interact with customers, as a substantial percentage of consumer interactions are now being carried out over online platforms with much higher visibility.

According to a study by Simply Measured, 71% of the world's largest brands are now using Instagram as a marketing channel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lindsey|first=Tishgart|title=As Instagram Rolls Out Ad Platform, Brands Are Seeing Record Engagement|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131029005603/en/Instagram-Rolls-Ad-Platform-Brands-Record-Engagement#.U32_-5RdWQo|date=2013-10-29}}</ref> For companies, Instagram can be used as a tool to connect and communicate with current\nand potential customers. The company can present a more personal picture of their brand, and by doing so the company conveys a better and true picture of itself. The idea of Instagram pictures lies on on-the-go, a sense that the event is happening right now, and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company. In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed. \"It's not an editorial photo,\" he explained, \"We're not trying to be a magazine. We're trying to create a moment.\"<ref name=\"Harper's Bazaar\"/> Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect a true picture of the brand from the perspective of the customers, for instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bj\u00f6rkgren|first1=Caroline|title=Guide: Kommunicera r\u00e4tt med Instagram (Communicate Right on Instagram)|url=http://internetworld.idg.se/2.1006/1.455713|website=Internet World|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> Other than the filters and hashtags functions, the Instagram's 15-second videos and the recently added ability to send private messages between users have opened new opportunities for brands to connect with customers in a new extent, further promoting effective marketing on Instagram.\n\n=== Snapchat ===\nSnapchat is a popular messaging and picture exchanging application that was created in 2011 by three students at Stanford University named Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. The application was first developed to allow users to message back and forth and to also send photographs that are only available from 1\u201310 seconds until they are no longer available. The app was an instant hit with social media members and today there are up to 158 million people using snapchat every single day.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-people-use-snapchat-user-numbers-2017-2|title=Here's everything you need to know about how many people are using Snapchat|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> It is also estimated that Snapchat users are opening the application approximately 18 times per day, which means users are on the app for about 25\u201330 minutes per day.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===YouTube===\n\n[[YouTube]] is another popular avenue; advertisements are done in a way to suit the target audience. The type of language used in the commercials and the ideas used to promote the product reflect the audience's style and taste. Also, the ads on this platform are usually in sync with the content of the video requested, this is another advantage YouTube brings for advertisers. Certain ads are presented with certain videos since the content is relevant. Promotional opportunities such as sponsoring a video is also possible on YouTube, \"for example, a user who searches for a YouTube video on dog training may be presented with a sponsored video from a dog toy company in results along with other videos.\"<ref name=\"kincy\">{{cite journal|last=Kincy|first=Jason|title=Advertising and social media|journal=ABA Bank Marketing|year=2011|volume=43|issue=7|page=40}}</ref> YouTube also enable publishers to earn money through its [[YouTube Partner Program]].

In 1999, Misner said that word-of mouth marketing is, \"the world's most effective, yet least understood marketing strategy\" (Trusov, Bucklin, & Pauwels, 2009, p.&nbsp;3).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trusov | first1 = M. | last2 = Bucklin | first2 = R.

Businesses and marketers have noticed that, \"a persons behaviour is influenced by many small groups\" (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). These small groups rotate around social networking accounts that are run by influential people (opinion leaders or \"thought leaders\") who have followers of groups. The types of groups (followers) are called:<ref>Kotler, P., Burton, S., Deans, K., Brown, L., & Armstrong, G. (2013). marketing (9th ed.). NSW, Australia: Pearson Australia</ref> reference groups (people who know each other either face-to-face or have an indirect influence on a persons attitude or behaviour); membership groups (a person has a direct influence on a person's attitude or behaviour); and aspirational groups (groups which an individual wishes to belong to).\n\n=== Influencer Marketing ===\n[[Influencer marketing|Marketers target influential people]], referred to as [[Internet celebrity|influencers]], on social media who are recognized as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify the impact of their message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or \"liking\" of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that \"consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals\" who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.&nbsp;216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sepp | first1 = M. | last2 = Liljander | first2 = V. | last3 = Gummerus | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Private bloggers' motivations to produce content \u2013 a gratifications theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Management | volume = 27 | issue = 13/14| pages = 1479\u20131503 | doi = 10.1080/0267257X.2011.624532 }}</ref><ref>Fill, C., Hughes, G., & De Francesco, S.

The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.)  (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.&nbsp;39).<ref>Dahlen, M., Lange, F., & Smith, T.

West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons.</ref>\n\n=== Organic Social Media ===\nOwned social media channels are an essential extension of business' and brands in today's world. Brand must seek to create their brand image on each platform, and cater to the type of consumer demographics on each respective platform. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled all aspects of the ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heath | first1 = R. | last2 = Brandt | first2 = D. | last3 = Narin | first3 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Brand relationships: Strengthened by emotion, weakened by attention | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising Research | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 410\u2013419 | doi=10.2501/s002184990606048x}}</ref>\n\nPlanned content begins with the creative/marketing team generating their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they send them off for approval. There is two general ways of doing so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ depending on the size and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) to sign off or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\">Brito, M. (2013). How content governance will facilitate media company transformation. InYour brand (pp. 3-7). Retrieved from http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2143149&seqNum=3</ref> Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department.\n\nUnplanned content is an 'in the moment' idea, \"a spontaneous, tactical reaction.\" (Cramer, 2014, p.&nbsp;6). The content could be trending and not have the time to take the planned content route. The unplanned content is posted sporadically and is not calendar/date/time arranged (Deshpande, 2014).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cramer | first1 = T | year = 2014 | title = The rise of content marketing | url = | journal = EContent | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 6\u201310 }}</ref><ref>Deshpande, P. (2014, August 24). The content marketing pyramid: Create more with less. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://contentmarketinginstitute.com</ref> Issues with unplanned content revolve around legal issues and whether the message being sent out represents the business/brand accordingly. If a company sends out a Tweet or Facebook message too hurriedly, the company may unintentionally use insensitive language or messaging that could alienate some consumers. For example, celebrity chef [[Paula Deen]] was criticized after she made a social media post commenting about [[HIV-AIDS]] and [[South Africa]]; her message was deemed to be offensive by many observers. The main difference between planned and unplanned is the time to approve the content. Unplanned content must still be approved by marketing managers, but in a much more rapid manner e.g. 1\u20132 hours or less. Sectors may miss errors because of being hurried. When using unplanned content Brito (2013) says, \"be prepared to be reactive and respond to issues when they arise.\"<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/> Brito (2013) writes about having a, \"crisis escalation plan\", because, \"It will happen\". The plan involves breaking down the issue into topics and classifying the issue into groups. Colour coding the potential risk \"identify and flag potential risks\" also helps to organise an issue. The problem can then be handled by the correct team and dissolved more effectively rather than any person at hand trying to solve the situation.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/>\n\n==Implications on traditional advertising==\n\n===Minimizing use===\nTraditional advertising techniques include print and [[television]] advertising. The [[Internet]] has already overtaken television as the largest advertising market.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/30/internet-biggest-uk-advertising-sector Internet overtakes television to become biggest advertising sector in the UK]. ''The Guardian'' (2009-09-30)</ref>\n[[Websites|Web sites]] often include the banner or pop-up ads. Social networking sites don't always have ads. In exchange, products have entire pages and are able to interact with users. [[Television commercials]] often end with a [[spokesperson]] asking viewers to check out the product website for more information. While briefly popular, print ads included [[QR code]]s on them. These QR codes can be scanned by cell phones and [[computers]], sending viewers to the product website. Advertising is beginning to move viewers from the traditional outlets to the electronic ones.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.business.com/articles/how-technology-is-changing-online-advertising/ |title = How Technology is Changing Online Advertising}}</ref>\nWhile traditional media, like newspapers and television advertising, are largely overshadowed by the rise of social media marketing, there is still a place for traditional marketing. For example, with newspapers, readership over the years has shown a decline. However, readership with newspapers is still fiercely loyal to print-only media. 51% of newspaper readers only read the newspaper in its print form,<ref>{{cite web|title=Newspapers: Fact Sheet|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> making well-placed ads valuable.\n\n===Leaks===\nThe Internet and social networking leaks are one of the issues facing traditional advertising. Video and print ads are often leaked to the world via the Internet earlier than they are scheduled to [[premiere]]. Social networking sites allow those leaks to go [[viral marketing|viral]], and be seen by many users more quickly.\n[[Time difference|The time difference]] is also a problem facing traditional advertisers. When social events occur and are [[broadcast]] on television, there is often a [[Broadcast delay|time delay]] between airings on the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] of the [[United States]]. Social networking sites have become a hub of comment and interaction concerning the event. This allows individuals watching the event on the west coast (time-delayed) to know the outcome before it airs. The [[2011 Grammy Awards]] highlighted this problem.

However, organizations must protect their information as well as closely watch comments and concerns on the social media they use. A flash poll done on 1225 [[Information technology|IT]] executives from 33 countries revealed that social media mishaps caused organizations a combined $4.3 million in damages in 2010.<ref name=r1/> The top three social media incidents an organization faced during the previous year included employees sharing too much information in public forums, loss or exposure of confidential information, and increased exposure to litigation.<ref name=r1 /> Due to the viral nature of the Internet, a mistake by a single employee has in some cases shown to result in devastating consequences for organizations. An example of a social media mishap includes designer [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]]'s Twitter mishap in 2011. When Kenneth Cole tweeted, \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo.

However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers like to hear from advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Mateo|title=The Ethics of Social Media Marketing|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mateo-gutierrez/social-media-marketing_b_2206357.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=2012-12-03}}</ref> The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Melissa S.

Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.\n\nIn addition, social media platforms have become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their viewers to connect with them in various ways.  Social-networking website Facebook Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Saravanakumar, M.  |author2=SuganthaLakshmi, T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012|title= Social media marketing|journal= Life Science Journal|volume= 9|pages= 4444\u20134451}}</ref>  This may be an unethical or ethical feature to some individuals.  Some people may react negatively because they believe it is an invasion of privacy.  On the other hand, some individuals may enjoy this feature because their social network recognizes their interests and sends them particular advertisements pertaining to those interests.

With the presence of data collecting companies, there is no longer a need to target specific audiences. This can be seen as a large ethically gray area. For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users.<ref name=\"jitpl.jmls.edu\">{{cite web|last1=Hochheiser|first1=Megan|title=Summary Of Data Mining Issues and Regulations|url=http://jitpl.jmls.edu/2015/04/02/summary-of-data-mining-issues-and-regulations/#_ftnref3|website=The John Marshall Journal of Information Technology and Privacy Law|accessdate=April 17, 2016}}</ref> In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix.

President Barack Obama tried to work with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to attempt to regulate data mining.

The proposed laws would give the consumer more control over what information companies can collect.<ref name=\"jitpl.jmls.edu\"/> President Obama was unable to pass most of these laws through congress, and it is unsure what President Trump will do with regards to social media [[marketing ethics]].\n\n==Metrics==\n\n===Web site reports===\n\nThis involves tracking the volume of visits, leads, and customers to a website from the individual social channel. Google Analytics<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/|title=Web Analytics Tools, Event Tracking & More \u2013 Google Analytics Features }}</ref> is a free tool that shows the behavior and other information, such as demographics and device type used, of website visitors from social networks.

Although social media is a useful marketing tool, it is often difficult to quantify to what extent it is contributing to profit. ROI can be measured by comparing marketing analytic value to contact database or CRM and connect marketing efforts directly to sales activity.\n\n===Customer response rates===\n\nSeveral customers are turning towards social media to express their appreciation or frustration with brands, product or services.  Therefore, marketers can measure the frequency of which customers are discussing their brand and judge how effective their SMM strategies are.

It grows faster than many North American hardwoods, often twice the annual growth rate of [[American beech]] and many [[birch]] species. Life expectancy is around 200 years, with flowering and seeding generally occurring between 15 and 100 years, though occasionally seed production may start as early as 8 years.\n\nThe crown is domed, the branches spreading, often pendulous. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is gray to light brown, with narrow, well defined fissures. The [[root]]s are large, deep, and spreading. The [[twig]]s are smooth, reddish-green, becoming light gray in their second year, finally dark brown or brownish gray, marked with dark wart-like excrescences. The winter buds are stout, ovate-acute, smooth, deep red, with two bud scales visible.\n\nThe [[leaves]] are [[simple leaf|simple]], [[alternate leaf|alternately]] arranged, [[Glossary of leaf morphology#ovate|ovate]] to [[Cordate (leaf shape)|cordate]], asymmetrical, unequal at the base (the side nearest the branch the largest), {{convert|10|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} (can grow up to {{convert|25|cm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) long and broad, with a long, slender petiole, a coarsely serrated margin and an acuminate apex. [[William Jackson Bean|Bean]] noted that occasionally, enormous leaves measuring {{convert|38|cm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|25|cm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}} wide appear on thick, succulent shoots.<ref name=Bean/> They open from the bud conduplicate, pale green, downy; when full grown are dark green, smooth, shining above, paler beneath, with tufts of rusty brown hairs in the axils of the primary veins; the small [[stipule]]s fall soon after leaf opening. The fall color is yellow-green to yellow. Both the twigs and leaves contain [[mucilaginous]] sap.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small, fragrant, yellowish-white, {{convert|10|\u2013|14|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=in}} in diameter, arranged in drooping, [[cymose]] clusters of 6\u201320 with a whitish-green leaf-like [[bract]] attached for half its length at the base of the cyme. They are perfect, regular, with five [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s, numerous [[stamen]]s, and a five-celled superior [[ovary (botany)|ovary]]. The leaves emerge in mid-spring, but the flowers require day lengths of approximately 14 hours and 30 minutes to form, hence ''T. americana'''s range is limited to north of the 35th parallel. Time of flowering varies by several weeks depending on the latitude; early May in Canada and early June in the extreme southern extent. Leaf drop in fall occurs between early and late October depending on the latitude. The flowers are fragrant and insect-pollinated.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a small, [[globose]], downy, hard and dry cream-colored [[nutlet]] with a diameter of {{convert|8|\u2013|10|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}}.<ref name=usfs /><ref name=nrcs>USDA NRCS Tree Guide: [http://www.plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_tiama.pdf ''Tilia americana'' (pdf file)]</ref><ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last =Keeler | first =H.

It also has minor occurrence in many other forest cover types.\n\nIts flowers provide abundant nectar for insects. The seeds are eaten by [[chipmunk]]s, [[mice]], and [[squirrel]]s. [[Rabbit]]s and [[vole]]s eat the bark, sometimes girdling young trees. The leaves serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on Tilia|Lepidoptera which feed on ''Tilia'']]).

Propagated plants grow rapidly in a rich soil, but are susceptible to many pests.\n\nThe American basswood is known for being one of the most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard seed coating that may delay germination for up to two years. If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating. This will then allow germination to occur immediately. Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing. All juvenile basswoods [[coppice]] extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut.\n\nThe American basswood is recommended as an ornamental tree when the mass of foliage or a deep shade is desired; no native tree surpasses it in this respect.

It grows faster than many North American hardwoods, often twice the annual growth rate of [[American beech]] and many [[birch]] species. Life expectancy is around 200 years, with flowering and seeding generally occurring between 15 and 100 years, though occasionally seed production may start as early as 8 years.\n\nThe crown is domed, the branches spreading, often pendulous. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is gray to light brown, with narrow, well defined fissures. The [[root]]s are large, deep, and spreading. The [[twig]]s are smooth, reddish-green, becoming light gray in their second year, finally dark brown or brownish gray, marked with dark wart-like excrescences. The winter buds are stout, ovate-acute, smooth, deep red, with two bud scales visible.\n\nThe [[leaves]] are [[simple leaf|simple]], [[alternate leaf|alternately]] arranged, [[Glossary of leaf morphology#ovate|ovate]] to [[Cordate (leaf shape)|cordate]], asymmetrical, unequal at the base (the side nearest the branch the largest), {{convert|10|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} (can grow up to {{convert|25|cm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) long and broad, with a long, slender petiole, a coarsely serrated margin and an acuminate apex. [[William Jackson Bean|Bean]] noted that occasionally, enormous leaves measuring {{convert|38|cm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|25|cm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}} wide appear on thick, succulent shoots.<ref name=Bean/> They open from the bud conduplicate, pale green, downy; when full grown are dark green, smooth, shining above, paler beneath, with tufts of rusty brown hairs in the axils of the primary veins; the small [[stipule]]s fall soon after leaf opening. The fall color is yellow-green to yellow. Both the twigs and leaves contain [[mucilaginous]] sap.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small, fragrant, yellowish-white, {{convert|10|\u2013|14|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=in}} in diameter, arranged in drooping, [[cymose]] clusters of 6\u201320 with a whitish-green leaf-like [[bract]] attached for half its length at the base of the cyme. They are perfect, regular, with five [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s, numerous [[stamen]]s, and a five-celled superior [[ovary (botany)|ovary]]. The leaves emerge in mid-spring, but the flowers require day lengths of approximately 14 hours and 30 minutes to form, hence ''T. americana'''s range is limited to north of the 35th parallel. Time of flowering varies by several weeks depending on the latitude; early May in Canada and early June in the extreme southern extent. Leaf drop in fall occurs between early and late October depending on the latitude. The flowers are fragrant and insect-pollinated.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a small, [[globose]], downy, hard and dry cream-colored [[nutlet]] with a diameter of {{convert|8|\u2013|10|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}}.<ref name=usfs /><ref name=nrcs>USDA NRCS Tree Guide: [http://www.plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_tiama.pdf ''Tilia americana'' (pdf file)]</ref><ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last =Keeler | first =H.

It also has minor occurrence in many other forest cover types.\n\nIts flowers provide abundant nectar for insects. The seeds are eaten by [[chipmunk]]s, [[mice]], and [[squirrel]]s. [[Rabbit]]s and [[vole]]s eat the bark, sometimes girdling young trees. The leaves serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on Tilia|Lepidoptera which feed on ''Tilia'']]). The [[Bucculatricidae|ribbed cocoon maker]] species ''[[Bucculatrix improvisa]]'' has not been found on other plants.\n\nThis species is particularly susceptible to adult [[Japanese beetle]]s (an [[invasive species]] in North America) that feed on its leaves.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USDA |title=Managing the Japanese Beetle:A Homeowner's Handbook |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/content/printable_version/JB3-07.indd.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916070734/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/content/printable_version/JB3-07.indd.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-16 }}</ref>  The mushroom ''[[Pholiota squarrosoides]]'' is known to decay the logs of the tree.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Halama |first=Marek |date=January 2011 |title=First record of the rare species Pholiota squarrosoides (Agaricales, Strophariaceae) in southwestern Poland |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236153077\n|journal=Polish Botanical Journal |access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and Uses ==\n[[File:Tilia americana sections.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sections of ''Tilia americana'' from ''[[The American Woods]]'']]\nThe American basswood can be propagated by cuttings and grafting as well as by seed. Propagated plants grow rapidly in a rich soil, but are susceptible to many pests.\n\nThe American basswood is known for being one of the most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard seed coating that may delay germination for up to two years. If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating. This will then allow germination to occur immediately. Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing. All juvenile basswoods [[coppice]] extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut.\n\nThe American basswood is recommended as an ornamental tree when the mass of foliage or a deep shade is desired; no native tree surpasses it in this respect. It is often planted on the windward side of an orchard as a protection to young and delicate trees.<ref name=Keeler /> It is cultivated at least as far north as [[Juneau, Alaska]].<ref>Juneau: [http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf Downtown Juneau Tree Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818004459/http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe foliage and flowers are both edible, though the tender young leaves are more palatable.

([[Canadian French]]: {{lang|fr|Bell M\u00e9dia}}) is the [[mass media]] subsidiary of [[BCE Inc.]] (also known as Bell Canada Enterprises, the parent company of the former telephone monopoly [[Bell Canada]]). Its operations include [[television]] broadcasting and production (including the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CTV 2]] television networks), radio broadcasting (through [[iHeartRadio Canada]]), [[digital media]] (including [[CraveTV]]) and [[Internet]] properties including [[Sympatico]].ca.\n\nBell Media is the successor-in-interest to '''Baton Broadcasting''' (later '''CTV Inc.'''), one of Canada's first private-sector television broadcasters. The company in its current form was originally established as '''Bell Globemedia''' by BCE and [[The Woodbridge Company|the Thomson family]] in 2001 combining CTV Inc., which Bell had acquired the previous year, and the operations of the Thomsons' ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Bell sold the majority of its interest in 2006 (at which point the company was renamed '''CTVglobemedia'''), but re-acquired the entire company, excluding the ''Globe'', in 2011.\n\n==History==\n===History before 2011===\n====Baton Broadcasting====\n{{Redirect|Baton Broadcasting|the defunct television system owned by Baton|Baton Broadcast System}}\nFor all practical purposes, Bell Media is the successor to '''Baton Broadcasting Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|e\u026a|t|\u0252|n}} {{respell|BAY|ton}}), which by the late 1990s had become one of Canada's largest broadcasters.\n\nBaton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting Ltd. was originally formed in 1960 to operate Toronto's first private television station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]]. The original investors included the [[John Bassett|<u>Ba</u>ssett]] and [[John David Eaton|Ea<u>ton</u>]] families ([[Telegram Corporation|Baton]]), [[Joel Aldred]] and [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.|Ted Rogers]], and [[Foster Hewitt]] in a much smaller role.<ref name=\"Nolan2001\">{{cite book|author=Michael Nolan|title=CTV, the Network that Means Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6c3FkFx0-uoC&pg=PA20|year=2001|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=978-0-88864-384-1|page=20}}</ref> Aldred sold his shares in 1961, followed by Rogers by 1970. With the Bassett and Eaton families firmly in control, the company went public in the early 1970s.\n\nCFTO was one of the charter affiliates of CTV when that network formed in 1961, becoming the network's flagship. In 1966, Baton became a part-owner in the network when it was reorganized as a station-owned [[cooperative]]. The [[Board of Broadcast Governors]] was initially skeptical about the proposal to turn CTV into a cooperative. Since CFTO was by far the largest and richest station in the network, the BBG feared Baton would take advantage of this to dominate the network. However, it approved the deal after Baton and the other owners included a provision in the cooperative's bylaws stipulating that the eight station owners would each have a single vote regardless of audience share. Additionally, if one owner ever bought another station, the acquired station's shares would be redistributed among the remaining owners so that each owner would still have one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1972, Baton began purchasing other CTV affiliates, starting with [[CFQC-DT|CFQC-TV]] in [[Saskatoon]]. This did not, however, give Baton a substantially higher investment in CTV, since its shares were redistributed among the other owners.  As a result, Baton still had only one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1987, Baton began a concerted effort to take over CTV.  It started this drive with a further expansion into [[Saskatchewan]], purchasing [[CKCK-DT|CKCK-TV]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Yorkton]] [[twinstick]] [[CKOS-TV]]/[[CICC-TV]], and CBC affiliate [[CKBI-TV]] [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. A twinstick CTV affiliate was soon launched in Prince Albert, [[CIPA-TV]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Baton applied for a high-power station in [[Ottawa]] on channel 60. The licence was approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), appealed to [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] by rival broadcasters, and ultimately sent back to the CRTC for review.<ref>[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html Order Referring back to the CRTC a Decision Respecting Nation's Capital Television Incorporated] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181627/http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, 28 April 1987</ref> However the licence was surrendered when Baton was instead able to acquire the local CTV affiliate, [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]], from [[Allan Slaight]]'s [[Standard Broadcasting]].\n\nIn 1990, Baton purchased the [[Mid-Canada Communications|MCTV]] system of [[twinstick]] operations in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Timmins]], and the [[Huron Broadcasting]] twinstick in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. In 1993, Baton purchased [[CFPL-DT|CFPL-TV]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[CKNX-TV]] in [[Wingham, Ontario|Wingham]] and received a licence for a new independent station, [[CHWI-DT|CHWI-TV]], in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\nIn 1991, the company launched Ontario Network Television, a secondary affiliation carried by Baton's CTV and [[independent station]]s in Ontario. This was expanded in 1994 into the [[Baton Broadcast System]], or BBS, which included Baton's Saskatchewan stations. BBS was meant as a backup in case Baton's ongoing acquisitions did not translate into control of CTV itself. A year earlier, CTV had been recently restructured into a corporation, with each owner holding a 14.3 percent stake in the network. However, any ''future'' acquisitions by Baton would come with all of that affiliate's CTV shares. It was around this time that former CBC executive [[Ivan Fecan]] joined the company.\n\n====Baton-Electrohome alliance====\nIn 1996, the CRTC approved two major deals involving Baton. First was the acquisition of [[CFCN-DT|CFCN-TV]] in [[Calgary]] from [[Rogers Communications]], which had recently purchased [[Maclean Hunter]]. Second, Baton and [[Electrohome]], owner of [[CKCO-DT|CKCO-TV]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton]], formed an alliance, under which the companies would share ownership of CFCN, Baton's stations in Saskatchewan and its independent stations in southwestern Ontario, and Electrohome's CKCO. The deals doubled Baton's own interest in CTV to 28.6%.  However, as part of the deal, Baton took control of Electrohome's CTV vote, allowing it to command 42.9% of CTV's shares.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-251.htm Decision CRTC 96-251], June 21, 1996</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Baton-Electrohome's \"Vancouver Television\" proposal emerged as the CRTC's choice for the new independent station in [[Vancouver]], beating out four other competitors. The new station, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]], would compete directly with [[Western International Communications]]'s two CTV affiliates in the market when it was launched that fall.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-39.htm Decision CRTC 97-39], January 31, 1997</ref>\n\nOn February 25, 1997, the Baton-Electrohome alliance and [[CHUM Limited]] announced that several stations would be swapped between them. Baton-Electrohome would acquire CHUM's [[CTV Atlantic|Atlantic Television System]] (ATV), consisting of four CTV affiliates in the [[Maritimes]], the [[CTV 2 Atlantic|Atlantic Satellite Network]] (ASN), and a further 14.3% in CTV. CHUM would receive Baton's independent stations in southwestern Ontario, as well as [[CHRO-TV]] in Pembroke, which had recently disaffiliated from CTV. The Baton-Electrohome alliance now held 57.2% of CTV.\n\nShortly thereafter, Electrohome announced it would sell its broadcasting assets \u2013 including CFRN its interest in the alliance and its CTV shares \u2013 to Baton in exchange for cash and shares in Baton. These two deals were approved by the CRTC in August.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-527.HTM Decision CRTC 97-527], August 28, 1997</ref> Baton now held controlling interest in CTV, triggering a [[put option]] that allowed the other owners to sell their stakes in the network while still keeping their stations. Accordingly, Baton acquired the remaining CTV shares from WIC and [[Moffat Communications]], which remained affiliates for the moment, that fall.\n\nThe BBS television system was merged into CTV, with the company itself being renamed CTV Inc. the following year. The Eatons' remaining shares, representing 41% of Baton, were sold off to the general public in early 1998. By the end of 2001, nearly all CTV stations were consolidated under network ownership (including one replacement).\n\n====NetStar Communications====\nNetStar Communications Inc. (previously Labatt Communications Inc., and currently CTV Specialty Television Inc.) was formed by [[Labatt Brewing Company]] to hold that firm's broadcasting assets, which included TSN, RDS, [[Viewers Choice]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]. In 1995, when the parent company was sold to the foreign brewing conglomerate [[Interbrew]], a consortium of four Canadian investors - [[Stephen Bronfman]] (22.5%), [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec|the Caisse]] (22.5%), [[Reitmans]] (16.5%), and senior management (6.5%) - along with [[ESPN]], with 32%, took over the company.<ref>[http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf Broadcast Dialogue newsletter, January 21, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304175349/http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter a takeover attempt by [[CanWest Global]] that was vetoed by ESPN, CTV announced a friendly bid to take over NetStar Communications in early 1999, with CRTC approval on March 24, 2000.\n\n====Under BCE ownership: Bell Globemedia (2000-2006)====\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, CTV (including the NetStar assets) was folded into a new media venture, Bell Globemedia Inc. (abbreviated \"BGM\"). This was masterminded by former [[Bell Canada]] chief executive [[Jean Monty]], largely as a response to [[Canwest]]'s purchase of the [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] newspaper chain as well as the trend of [[media convergence]], particularly the [[AOL]]-[[Time Warner]] merger. Monty believed that, to survive in a changing technological landscape, and in particular to drive subscriptions to [[satellite television]] provider [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]]<!-- As it was known at the time. --> and [[internet service provider]] [[Bell Sympatico]], BCE had to have control over content.\n\nThe transaction was structured as follows: In 2000, BCE acquired CTV Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.3 billion ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/02/25/bcectv000225.html BCE announces $2.3 billion bid for CTV], CBC.ca, February 25, 2000 (modified November 11, 2000); accessed August 9, 2006</ref> Soon after, Monty arranged to have [[Thomson Corporation]] transfer control of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the [[Toronto]]-based national newspaper, to BCE in exchange for a significant (20%) interest in the merged CTV/''Globe'' entity. The Thomsons' family holding company, [[The Woodbridge Company|The Woodbridge Company Ltd.]], invested in the company directly to obtain an additional 9.9% interest, and later bought Thomson Corp.'s interests itself.\n\nThe resulting company, Bell Globemedia, consisted of CTV, ''The Globe and Mail'', and the [[internet]] portal then known as [[Sympatico]]-[[Lycos]] (Lycos was later replaced by [[MSN]]). Fecan was named the combined firm's president and CEO, a role he remained in for the duration of the BGM / CTVgm era. After Monty resigned and was replaced by [[Michael Sabia]] in 2002, it became clear that Monty's vision was not producing anything near the desired results, notwithstanding the good results for the individual units, particularly the CTV network.\n\nThe following years provided a few cosmetic changes in BGM's assets. In 2001, CTV acquired [[CKY-DT|CKY-TV]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CFCF-DT|CFCF-TV]] in Montreal, and moved the CTV affiliation in British Columbia to CIVT, replacing two affiliates that had been purchased by Canwest. That fall also brought the launch of the first digital [[specialty channel]]s, including several owned by CTV.\n\nThe company acquired partial ownership in TQS in 2002, the Sympatico portal was sold back to Bell Canada, while a further investment from the Thomsons (whose ownership increased to 31.5%) funded the acquisition of 15% of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]. However, beginning in 2003, BCE management began to refer to BGM as a non-core asset; as a result, much attention was given to the likely sale of the company, and potentially a breakup into several different pieces.\n\n====Reorganization and CHUM Limited merger (2006-2011)====\n{{see also|CHUM Limited}}\n\nOn December 2, 2005, [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprises]] (BCE) announced it would sell an 8.5% interest to Woodbridge (increasing their total ownership to 40%), a 20% interest to [[Torstar]], and a 20% interest to the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]]. BCE retained 20% of the group - a condition that ensured that Bell TV, Sympatico, and other Bell units continued to have access to Globemedia content. The transaction closed on August 30, 2006.<ref>\"[http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html BGM Ownership Deal Closes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202033123/http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html |date=December 2, 2007 }}\", BGM press release, August 30, 2006</ref>\n\nThis deal put to rest any rumours about a possible breakup of the company. However, Torstar's involvement led to additional [[media concentration]] concerns, mainly from media [[trade union|union]]s. Torstar insisted it was committed to maintaining the [[editorial independence]] of the ''Globe'' and its own ''[[Toronto Star]]'', and ultimately there were no major regulatory hurdles due to this.\n\n{{Wikinews|Canadian media company Bell Globemedia to acquire rival CHUM}}On July 12, 2006, BGM announced a friendly bid to take over [[CHUM Limited]] for an estimated $1.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the secondary broadcast system ([[Citytv]]), other stations including [[CP24|CablePulse24]], [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Star!]], [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]], and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]], and all of CHUM's radio stations, into the BGM fold. BGM originally announced that CHUM's [[CTV 2|A-Channel]] stations, [[Access (TV channel)|Access]], [[CKX-TV]], [[MusiquePlus]], [[MusiMax]], [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[Cooking Channel (Canadian TV channel)|SexTV: The Channel]] and BGM's own [[OLN]] would not be retained.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, in order to pay for the CHUM acquisition, BGM sold additional shares to its existing shareholders. BCE did not participate in the refinancing; the net effect was an increase in Teachers' ownership to 25%, while BCE's interest was reduced to 15%.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html Bell Globemedia Completes Financing to Pay for CHUM Limited Shares] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222027/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, BGM press release, September 7, 2006</ref> As a result of BCE's reduced ownership, the company was renamed as CTVglobemedia as of January 1, 2007.\n\nIn April 2007, [[Rogers Communications]] announced a tentative deal to purchase A-Channel, CKX-TV, Access Alberta, Canadian Learning Television, and SexTV: The Channel from CTVglobemedia, if its purchase of CHUM was approved. [[Astral Media]] made a similar deal for CHUM's 50% interest in MusiMax and MusiquePlus.\n\nThat June, the CRTC approved the CHUM takeover, on condition that CTV sell off the Citytv stations, because of the CTV network's O&O stations serving the very same cities. CTV ultimately chose to keep the A-Channel stations along with the rest of CHUM assets it had previously said it would sell, except for MusiquePlus/MusiMax. [[Rogers Communications]] was announced as the buyer of the Citytv stations on June 11, 2007, and the CHUM acquisition was finalized on June 22.\n\nSince then, CTVglobemedia has sold off its interests in various non-core channels. Rogers has purchased several of these assets, including CTV's 33% interest in OLN in late 2007, as well as radio stations [[CHST-FM]] in [[London, Ontario]] and [[CHBN-FM]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm Canada's Rogers Radio acquires Edmonton top 40 station 91.7 The Bounce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032732/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm |date=2010-06-27 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario Canada's Rogers Radio acquires 102.3 Bob FM in London, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804172359/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario |date=2011-08-04 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref> [[Corus Entertainment]] would acquire [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[SexTV: The Channel]], and [[Drive-In Classics]] for a combined $113 million.

([[Canadian French]]: {{lang|fr|Bell M\u00e9dia}}) is the [[mass media]] subsidiary of [[BCE Inc.]] (also known as Bell Canada Enterprises, the parent company of the former telephone monopoly [[Bell Canada]]). Its operations include [[television]] broadcasting and production (including the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CTV 2]] television networks), radio broadcasting (through [[iHeartRadio Canada]]), [[digital media]] (including [[CraveTV]]) and [[Internet]] properties including [[Sympatico]].ca.\n\nBell Media is the successor-in-interest to '''Baton Broadcasting''' (later '''CTV Inc.'''), one of Canada's first private-sector television broadcasters. The company in its current form was originally established as '''Bell Globemedia''' by BCE and [[The Woodbridge Company|the Thomson family]] in 2001 combining CTV Inc., which Bell had acquired the previous year, and the operations of the Thomsons' ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Bell sold the majority of its interest in 2006 (at which point the company was renamed '''CTVglobemedia'''), but re-acquired the entire company, excluding the ''Globe'', in 2011.\n\n==History==\n===History before 2011===\n====Baton Broadcasting====\n{{Redirect|Baton Broadcasting|the defunct television system owned by Baton|Baton Broadcast System}}\nFor all practical purposes, Bell Media is the successor to '''Baton Broadcasting Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|e\u026a|t|\u0252|n}} {{respell|BAY|ton}}), which by the late 1990s had become one of Canada's largest broadcasters.\n\nBaton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting Ltd. was originally formed in 1960 to operate Toronto's first private television station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]]. The original investors included the [[John Bassett|<u>Ba</u>ssett]] and [[John David Eaton|Ea<u>ton</u>]] families ([[Telegram Corporation|Baton]]), [[Joel Aldred]] and [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.|Ted Rogers]], and [[Foster Hewitt]] in a much smaller role. Aldred sold his shares in 1961, followed by Rogers by 1970. With the Bassett and Eaton families firmly in control, the company went public in the early 1970s.\n\nCFTO was one of the charter affiliates of CTV when that network formed in 1961, becoming the network's flagship. In 1966, Baton became a part-owner in the network when it was reorganized as a station-owned [[cooperative]]. The [[Board of Broadcast Governors]] was initially skeptical about the proposal to turn CTV into a cooperative. Since CFTO was by far the largest and richest station in the network, the BBG feared Baton would take advantage of this to dominate the network. However, it approved the deal after Baton and the other owners included a provision in the cooperative's bylaws stipulating that the eight station owners would each have a single vote regardless of audience share. Additionally, if one owner ever bought another station, the acquired station's shares would be redistributed among the remaining owners so that each owner would still have one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1972, Baton began purchasing other CTV affiliates, starting with [[CFQC-DT|CFQC-TV]] in [[Saskatoon]]. This did not, however, give Baton a substantially higher investment in CTV, since its shares were redistributed among the other owners.  As a result, Baton still had only one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1987, Baton began a concerted effort to take over CTV.  It started this drive with a further expansion into [[Saskatchewan]], purchasing [[CKCK-DT|CKCK-TV]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Yorkton]] [[twinstick]] [[CKOS-TV]]/[[CICC-TV]], and CBC affiliate [[CKBI-TV]] [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. A twinstick CTV affiliate was soon launched in Prince Albert, [[CIPA-TV]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Baton applied for a high-power station in [[Ottawa]] on channel 60. The licence was approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), appealed to [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] by rival broadcasters, and ultimately sent back to the CRTC for review.<ref>[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html Order Referring back to the CRTC a Decision Respecting Nation's Capital Television Incorporated] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181627/http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, 28 April 1987</ref> However the licence was surrendered when Baton was instead able to acquire the local CTV affiliate, [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]], from [[Allan Slaight]]'s [[Standard Broadcasting]].\n\nIn 1990, Baton purchased the [[Mid-Canada Communications|MCTV]] system of [[twinstick]] operations in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Timmins]], and the [[Huron Broadcasting]] twinstick in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. In 1993, Baton purchased [[CFPL-DT|CFPL-TV]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[CKNX-TV]] in [[Wingham, Ontario|Wingham]] and received a licence for a new independent station, [[CHWI-DT|CHWI-TV]], in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\nIn 1991, the company launched Ontario Network Television, a secondary affiliation carried by Baton's CTV and [[independent station]]s in Ontario. This was expanded in 1994 into the [[Baton Broadcast System]], or BBS, which included Baton's Saskatchewan stations. BBS was meant as a backup in case Baton's ongoing acquisitions did not translate into control of CTV itself. A year earlier, CTV had been recently restructured into a corporation, with each owner holding a 14.3 percent stake in the network. However, any ''future'' acquisitions by Baton would come with all of that affiliate's CTV shares. It was around this time that former CBC executive [[Ivan Fecan]] joined the company.\n\n====Baton-Electrohome alliance====\nIn 1996, the CRTC approved two major deals involving Baton. First was the acquisition of [[CFCN-DT|CFCN-TV]] in [[Calgary]] from [[Rogers Communications]], which had recently purchased [[Maclean Hunter]]. Second, Baton and [[Electrohome]], owner of [[CKCO-DT|CKCO-TV]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton]], formed an alliance, under which the companies would share ownership of CFCN, Baton's stations in Saskatchewan and its independent stations in southwestern Ontario, and Electrohome's CKCO. The deals doubled Baton's own interest in CTV to 28.6%.  However, as part of the deal, Baton took control of Electrohome's CTV vote, allowing it to command 42.9% of CTV's shares.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-251.htm Decision CRTC 96-251], June 21, 1996</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Baton-Electrohome's \"Vancouver Television\" proposal emerged as the CRTC's choice for the new independent station in [[Vancouver]], beating out four other competitors. The new station, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]], would compete directly with [[Western International Communications]]'s two CTV affiliates in the market when it was launched that fall.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-39.htm Decision CRTC 97-39], January 31, 1997</ref>\n\nOn February 25, 1997, the Baton-Electrohome alliance and [[CHUM Limited]] announced that several stations would be swapped between them. Baton-Electrohome would acquire CHUM's [[CTV Atlantic|Atlantic Television System]] (ATV), consisting of four CTV affiliates in the [[Maritimes]], the [[CTV 2 Atlantic|Atlantic Satellite Network]] (ASN), and a further 14.3% in CTV. CHUM would receive Baton's independent stations in southwestern Ontario, as well as [[CHRO-TV]] in Pembroke, which had recently disaffiliated from CTV. The Baton-Electrohome alliance now held 57.2% of CTV.\n\nShortly thereafter, Electrohome announced it would sell its broadcasting assets \u2013 including CFRN its interest in the alliance and its CTV shares \u2013 to Baton in exchange for cash and shares in Baton. These two deals were approved by the CRTC in August.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-527.HTM Decision CRTC 97-527], August 28, 1997</ref> Baton now held controlling interest in CTV, triggering a [[put option]] that allowed the other owners to sell their stakes in the network while still keeping their stations. Accordingly, Baton acquired the remaining CTV shares from WIC and [[Moffat Communications]], which remained affiliates for the moment, that fall.\n\nThe BBS television system was merged into CTV, with the company itself being renamed CTV Inc. the following year. The Eatons' remaining shares, representing 41% of Baton, were sold off to the general public in early 1998. By the end of 2001, nearly all CTV stations were consolidated under network ownership (including one replacement).\n\n====NetStar Communications====\nNetStar Communications Inc. (previously Labatt Communications Inc., and currently CTV Specialty Television Inc.) was formed by [[Labatt Brewing Company]] to hold that firm's broadcasting assets, which included TSN, RDS, [[Viewers Choice]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]. In 1995, when the parent company was sold to the foreign brewing conglomerate [[Interbrew]], a consortium of four Canadian investors - [[Stephen Bronfman]] (22.5%), [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec|the Caisse]] (22.5%), [[Reitmans]] (16.5%), and senior management (6.5%) - along with [[ESPN]], with 32%, took over the company.<ref>[http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf Broadcast Dialogue newsletter, January 21, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304175349/http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter a takeover attempt by [[CanWest Global]] that was vetoed by ESPN, CTV announced a friendly bid to take over NetStar Communications in early 1999, with CRTC approval on March 24, 2000.\n\n====Under BCE ownership: Bell Globemedia (2000-2006)====\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, CTV (including the NetStar assets) was folded into a new media venture, Bell Globemedia Inc. (abbreviated \"BGM\"). This was masterminded by former [[Bell Canada]] chief executive [[Jean Monty]], largely as a response to [[Canwest]]'s purchase of the [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] newspaper chain as well as the trend of [[media convergence]], particularly the [[AOL]]-[[Time Warner]] merger. Monty believed that, to survive in a changing technological landscape, and in particular to drive subscriptions to [[satellite television]] provider [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]]<!-- As it was known at the time. --> and [[internet service provider]] [[Bell Sympatico]], BCE had to have control over content.\n\nThe transaction was structured as follows: In 2000, BCE acquired CTV Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.3 billion ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/02/25/bcectv000225.html BCE announces $2.3 billion bid for CTV], CBC.ca, February 25, 2000 (modified November 11, 2000); accessed August 9, 2006</ref> Soon after, Monty arranged to have [[Thomson Corporation]] transfer control of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the [[Toronto]]-based national newspaper, to BCE in exchange for a significant (20%) interest in the merged CTV/''Globe'' entity. The Thomsons' family holding company, [[The Woodbridge Company|The Woodbridge Company Ltd.]], invested in the company directly to obtain an additional 9.9% interest, and later bought Thomson Corp.'s interests itself.\n\nThe resulting company, Bell Globemedia, consisted of CTV, ''The Globe and Mail'', and the [[internet]] portal then known as [[Sympatico]]-[[Lycos]] (Lycos was later replaced by [[MSN]]). Fecan was named the combined firm's president and CEO, a role he remained in for the duration of the BGM / CTVgm era. After Monty resigned and was replaced by [[Michael Sabia]] in 2002, it became clear that Monty's vision was not producing anything near the desired results, notwithstanding the good results for the individual units, particularly the CTV network.\n\nThe following years provided a few cosmetic changes in BGM's assets. In 2001, CTV acquired [[CKY-DT|CKY-TV]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CFCF-DT|CFCF-TV]] in Montreal, and moved the CTV affiliation in British Columbia to CIVT, replacing two affiliates that had been purchased by Canwest. That fall also brought the launch of the first digital [[specialty channel]]s, including several owned by CTV.\n\nThe company acquired partial ownership in TQS in 2002, the Sympatico portal was sold back to Bell Canada, while a further investment from the Thomsons (whose ownership increased to 31.5%) funded the acquisition of 15% of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]. However, beginning in 2003, BCE management began to refer to BGM as a non-core asset; as a result, much attention was given to the likely sale of the company, and potentially a breakup into several different pieces.\n\n====Reorganization and CHUM Limited merger (2006-2011)====\n{{see also|CHUM Limited}}\n\nOn December 2, 2005, [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprises]] (BCE) announced it would sell an 8.5% interest to Woodbridge (increasing their total ownership to 40%), a 20% interest to [[Torstar]], and a 20% interest to the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]]. BCE retained 20% of the group - a condition that ensured that Bell TV, Sympatico, and other Bell units continued to have access to Globemedia content. The transaction closed on August 30, 2006.<ref>\"[http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html BGM Ownership Deal Closes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202033123/http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html |date=December 2, 2007 }}\", BGM press release, August 30, 2006</ref>\n\nThis deal put to rest any rumours about a possible breakup of the company. However, Torstar's involvement led to additional [[media concentration]] concerns, mainly from media [[trade union|union]]s. Torstar insisted it was committed to maintaining the [[editorial independence]] of the ''Globe'' and its own ''[[Toronto Star]]'', and ultimately there were no major regulatory hurdles due to this.\n\n{{Wikinews|Canadian media company Bell Globemedia to acquire rival CHUM}}On July 12, 2006, BGM announced a friendly bid to take over [[CHUM Limited]] for an estimated $1.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the secondary broadcast system ([[Citytv]]), other stations including [[CP24|CablePulse24]], [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Star!]], [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]], and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]], and all of CHUM's radio stations, into the BGM fold. BGM originally announced that CHUM's [[CTV 2|A-Channel]] stations, [[Access (TV channel)|Access]], [[CKX-TV]], [[MusiquePlus]], [[MusiMax]], [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[Cooking Channel (Canadian TV channel)|SexTV: The Channel]] and BGM's own [[OLN]] would not be retained.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, in order to pay for the CHUM acquisition, BGM sold additional shares to its existing shareholders. BCE did not participate in the refinancing; the net effect was an increase in Teachers' ownership to 25%, while BCE's interest was reduced to 15%.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html Bell Globemedia Completes Financing to Pay for CHUM Limited Shares] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222027/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, BGM press release, September 7, 2006</ref> As a result of BCE's reduced ownership, the company was renamed as CTVglobemedia as of January 1, 2007.\n\nIn April 2007, [[Rogers Communications]] announced a tentative deal to purchase A-Channel, CKX-TV, Access Alberta, Canadian Learning Television, and SexTV: The Channel from CTVglobemedia, if its purchase of CHUM was approved. [[Astral Media]] made a similar deal for CHUM's 50% interest in MusiMax and MusiquePlus.\n\nThat June, the CRTC approved the CHUM takeover, on condition that CTV sell off the Citytv stations, because of the CTV network's O&O stations serving the very same cities. CTV ultimately chose to keep the A-Channel stations along with the rest of CHUM assets it had previously said it would sell, except for MusiquePlus/MusiMax. [[Rogers Communications]] was announced as the buyer of the Citytv stations on June 11, 2007, and the CHUM acquisition was finalized on June 22.\n\nSince then, CTVglobemedia has sold off its interests in various non-core channels. Rogers has purchased several of these assets, including CTV's 33% interest in OLN in late 2007, as well as radio stations [[CHST-FM]] in [[London, Ontario]] and [[CHBN-FM]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm Canada's Rogers Radio acquires Edmonton top 40 station 91.7 The Bounce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032732/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm |date=2010-06-27 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario Canada's Rogers Radio acquires 102.3 Bob FM in London, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804172359/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario |date=2011-08-04 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref> [[Corus Entertainment]] would acquire [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[SexTV: The Channel]], and [[Drive-In Classics]] for a combined $113 million.

In some contexts the '' 'ndrine'' have become more powerful than the ''locale'' on which they formally depend.<ref name=\"paoli29\" /> Other observers maintain that the '' 'ndrina'' is the basic organizational unit.

Marriages help cement relations within each '' 'ndrina'' and to expand membership. As a result, a few blood families constitute each group, hence \"a high number of people with the same last name often end up being prosecuted for membership of a given '' 'ndrina''.\" Indeed, since there is no limit to the membership of a single unit, bosses try to maximize descendants.<ref name=\"varese\" />\n\nAt the bottom of the chain of command are the ''picciotti d'onore'' or soldiers, who are expected to perform tasks with blind obedience until they are promoted to the next level of ''cammorista'', where they will be granted command over their own group of soldiers.

The ''Quintino'', also called ''Padrino'', is the second-highest level of command in a 'Ndrangheta clan (name ''Ndrina''), being made up of five privileged members of the crime family who report directly to the boss, the ''[[capobastone]]'' (head of command).<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 'Ndrangheta Looms Large |url=http://americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_286.html |website=americanmafia.com |access-date=10 February 2016 |last=La Sorte |first=Mike |date=December 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054929/http://americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_286.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== Power structure ===\nFor many years, the power apparatus of the single families were the sole ruling bodies within the two associations, and they have remained the real centers of power even after superordinate bodies were created in the [[Cosa Nostra]] beginning in the 1950s (the [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]]) and in the 'Ndrangheta a superordinate body was created only in 1991 as the result of negotiations to end years of inter-family violence.<ref name=\"paoli\">{{cite web |url=http://www.organized-crime.de/revpao01mafiandrangheta.htm |title=Review of: Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'' |publisher=Organized-crime.de |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215127/http://www.organized-crime.de/revpao01mafiandrangheta.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the Sicilian Mafia, the 'Ndrangheta managed to maintain a horizontal organizational structure up to the early 1990s, avoiding the establishment of a formal superordinate body.

Following the failure of the [[French Air Force]] to select the Fleuret, Morane-Saulnier opted to develop the design into a liaison aircraft and compact [[business jet]]. The primary difference between the two designs was the altered seating arrangement, the original [[side-by-side seating]] two-seat cockpit was modified to allow for the addition of another row of two seats to accommodate passengers. The Paris retained the flight characteristics of the Fleuret along with the option for installing armaments, which maintained its potential for use as a military trainer as well for civil aviation. On 29 July 1954, the prototype performed the type's [[maiden flight]].\n\nThe primary operator of the Paris was the French air services, who used the type for liaison purposes between 1959 and 1997. During 1955, a short-lived joint venture was formed between Morane-Saulnier and American aviation company [[Beech Aircraft]] to market the Paris as an early Executive Business Jet in the [[North America]]n market.<ref>Jerram, Mike. [http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf \"Morane-Saulnier Paris: The very first Very Light Jet.\"] ''General Aviation'', October 2010.</ref> However, it was soon eclipsed by the arrival of more advanced business jets, such as [[Learjet]]\u2019s [[Learjet 23|Model 23]], leading to the joint venture being disbanded during early 1961. During the 1960s more advanced variants were developed such as the ''MS.760B Paris II'' and the six-seat ''MS.760C Paris III''; the latter would not enter production however. While four-seat propeller planes are commonplace, jet-powered aircraft with this seating arrangement, such as the [[Grumman EA-6B Prowler]] combat aircraft, have remained comparatively rare.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Origins===\nThe Paris has its origins within an earlier jet trainer aircraft developed by French aircraft manufacturer [[Morane-Saulnier]]. During the early 1950s, the [[French Air Force]] sought a jet trainer suitable to the [[ab-initio]] training sector; in response, Morane-Saulnier produced their own submission, designated as the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]].<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> However, the military competition was ultimately won by another bid, which was produced in large numbers as the [[Fouga Magister]]. Shortly after this failure, Morane-Saulnier decided to embark upon a re-design of the MS.755 to allow it to function as a four-seat liaison aircraft instead; accordingly, the new aircraft was later given the designation of ''MS.760 Paris''.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/><ref name = \"phil 26\"/>\n\nAccording to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], the adaption from the earlier Fleuret to the Paris had been largely achieved via the elimination of the former's armament, the re-design of the cabin floor to remove the downward [[ejection seat|ejection]] hatch arrangement, and the repositioning of the cabin's rear bulkhead slightly aft.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> To avoid a reduction of the aircraft's available fuel tankage as a result of the latter change, the tank was re-profiled in other areas to expand it. In spite of these changes, the Paris still retained the favourable flying characteristics and did not entirely foreclose its use as a trainer aircraft.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/>\n\nThe Paris differed from the majority of liaison aircraft then in service by its use of [[jet propulsion]], instead of a [[turboprop]] or [[piston engine]].<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> According to M. Vichou, the head of the design department of Morane-Saulnier, the decision to adopt a pair of [[Turbomeca Marbor\u00e9]] jet engines had been determined to be the superior option available; studies found that a single turboprop engine capable of providing at least 2,000 hp was necessary to produce a comparable performance, which would have resulted in the additional complications of appropriately accommodating a fairly large [[propeller]] in the design. Another alternative in using a pair of small turboprop engines was also less convenient than the Marbore engine, which could be positioned relatively low down in the airframe and in close proximity to the aircraft's centre-line.<ref name = \"actfra 553\">Lambert, C. M. [https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%200553.html \"Actualites Francaises.\"] ''[[Flight International]]'', 29 April 1955. p. 553.</ref>\n\nThe all-up weight of the Paris, including a payload of four passengers and 30 kg (66 lb) of baggage, was 3,397 kg (7,470 lb) and its maximum flight speed was 650 km/hr (400 mph).<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> According to the manufacturer, it was able to ascend to an altitude of 7,000m (22,900ft) in 18 minutes; at this altitude and at maximum continuous thrust, the aircraft had a flight endurance of 2 hours 45 minutes and a maximum range of 930 miles. In terms of fuel, the main fuselage tank contained up to 1,000 litres (220 gal), while a further 250 litres (55 gal) could be accommodated in each tip-tank.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> A feature that was intended to be used in emergency situations was the provisioning of the tip-tanks with electrically-actuated valves, which enabled the rapid dumping of any remaining fuel. Actuation of the [[flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s, [[Air brake (aeronautics)|dive-brake]] and [[landing gear|undercarriage]] was provided using electric [[motor]]s delivering power via flexible shafts and Lear electric motors.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> The nose of the Paris contained much of the avionics and electrical systems, including the [[radio]], [[alternator]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and motors. Access to the engines was provided via a completely detachable tail unit; the wings could also be similarly detached without the necessity of removing the undercarriage.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> The sizable main canopy was a one-piece [[Molding (process)|mould]]ing, being 8 mm (0.3 lin) thick. For increased passenger comfort, the cabin was both fully [[cabin pressurization|pressurized]] and [[air conditioning|air-conditioned]].<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/>\n\nOn 29 July 1954, the prototype MS.760, registered F-WGVO (F-BGVO), took off on its [[maiden flight]].<ref name = \"phil 26\"/> Various features of its design, such as its [[T-tail|T-shaped vertical stabilizer]], low wing, and two [[Turbomeca Marbor\u00e9|Turbomeca Marbor\u00e9 II]] 400&nbsp;kg [[turbojet]]s internally mounted side-by-side within the aft fuselage, led to the aircraft being largely characterized for its inherent stability during flight. The French military emerged as a crucial early customer for the Paris, ordering a large batch of 50 aircraft to perform liaison duties for both the French Air Force and the French Navy, replacing older types such as the [[Nord Noralpha]] and [[Nord Nor\u00e9crin]]. The securing of this order allowed Morane-Saulnier to proceed with quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> On 27 February 1958, the first production aircraft performed its first flight. Early aircraft were provided with a total of four seats, two in the front and two in the back, and a retractable tricycle landing gear.\n\n===Production===\nBy the early 1960s, the main production focus of Morane-Saulnier firmly set on the Paris.<ref name = \"fi 1961\"/> According to Flight International, by May 1961, 100 aircraft had been completed and the type was being manufactured at a rate of four per month. At the same time, roughly 200 aircraft were reportedly on order; while the French Air Force was still the primary customer for the type, additional export sales arrangements had been achieved with ten separate foreign countries.<ref name = \"fi 1961\"/> Flight International also reported that Morane-Saulnier had come to two separate agreements to [[licensed production|license]] manufacturing of the Paris to other companies.<ref name = \"fi 1961\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200698.html \"France's Aircraft Industry.\"] ''Flight International'', 25 May 1961. p. 708.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1955, even prior to the Paris having entered into production, it was known that American manufacturer [[Beech Aircraft]] held considerable interest in the programme, and was reportedly considered options for producing the type in North America [[licensed production|under licence]] from Morane-Saulnier.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> For a time, the Paris was the only twin-jet civil aircraft and there was no direct competitors available.<ref name = \"phil 26\">Phillips et al 2012, p. 26.</ref> In response to this interest, senior design staff at the French company spent considerable time in the United States during the development phase of the programme. Reportedly, by 1955, Beechcraft had requested that the Paris, installed with the latest model of the Marbor\u00e9 engine, be dispatched to North American to perform demonstration flights totalling 500 flight hours.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> Later that year, this demonstration was conducted, during which the aircraft visited several major cities across both the United States and [[Canada]].<ref name = \"phil 26\"/>\n\nDetailed production plans were mooted by Beechcraft and Morane-Saulnier; one key difference of the projected American-built aircraft was the adoption of the US-built [[Teledyne CAE J69]] engine to take the place of the Marbor\u00e9 powerplants.<ref name = \"phil 26\"/> Beechcraft led approaches to both the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], offering the Paris to meet their requirements for a jet-propelled trainer aircraft. During January 1958, the company announced a price of $210,000 for a single US-built Paris, spare parts, maintenance tooling, and a training course to familiarise operators with tending to the needs of the relatively unfamiliar jet engine; this measure was due to relatively few private companies, let alone private operators, possessing any experience with jet propulsion.<ref name = \"phil 27\">Phillips et al 2012, p. 27.</ref>  However, American sales of the Paris were not forthcoming, reportedly, only two sales were made during Beechcraft's tenure as the type's distributor; by early 1961, when Beechcraft chose to abandon all distribution activities involving the type, a number of more advanced [[business jet]]s, such as the [[Lockheed JetStar]] and the [[North American Sabreliner]], had become available and gained traction in the market.<ref name = \"phil 27 52\">Phillips et al 2012, pp. 27, 52.</ref> \n\nDuring 1961, production commenced on an improved variant of the type, designated as the ''MS.760B Paris II'', fitted with a pair of Marbor\u00e9 VI 480&nbsp;kg engines, wingtip fuel tanks, [[air conditioning]], and an enlarged luggage compartment. Following the [[bankruptcy]] of Morane-Saulnier in 1961, the company was acquired by aviation firm [[Potez]], who continued development on work on the type for a time.<ref name = \"phil 52\"/> On 24 February 1964, a six-passenger version, designated ''MS.760C Paris III'', performed its first flight; however, there was ultimately no production of this variant. Production of the Paris II ceased, and production of the Paris III never started as hopes of a substantial order to support its launch went unfulfilled..<ref name = \"phil 52 53\">Phillips et al 2012, pp. 52-53.</ref> During the type's production run, a total of 153 aircraft (of both Paris I and Paris II variants) were manufactured for several different operators, including the French Air Force, the French Navy, the [[Argentinian Air Force]], and the [[Brazilian Air Force]].\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:MS-760C Paris III LeB 1967.jpg|thumb|right|The sole MS.760C Paris III six-seat aircraft at the Paris Air Show in June 1967]]\n\nOn 18 July 1956, the French government requisitioned a batch of 50 aircraft, including 14 of which that were destined for the Navy, from Morane-Saulnier. The first plane was delivered on 9 February 1959 to Naval Air Station (N.A.S.) [[Paris - Le Bourget Airport|Dugny-Le Bourget]], before going to the C.E.P.A. (directly translated as Aeronautical Practical Experiment Center - in English this would probably be \"Flight Test Centre\") in 1959-60, for the flight tests necessary to develop training programs and materials. The type was also purchased by several countries such as Brazil and Argentina; 36 planes were license-built by [[F\u00e1brica de Aviones C\u00f3rdoba|Fabrica Militar de Aviones]] (FMA) in Argentina. The MS.760B Paris II, with various systems improvements and integral fuel tanks in the leading edges of the wing, first flew on 12 December 1960.\n\n[[File:Morane MS760B PH-MSV Gron 13.03.67 edited-2 MIck edited-1.jpg|thumb|right|MS.760B of the Rijksluchtvaartschool at Groningen Airport in 1967]]\nBetween September 1962 and November 1974, a fleet of six MS.760Bs were flown on training duties by the Rijksluchtvaartschool based at [[Groningen Airport]] in the north of the Netherlands.<ref>Dekker 1987, pp. 94-95.</ref> From 1958 to the early 1970s, a single MS 760 was used as a flying classroom at the \"College of Aeronautics\" at [[Cranfield]], [[United Kingdom]]; the aircraft was equipped to study stability and control together with performance as part of the MSc course.\n\nThe 14 MS.760 were assigned to Flight 11.S from 9 February 1959 onwards. The last plane, No. 88, was delivered on 27 July 1961. In 1965, MS.760 No. 48 was briefly assigned to Flight 3.S based at N.A.S [[Hy\u00e8res]]. From 1970 onwards, all the 12 remaining MS.760s were assigned to Flight 2.S based at N.A.S. Lann-Bihou\u00e9. During May 1972, these aircraft were dispatched to the S.R.L.

Following the failure of the [[French Air Force]] to select the Fleuret, Morane-Saulnier opted to develop the design into a liaison aircraft and compact [[business jet]]. The primary difference between the two designs was the altered seating arrangement, the original [[side-by-side seating]] two-seat cockpit was modified to allow for the addition of another row of two seats to accommodate passengers. The Paris retained the flight characteristics of the Fleuret along with the option for installing armaments, which maintained its potential for use as a military trainer as well for civil aviation. On 29 July 1954, the prototype performed the type's [[maiden flight]].\n\nThe primary operator of the Paris was the French air services, who used the type for liaison purposes between 1959 and 1997. During 1955, a short-lived joint venture was formed between Morane-Saulnier and American aviation company [[Beech Aircraft]] to market the Paris as an early Executive Business Jet in the [[North America]]n market.<ref>Jerram, Mike. [http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf \"Morane-Saulnier Paris: The very first Very Light Jet.\"] ''General Aviation'', October 2010.</ref> However, it was soon eclipsed by the arrival of more advanced business jets, such as [[Learjet]]\u2019s [[Learjet 23|Model 23]], leading to the joint venture being disbanded during early 1961. During the 1960s more advanced variants were developed such as the ''MS.760B Paris II'' and the six-seat ''MS.760C Paris III''; the latter would not enter production however. While four-seat propeller planes are commonplace, jet-powered aircraft with this seating arrangement, such as the [[Grumman EA-6B Prowler]] combat aircraft, have remained comparatively rare.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Origins===\nThe Paris has its origins within an earlier jet trainer aircraft developed by French aircraft manufacturer [[Morane-Saulnier]]. During the early 1950s, the [[French Air Force]] sought a jet trainer suitable to the [[ab-initio]] training sector; in response, Morane-Saulnier produced their own submission, designated as the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]].<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> However, the military competition was ultimately won by another bid, which was produced in large numbers as the [[Fouga Magister]]. Shortly after this failure, Morane-Saulnier decided to embark upon a re-design of the MS.755 to allow it to function as a four-seat liaison aircraft instead; accordingly, the new aircraft was later given the designation of ''MS.760 Paris''.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/><ref name = \"phil 26\"/>\n\nAccording to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], the adaption from the earlier Fleuret to the Paris had been largely achieved via the elimination of the former's armament, the re-design of the cabin floor to remove the downward [[ejection seat|ejection]] hatch arrangement, and the repositioning of the cabin's rear bulkhead slightly aft.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> To avoid a reduction of the aircraft's available fuel tankage as a result of the latter change, the tank was re-profiled in other areas to expand it. In spite of these changes, the Paris still retained the favourable flying characteristics and did not entirely foreclose its use as a trainer aircraft.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/>\n\nThe Paris differed from the majority of liaison aircraft then in service by its use of [[jet propulsion]], instead of a [[turboprop]] or [[piston engine]].<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> According to M. Vichou, the head of the design department of Morane-Saulnier, the decision to adopt a pair of [[Turbomeca Marbor\u00e9]] jet engines had been determined to be the superior option available; studies found that a single turboprop engine capable of providing at least 2,000 hp was necessary to produce a comparable performance, which would have resulted in the additional complications of appropriately accommodating a fairly large [[propeller]] in the design. Another alternative in using a pair of small turboprop engines was also less convenient than the Marbore engine, which could be positioned relatively low down in the airframe and in close proximity to the aircraft's centre-line.<ref name = \"actfra 553\">Lambert, C. M. [https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%200553.html \"Actualites Francaises.\"] ''[[Flight International]]'', 29 April 1955. p. 553.</ref>\n\nThe all-up weight of the Paris, including a payload of four passengers and 30 kg (66 lb) of baggage, was 3,397 kg (7,470 lb) and its maximum flight speed was 650 km/hr (400 mph).<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> According to the manufacturer, it was able to ascend to an altitude of 7,000m (22,900ft) in 18 minutes; at this altitude and at maximum continuous thrust, the aircraft had a flight endurance of 2 hours 45 minutes and a maximum range of 930 miles. In terms of fuel, the main fuselage tank contained up to 1,000 litres (220 gal), while a further 250 litres (55 gal) could be accommodated in each tip-tank.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> A feature that was intended to be used in emergency situations was the provisioning of the tip-tanks with electrically-actuated valves, which enabled the rapid dumping of any remaining fuel. Actuation of the [[flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s, [[Air brake (aeronautics)|dive-brake]] and [[landing gear|undercarriage]] was provided using electric [[motor]]s delivering power via flexible shafts and Lear electric motors.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> The nose of the Paris contained much of the avionics and electrical systems, including the [[radio]], [[alternator]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and motors. Access to the engines was provided via a completely detachable tail unit; the wings could also be similarly detached without the necessity of removing the undercarriage.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> The sizable main canopy was a one-piece [[mould]]ing, being 8 mm (0.3 lin) thick. For increased passenger comfort, the cabin was both fully [[cabin pressurization|pressurized]] and [[air conditioning|air-conditioned]].<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/>\n\nOn 29 July 1954, the prototype MS.760, registered F-WGVO (F-BGVO), took off on its [[maiden flight]].<ref name = \"phil 26\"/> Various features of its design, such as its [[T-tail|T-shaped vertical stabilizer]], low wing, and two [[Turbomeca Marbor\u00e9|Turbomeca Marbor\u00e9 II]] 400&nbsp;kg [[turbojet]]s internally mounted side-by-side within the aft fuselage, led to the aircraft being largely characterized for its inherent stability during flight. The French military emerged as a crucial early customer for the Paris, ordering a large batch of 50 aircraft to perform liaison duties for both the French Air Force and the French Navy, replacing older types such as the [[Nord Noralpha]] and [[Nord Nor\u00e9crin]]. The securing of this order allowed Morane-Saulnier to proceed with quantity production of the type.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> On 27 February 1958, the first production aircraft performed its first flight. Early aircraft were provided with a total of four seats, two in the front and two in the back, and a retractable tricycle landing gear.\n\n===Production===\nBy the early 1960s, the main production focus of Morane-Saulnier firmly set on the Paris.<ref name = \"fi 1961\"/> According to Flight International, by May 1961, 100 aircraft had been completed and the type was being manufactured at a rate of four per month. At the same time, roughly 200 aircraft were reportedly on order; while the French Air Force was still the primary customer for the type, additional export sales arrangements had been achieved with ten separate foreign countries.<ref name = \"fi 1961\"/> Flight International also reported that Morane-Saulnier had come to two separate agreements to [[licensed production|license]] manufacturing of the Paris to other companies.<ref name = \"fi 1961\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200698.html \"France's Aircraft Industry.\"] ''Flight International'', 25 May 1961. p. 708.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1955, even prior to the Paris having entered into production, it was known that American manufacturer [[Beech Aircraft]] held considerable interest in the programme, and was reportedly considered options for producing the type in North America [[licensed production|under licence]] from Morane-Saulnier.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> For a time, the Paris was the only twin-jet civil aircraft and there was no direct competitors available.<ref name = \"phil 26\">Phillips et al 2012, p. 26.</ref> In response to this interest, senior design staff at the French company spent considerable time in the United States during the development phase of the programme. Reportedly, by 1955, Beechcraft had requested that the Paris, installed with the latest model of the Marbor\u00e9 engine, be dispatched to North American to perform demonstration flights totalling 500 flight hours.<ref name = \"actfra 553\"/> Later that year, this demonstration was conducted, during which the aircraft visited several major cities across both the United States and [[Canada]].<ref name = \"phil 26\"/>\n\nDetailed production plans were mooted by Beechcraft and Morane-Saulnier; one key difference of the projected American-built aircraft was the adoption of the US-built [[Teledyne CAE J69]] engine to take the place of the Marbor\u00e9 powerplants.<ref name = \"phil 26\"/> Beechcraft led approaches to both the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], offering the Paris to meet their requirements for a jet-propelled trainer aircraft. During January 1958, the company announced a price of $210,000 for a single US-built Paris, spare parts, maintenance tooling, and a training course to familiarise operators with tending to the needs of the relatively unfamiliar jet engine; this measure was due to relatively few private companies, let alone private operators, possessing any experience with jet propulsion.<ref name = \"phil 27\">Phillips et al 2012, p. 27.</ref>  However, American sales of the Paris were not forthcoming, reportedly, only two sales were made during Beechcraft's tenure as the type's distributor; by early 1961, when Beechcraft chose to abandon all distribution activities involving the type, a number of more advanced [[business jet]]s, such as the [[Lockheed JetStar]] and the [[North American Sabreliner]], had become available and gained traction in the market.<ref name = \"phil 27 52\">Phillips et al 2012, pp. 27, 52.</ref> \n\nDuring 1961, production commenced on an improved variant of the type, designated as the ''MS.760B Paris II'', fitted with a pair of Marbor\u00e9 VI 480&nbsp;kg engines, wingtip fuel tanks, [[air conditioning]], and an enlarged luggage compartment. Following the [[bankruptcy]] of Morane-Saulnier in 1961, the company was acquired by aviation firm [[Potez]], who continued development on work on the type for a time.<ref name = \"phil 52\"/> On 24 February 1964, a six-passenger version, designated ''MS.760C Paris III'', performed its first flight; however, there was ultimately no production of this variant. Production of the Paris II ceased, and production of the Paris III never started as hopes of a substantial order to support its launch went unfulfilled..<ref name = \"phil 52 53\">Phillips et al 2012, pp. 52-53.</ref> During the type's production run, a total of 153 aircraft (of both Paris I and Paris II variants) were manufactured for several different operators, including the French Air Force, the French Navy, the [[Argentinian Air Force]], and the [[Brazilian Air Force]].\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:MS-760C Paris III LeB 1967.jpg|thumb|right|The sole MS.760C Paris III six-seat aircraft at the Paris Air Show in June 1967]]\n\nOn 18 July 1956, the French government requisitioned a batch of 50 aircraft, including 14 of which that were destined for the Navy, from Morane-Saulnier. The first plane was delivered on 9 February 1959 to Naval Air Station (N.A.S.) [[Paris - Le Bourget Airport|Dugny-Le Bourget]], before going to the C.E.P.A. (directly translated as Aeronautical Practical Experiment Center - in English this would probably be \"Flight Test Centre\") in 1959-60, for the flight tests necessary to develop training programs and materials. The type was also purchased by several countries such as Brazil and Argentina; 36 planes were license-built by [[F\u00e1brica de Aviones C\u00f3rdoba|Fabrica Militar de Aviones]] (FMA) in Argentina. The MS.760B Paris II, with various systems improvements and integral fuel tanks in the leading edges of the wing, first flew on 12 December 1960.\n\n[[File:Morane MS760B PH-MSV Gron 13.03.67 edited-2 MIck edited-1.jpg|thumb|right|MS.760B of the Rijksluchtvaartschool at Groningen Airport in 1967]]\nBetween September 1962 and November 1974, a fleet of six MS.760Bs were flown on training duties by the Rijksluchtvaartschool based at [[Groningen Airport]] in the north of the Netherlands.<ref>Dekker 1987, pp. 94-95.</ref> From 1958 to the early 1970s, a single MS 760 was used as a flying classroom at the \"College of Aeronautics\" at [[Cranfield]], [[United Kingdom]]; the aircraft was equipped to study stability and control together with performance as part of the MSc course.\n\nThe 14 MS.760 were assigned to Flight 11.S from 9 February 1959 onwards. The last plane, No. 88, was delivered on 27 July 1961. In 1965, MS.760 No. 48 was briefly assigned to Flight 3.S based at N.A.S [[Hy\u00e8res]]. From 1970 onwards, all the 12 remaining MS.760s were assigned to Flight 2.S based at N.A.S. Lann-Bihou\u00e9. During May 1972, these aircraft were dispatched to the S.R.L. On 1 September 1981, this unit became Flight 57.S.{{CN|date=November 2017}} Their missions were to provide various forms of training, such as [[Dassault Super \u00c9tendard]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader]] pilot [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR) flight, all-weather flights, advanced training for new pilots, proficiency training for other pilots and A.L.P.A.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\".

Local ([[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]]e / [[Districts of Germany|Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte]]) health departments initially reported data to the federal country health department which transferred data to the nations federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal country health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

When used correctly, they can provide a valuable aid to investigation.<ref name=\"Graham Coleman\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.buildingpreservation.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=26\n| title = Use of electrical moisture meters\n}}</ref> The competence and experience of the person undertaking the damp investigations is often of greater importance than the kit he or she carries. Experience and qualified surveyors are the difference between a correct and incorrect diagnosis of damp. For example, it is sometimes found that [[Condensation#Condensation in building construction|condensation]] is misdiagnosed as another form of dampness resulting in the wrong form of treatment being specified. Chartered building surveyors are usually experienced in identifying dampness issues, however, their reports often suggest that dampness problems are investigated by a specialist damp and timber surveyor with a CSRT qualification.\n\n==Prevention and treatment==\nMost forms of dampness can be prevented by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include [[damp proofing]] in the form of a synthetic damp-proof course (DPC), about 15&nbsp;cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or \"engineering bricks\" with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem.\n\nThere are many approaches to the treatment of dampness in existing buildings. Key to the selection of an appropriate treatment is a correct diagnosis of the types of dampness affecting a building. Details of possible treatments for specific types of dampness are covered in the sections below.\n\nThe cause of the dampness must first be eliminated, by providing better drainage or fixing leaking pipes. Several methods of treating rising damp are possible, including the use of land-drains and the insertion of physical and chemical DPCs <ref name=\"Trotman_a\">{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Trotman|volume=BRE Digest 245|publisher=Building Research l Establishment|title=Rising damp in walls, diagnosis and treatment|isbn=978-1-84806-012-8}}</ref>. Then, any affected plaster or mortar must be removed, and the wall treated, before replacing the plaster and repainting.\n\n==Humidity==\nHumidity occurs in indoor environments due to building related causes. Porous walls, rising damp, and leaks in the building are determinants for structural dampness due to elevated humidity levels.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}} The construction of the building can also lead to humidity and unwanted moisture in the indoor environment.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\">{{cite web|last=Prowler|first=Don|title=Mold and Moisture Dynamics|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/moisturedynamics.php|publisher=WBDG: Whole Building Design Guide|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> Wet materials, such as lumber stored unprotected outdoors before construction, can lead to increased humidity indoors for up to the second year of occupancy in the building.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\"/> Most commonly in residences, elevated relative humidity is produced by poor drainage systems. This leads to dampness in substructures such as crawlspaces and basements. The dampness results in vaporization where water vapor is transmitted into the building's interiors. Water vapor may enter the building through supply air ducts in building slabs and circulated by warm forced air. Water vapor can also enter a building through leaky return air ducts in homes with crawlspaces.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}}\n\nHuman occupancy adds a significant amount of humidity to the indoor environment. Personal activity as basic as breathing and perspiration add moisture to an indoor space.<ref name=\"Humidity Cooling\">{{cite web |title=Why Humidity Matters when Cooling |url=http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |publisher=Nature's Cooling Solutions |accessdate=13 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135306/http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Cooking and showering raise humidity levels in the indoor environment, which directly affects the structural dampness of a home. Aspects of the home can also increase the humidity of a space. Items such as aquariums, indoor swimming pools, hot tubs, and even indoor plants add to the humidity of an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> All of these attributes can increase the humidity of a home beyond its recommended thirty to fifty percent.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\nHumidity levels in an indoor environment need to be accounted for based upon season and temperature. If humidity levels do not agree with the time of the year and the temperature during seasons, mold infestation and deterioration of the building will occur due to moisture. An acceptable humidity level in indoor spaces ranges from twenty to sixty per cent year round.<ref name=\"Air Quality\">{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality|url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/indoorairqualityguide_fs.htm|publisher=Illinois Department of Public Health|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> However, levels less than twenty per cent in the winter and levels higher than sixty per cent in the summer are deemed unacceptable for indoor air quality.<ref name=\"Air Quality\" /> Structural dampness is likely to occur as well as an increase of health risks associated with moisture damage.\n\n===Prevention and treatment===\nThere are strategies to prevent water infiltration due to humidity into structures, as well as ways to treat human occupancy practices regarding humidity. Vapor retarders are materials that can be used to restrain uncontrolled airflow and water vapor into an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Vapor retarders are used to decrease the rate and amount of water vapor diffusion through ceilings, walls, and floors caused by humidity.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> It is made of thin, flexible materials and its coatings can be installed by trowels or brushes.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Utilizing vapor retarders in a building prevents structural dampness from occurring or continuing if it already exists. A strategy for reducing humidity levels in an indoor environment is by altering occupant activity and indoor mechanics. Kitchens and bathrooms need to have their own vents.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Additionally, washing machines need to be vented outdoors.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Both of these are important in order to decrease indoor moisture due to humidity caused by the activities occurring in these indoor spaces. Moisture sources, such as hot tubs or indoor swimming pools, should be covered by airtight lids when not in use, thus humidity levels stay low in the indoor environment///-.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\n==Condensation==\nCondensation comes from water vapour within the building. Common sources may include cooking, bathing, dishwashers, etc. The moisture in the air condenses on cold surfaces, sometimes inside the walls called [[interstitial condensation]]. Buildings with poorly insulated walls are very prone to this problem. It often causes damage similar to damp in a building and often appears in similar places. This is because it occurs in the \"dead air\" pockets that accumulate in both horizontal and vertical corners (i.e. out of circulating air patterns).\n\n[[File:Mould Caused By Condensation.jpg|thumb|Mould growth caused by condensation in dead air pocket behind books]]\n\nMoisture condenses on the interiors of buildings due to specific interactions between the roof and wall. Leaks most commonly occur on flat-roofed buildings.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|328}} Certain building materials and mechanisms can be used to prevent condensation from occurring in these areas, therefore reducing structural dampness and potential mold infestation. In many cases, the insulation between the roof and wall is compressed, leading to a decrease in thermal resistance.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Due to the lack of thermal resistance, condensation occurs, which leads to water damage in the indoor environment. In most cases where moisture is not addressed quickly enough, mold and mildew develop. Another issue is that wind washing up into the crevice where the roof and wall intersect reduces the efficiency of the insulation.<ref name=\"Roof Surface\">{{cite web|title=The Leaky Roof Surface |url=http://livingwithmyhome.com/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |work=Living With My Home |publisher=Pillar To Post, Inc. |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916001154/http://www.livingwithmyhome.com:80/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |archivedate=16 September 2011 }}</ref> This results in condensation and risk for mold growth.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, condensation problems are particularly common between October and March&nbsp;\u2013 to the extent that this period is often referred to as the \"condensation season.\"<ref name=\"Peter MacDonald Condensation\">[http://www.dampdecay.co.uk/index.php/condensation-explained/94-condensation-1-the-condensation-season-october-until-march The Condensation Season - October until March], Peter MacDonald - Condensation Explained.</ref>\n\n===Identification of condensation===\nIf it is suspected that the problem is condensation, then a room should be sealed off with a [[dehumidifier]] left running for the recommended time and then further instrument tests made. If the dampness has disappeared, then condensation is very likely the problem.\n\nAlternatively Humiditect cards or dataloggers (measuring air humidity, air temperature, and surface temperature) can be used as tools for diagnosing a condensation problem.<ref name=\"Peter MacDonald Condensation Identification\">[http://www.dampdecay.co.uk/index.php/condensation-explained/107-condensation-14-qhow-can-i-check-for-condensationq How can I check for condensation?], Peter MacDonald - Condensation Explained.</ref>\n\n===Treatment===\nTypical remedies for condensation include increasing background heat and ventilation,<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=151|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref> improving the insulation of cold surfaces and reducing moisture generation (e.g. by avoiding the drying of clothes indoors).\n\n==Rain penetration==\nRain Penetration (also known as \"penetrating damp\"(<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seamlesscoatings.co.uk/what-is-penetrating-damp-and-how-can-i-solve-it |title=What is Penetrating Damp and How Can I Solve It |publisher=Seamlesscoatings.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-12}}</ref>)) is a common form of dampness in buildings. It can occur through walls, roofs, or through openings (e.g. window reveals).<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nWater will often penetrate the outer envelope of a building and appear inside. Common defects include:\n* Roof defects such as faulty [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]], cracked or missing slates or tiles.\n* Faults in the brickwork or masonry such as missing or cracked [[repointing|pointing]]. Porous bricks or stones.\n* Missing or defective mastic around windows and doors.\n* Blocked [[weep hole]]s.\n* Missing or defective trays in [[cavity wall]]s.\n\n===Walls===\nRain penetration is most often associated with single-skin walls, but can also occur through cavity walls - e.g. by tracking across wall ties.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nSingle-skin brick walls of standard thickness (9 inches) have been considered to provide inadequate resistance to rain penetration for many years, which is why [[Cavity wall|cavity wall construction]] is now standard in the UK. The 1944 Housing Manual published by the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Health stated that:<blockquote>''\"The resistance to penetration of rain should not be less than that of 11-in. brick cavity wall, properly designed and constructed with attention to details at the heads and joints of openings. An unrendered 9-in. wall is regarded as substandard.\"''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Housing manual : 1944|last=Gran Bretagna. Ministry of Health.|date=1944|publisher=His Majesty's stationery office|oclc=1110914533}}</ref></blockquote>Whilst renders are often applied in an attempt to resist rain penetration, they must be maintained in good condition in order to fulfil this function. Even relatively small cracks in renders can allow rain penetration to pass into the underlying masonry. In his 1954 book, \"The Restoration of Old Houses\" Hugh Braun highlighted problems inherent in certain types of render that were widely used in the late eighteenth century and throughout the Victorian era:\n\n''\"By the end of the eighteenth century a number of patent water-repellent cements were appearing on the market, the most popular of which, roman cement, continued in universal use throughout the Victorian era; many old buildings were rendered with this substance. Its adhesion was poor and it will often be found that it has become separated from the walling over considerable areas and can be stripped away in large sheets.\"'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Restoration of Old Houses|last=Braun|first=Hugh|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n====Primary Causes====\n\n* Porous masonry (i.e. under-fired bricks, porous stone, or porous mortar)\n* Cracks\n* Defective pointing\n* Unfilled joints and perpends,\n* Defective seals around doors and windows\n* Holes in walls&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. where cables or pipes protrude\n* Defective render\n\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Primary Causes of Penetrating Damp\n|width=160\n|height=170\n|lines=4\n|align=center\n|File:Crack in Render.jpg|Cracks in render and masonry provide a pathway for damp to penetrate.\n|File:Defective-pointing.jpg|Defective pointing can allow rain to penetrate through masonry walls\n|File:Porous-bricks.jpg|Porous bricks combined with poorly-maintained rainwater goods leading to penetrating damp.\n|File:Hole_in_brick_masonry_wall.jpg|Hole in brick wall provides a path for rain penetration.\n\n\n}}\n\n====Exacerbators of Rain penetration====\n\nWhere a wall suffers from one or more of the primary causes of rain penetration listed above, the problem can be made worse by one of the following exacerbators of rain penetration:\n* Defective rainwater goods\n* Moss growth on roof tiles (causing blockage of rainwater goods)\n* Defective or missing window sills (causing high concentrations of rainwater to bear on section of wall below window)\n* Non-breathable coatings such as acrylic masonry paints&nbsp;\u2013 especially where applied to a poorly prepared masonry substrate\n* Location/aspect of wall&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. walls facing prevailing wind are more prone to rain penetration problems (see [[British Standard 8104|BS8104]])\n* Periods of extreme rainfall&nbsp;\u2013 walls that are normally thick enough to prevent rainfall from reaching the inner face can be overwhelmed during periods of heavy, persistent rainfall\n\nModifications to a building involving impermeable materials can also exacerbate the symptoms of rain penetration by trapping moisture. This can be a particular problem with regard to the installation of retrofit external wall insulation (EWI).\n\n==Rising damp==\n\n[[File:Rising-damp.jpg|thumb|left|Moderate rising damp on an internal wall.]]\n\n{{globalize||UK date=August 2012|date=August 2012}} \nRising damp is the common term for absorption of water in the lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures by [[capillary action]].

The effect can easily be seen by simply placing a piece of porous brick, stone, or mortar in a shallow tray of water and observing how the water is absorbed into the porous material and is transported above the water line.\n\nRising damp can be identified by a characteristic \"tide mark\" on the lower section of affected walls.

Attempts have been made to remedy this evil of porous bricks by the substitution of the hard blue bricks of Staffordshire; and then it may often be noticed that the wet has only struck, sailor-like, across the mortar-joints and chequered the inside walls like a tartan plaid.<ref>\"Damp Houses,\" British Medical Journal, May 25, 1872, p. 558</ref>}}\n\nIn July 1860 it was reported in ''[[The Engineer (UK magazine)|The Engineer]]'' that\n\n{{quote|At the Salford Hundred Quarter Sessions on Monday, it was officially stated by the Assize Courts Committee that the foundations which had been completed had been covered with asphalte by Messrs.

The way to prevent this is to insert above the ground level but below the floor level, either a course of vitrified stoneware made on purpose, or two layers of slates laid in cement, or some equally effective impervious material, the intervention of which between two courses of brickwork bars will prevent the further upward progress of the damp (see figure 1).<ref>''Helps to Health'' - Henry Burdett - , p. 123</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Helpstohealth-fig2-p127.jpg|thumb|right|Gaps between damp course for damp to rise in jerry-built house - Helps To Health, Sir Henry Burdett (1885), page 124]]\nHenry Burdett was deeply concerned with the quality building in Victorian England, and he cautioned would-be house buyers to check houses for the presence of a damp-proof course and to ensure that it is of an effective type.\n\n{{quote|As to the damp-proof course, however, it is possible by knowing what to look for, and where to look, to find out for a certainty whether there is or is not such a thing.

Moisture penetration has been an ongoing problem for residences as evaporation occurs at the edge of the damp area, resulting in \"tide marks\" due to salt deposition.<ref name=Hutton /> The \"tide mark\" is commonly distinguished as a feature of rising damp. However, even after the water intrusion has been treated, these salt accumulations still persist.<ref name=Hutton /> This suggests that rising damp is not always the cause for the water penetration.\n\nThe Building Research Establishment (BRE) in its review concludes that rising damp is a real problem.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/><ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /><ref name=\"A Review of Rising Damp in Masonry Buildings\"/>\n\n===How rising damp occurs===\nAccording to [[Jurin's law]] the maximum height of rise is inversely proportional to the capillary radius.<ref name=Alfano2006>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.04.017|first=G|last=Alfano|author2=C Chiancarella |author3=E Cirillo |author4=I Fato |author5=F Martellotta |title=Long-term performance of chemical damp-proof courses: Twelve years of laboratory testing|journal=Building and Environment|volume=41|issue=8|year=2006|pages=1060\u20131069}}</ref> Taking a typical pore radius for building materials of 1&nbsp;\u00b5m, Jurin's Law would give a maximum rise of about 15&nbsp;m, however, due to the effects of evaporation, in practice the rise would be considerably lower.<ref name=Alfano2006/>\n\nA physical model of rising damp was developed by Christopher Hall and William D Hoff in their paper \"Rising damp: capillary rise dynamics in walls\".<ref name=\"HallH07\" /> The analysis is based on experimentally well established properties of porous building materials and the physics of evaporation from building surfaces.<ref name=\"WTBSC2\">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Christopher|last2=Hoff|first2=William D|title=Water transport in brick, stone and concrete, 2nd edn|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London and New York|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415564670/}}</ref> Hall and Hoff show that the model can be used to predict the height to which damp will rise in a wall. The height of rise depends on the wall thickness, the [[sorptivity]] of the wall structure and the rate of evaporation. Further work has confirmed experimentally the importance of mortar properties in determining the height to which damp will rise in walls.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''BRE Digest'' 245 lists several factors that can influence the height of the rise including rate of evaporation from the wall, pore sizes of the masonry, salt content of the materials and the soil, groundwater and degree of saturation, and use of heating within the property.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> The effect of seasonal variations in evaporation rate on the height of moisture rise have been comprehensively described.<ref name=\"HallHHV11\">{{Cite journal | last=Hall | first=Christopher |last2 = Hamilton | first2=Andrea | last3=Hoff | first3=William D | last4=Viles | first4= Heather A | last5=Eklund | first5=Julie A | title=Moisture dynamics in walls: Response to microenvironment and climate change| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume=467 | issue=2125 | pages=194\u2013211 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0131| doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nA review of data and publications commissioned by the Property Care Association and carried out by the University of Portsmouth <ref name=\"A Review of Rising Damp in Masonry Buildings\"/> concluded that \"Rising damp is an age-old and ubiquitous problem.\" It also noted that \"Records on observation and descriptions on this phenomenon date back to early times. It was identified as a public health issue in the second half of the 19th Century.\" The review looked at data and studies on rising damp from a number of countries including the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, and Malaysia.\n\n===Diagnosis of rising damp===\n[[File:Rising-damp-wall.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A wall affected by rising damp|A wall affected by rising damp.]]\nThe first step in assessing damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, the next step is to look for the presence of a damp-proof course.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> If a damp-proof course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which damp proof courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nOne indicator that is often used to determine if the source of dampness is rising damp (rather than other forms of dampness) is to look for the presence of salts&nbsp;\u2013 in particular a tell tale \"salt band\" or \"tide mark\" at the peak of the damp's rise. This is not a reliable method as salts and dampness can enter the fabric of the wall in other ways&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. unwashed sea sand or gravel used in the construction of the wall.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nIf there is no damp-proof course and rising damp is suspected (tide mark, moisture confined to lower section of wall etc.&nbsp;...) then a number of diagnostic techniques can be used to determine the source of dampness. BRE Digest 245 states that the most satisfactory approach is to obtain samples of mortar in the affected wall using a drill and then analysing these samples to determine their moisture and salt content to assist in providing appropriate remedial building solutions.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> The fact that this technique is destructive to the wall finish often makes it unacceptable to homeowners. It is for this reason that electrical moisture meters are often used when surveying for rising damp. These instruments are unable to accurately measure the moisture content of masonry, as they were developed for use on timber, but the reading patterns that are achieved can provide useful indicators of the source of dampness.<ref name=\"Graham Coleman\"/>\n\n===Rising damp treatment===\nIn many cases, damp is caused by \"bridging\" of a damp-proof course that is otherwise working effectively. For example, a flower bed next to an affected wall might result in soil being piled up against the wall above the level of the DPC. In this example, moisture from the ground would be able to ingress through the wall from the soil. Such a damp problem could be rectified by simply lowering the flower bed to below DPC level.\n\nWhere a rising damp problem is caused by a lack of a damp-proof course (common in buildings over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed damp-proof course (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include:\n* Replacement physical damp proof course\n* Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)\n* Damp-proofing rods\n* Porous tubes / other evaporative\n* Land drainage\n* Electrical-osmotic systems\n\n====Replacement physical damp proof course====\n[[File:Brickwork 8.png|thumb|right|An example of a damp proof course of slate in a brick wall intended to prevent rising damp]]\nA physical damp proof course made from plastic can be installed into an existing building by cutting into short sections of the mortar course, and installing short sections of the damp proof course material. This method can provide an extremely effective barrier to rising damp, but is not widely used as it requires experienced contractors to carry out if structural movement is to be avoided and takes considerably longer to install than other types of rising damp treatment. The cost is also several times higher than for other types of rising damp treatment.\n\n====Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)====\nInjection of a liquid or cream into bricks or mortar is the most common method of treating rising damp.\n\nLiquid-injection products were introduced in the 1950s and were typically installed using funnels (gravity feed method) or pressured injection pumps. The effectiveness of liquid injection damp proofing products is dependent on the type of formulation and the skill of the installer. In practice injection times tend to be lower than those required to provide a damp proof course of optimum effectiveness. A paper published in Building and Environment in 1990 made the following calculations about injection times:\n\n{{quote|The results of these calculations for a range of bricks and one building stone suggest that when high pressure injection is used the time of injection is unlikely to be less than five minutes per hole and may exceed 20 minutes per hole even for relatively permeable and porous materials. The times calculated for low pressure infusion of repellents range from 8 hours to 44 hours.<ref>{{cite journal|last=I'Anson|first=S J|author2=Hoff|title=Chemical Injection Treatment for Rising Damp - II. Calculation of Injection Times|journal=Building and Environment|year=1990|volume=25|issue=1|pages=63\u201370|doi=10.1016/0360-1323(90)90042-p}}</ref>}}\n\n=====Damp-Proofing Creams=====\n[[File:Dpc-cream.jpg|thumb|Damp-proofing cream leaking from injection holes. This can make it difficult to ascertain whether sufficient cream has remained in the holes for treatment to be successful.]]\nSince the early 2000s, damp-proofing creams have taken over from liquid products due to improved ease of application. As with liquid products these are based on silane/siloxane active ingredients which line the pores of the mortar to repel damp.\n\nThe effectiveness of liquid and cream based rising damp treatments varies considerably between products due to variations in product formulations. Independent test certifications such as British Board of Agreement (BBA) certificates are available for some products, showing that they have met a minimum requirement for product performance - see [[#Damp_(structural)/Effectiveness_of_rising_damp_treatments]]\n\nAs with liquid injection systems, cream based treatments rely on the competence of the installer for treatment to be successful. Injection holes need to be fully cleared of drill dust and debris before the cream is injected, and it is often difficult to know if each injection hole has been completely filled with cream. Furthermore, damp-proofing cream can sometimes drip out of the injection holes after treatment, reducing the effectiveness of the damp-proofing treatment.\n\n====Damp-proofing rods====\n[[File:Damp-proofing rods.jpg|thumb|left|A packet of damp-proofing rods]] [[File:Damp rods in wall.jpg|thumb|right|Damp-proofing rods installed along a mortar course to treat rising damp by forming a damp-proof course (DPC)]]Damp-proofing rods use similar active ingredients to those found in liquid or cream-based rising damp treatments, but contained in a solid rod. They are generally considered to be easier to use than other types of rising damp treatment as the method of installation is simply to insert them into the correct sized holes drilled into a mortar bed. Damp-proofing rods are available with BBA approval.\n\nThe rods are placed into holes drilled in the mortar course and the active ingredients diffuse along the mortar line before curing to form a damp-proof course.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.btpreservation.co.uk/news-item/advanced-dryrod-damp-proofing-system-arrives-yorkshire/ | title=The advanced DryRod damp proofing system arrives in Yorkshire | accessdate=26 January 2015 | website=Brick-Tie Ltd.}}</ref>\n\nDamp-proofing rods are usually supplied in 180mm lengths suitable for inserting into a 9-inch thick wall. For treating half-brick thick (4.5 inch) walls, the rods are simply cut in half.\n\nA benefit of damp-proofing rods compared with damp-proofing creams and liquids is that it is possible to guarantee a consistent dose of active ingredient into each hole drilled in the mortar course&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. it is impossible to under-fill the holes.\n\n====Porous tubes====\nPorous tubes are installed along a mortar course. In theory these encourage evaporation and reduce the rise of the damp. Independent test certification are available for this type of product and tests carried out by the Building Research Establishment suggest that they are effective at controlling rising damp.\n[[File:Porous-tubes-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Porous tubes used to treat rising damp are visible on the outside of this Victorian house.]]\n{{quote|Porous ceramic tubes were an early technic to produce a method of combating rising damp; in the 1920s this technique was marketed by British Knapen. Tests were written up in the Building Research Station Annual Report of 1930: 'There have been tests to determine the effect on the rate of evaporation of moisture of inclined porous clay tubes set in specimens of brickwork and natural stone. Laboratory experiments and field tests have been carried out. Results indicate an increase of evaporation of moisture results from the use of these tubes.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n====Land drainage====\nIt has been suggested that improving drainage around walls affected by rising damp can help to reduce the height of rise by reducing the amount of water available to be absorbed into the capillaries of the wall. Typically a trench would be excavated around the affected wall into which a porous pipe would be laid. The trench would then be back-filled with a porous material such as a single-sized aggregate, forming a [[French drain]].\n\nSuch a system would obviously have the practical disadvantage of being suitable only for the treatment of outside walls and would be impractical where other buildings are close by or where a building has shallow footings. Although the theory of reducing rising damp by reducing the amount of moisture in the underlying ground would appear to be sound, there is little data to suggest that it is effective in practice. Indeed, G and I Massari stated in the ICCROM publication \"Damp Buildings Old and New\" that little effect was observed with \"open trenching\" and no effect was observed with \"covered trenching.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Electrical-osmotic systems====\nThese attempt to control rising damp through the phenomenon of [[Electro-osmosis|electro osmosis]]. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that these systems can be useful in moving salts in walls <ref name=\"Ottosen\">{{cite book|first=Lisbeth|last=Ottosen |author2=Anne J Pedersen |author3=Inge Rorig-Dalgaard|title=Salt related problems in brick masonry and electrokinetic removal of salts|publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal}}</ref> there is little in the way of independent data to demonstrate effectiveness in treating rising damp. The BRE publication \"Understanding Dampness\" makes the following observations about electro osmotic systems for the treatment of rising damp:\n\n{{quote|There are two types: active and passive; neither has been approved by a recognised laboratory. By far the greater number of systems are of the passive kind, where there is no external source of electricity. They have always been something of a controversial issue. On theoretical grounds, it remains a mystery as to how they can work; their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in the laboratory and field evidence is disappointing.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n===Effectiveness of rising damp treatments===\nBRE Digest 245 suggests that with the exception of replacement physical DPCs, only methods of treatment with third party accreditation (e.g. [[British Board of Agr\u00e9ment]] Certificate) should be considered for the treatment of rising damp. It then goes on to state that the only method of currently satisfying this requirement is DPC injection (liquid or cream&nbsp;\u2013 although damp-proofing rods have subsequently been made available with BBA approval) and that \"this is the only method which BRE considers suitable where insertion of a physical DPC is not possible.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nThe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveryors (RICS) publication \"Remedying Damp\" is more cautious about reliance on third party accreditation, casting doubt upon the validity of the test methods employed, arguing that trials are usually conducted using \"specially built masonry panels&nbsp;\u2013 which do not match up in many respects to walls found in real properties,\" and that \"if a DPC were proved {{em|to not}} work in a specially built masonry panel, this would be the more significant result.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\">{{cite book|first=Ralph|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=85|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref> The MOAT No 39 test<ref>{{cite book|title=The Assessment of Damp-proof Course Systems for Existing Buildings, MOAT No.39|publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment}}</ref> employed by the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment (BBA) in the UK is dismissed as \"quite a clever test idea but in the author's opinion not actually replicating a real wall.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\"/> The author, Ralph Burkinshaw, has developed his own test method which he has published under the title, ''\"The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application.\"''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jba/journal/v6/n1/full/jba201013a.html |title=The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application. |last1=Burkinshaw |first1=Ralph |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014 the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment confirmed that it would consult with manufacturers and holders of BBA certificates with a view to updating the MOAT No.39 test in light of the fact that it was not originally designed to test damp proofing creams and these have become the most popular type of rising damp treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBA Statement on Chemical Damp Proofing Creams |url=http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417023458/http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-17 }}</ref> This replaces a draft BBA guidance note that said Damp-proofing creams differ from fluid-based damp-proofing treatments in a number of ways:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/228945025/BBA-Statement-on-Damp-Proofing-Creams|title=BBA Statement on Damp-proofing Creams - October 2013}}</ref>\n\n# Creams are applied at much lower application rates than is typical for fluid injection and are designed to spread through masonry by diffusion without the assistance of pressure injection. Owing to the number of different mortar types and moisture contents, it is necessary to test these materials under a wider range of conditions. Research undertaken by the BBA has indicated that the performance of creams differs with varying test conditions, with not all products performing well under all test conditions.\n# The amount of active material delivered per linear metre varies considerably between cream formulations. Injection systems were typically injected at an application rate of approximately 100g of active ingredient per linear metre of 275&nbsp;mm (9 inch) thick wall. However, because the strength of cream formulations used in the UK can vary widely, the applied amount of delivered active material varied from 22g to 107g per linear metre depending on product strength. As there is limited historical data on the durability of chemical creams with low levels of active material, it is difficult to draw conclusions on their life expectancy in comparison to high strength creams which have similar active material levels to injected systems.\n\nIn his book, Dampness in Buildings, Alan Oliver refers to research carried out in Belgium regarding the effectiveness of different types of rising damp treatments:\n\n{{quote|In Belgium, at the Centre Scientifique et Technique de la Construction (CTSC, 1985), research was carried out on the effectiveness of the main retrofit DPCs found in Europe. It was generally found that physical DPCs performed best, followed by the various chemical DPCs, with electro osmosis and atmospheric syphons being the least effective.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Oliver|title=Dampness in Buildings - Second Edition|publisher=Blackwall Science|page=206|isbn=0-632-04085-8|date=1997-01-30}}</ref>}}\n\n===Replastering===\nReplastering will often be carried out as part of a rising damp treatment. Where plaster has become severely damaged by ground salts there is little argument about the need to replaster. However, there is considerable debate about:\n\n# The extent of replastering required\n# The use of hard sand:cement renders to replaster as part of a rising damp treatment\n\n[[File:Plaster-removed-rising-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaster removed from a wall as part of a rising damp treatment.

He also suggests that damp-proofers have an incentive to carry out more replastering than is strictly necessary as it allows them to finish the job without having to wait for walls to dry out, resulting in faster payment.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=81|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sand-cement-render.jpg|thumbnail|left|Application of a sand:cement render to a wall as part of a rising damp treatment]]\nAlthough the sand-cement renders typically installed as part of a rising damp treatment are very effective at holding back damp and ground salts, they have a number of disadvantages. These include an incompatibility with the soft bricks and mortars encountered in older buildings and a lack of insulation properties compared with more traditional plasters, resulting in an increased risk of condensation. Replastering is also one of the most expensive parts of a rising damp treatment.\n\nPorous renders to German WTA specification 2-2-91 can be used as an alternative to dense sand-cement renders. These have a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume. Salts crystallise in these pores rather than on the plaster surface, avoiding decorative spoiling. Such plasters offer a better solution than dense sand-cement renders when used on moderately salt-contaminated walls as their porous nature gives them insulation properties, resulting in a warmer surface temperature and making condensation problems less likely to occur. However, when used on heavily salt contaminated walls they may need to be replaced frequently as they lose effectiveness once all the pores have become filled with crystallised salt.<ref>WTA Merkblatt 2-6-99/D. Endg\u00fcltige Fassung Juli 2001 - {{ISBN|978-3-8167-6794-7}}</ref> The \"Renovation Mortars\" described in EN998-1:2003<ref>{{cite book|title=BS EN 998-1:2003 Specification for mortar for masonry - Part 1:Rendering and plastering mortar|publisher=British Standards Institution |page=7|isbn=0-580-42780-3}}</ref> are described as being designed for use on \"moist masonry walls containing soluble salts.\" The performance requirements for these types of mortars are based on German WTA specification 2-2-91 but without the requirement for a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume.\n\nMore recently, systems have become available that allow plasterboard or insulation board to be used to replaster walls affected by rising damp. After the existing plaster has been hacked off the wall, a salt and moisture retardant cream is applied to the wall. The plasterboard is then applied to the wall using a salt/moisture-proof adhesive. Such systems have the advantage that they can be decorated straight away, rather than having to wait several days or weeks (as would be the case with standard plasters). They also provide a warmer surface that is less prone to condensation than would be the case with a standard sand:cement render.\n\nReplastering may not be necessary where salt contamination is not severe. BS6576:2005<ref name=\"BS6576 2005\"/> states that \"Where the plaster appears to be in sound condition, the extent of plaster to be removed may be minimised by delaying any decision to replaster until the drying period is complete.\" Avoiding the need to replaster in this way can reduce disruption and mess and has the advantage of allowing the original lime or gypsum-based plaster to be maintained. However, the deficiencies of any remedial damp-proof course will be more apparent if the wall is not covered with a waterproof render. For this reason it is important to check the BBA certificate of the damp-proofing system to ensure that it is valid for use where replastering is not being carried out.\n\n====Redecoration====\nIt is best practice to delay replastering and redecoration for as long as possible following rising damp treatment, but this obviously creates inconvenience to the occupants of the affected building. BRE Digest 245 states that \"While the wall should be allowed to dry for as long as possible, replastering can follow, providing porous decorations are selected. These are usually matt emulsions and water-based paints, both of which will allow the wall to breathe. Application of gloss and vinyl paints or wallpapers should be delayed for at least one year.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nPlasterboard-based replastering systems have the advantage that immediate redecoration is possible irrespective of which decorative finish is chosen.\n\nDue to the fact that rising damp often co-exists with other forms of dampness such as condensation, the use of a mould resistant emulsion paint is often recommended.\n\n===In popular culture===\nIn [[Calling All Cars (The Sopranos)|''The Sopranos'' episode \"Calling All Cars\"]], [[Janice Soprano]] adopts the identity \"Rising Damp\" (along with the AOL username \"Vlad666\") to instant message [[Bobby Baccalieri]]'s children, Little Bobby and Sophia, who are grieving for their newly departed mother, and to direct them to communicate further via [[Ouija board]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Calling All Cars (4.11) |website= Sopranos Autopsy|url=https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* Institute of Specialist Surveyors and Engineers (ISSE - UK) [http://www.isse.org.uk The UK - based international institute specialising in structural damp, committed to creating & raising standards and representing the highest of standards within this industry]\n* Howell, Jeff.

Experience and qualified surveyors are the difference between a correct and incorrect diagnosis of damp. For example, it is sometimes found that [[Condensation#Condensation in building construction|condensation]] is misdiagnosed as another form of dampness resulting in the wrong form of treatment being specified. Chartered building surveyors are usually experienced in identifying dampness issues, however, their reports often suggest that dampness problems are investigated by a specialist damp and timber surveyor with a CSRT qualification.\n\n==Prevention and treatment==\nMost forms of dampness can be prevented by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include [[damp proofing]] in the form of a synthetic damp-proof course (DPC), about 15&nbsp;cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or \"engineering bricks\" with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem.\n\nThere are many approaches to the treatment of dampness in existing buildings. Key to the selection of an appropriate treatment is a correct diagnosis of the types of dampness affecting a building. Details of possible treatments for specific types of dampness are covered in the sections below.\n\nThe cause of the dampness must first be eliminated, by providing better drainage or fixing leaking pipes. Several methods of treating rising damp are possible, including the use of land-drains and the insertion of physical and chemical DPCs <ref name=\"Trotman_a\">{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Trotman|volume=BRE Digest 245|publisher=Building Research l Establishment|title=Rising damp in walls, diagnosis and treatment|isbn=978-1-84806-012-8}}</ref>. Then, any affected plaster or mortar must be removed, and the wall treated, before replacing the plaster and repainting.\n\n==Humidity==\nHumidity occurs in indoor environments due to building related causes. Porous walls, rising damp, and leaks in the building are determinants for structural dampness due to elevated humidity levels.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}} The construction of the building can also lead to humidity and unwanted moisture in the indoor environment.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\">{{cite web|last=Prowler|first=Don|title=Mold and Moisture Dynamics|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/moisturedynamics.php|publisher=WBDG: Whole Building Design Guide|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> Wet materials, such as lumber stored unprotected outdoors before construction, can lead to increased humidity indoors for up to the second year of occupancy in the building.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\"/> Most commonly in residences, elevated relative humidity is produced by poor drainage systems. This leads to dampness in substructures such as crawlspaces and basements. The dampness results in vaporization where water vapor is transmitted into the building's interiors. Water vapor may enter the building through supply air ducts in building slabs and circulated by warm forced air. Water vapor can also enter a building through leaky return air ducts in homes with crawlspaces.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|185\u2013187}}\n\nHuman occupancy adds a significant amount of humidity to the indoor environment. Personal activity as basic as breathing and perspiration add moisture to an indoor space.<ref name=\"Humidity Cooling\">{{cite web |title=Why Humidity Matters when Cooling |url=http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |publisher=Nature's Cooling Solutions |accessdate=13 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135306/http://naturescoolingsolutions.com/ecobreeze/?page_id=193 |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Cooking and showering raise humidity levels in the indoor environment, which directly affects the structural dampness of a home. Aspects of the home can also increase the humidity of a space. Items such as aquariums, indoor swimming pools, hot tubs, and even indoor plants add to the humidity of an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> All of these attributes can increase the humidity of a home beyond its recommended thirty to fifty percent.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\nHumidity levels in an indoor environment need to be accounted for based upon season and temperature. If humidity levels do not agree with the time of the year and the temperature during seasons, mold infestation and deterioration of the building will occur due to moisture. An acceptable humidity level in indoor spaces ranges from twenty to sixty per cent year round.<ref name=\"Air Quality\">{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality|url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/factsheets/indoorairqualityguide_fs.htm|publisher=Illinois Department of Public Health|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> However, levels less than twenty per cent in the winter and levels higher than sixty per cent in the summer are deemed unacceptable for indoor air quality.<ref name=\"Air Quality\" /> Structural dampness is likely to occur as well as an increase of health risks associated with moisture damage.\n\n===Prevention and treatment===\nThere are strategies to prevent water infiltration due to humidity into structures, as well as ways to treat human occupancy practices regarding humidity. Vapor retarders are materials that can be used to restrain uncontrolled airflow and water vapor into an indoor space.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Vapor retarders are used to decrease the rate and amount of water vapor diffusion through ceilings, walls, and floors caused by humidity.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> It is made of thin, flexible materials and its coatings can be installed by trowels or brushes.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Utilizing vapor retarders in a building prevents structural dampness from occurring or continuing if it already exists. A strategy for reducing humidity levels in an indoor environment is by altering occupant activity and indoor mechanics. Kitchens and bathrooms need to have their own vents.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Additionally, washing machines need to be vented outdoors.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Both of these are important in order to decrease indoor moisture due to humidity caused by the activities occurring in these indoor spaces. Moisture sources, such as hot tubs or indoor swimming pools, should be covered by airtight lids when not in use, thus humidity levels stay low in the indoor environment///-.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" />\n\n==Condensation==\nCondensation comes from water vapour within the building. Common sources may include cooking, bathing, dishwashers, etc. The moisture in the air condenses on cold surfaces, sometimes inside the walls called [[interstitial condensation]]. Buildings with poorly insulated walls are very prone to this problem. It often causes damage similar to damp in a building and often appears in similar places. This is because it occurs in the \"dead air\" pockets that accumulate in both horizontal and vertical corners (i.e. out of circulating air patterns).\n\n[[File:Mould Caused By Condensation.jpg|thumb|Mould growth caused by condensation in dead air pocket behind books]]\n\nMoisture condenses on the interiors of buildings due to specific interactions between the roof and wall. Leaks most commonly occur on flat-roofed buildings.<ref name=Godish />{{rp|328}} Certain building materials and mechanisms can be used to prevent condensation from occurring in these areas, therefore reducing structural dampness and potential mold infestation. In many cases, the insulation between the roof and wall is compressed, leading to a decrease in thermal resistance.<ref name=\"Moisture Dynamics\" /> Due to the lack of thermal resistance, condensation occurs, which leads to water damage in the indoor environment. In most cases where moisture is not addressed quickly enough, mold and mildew develop. Another issue is that wind washing up into the crevice where the roof and wall intersect reduces the efficiency of the insulation.<ref name=\"Roof Surface\">{{cite web|title=The Leaky Roof Surface |url=http://livingwithmyhome.com/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |work=Living With My Home |publisher=Pillar To Post, Inc. |accessdate=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916001154/http://www.livingwithmyhome.com:80/201-home-tips/pillar-to-post-leaky-roof.aspx |archivedate=16 September 2011 }}</ref> This results in condensation and risk for mold growth.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, condensation problems are particularly common between October and March&nbsp;\u2013 to the extent that this period is often referred to as the \"condensation season.\"<ref name=\"Peter MacDonald Condensation\">[http://www.dampdecay.co.uk/index.php/condensation-explained/94-condensation-1-the-condensation-season-october-until-march The Condensation Season - October until March], Peter MacDonald - Condensation Explained.</ref>\n\n===Identification of condensation===\nIf it is suspected that the problem is condensation, then a room should be sealed off with a [[dehumidifier]] left running for the recommended time and then further instrument tests made.

It can occur through walls, roofs, or through openings (e.g. window reveals).<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nWater will often penetrate the outer envelope of a building and appear inside. Common defects include:\n* Roof defects such as faulty [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]], cracked or missing slates or tiles.\n* Faults in the brickwork or masonry such as missing or cracked [[repointing|pointing]]. Porous bricks or stones.\n* Missing or defective mastic around windows and doors.\n* Blocked [[weep hole]]s.\n* Missing or defective trays in [[cavity wall]]s.\n\n===Walls===\nRain penetration is most often associated with single-skin walls, but can also occur through cavity walls - e.g. by tracking across wall ties.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nSingle-skin brick walls of standard thickness (9 inches) have been considered to provide inadequate resistance to rain penetration for many years, which is why [[Cavity wall|cavity wall construction]] is now standard in the UK. The 1944 Housing Manual published by the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Health stated that:<blockquote>''\"The resistance to penetration of rain should not be less than that of 11-in. brick cavity wall, properly designed and constructed with attention to details at the heads and joints of openings. An unrendered 9-in. wall is regarded as substandard.\"''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Housing manual : 1944|last=Gran Bretagna. Ministry of Health.|date=1944|publisher=His Majesty's stationery office|oclc=1110914533}}</ref></blockquote>Whilst renders are often applied in an attempt to resist rain penetration, they must be maintained in good condition in order to fulfil this function. Even relatively small cracks in renders can allow rain penetration to pass into the underlying masonry. In his 1954 book, \"The Restoration of Old Houses\" Hugh Braun highlighted problems inherent in certain types of render that were widely used in the late eighteenth century and throughout the Victorian era:\n\n''\"By the end of the eighteenth century a number of patent water-repellent cements were appearing on the market, the most popular of which, roman cement, continued in universal use throughout the Victorian era; many old buildings were rendered with this substance. Its adhesion was poor and it will often be found that it has become separated from the walling over considerable areas and can be stripped away in large sheets.\"'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Restoration of Old Houses|last=Braun|first=Hugh|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n====Primary Causes====\n\n* Porous masonry (i.e. under-fired bricks, porous stone, or porous mortar)\n* Cracks\n* Defective pointing\n* Unfilled joints and perpends,\n* Defective seals around doors and windows\n* Holes in walls&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. where cables or pipes protrude\n* Defective render\n\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Primary Causes of Penetrating Damp\n|width=160\n|height=170\n|lines=4\n|align=center\n|File:Crack in Render.jpg|Cracks in render and masonry provide a pathway for damp to penetrate.\n|File:Defective-pointing.jpg|Defective pointing can allow rain to penetrate through masonry walls\n|File:Porous-bricks.jpg|Porous bricks combined with poorly-maintained rainwater goods leading to penetrating damp.\n|File:Hole_in_brick_masonry_wall.jpg|Hole in brick wall provides a path for rain penetration.\n\n\n}}\n\n====Exacerbators of Rain penetration====\n\nWhere a wall suffers from one or more of the primary causes of rain penetration listed above, the problem can be made worse by one of the following exacerbators of rain penetration:\n* Defective rainwater goods\n* Moss growth on roof tiles (causing blockage of rainwater goods)\n* Defective or missing window sills (causing high concentrations of rainwater to bear on section of wall below window)\n* Non-breathable coatings such as acrylic masonry paints&nbsp;\u2013 especially where applied to a poorly prepared masonry substrate\n* Location/aspect of wall&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. walls facing prevailing wind are more prone to rain penetration problems (see [[British Standard 8104|BS8104]])\n* Periods of extreme rainfall&nbsp;\u2013 walls that are normally thick enough to prevent rainfall from reaching the inner face can be overwhelmed during periods of heavy, persistent rainfall\n\nModifications to a building involving impermeable materials can also exacerbate the symptoms of rain penetration by trapping moisture. This can be a particular problem with regard to the installation of retrofit external wall insulation (EWI).\n\n==Rising damp==\n\n[[File:Rising-damp.jpg|thumb|left|Moderate rising damp on an internal wall.]]\n\n{{globalize||UK date=August 2012|date=August 2012}} \nRising damp is the common term for absorption of water in the lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures by [[capillary action]].

The effect can easily be seen by simply placing a piece of porous brick, stone, or mortar in a shallow tray of water and observing how the water is absorbed into the porous material and is transported above the water line.\n\nRising damp can be identified by a characteristic \"tide mark\" on the lower section of affected walls. This tide mark is caused by soluble salts (particularly nitrates and chlorides) contained in the groundwater. Due to the effects of evaporation these salts accumulate at the \"peak\" of the rising damp.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Oliver|title=Dampness in Buildings|publisher=BSP Professional Books|isbn=0-632-01932-8}}</ref> Due to rising damp often being caused by moisture from wet ground, it is not common to find rising damp on floors above ground level.<ref>{{cite web|last=Broady|first=Thomas|title=Damp Problems: What Can You Do?|url=https://chrisruddsolicitors.co.uk/2019/03/06/damp-problems-rented-property|work=www.chrisruddsolicitors.co.uk|publisher=Chris Rudd Solicitors|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Rising damp \u2013 Historical context===\nThe issue of rising damp has been a concern since ancient times.<ref name=\"Roman Damp Proof Course\"/><ref name=\"The Roman Villa p. 36\"/> The Roman Architect [[Vitruvius]] referred to the problem of dampness rising up walls and advised on how to construct buildings to avoid the problem.<ref>A History of Architectural Conservation - Jukka Jokilehto - {{ISBN|0-7506-3793-5}} - p. 3</ref><ref>''Roman Baths in Britain'' - Tony Rook - {{ISBN|0-7478-0157-6}} - p. 14</ref>\n\n[[File:British Medical Journal 25th May 1872 - Damp Houses.jpg|thumb|left|Damp Houses - British Medical Journal - May 25th 1872]]\n[[File:Helps-to-health-fig-12.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Dilapidated Victorian House in Willesden|{{quote|Next we look, but in vain, for any signs of a damp proof course, or for any gratings to show that ventilation to the ground floor joists has not been forgotten.

However, even after the water intrusion has been treated, these salt accumulations still persist.<ref name=Hutton /> This suggests that rising damp is not always the cause for the water penetration.\n\nThe Building Research Establishment (BRE) in its review concludes that rising damp is a real problem.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/><ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /><ref name=\"A Review of Rising Damp in Masonry Buildings\"/>\n\n===How rising damp occurs===\nAccording to [[Jurin's law]] the maximum height of rise is inversely proportional to the capillary radius.<ref name=Alfano2006>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.04.017|first=G|last=Alfano|author2=C Chiancarella |author3=E Cirillo |author4=I Fato |author5=F Martellotta |title=Long-term performance of chemical damp-proof courses: Twelve years of laboratory testing|journal=Building and Environment|volume=41|issue=8|year=2006|pages=1060\u20131069}}</ref> Taking a typical pore radius for building materials of 1&nbsp;\u00b5m, Jurin's Law would give a maximum rise of about 15&nbsp;m, however, due to the effects of evaporation, in practice the rise would be considerably lower.<ref name=Alfano2006/>\n\nA physical model of rising damp was developed by Christopher Hall and William D Hoff in their paper \"Rising damp: capillary rise dynamics in walls\".<ref name=\"HallH07\" /> The analysis is based on experimentally well established properties of porous building materials and the physics of evaporation from building surfaces.<ref name=\"WTBSC2\">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Christopher|last2=Hoff|first2=William D|title=Water transport in brick, stone and concrete, 2nd edn|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London and New York|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415564670/}}</ref> Hall and Hoff show that the model can be used to predict the height to which damp will rise in a wall. The height of rise depends on the wall thickness, the [[sorptivity]] of the wall structure and the rate of evaporation. Further work has confirmed experimentally the importance of mortar properties in determining the height to which damp will rise in walls.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''BRE Digest'' 245 lists several factors that can influence the height of the rise including rate of evaporation from the wall, pore sizes of the masonry, salt content of the materials and the soil, groundwater and degree of saturation, and use of heating within the property.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> The effect of seasonal variations in evaporation rate on the height of moisture rise have been comprehensively described.<ref name=\"HallHHV11\">{{Cite journal | last=Hall | first=Christopher |last2 = Hamilton | first2=Andrea | last3=Hoff | first3=William D | last4=Viles | first4= Heather A | last5=Eklund | first5=Julie A | title=Moisture dynamics in walls: Response to microenvironment and climate change| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume=467 | issue=2125 | pages=194\u2013211 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0131| doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nA review of data and publications commissioned by the Property Care Association and carried out by the University of Portsmouth <ref name=\"A Review of Rising Damp in Masonry Buildings\"/> concluded that \"Rising damp is an age-old and ubiquitous problem.\" It also noted that \"Records on observation and descriptions on this phenomenon date back to early times. It was identified as a public health issue in the second half of the 19th Century.\" The review looked at data and studies on rising damp from a number of countries including the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, and Malaysia.\n\n===Diagnosis of rising damp===\n[[File:Rising-damp-wall.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A wall affected by rising damp|A wall affected by rising damp.]]\nThe first step in assessing damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, the next step is to look for the presence of a damp-proof course.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> If a damp-proof course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which damp proof courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nOne indicator that is often used to determine if the source of dampness is rising damp (rather than other forms of dampness) is to look for the presence of salts&nbsp;\u2013 in particular a tell tale \"salt band\" or \"tide mark\" at the peak of the damp's rise. This is not a reliable method as salts and dampness can enter the fabric of the wall in other ways&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. unwashed sea sand or gravel used in the construction of the wall.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>\n\nIf there is no damp-proof course and rising damp is suspected (tide mark, moisture confined to lower section of wall etc.&nbsp;...) then a number of diagnostic techniques can be used to determine the source of dampness. BRE Digest 245 states that the most satisfactory approach is to obtain samples of mortar in the affected wall using a drill and then analysing these samples to determine their moisture and salt content to assist in providing appropriate remedial building solutions.<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" /> The fact that this technique is destructive to the wall finish often makes it unacceptable to homeowners. It is for this reason that electrical moisture meters are often used when surveying for rising damp. These instruments are unable to accurately measure the moisture content of masonry, as they were developed for use on timber, but the reading patterns that are achieved can provide useful indicators of the source of dampness.<ref name=\"Graham Coleman\"/>\n\n===Rising damp treatment===\nIn many cases, damp is caused by \"bridging\" of a damp-proof course that is otherwise working effectively. For example, a flower bed next to an affected wall might result in soil being piled up against the wall above the level of the DPC. In this example, moisture from the ground would be able to ingress through the wall from the soil. Such a damp problem could be rectified by simply lowering the flower bed to below DPC level.\n\nWhere a rising damp problem is caused by a lack of a damp-proof course (common in buildings over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed damp-proof course (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include:\n* Replacement physical damp proof course\n* Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)\n* Damp-proofing rods\n* Porous tubes / other evaporative\n* Land drainage\n* Electrical-osmotic systems\n\n====Replacement physical damp proof course====\n[[File:Brickwork 8.png|thumb|right|An example of a damp proof course of slate in a brick wall intended to prevent rising damp]]\nA physical damp proof course made from plastic can be installed into an existing building by cutting into short sections of the mortar course, and installing short sections of the damp proof course material. This method can provide an extremely effective barrier to rising damp, but is not widely used as it requires experienced contractors to carry out if structural movement is to be avoided and takes considerably longer to install than other types of rising damp treatment. The cost is also several times higher than for other types of rising damp treatment.\n\n====Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection)====\nInjection of a liquid or cream into bricks or mortar is the most common method of treating rising damp.\n\nLiquid-injection products were introduced in the 1950s and were typically installed using funnels (gravity feed method) or pressured injection pumps. The effectiveness of liquid injection damp proofing products is dependent on the type of formulation and the skill of the installer. In practice injection times tend to be lower than those required to provide a damp proof course of optimum effectiveness. A paper published in Building and Environment in 1990 made the following calculations about injection times:\n\n{{quote|The results of these calculations for a range of bricks and one building stone suggest that when high pressure injection is used the time of injection is unlikely to be less than five minutes per hole and may exceed 20 minutes per hole even for relatively permeable and porous materials. The times calculated for low pressure infusion of repellents range from 8 hours to 44 hours.<ref>{{cite journal|last=I'Anson|first=S J|author2=Hoff|title=Chemical Injection Treatment for Rising Damp - II. Calculation of Injection Times|journal=Building and Environment|year=1990|volume=25|issue=1|pages=63\u201370|doi=10.1016/0360-1323(90)90042-p}}</ref>}}\n\n=====Damp-Proofing Creams=====\n[[File:Dpc-cream.jpg|thumb|Damp-proofing cream leaking from injection holes. This can make it difficult to ascertain whether sufficient cream has remained in the holes for treatment to be successful.]]\nSince the early 2000s, damp-proofing creams have taken over from liquid products due to improved ease of application. As with liquid products these are based on silane/siloxane active ingredients which line the pores of the mortar to repel damp.\n\nThe effectiveness of liquid and cream based rising damp treatments varies considerably between products due to variations in product formulations. Independent test certifications such as British Board of Agreement (BBA) certificates are available for some products, showing that they have met a minimum requirement for product performance - see [[#Damp_(structural)/Effectiveness_of_rising_damp_treatments]]\n\nAs with liquid injection systems, cream based treatments rely on the competence of the installer for treatment to be successful. Injection holes need to be fully cleared of drill dust and debris before the cream is injected, and it is often difficult to know if each injection hole has been completely filled with cream. Furthermore, damp-proofing cream can sometimes drip out of the injection holes after treatment, reducing the effectiveness of the damp-proofing treatment.\n\n====Damp-proofing rods====\n[[File:Damp-proofing rods.jpg|thumb|left|A packet of damp-proofing rods]] [[File:Damp rods in wall.jpg|thumb|right|Damp-proofing rods installed along a mortar course to treat rising damp by forming a damp-proof course (DPC)]]Damp-proofing rods use similar active ingredients to those found in liquid or cream-based rising damp treatments, but contained in a solid rod. They are generally considered to be easier to use than other types of rising damp treatment as the method of installation is simply to insert them into the correct sized holes drilled into a mortar bed. Damp-proofing rods are available with BBA approval.\n\nThe rods are placed into holes drilled in the mortar course and the active ingredients diffuse along the mortar line before curing to form a damp-proof course.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.btpreservation.co.uk/news-item/advanced-dryrod-damp-proofing-system-arrives-yorkshire/ | title=The advanced DryRod damp proofing system arrives in Yorkshire | accessdate=26 January 2015 | website=Brick-Tie Ltd.}}</ref>\n\nDamp-proofing rods are usually supplied in 180mm lengths suitable for inserting into a 9-inch thick wall. For treating half-brick thick (4.5 inch) walls, the rods are simply cut in half.\n\nA benefit of damp-proofing rods compared with damp-proofing creams and liquids is that it is possible to guarantee a consistent dose of active ingredient into each hole drilled in the mortar course&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. it is impossible to under-fill the holes.\n\n====Porous tubes====\nPorous tubes are installed along a mortar course. In theory these encourage evaporation and reduce the rise of the damp. Independent test certification are available for this type of product and tests carried out by the Building Research Establishment suggest that they are effective at controlling rising damp.\n[[File:Porous-tubes-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Porous tubes used to treat rising damp are visible on the outside of this Victorian house.]]\n{{quote|Porous ceramic tubes were an early technic to produce a method of combating rising damp; in the 1920s this technique was marketed by British Knapen. Tests were written up in the Building Research Station Annual Report of 1930: 'There have been tests to determine the effect on the rate of evaporation of moisture of inclined porous clay tubes set in specimens of brickwork and natural stone. Laboratory experiments and field tests have been carried out. Results indicate an increase of evaporation of moisture results from the use of these tubes.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n====Land drainage====\nIt has been suggested that improving drainage around walls affected by rising damp can help to reduce the height of rise by reducing the amount of water available to be absorbed into the capillaries of the wall. Typically a trench would be excavated around the affected wall into which a porous pipe would be laid. The trench would then be back-filled with a porous material such as a single-sized aggregate, forming a [[French drain]].\n\nSuch a system would obviously have the practical disadvantage of being suitable only for the treatment of outside walls and would be impractical where other buildings are close by or where a building has shallow footings. Although the theory of reducing rising damp by reducing the amount of moisture in the underlying ground would appear to be sound, there is little data to suggest that it is effective in practice. Indeed, G and I Massari stated in the ICCROM publication \"Damp Buildings Old and New\" that little effect was observed with \"open trenching\" and no effect was observed with \"covered trenching.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Electrical-osmotic systems====\nThese attempt to control rising damp through the phenomenon of [[Electro-osmosis|electro osmosis]]. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that these systems can be useful in moving salts in walls <ref name=\"Ottosen\">{{cite book|first=Lisbeth|last=Ottosen |author2=Anne J Pedersen |author3=Inge Rorig-Dalgaard|title=Salt related problems in brick masonry and electrokinetic removal of salts|publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal}}</ref> there is little in the way of independent data to demonstrate effectiveness in treating rising damp. The BRE publication \"Understanding Dampness\" makes the following observations about electro osmotic systems for the treatment of rising damp:\n\n{{quote|There are two types: active and passive; neither has been approved by a recognised laboratory. By far the greater number of systems are of the passive kind, where there is no external source of electricity. They have always been something of a controversial issue. On theoretical grounds, it remains a mystery as to how they can work; their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in the laboratory and field evidence is disappointing.<ref name=\"Trotman\"/>}}\n\n===Effectiveness of rising damp treatments===\nBRE Digest 245 suggests that with the exception of replacement physical DPCs, only methods of treatment with third party accreditation (e.g. [[British Board of Agr\u00e9ment]] Certificate) should be considered for the treatment of rising damp. It then goes on to state that the only method of currently satisfying this requirement is DPC injection (liquid or cream&nbsp;\u2013 although damp-proofing rods have subsequently been made available with BBA approval) and that \"this is the only method which BRE considers suitable where insertion of a physical DPC is not possible.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nThe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveryors (RICS) publication \"Remedying Damp\" is more cautious about reliance on third party accreditation, casting doubt upon the validity of the test methods employed, arguing that trials are usually conducted using \"specially built masonry panels&nbsp;\u2013 which do not match up in many respects to walls found in real properties,\" and that \"if a DPC were proved {{em|to not}} work in a specially built masonry panel, this would be the more significant result.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\">{{cite book|first=Ralph|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=85|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref> The MOAT No 39 test<ref>{{cite book|title=The Assessment of Damp-proof Course Systems for Existing Buildings, MOAT No.39|publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment}}</ref> employed by the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment (BBA) in the UK is dismissed as \"quite a clever test idea but in the author's opinion not actually replicating a real wall.\"<ref name=\"Burkinshaw 85\"/> The author, Ralph Burkinshaw, has developed his own test method which he has published under the title, ''\"The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application.\"''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jba/journal/v6/n1/full/jba201013a.html |title=The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application. |last1=Burkinshaw |first1=Ralph |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=Journal of Building Appraisal |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014 the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment confirmed that it would consult with manufacturers and holders of BBA certificates with a view to updating the MOAT No.39 test in light of the fact that it was not originally designed to test damp proofing creams and these have become the most popular type of rising damp treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBA Statement on Chemical Damp Proofing Creams |url=http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |publisher=British Board of Agr\u00e9ment |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417023458/http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/media/153122/bba_statement_on_dpc_creams_april_2014.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-17 }}</ref> This replaces a draft BBA guidance note that said Damp-proofing creams differ from fluid-based damp-proofing treatments in a number of ways:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/228945025/BBA-Statement-on-Damp-Proofing-Creams|title=BBA Statement on Damp-proofing Creams - October 2013}}</ref>\n\n# Creams are applied at much lower application rates than is typical for fluid injection and are designed to spread through masonry by diffusion without the assistance of pressure injection. Owing to the number of different mortar types and moisture contents, it is necessary to test these materials under a wider range of conditions. Research undertaken by the BBA has indicated that the performance of creams differs with varying test conditions, with not all products performing well under all test conditions.\n# The amount of active material delivered per linear metre varies considerably between cream formulations. Injection systems were typically injected at an application rate of approximately 100g of active ingredient per linear metre of 275&nbsp;mm (9 inch) thick wall. However, because the strength of cream formulations used in the UK can vary widely, the applied amount of delivered active material varied from 22g to 107g per linear metre depending on product strength. As there is limited historical data on the durability of chemical creams with low levels of active material, it is difficult to draw conclusions on their life expectancy in comparison to high strength creams which have similar active material levels to injected systems.\n\nIn his book, Dampness in Buildings, Alan Oliver refers to research carried out in Belgium regarding the effectiveness of different types of rising damp treatments:\n\n{{quote|In Belgium, at the Centre Scientifique et Technique de la Construction (CTSC, 1985), research was carried out on the effectiveness of the main retrofit DPCs found in Europe. It was generally found that physical DPCs performed best, followed by the various chemical DPCs, with electro osmosis and atmospheric syphons being the least effective.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Oliver|title=Dampness in Buildings - Second Edition|publisher=Blackwall Science|page=206|isbn=0-632-04085-8|date=1997-01-30}}</ref>}}\n\n===Replastering===\nReplastering will often be carried out as part of a rising damp treatment. Where plaster has become severely damaged by ground salts there is little argument about the need to replaster. However, there is considerable debate about:\n\n# The extent of replastering required\n# The use of hard sand:cement renders to replaster as part of a rising damp treatment\n\n[[File:Plaster-removed-rising-damp.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plaster removed from a wall as part of a rising damp treatment. The wall was replastered using a sand-cement render.]]\n\nBS6576:2005<ref name=\"BS6576 2005\">{{cite book|title=BS6576:2005, Code of practice for diagnosis of rising damp in walls of buildings and installation of chemical damp proof courses|publisher=BSI|page=9|isbn=0-580-46867-4}}</ref> states that \"the function of the new plaster is to prevent hygroscopic salts that might be present in the wall from migrating through to its surface, while still allowing the wall to dry.\" However, writing in the RICS publication \"Remedying Damp\", Ralph Burkinshaw claims that, \"the plaster is really there for {{em|two}} main reasons.\" He accepts the need for replastering when significant amounts of ground salts have built up in the existing plaster, but he then goes on to say that replastering is often carried out to make up for an unreliable chemical DPC. He also suggests that damp-proofers have an incentive to carry out more replastering than is strictly necessary as it allows them to finish the job without having to wait for walls to dry out, resulting in faster payment.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralf|last=Burkinshaw|title=Remedying Damp|publisher=RICS Books|page=81|isbn=978-1-84219-305-1|date=December 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sand-cement-render.jpg|thumbnail|left|Application of a sand:cement render to a wall as part of a rising damp treatment]]\nAlthough the sand-cement renders typically installed as part of a rising damp treatment are very effective at holding back damp and ground salts, they have a number of disadvantages. These include an incompatibility with the soft bricks and mortars encountered in older buildings and a lack of insulation properties compared with more traditional plasters, resulting in an increased risk of condensation. Replastering is also one of the most expensive parts of a rising damp treatment.\n\nPorous renders to German WTA specification 2-2-91 can be used as an alternative to dense sand-cement renders. These have a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume. Salts crystallise in these pores rather than on the plaster surface, avoiding decorative spoiling. Such plasters offer a better solution than dense sand-cement renders when used on moderately salt-contaminated walls as their porous nature gives them insulation properties, resulting in a warmer surface temperature and making condensation problems less likely to occur. However, when used on heavily salt contaminated walls they may need to be replaced frequently as they lose effectiveness once all the pores have become filled with crystallised salt.<ref>WTA Merkblatt 2-6-99/D. Endg\u00fcltige Fassung Juli 2001 - {{ISBN|978-3-8167-6794-7}}</ref> The \"Renovation Mortars\" described in EN998-1:2003<ref>{{cite book|title=BS EN 998-1:2003 Specification for mortar for masonry - Part 1:Rendering and plastering mortar|publisher=British Standards Institution |page=7|isbn=0-580-42780-3}}</ref> are described as being designed for use on \"moist masonry walls containing soluble salts.\" The performance requirements for these types of mortars are based on German WTA specification 2-2-91 but without the requirement for a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume.\n\nMore recently, systems have become available that allow plasterboard or insulation board to be used to replaster walls affected by rising damp. After the existing plaster has been hacked off the wall, a salt and moisture retardant cream is applied to the wall. The plasterboard is then applied to the wall using a salt/moisture-proof adhesive. Such systems have the advantage that they can be decorated straight away, rather than having to wait several days or weeks (as would be the case with standard plasters). They also provide a warmer surface that is less prone to condensation than would be the case with a standard sand:cement render.\n\nReplastering may not be necessary where salt contamination is not severe. BS6576:2005<ref name=\"BS6576 2005\"/> states that \"Where the plaster appears to be in sound condition, the extent of plaster to be removed may be minimised by delaying any decision to replaster until the drying period is complete.\" Avoiding the need to replaster in this way can reduce disruption and mess and has the advantage of allowing the original lime or gypsum-based plaster to be maintained. However, the deficiencies of any remedial damp-proof course will be more apparent if the wall is not covered with a waterproof render. For this reason it is important to check the BBA certificate of the damp-proofing system to ensure that it is valid for use where replastering is not being carried out.\n\n====Redecoration====\nIt is best practice to delay replastering and redecoration for as long as possible following rising damp treatment, but this obviously creates inconvenience to the occupants of the affected building. BRE Digest 245 states that \"While the wall should be allowed to dry for as long as possible, replastering can follow, providing porous decorations are selected. These are usually matt emulsions and water-based paints, both of which will allow the wall to breathe. Application of gloss and vinyl paints or wallpapers should be delayed for at least one year.\"<ref name=\"Trotman_a\" />\n\nPlasterboard-based replastering systems have the advantage that immediate redecoration is possible irrespective of which decorative finish is chosen.\n\nDue to the fact that rising damp often co-exists with other forms of dampness such as condensation, the use of a mould resistant emulsion paint is often recommended.\n\n===In popular culture===\nIn [[Calling All Cars (The Sopranos)|''The Sopranos'' episode \"Calling All Cars\"]], [[Janice Soprano]] adopts the identity \"Rising Damp\" (along with the AOL username \"Vlad666\") to instant message [[Bobby Baccalieri]]'s children, Little Bobby and Sophia, who are grieving for their newly departed mother, and to direct them to communicate further via [[Ouija board]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Calling All Cars (4.11) |website= Sopranos Autopsy|url=https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* Institute of Specialist Surveyors and Engineers (ISSE - UK) [http://www.isse.org.uk The UK - based international institute specialising in structural damp, committed to creating & raising standards and representing the highest of standards within this industry]\n* Howell, Jeff.
