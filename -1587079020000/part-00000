Chives are a [[bulb]]-forming [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant]], growing to {{convert|30|\u2013|50|cm|abbr=on}} tall. The bulbs are slender, conical, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} broad, and grow in dense clusters from the [[root]]s. The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} across, with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The grass-like<ref name=\"Linford\"/> leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from [[Allium tuberosum|garlic chives]] (''Allium tuberosum''). The [[flower]]s are pale purple, and star-shaped with six [[petal]]s, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small, three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, retrieved on June 13, 2006, based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)</ref><ref>[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gr\u00e4sl\u00f6k], from Den virtuella floran, retrieved on June 13, 2006, The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.</ref>\n\nChives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the [[New world|New]] and the [[Old World]]s.

The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} across, with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The grass-like<ref name=\"Linford\"/> leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from [[Allium tuberosum|garlic chives]] (''Allium tuberosum''). The [[flower]]s are pale purple, and star-shaped with six [[petal]]s, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small, three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, retrieved on June 13, 2006, based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)</ref><ref>[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gr\u00e4sl\u00f6k], from Den virtuella floran, retrieved on June 13, 2006, The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.</ref>\n\nChives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the [[New world|New]] and the [[Old World]]s.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \"noble savage\" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).

Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name \"symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership\", and that the \"Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people\".<ref name=\"bar\">{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (Newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)|  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: \"Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|website=ESPN|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOthers claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the former athletic symbol for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.<ref name=\"Spindel\"/> In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: \"His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \"noble savage\" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).

Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name \"symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership\", and that the \"Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people\".<ref name=\"bar\">{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (Newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)|  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: \"Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces.

[[Chief Illiniwek]], the former athletic symbol for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.<ref name=\"Spindel\"/> In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: \"His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty.

The city is within the boundaries of the [[Allegany Indian Reservation]] of the [[Seneca Nation of Indians]], and 26% of the high school students are Native American. In 2001, when the commissioner of the New York State Education Department sent a letter to all New York school boards calling for the elimination of Native American mascots, the Seneca Nation Tribal Council joined with other members of the community in seeking to retain the Warrior imagery, although with individual differences of opinion. Salamanca may be unique in having a mixed but not fully integrated community, with the Warrior identity combining elements negotiated between the Seneca and non-Seneca population.  For example, the school logo now depicts a Seneca man, replacing the stereotypical [[Plains Indian]] warrior image that was used prior to 1978.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Taylor| first=Michael| title=THE SALAMANCA WARRIORS: A Case Study of an 'Exception to the Rule.'| journal=Journal of Anthropological Research| volume=67| issue=2| year=2011| pages=245\u2013265| jstor=41303285| doi=10.3998/jar.0521004.0067.205}}</ref>\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n[[File:Ticket Washington vs Stanford 1930 side1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1930 football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot]]\nSome college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots.

After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became [[Otto the Orange]] for the school color. [[Miami University]] began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/index.html|title=Mascot Story|accessdate=February 5, 2013|website=Miami University}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the team name of [[Eastern Michigan University]] changed from the [[Hurons]] to the Eagles in 1991, the change remained controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside a flap of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, the return of the Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/eastern-michigan-university-hurons-logo/28797179/| title=Native Americans rally against Hurons logo at EMU| first=Kim| last=Kozlowski| newspaper=The Detroit News| date=June 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/huron-logo-emu/28828217/| title=Community wants logo off EMU band uniforms| first=David| last=Jesse| newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Marquette University]] changed their team name from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994.

Since their introduction, LEGO pneumatics have featured in a variety of LEGO Technic and LEGO Educational (DACTA) products.\n\n=== Generation 1 ===\n\n[[Image:Lego Technic 8851 Excavator (5617240802).jpg|thumb|First generation Pneumatics excavator from 1984]]\nThe first generation of LEGO Pneumatics ran from 1984 through 1988. This generation is characterised by single port pneumatic cylinders and the more complex plumbing including a three port distribution block with a pressure and vacuum outlet port.  These pressure and vacuum lines ran to a switch to provide pressure for extension or vacuum for retraction of the pneumatic cylinders.  These are often falsely compared to single acting hydraulic cylinders that require gravity to retract.  The difference is that these units retract on the application of vacuum. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Generation 2 ===\n\n[[Image:Lego Pneumatic Excavator (8837) (3965216727).jpg|thumb|Second generation Pneumatics excavator from 1992]]\nIn 1989, the LEGO pneumatic line was revamped, and a new cylinder and pump piece were introduced. The old cylinders and pumps were discontinued. The chief difference is that the new cylinder had two input valves now, which allowed both pushing and pulling without needing complex circuits involving the distribution block piece.  The Generation 2 cylinders also had metal rods so that they more closely resembled real hydraulic cylinders.\n\nOver the years, several new pieces were introduced in this line as well. The new pump was spring based, and could only be operated by hand, which limited pneumatic power to how fast it could be manually pumped. This obviously limited the power of pneumatic circuits. So in 1992, LEGO introduced two new pieces; a small pump and a small cylinder. The small pump did not have a spring on it, and it was designed to be operated by a motor, which would allow for continuously-running pneumatic creations. As of 2011, the small pump has only appeared in one set \u2014 [http://peeron.com/inv/sets/8868-1 8868 Air Tech Claw Rig] (1992) (found on [[Peeron]]) \u2014 and a few parts sets (no longer available). A new version of the small pump was released in Lego set 8110 [[Unimog]] U400 (2011). At 2L, this pump's stroke is 1/3 longer than the old one's 1.5L, 'L' being the LEGO unit of a stud. This made it much easier to use in studless construction.\n\nIn 1997, LEGO introduced the Air Tank, which acts like a battery, storing compressed air so that even more powerful pneumatic circuits can be created. This piece is very popular with the enthusiast community, but many feel that it was underutilised by LEGO, as it only appeared in 3 model sets and a parts pack. This tank is now only available at the LEGO Education Store, along with a new [[manometer]] part.\n\n[[Image:Lego Technic 8455.JPG|thumb|Loader with studless Pneumatics from 2003]]\nIn 2003, LEGO discontinued the old cylinder and switch parts, and made new \"studless\" versions to fit in with their transition towards removing studs from Technic sets.\n\n===Linear Actuator===\n\nBeginning 2008, LEGO has released several sets with [[Linear actuator#Mechanical actuators|mechanical linear actuators]], which are used for the same purpose as the pneumatic cylinders, but the fact that they can easily be extended to intermediate points means that they approximate hydraulic cylinders more closely. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Lego pneumatics components==\n\n<imagemap>\nFile:Collection_of_LEGO_pneumatic_components.jpg|540px|thumb|some Lego pneumatics components\n\nrect 109 120 336 978 [[#Pneumatic pump|manual pump]]\nrect 430 145 630 959 [[#Pneumatic cylinder|cylinder (1st generation)]]\nrect 692 401 839 981 [[#Pneumatic pump|small compressor pump]]\nrect 895 710 1226 944 [[#Pneumatic distribution block|distribution block (with check valves)]]\nrect 1010 238 1641 585 [[#Air tank|air tank]]\nrect 1834 291 2024 444 [[#Pneumatic T-junction|T-junction]]\nrect 1444 788 1800 909 [[#Pneumatic tubing|tubing]]\npoly 1616 600 1906 572 2461 550 2464 600 1903 619 1993 884 1946 897 1843 632 1637 660 [[#Pneumatic tubing|tubing]]\ndefault [[File:Collection_of_LEGO_pneumatic_components.jpg|]]\n\ndesc bottom-right\n</imagemap>\nThe key components of Lego pneumatics are:\n\n===Pneumatic pump===\n\nThere are three versions of the [[air pump|pump]]. The old Generation one pump, the new Generation two pump (both of these are spring-loaded) and the small pump without a spring (designed for use with motors as a [[compressor]]).  The Generation one pump is red, while the Generation two pump is yellow and has a larger contact pad at the top of the pump. Generation three pumps are now available in translucent blue.\n\nPumps are the primary source of air in a pneumatic circuit.\n\n===Pneumatic cylinder===\n\n[[pneumatic cylinder|Cylinders]] look like pumps, but they are the outputs of the energy, rather than the inputs. There are five versions of cylinders. The Generation 1 cylinders came in two lengths, only had one input and worked on pressure or vacuum. The Generation 2 cylinders have 2 inputs (and come in studded, studless, and small versions), and work on pressure in both directions.  They allow pushing and pulling, depending on which input air is pumped into.\n\n===Pneumatic valve===\n\nValves have three ports on them, and a black Lego axle which controls which of the ports are connected to each other.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Valve\n! scope=\"col\" | Left Port\n! scope=\"col\" | Center Port\n! scope=\"col\" | Right Port\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Right position\n| Open\n| Connected to Right\n| Connected to Center\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Center Position\n| Closed\n| Closed\n| Closed\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Left position\n| Connected to Center\n| Connected to Left\n| Open\n|}\n\nWhen a port is \"open\", that means it is like an open tire valve; all the air will leak out as fast as it can. When a port is closed, no air can enter or leave that port. When ports are connected, air will freely travel through the valve between those two ports.\n\n===Pneumatic tubing===\n\n[[hose|Tubing]] is simply the means by which air power is transferred through the circuit. Tubing can connect to a switch, air tank, T-junction, cylinder, pump, distribution block, or flex-hose.\n\nFlex-hoses aren't actually considered pneumatic pieces; they were designed as part of the Technic system for a different purpose, but Lego fans have discovered that pneumatic tubing actually fits over flex hoses pretty well, so many people use them as tubing extenders whenever they are needed. Flex hoses are more rigid than tubing.\n\nLego pneumatic came in an uncut form in earlier sets, and were required to be cut into smaller pieces using scissors. In newer sets, such as the 8049 technic tractor and log loader, the 8110 Unimog U400, the 42053 Volvo EW160E Digger and the 42043 Mercedes Benz Arocs 3245, the tubes are already cut to size.\n\n===Pneumatic T-junction===\n\nA T-junction is a very small piece that allows three pieces of tubing to connect into one junction, essentially splitting (or joining) airflow from two hoses into one. These only allow 1:2 branching, but by combining T-junctions, any number of branches can be achieved (i.e.: one tube can branch into three by using two T-junctions).\n\n===Air tank===\n\nAir [[pressure vessel|tanks]] are an important piece to most larger pneumatic designs, as they allow air power to be easily stored for later retrieval.\n\nIn 2006, Lego has discontinued this piece.\n\nIn 2008 Lego Education has re-released the tank in a new white color, as part of an add-on set (W979641)\n\n===Pneumatic distribution block===\n\nThese pieces used a special kind of [[check valve|one-way valve]] inside of them, and three ports on the outside. The leftmost port could only have air going into it, no air would ever come out. The middle port could have air going in or out. The right port could only have air coming out of it, no air could go into it.\n\nUsing these, it was possible to make the Generation 1 cylinders pull down as well as push up, however the pulling wasn't as strong as the pushing, and this prompted Lego to redesign the pneumatics into an easier-to-use and stronger system.\n\nThese were discontinued when Lego switched to Generation 2, in 1988.\n\n==Pneumatic principles==\n\nLego pneumatics offer the opportunity to learn and experiment with the principles of pneumatics and control circuits.  Advanced use of Lego pneumatics has been made in various [[Lego Mindstorms]] creations.\n\nLego pneumatic projects usually include a compressor made from a combination of a lego electric motor and pneumatic pump, together with a pressure switch which will activate the motor when greater pressure is required.\n\nThe pneumatic elements are most commonly used to resemble and take the function of hydraulic cylinders in appropriate models, actuating a digging arm or crane, for example. They can, however, also be used to build a pneumatic engine, which converts air pressure into rotary motion using the same principles as a steam engine. However, the cylinders are not optimised for this purpose, and such engines tend to be slow and lack power unless the cylinder inlets are enlarged.\n\nBecause a slight delay is involved between increased pressure and cylinder movement, various feedback loops can be used whereby one pneumatic component can activate another in a series of mechanical events.\n\nLego pneumatics can be configured in such a way that electronic circuits can be replicated.  These circuits can then be combined to create digital computers.\n\n==Alternative pneumatic systems==\n\n[[Fischertechnik]] offers a similar pneumatics system for robotic and control technology hobbyists.  The Fischertechnik system includes an electrically activated air [[solenoid]], a feature not available in the Lego range.\n\nA number of hobbyists have also constructed additional components such as larger air tanks and solenoids to complement the standard Lego pneumatic components.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Lego]]\n* [[Lego Mindstorms]]\n* [[Lego Technic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080610151631/http://www.fifth-r.com/cssoh1/contents.htm Wayback archive of site featuring Lego pneumatic principles and creations]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062002/http://lego.edutech.com/machines-and-mechanics.html Building and exploring pneumatics through real-life LEGO models]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060430012802/http://www.hempeldesigngroup.com/lego/compressor/index.html Hempel double action Lego air compressor]\n* [http://www.malgil.com/esl/lego/pneumatics.html Further information on pneumatic compressors and pressure switches]\n* [http://www.lpepower.com/ Examples of Lego Pneumatic Engines, similar to Steam Engines]\n{{Lego}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lego Pneumatics}}\n[[Category:Lego Technic]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox Lego theme\n|name=Lego Pneumatics\n|image=Collection of LEGO pneumatic components.jpg\n|parentthemes=[[Lego]]\n*[[Lego Technic]]\n**Lego pneumatics\n|from=1984\n|sets=[[Pneumatics Add-On Set (W979641) & Pneumatics Extension Pack (W991462)]]\n}}\n\n'''Lego pneumatics''' is a variety of [[Lego]] bricks which use air pressure and specialised components to perform various actions using the principles of [[pneumatics]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe LEGO pneumatics components were first introduced as part of the [[LEGO Technic]] range in 1984.

{"title_page": "The Wool Road (New South Wales)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date = November 2019}}\n'''The Wool Road''' (also later known as 'The Old Wool Road') was a [[Historic roads|historic road]] of New South Wales, Australia, that ran from [[Nerriga, New South Wales|Nerriga]] to what is now [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] on [[Jervis Bay]]. It was constructed privately in 1841, using convict labour. Its purpose was to provide a shorter route to a seaport for wool grown at [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] and beyond.\n\nThe historical significance of The Wool Road is that it was the first road, capable of being used by wheeled vehicles, linking the inland area around [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] to the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]]. The road led to the foundation of the privately-owned port town of South Huskisson (called [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] since 1952) and the adjacent 'government townshIp' of [[Huskisson, New South Wales|Huskisson]].\n\nThe Wool Road's route made its use difficult and the port on Jervis Bay was not a success. In 1856, the original road was realigned and extended to [[Terara]] (near [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]]) instead of Jervis Bay, becoming the Braidwood Road. The old route through the coastal escarpment to Jervis Bay fell into disuse for many years.\n\nMuch of the original route of The Wool Road remains in use today but some parts are accessible only to four-wheel drive traffic. Only a part of the original route that is currently in use is known as The Wool Road or The Old Wool Road today\u2014the section from the Princes Highway to Vincentia. The remainder of the original route still in use today is made up of a significant part of the Braidwood Road (MR92), Wandean Road, and a short section of the Princes Highway.[[File:Wandean Gap - Bottom of First Sideling of 1841 Wool Road in February 2019.jpg|thumb|256x256px|Wandean Gap - The bottom of the first of three steep sidelings on  Wandean Road (1841 Wool Road) that take it from the plateau of the Pigeon House Range to the ridge-line sloping toward the coast.

In the 1830s and 1840s, the Wandandian people still lived on their traditional lands.\n\nThe land also lay within the [[St Vincent County|County of St. Vincent]], one of the [[Nineteen Counties]] in which white settlement was permitted by the colonial government of New South Wales. In the late 1820s and 1830s colonial settlement had spread to the vicinity of [[Lake George (New South Wales)|Lake George]], [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]], [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], the Limestone Plains (now [[Canberra]]), and beyond to the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro district]]. The country settled was well-suited for the production of wool, for which there was a booming export market, but lay far from the existing port of Sydney. Transporting the [[wool bale]]s using the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the time involved a long and arduous journey from Braidwood\u2014taking around three weeks at the bullock's slow pace and with their need to stop for rest, feeding and watering\u2014via [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]] and [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] to Sydney.

Transport of wool in [[Wool bale|bales]] required a road that could be used by bullock drays.\n\nJervis Bay, a large sheltered bay that was suitable as a deepwater port lay far closer than Sydney but there was no road from Braidwood toward the coast beyond Nerriga. From 1831, there were sea-going auxiliary steamships\u2014such as the ''[[Sophia Jane]]''\u2014operating in New South Wales but steam powered railways were not in place before the mid-1850s.\n\nAlthough transportation of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] to New South Wales had ceased in 1840, it was still a penal colony. Convicts were a workforce that could be put to work on roadmaking.\n\n== Route ==\n[[File:Tianjara Creek looking north from Tianjara falls.jpg|thumb|209x209px|The valley of Tianjara Creek, looking north from Tianjara Falls.

The significant geographical obstacles to be overcome were crossing the [[Endrick River]] near Nerriga, climbing to a plateau in the northern part of the Pigeon House Range, then avoiding the steep valleys and gorges cut into that plateau by tributaries of the [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] and [[Clyde River (New South Wales)|Clyde]] rivers, and subsequently descending from the plateau to the coastal plain to reach Jervis Bay.\n\nAfter fording the Endrick River, The Wool Road broadly followed the direction of the modern-day Braidwood Road (MR92), from Nerriga to near the Boolijah Peak, a point east of [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]]. The current Braidwood Road alignment is the result of an upgrade in 1856. The original 1841 road's exact route was different in some places, most significantly where it climbs the Pigeon House Range at Bulee Mountain near Nerriga. The 1841 road traversed the ridge to the north of Bulee Mountain and went through the man-made Bulee Gap,<ref name=\":5\" />  whereas the 1856 alignment and the current road pass to the south of Bulee Mountain[[File:Sussex Inlet from Jerrawangala lookout.jpg|thumb|View from Jerrawangala lookout atop the coastal escarpment approx. 500m south of Wandean Gap.

Holman later recognised that had they done so they could have found a far easier route for a road to Jervis Bay<ref name=\":6\" /> (such as that of the longer but less steep Turpentine Road). However, the explorers had passed through rugged and difficult country and, having reached Jervis Bay via what was apparently the shortest route, did not search for any longer but easier route.\n\nIn 1839, the owner of [[Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory#Settlement|Yarralumla]], [[Terence Aubrey Murray]], also explored a route between Nerriga and Jervis Bay, which may have been similar to that followed by the Futter expedition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nerriga on the wool road|last=Pam.|first=Radowitz|date=1990|publisher=Nerriga Historical Museum|others=Nerriga Historical Museum.|isbn=0646006010|location=[Nerriga, N.S.W.]|pages=19|oclc=27515653}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31726503|title=Country News.|date=1839-09-27|work=Australasian Chronicle (Sydney, NSW : 1839 - 1843)|access-date=2019-01-09|pages=4}}</ref>\n\n=== Proponents ===\nAfter at first failing to obtain government funding for such a road in 1839,<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31724219|title=The Colonist.|date=1839-12-18|work=Colonist (Sydney, NSW : 1835 - 1840)|access-date=2019-01-13|pages=2}}</ref> landholders from around Braidwood and Nerriga decided to build their own road from Nerriga to Jervis Bay.

It was constructed privately in 1841, using convict labour. Its purpose was to provide a shorter route to a seaport for wool grown at [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] and beyond.\n\nThe historical significance of The Wool Road is that it was the first road, capable of being used by wheeled vehicles, linking the inland area around [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] to the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]]. The road led to the foundation of the privately-owned port town of South Huskisson (called [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] since 1952) and the adjacent 'government townshIp' of [[Huskisson, New South Wales|Huskisson]].\n\nThe Wool Road's route made its use difficult and the port on Jervis Bay was not a success. In 1856, the original road was realigned and extended to [[Terara]] (near [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]]) instead of Jervis Bay, becoming the Braidwood Road. The old route through the coastal escarpment to Jervis Bay fell into disuse for many years.\n\nMuch of the original route of The Wool Road remains in use today but some parts are accessible only to four-wheel drive traffic. Only a part of the original route that is currently in use is known as The Wool Road or The Old Wool Road today\u2014the section from the Princes Highway to Vincentia. The remainder of the original route still in use today is made up of a significant part of the Braidwood Road (MR92), Wandean Road, and a short section of the Princes Highway.[[File:Wandean Gap - Bottom of First Sideling of 1841 Wool Road in February 2019.jpg|thumb|256x256px|Wandean Gap - The bottom of the first of three sidelings on the Wandean Road (1841 Wool Road) that take the road from the plateau of the Pigeon House Range to the ridge-line sloping toward the coast.

In the 1830s and 1840s, the Wandandian people still lived on their traditional lands.\n\nThe land also lay within the [[St Vincent County|County of St. Vincent]], one of the [[Nineteen Counties]] in which white settlement was permitted by the colonial government of New South Wales. In the late 1820s and 1830s colonial settlement had spread to the vicinity of [[Lake George (New South Wales)|Lake George]], [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]], [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], the Limestone Plains (now [[Canberra]]), and beyond to the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro district]]. The country settled was well-suited for the production of wool, for which there was a booming export market, but lay far from the existing port of Sydney. Transporting the [[wool bale]]s using the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the time involved a long and arduous journey from Braidwood\u2014taking around three weeks at the bullock's slow pace and with their need to stop for rest, feeding and watering\u2014via [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]] and [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] to Sydney.

Transport of wool in [[Wool bale|bales]] required a road that could be used by bullock drays.\n\nJervis Bay, a large sheltered bay that was suitable as a deepwater port lay far closer than Sydney but there was no road from Braidwood toward the coast beyond Nerriga. From 1831, there were sea-going auxiliary steamships\u2014such as the ''[[Sophia Jane]]''\u2014operating in New South Wales but steam powered railways were not in place before the mid-1850s.\n\nAlthough transportation of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] to New South Wales had ceased in 1840, it was still a penal colony. Convicts were a workforce that could be put to work on roadmaking.\n\n== Route ==\n[[File:Tianjara Creek looking north from Tianjara falls.jpg|thumb|209x209px|The valley of Tianjara Creek, looking north from Tianjara Falls.

The significant geographical obstacles to be overcome were crossing the [[Endrick River]] near Nerriga, climbing to a plateau in the northern part of the Pigeon House Range, then avoiding the steep valleys and gorges cut into that plateau by tributaries of the [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] and [[Clyde River (New South Wales)|Clyde]] rivers, and subsequently descending from the plateau to the coastal plain to reach Jervis Bay.\n\nAfter fording the Endrick River, The Wool Road broadly followed the direction of the modern-day Braidwood Road (MR92), from Nerriga to near the Boolijah Peak, a point east of [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]]. The current Braidwood Road alignment is the result of an upgrade in 1856. The original 1841 road's exact route was different in some places, most significantly where it climbs the Pigeon House Range at Bulee Mountain near Nerriga.

Soon after the road opened, in January 1842, an anonymous report of difficulties using it appeared, which included a prediction that, ''\"it is doubtful if ever it will be completed and when finished, a constant thoroughfare to the sea coast; inasmuch as the route is chiefly barren scrub, and badly watered.\"''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226356874|title=COUNTRY NEWS.|date=1842-01-08|work=Sydney Free Press (NSW : 1841 - 1842)|access-date=2019-02-02|pages=2}}</ref> A year later, in January 1843, an article in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] stated that, ''\"The township, the wharf, and the road, have all still to contend against the evil reports which have been so industriously clrculated respecting them by interested parties\"''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12413192|title=&quot;JERVIS BAY.|date=1843-01-11|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-12-09|pages=2}}</ref> There was some factual basis for such negative views.\n\nGeographic and economic difficulties affected The Wool Road and these, rather than the 'evil reports', caused it to fall into disuse after a relatively short time.\n\nThe steep descent proved a problem for the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the day. Although the distance was short, the slowness of the fully laden bullock drays descending the steep route led to ships being delayed at Jervis Bay and on at least one occasion leaving without taking on a cargo there. With hindsight, the route of The Wool Road via the Wandean Gap had been a poor choice; far better routes for roads over the coastal escarpment would be found later.\n\nThe truth about the road\u2014and the country through which it ran\u2014was very much contrary to the apparently exaggerated claims that had been made, when town allotments in South Huskisson had been sold for high prices in 1841.<ref name=\":15\" /> The country atop the Pidgeon House Range was infertile land that was unsuitable to provide grazing for the bullock teams, with the exception of the natural clearing at Yerock (or Yarrock) Flat\u2014known as McKenzie's Paddock<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sassafras : the story of the Post Town at Sassafras Mountain on the old Wool Road in the County of St. Vincent|last=Charles.|first=Snedden, Robert|date=1996|publisher=R C Snedden|isbn=0646259822|location=Duffy, A.C.T.|pages=22 & 24|oclc=38411506}}</ref>\u2014and the nearby area of volcanic soil around [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]].

As a result, some of those who had supported the building of the road, such as Terence Aubrey Murray, did not use it once it was completed.

Before the railway was extended beyond Goulburn, the town had sixty carriers delivering to the railhead.<ref>Interpretive signage at Goulburn Railway Station (accessed Nov. 2018).</ref> In 1893, the [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast railway line]] reached [[Bomaderry railway station|Bomaderry]], just north of Nowra, providing a second railhead.\n\nA section of the original The Wool Road from Nerriga that passed through the Bulee Gap cutting was bypassed by the 1856 route but it remained in use as an alternative [[stock route]] to the corresponding part to the newer Braidwood Road. During the Second World War, a part of this section of the original road was deliberately destroyed using explosives, to limit access by an enemy to the inland area and the national capital, [[Canberra]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nerriga on the wool road|last=Pam.|first=Radowitz|date=1990|publisher=Nerriga Historical Museum|others=Nerriga Historical Museum.|isbn=0646006010|location=[Nerriga, N.S.W.]|pages=22|oclc=27515653}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy and remnants ==\nOne surviving section of the original 1841 Wool Road is located just north of the existing Braidwood Road (MR92), near to the Bulee Gap, east of Nerriga. The man-made Bulee Gap cutting\u2014bypassed by the 1856 route\u2014and the surviving sections of original road passing through it, are remnants of the 1841 convict-built road. (A part of the original road immediately north of the Bulee Gap cutting was deliberately and thoroughly destroyed during WWII.) The existing Braidwood Road (MR92), east of Bulee Gap, largely follows the original 1841 route of The Wool Road but the section of the current road west of the Bullee Gap largely follows the 1856 realignment.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stgeorgesbasin.info/level2/heritage.html|title=St Georges Basin Heritage|website=stgeorgesbasin.info|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref>\n[[File:Braidwood Road (1856 route) at junction with 1841 route at Bulee Gap.jpg|thumb|192x192px|Braidwood Road (1856 route).

The route of the modern road over the bridge structure preserved sandstone landforms and a part of the 1856 road's formation, including a [[dry stone]] walled embankment and the junction with the older 1841 route at the south end of the Bulee Gap cutting.[[File:Wandean Gap - Start of descent of 1841 Wool Road in February 2019.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Wandean Gap\u2014Wandean Road (1841 Wool Road) at the start of the steep descent.(February 2019)]]The last portion of the road to South Huskisson (now Vincentia) was reopened as a public road around 1911-12 and that involved the resumption of some private land\u2014land being used at the time as 'private road' or 'private track'\u2014to do so (South Huskisson\u2014now Vincentia\u2014was, at that time, still a 'private town').<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230685906|title=NOTIFICATION UNDER THE PUBLIC ROADS ACT OF 1902, OF RESUMPTION AND DEDICATION OF LANDS FOR ROADS, AND PARTS OF ROADS DECLARED TO RE A PUBLIC ROAD.|last=|first=|date=1911-08-30|work=Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales (Sydney, NSW : 1901 - 2001)|access-date=2018-11-25|pages=4779}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161470101|title=Advertising|date=1912-04-27|work=Ulladulla and Milton Times (NSW : 1891 - 1917)|access-date=2018-12-02|pages=4}}</ref> The modern road is known as The Wool Road and is a largely straight road. To the south of the modern Wool Road\u2014starting at Island Point Road and following a more circuititous route south of Cockrow Creek\u2014is 'The Old Wool Road' and connecting it to the modern day The Wool Road is 'Wool Lane' . Where it exists, this 'Old Wool Road' is closer to the route of the original road than the corresponding section of the modern straighter road. \nHistorically, the end of The Wool Road was where it entered the town of South Huskisson,<ref name=\":9\" /> from where the streets of the town led to a wharf on Jervis Bay; the modern day road known as The Wool Road now ends at a roundabout intersecting Elizabeth Drive and Burton Street, Vincentia, near the shore of Jervis Bay. Some hewn sandstone blocks from the 1842 wharf are visible at low tide near the Holden Street boat ramp<ref name=\":4\" /> Many street names from \"The Old Township\" are still in use in Vincentia today and much of the original street plan remains.<ref name=\":9\" /> The 'government town' north of Moona Moona Creek, which was surveyed at the same time as \"the Old Township\",<ref name=\":9\" /> grew from the early 1860s onwards to become modern-day [[Huskisson, New South Wales|Huskisson]].\n\nThere is a lookout known as the [[Jerrawangala]] Lookout and to reach it visitors turn off Braidwood Road and pass over part of the 1841 route, along the first part of modern-day Wandean Road. The 1841 route of The Wool Road passes through the Wandean Gap approximately 500m to the north from the location of the modern day lookout. The elevation of the lookout demonstrates the folly of building a road through the escarpment at this location. Drill marks in the rocks at Wandean Gap are remnants of the construction of The Wool Road in 1841.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stgeorgesbasin.info/level2/heritage.html|title=St Georges Basin Heritage|website=stgeorgesbasin.info|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe little used road through the Wandean Gap to Wandandian (Wandean Road) still exists; most of it is single-lane and unsealed and much of it is unsuitable for general traffic.
