In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F.

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

He made important contributions to the areas of [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]], the algebraic theory of differential operators, [[homological algebra]], [[differential geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]], [[mechanics]] and [[mathematical physics]], the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nA.M. Vinogradov was born on February 18, 1938 in [[Novorossiysk]].  His father, Mikhail Ivanovich Vinogradov, was a hydraulics scientist, his mother, Ilza Alexandrovna Firer, was a medical doctor. Among his more distant ancestors, his great-grandfather [[Anton Smagin]], a self-taught peasant and a deputy of the State Duma of the second convocation stand out. \n\nIn 1955 A.M. Vinogradov entered the Mechanics and Mathematics Department of Moscow State University (Mech-mat), began his Ph.D. in 1960 and completed it in 1964. In 1965, he received a position at the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology of Moscow State University, where he worked until he left the Soviet Union for Italy in 1990. He obtained the next degree (doktorskaya dissertatsiya) in 1984 at the Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Science in Novosibirsk in Russia. From 1993 to 2010, he held the position of professor in geometry at the University of Salerno in Italy. \n\n==Work==\n\nVinogradov published his first works in number theory, together with [[Boris_Delaunay|B.N. Delaunay]] and [[Dmitry_Fuchs|D.B. Fuchs]] when he was a second year undergraduate student. By the end of his undergraduate years, he was contributing to the [[Albert_Schwarz|A.S. Schwartz]] seminar, and started working on [[algebraic topology]]. His PhD thesis (under the formal supervision of V.G. Boltyansky) was devoted to homotopic properties of the embedding spaces of circles into the 2-sphere or the 3-disk. Vinogradov continued working in algebraic and [[differential topology]] \u2013 in particular, on the [[Adams spectral sequence]] \u2013 until the early seventies, and he started his own research seminar in 1967. Between the sixties and the seventies, inspired by the ideas of [[Sophus Lie]], he began to investigate the foundations of the geometric theory of partial differential equations. Having become familiar with the work of [[Donald_C._Spencer|Spencer]], Goldschmidt and [[Daniel_Quillen|Quillen]] on formal integrability, he turned his attention to the algebraic (in particular, cohomological) component of that theory.\nIn 1972, the short note in Soviet Math Doklady (publishing long texts in the Soviet Union at the time was very difficult) entitled \u201cThe logic algebra of the theory of linear differential operators\u201d [[#1|[1]]], contained what Vinogradov himself called the main functors of the differential calculus over commutative algebras.\n\nVinogradov\u2019s approach to nonlinear [[differential equations]] as geometric objects, with their general theory and applications, is developed in detail in the monographs [[#2|[2]]], [[#3|[3]]] and [[#4|[4]]], as well as in some articles [[#5|[5]]], [[#6|[6]]], [[#22|[22]]]. He united infinitely prolonged differential equations into a category [[#7|[7]]] whose objects, called [[Diffiety|diffieties]] (= differential varieties), are studied in the framework of what he called [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]] (by analogy with secondary quantization) [[#8|[8]]], [[#9|[9]]]. One of the central parts of this theory is based on the <math>\\cal C</math>-spectral sequence (now known as the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov spectral sequence]]) [[#10|[10]]], [[#11|[11]]]. The first term of this spectral sequence gives a unified cohomological approach to various notions and statements, including the [[Lagrangian_(field_theory)|Lagrangian]] formalism with constraints, [[Conservation_law|conservation laws]], cosymmetries, the [[Noether theorem]], and the Helmholtz criterion in the inverse problem of the [[calculus of variations]] (for arbitrary nonlinear differential operators). A particular case of the <math>\\cal C</math>-spectral sequence (for an \u201cempty\u201d equation, i.e., for the space of infinite jets) is the so-called [[variational bicomplex]] (see also [https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/variational+bicomplex the n-lab article]).\n\nFurthermore, Vinogradov introduced the construction of a new bracket on the graded algebra of linear transformations of a cochain complex [[#12|[12]]]. The Vinogradov bracket is skew-symmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity modulo a coboundary. Vinogradov\u2019s construction precursed the general concept of a derived bracket on a differential Loday (or Leibniz) algebra introduced by Y. Kosmann-Schwarzbach in 1996 [[#13|[13]]]. These results were also applied to [[Poisson geometry]] [[#14|[14]]], [[#15|[15]]]. \n\nFurthermore, together with coauthors, Vinogradov was concerned with the analysis and comparison of various generalizations of Lie (super) algebras, including <math>L_\\infty</math> algebras and Filippov algebras [[#16|[16]]].\n\nThe research interests of Alexandre M. Vinogradov were also motivated by problems of contemporary physics \u2013 for example the structure of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] [[#23|[23]]], [[#24|[24]]], the dynamics of acoustic beams [[#17|[17]]], the equations of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (the so-called Kadomtsev-Pogutse equations appearing in the stability theory of high-temperature plasma in [[Tokamak|tokamaks]]) [[#18|[18]]] and mathematical questions in [[general relativity]] [[#19|[19]]], [[#20|[20]]], [[#21|[21]]]. Considerable attention to the mathematical understanding of the fundamental physical notion of observable is given in the book [[#4|[4]]], written by Vinogradov jointly with several participants of his seminar under the pen name of Jet Nestruev.\n\n==Contribution to the mathematical community==\n\n[[File:Alexandre_Vinogradov-lect-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Prof. A. M. Vinogradov during a lecture]] From 1967 until 1990, Vinogradov headed a research seminar at Mekhmat MSU.\nFrom 1998 to 2019, Vinogradov organized and directed the so-called [https://sites.google.com/site/levicivitainstitute/Activities/DiffietySchools Diffiety Schools] in Italy, Russia, and Poland in which were taught the ideas about [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]], the algebraic theory of differential operators, the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, the concept of a [[diffiety]], the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov (C-spectral) sequence]] and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]].\n\nHe also organized a series of small conferences called \u201cCurrent Geometry\u201d that took place in Italy from 2000 to 2010, as well as the large Moscow conference \u201cSecondary Calculus and Cohomological Physics\u201d (1997) [[#9|[9]]]. \nVinogradov was one of the initial organizers of the [https://www.esi.ac.at/about/people Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute] in Mathematical Physics in Vienna, as well as of the mathematical journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/differential-geometry-and-its-applications Differential Geometry and its Applications], remaining one of the editors to his last days. \n\nIn 1985, he created a laboratory that studied various aspects of the geometry of differential equations at the Institute of Programming Systems in Pereslavl-Zalessky and headed it until he left for Italy. \nIn 1978, he was one of the organizers and first lecturers in the so-called [[Jewish_People's_University|People's University]] for students who were not accepted to Mekhmat because they were ethnically Jewish (he ironically called this school the \u201cPeople\u2019s Friendship University\u201d).\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n# {{Citation | first1 = A.

Having become familiar with the work of [[Donald_C._Spencer|Spencer]], Goldschmidt and [[Daniel_Quillen|Quillen]] on formal integrability, he turned his attention to the algebraic (in particular, cohomological) component of that theory.\nIn 1972, the short note in Soviet Math Doklady (publishing long texts in the Soviet Union at the time was very difficult) entitled \u201cThe logic algebra of the theory of linear differential operators\u201d [[#1|[1]]], contained what Vinogradov himself called the main functors of the differential calculus over commutative algebras.\n\nVinogradov\u2019s approach to nonlinear [[differential equations]] as geometric objects, with their general theory and applications, is developed in detail in the monographs [[#2|[2]]], [[#3|[3]]] and [[#4|[4]]], as well as in some articles [[#5|[5]]], [[#6|[6]]], [[#22|[22]]]. He united infinitely prolonged differential equations into a category [[#7|[7]]] whose objects, called [[Diffiety|diffieties]] (= differential varieties), are studied in the framework of what he called [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]] (by analogy with secondary quantization) [[#8|[8]]], [[#9|[9]]]. One of the central parts of this theory is based on the C-spectral sequence (now known as the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov spectral sequence]]) [[#10|[10]]], [[#11|[11]]]. The first term of this spectral sequence gives a unified cohomological approach to various notions and statements, including the [[Lagrangian_(field_theory)|Lagrangian]] formalism with constraints, [[Conservation_law|conservation laws]], cosymmetries, the [[Noether theorem]], and the Helmholtz criterion in the inverse problem of the [[calculus of variations]] (for arbitrary nonlinear differential operators). A particular case of the C-spectral sequence (for an \u201cempty\u201d equation, i.e., for the space of infinite jets) is the so-called [[variational bicomplex]] (see also [https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/variational+bicomplex the n-lab article]).\n\nFurthermore, Vinogradov introduced the construction of a new bracket on the graded algebra of linear transformations of a cochain complex [[#12|[12]]]. The Vinogradov bracket is skew-symmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity modulo a coboundary. Vinogradov\u2019s construction precursed the general concept of a derived bracket on a differential Loday (or Leibniz) algebra introduced by Y. Kosmann-Schwarzbach in 1996 [[#13|[13]]]. These results were also applied to [[Poisson geometry]] [[#14|[14]]], [[#15|[15]]]. \n\nFurthermore, together with coauthors, Vinogradov was concerned with the analysis and comparison of various generalizations of Lie (super) algebras, including <math>L_\\infty</math> algebras and Filippov algebras [[#16|[16]]].\n\nThe research interests of Alexandre M. Vinogradov were also motivated by problems of contemporary physics \u2013 for example the structure of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] [[#23|[23]]], [[#24|[24]]], the dynamics of acoustic beams [[#17|[17]]], the equations of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (the so-called Kadomtsev-Pogutse equations appearing in the stability theory of high-temperature plasma in [[Tokamak|tokamaks]]) [[#18|[18]]] and mathematical questions in [[general relativity]] [[#19|[19]]], [[#20|[20]]], [[#21|[21]]]. Considerable attention to the mathematical understanding of the fundamental physical notion of observable is given in the book [[#4|[4]]], written by Vinogradov jointly with several participants of his seminar under the pen name of Jet Nestruev.\n\n==Contribution to the mathematical community==\n\n[[File:Alexandre_Vinogradov-lect-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Prof. A. M. Vinogradov during a lecture]] From 1967 until 1990, Vinogradov headed a research seminar at Mekhmat MSU.\nFrom 1998 to 2019, Vinogradov organized and directed the so-called [https://sites.google.com/site/levicivitainstitute/Activities/DiffietySchools Diffiety Schools] in Italy, Russia, and Poland in which were taught the ideas about [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]], the algebraic theory of differential operators, the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, the concept of a [[diffiety]], the [[Diffiety#Vinogradov_sequence|Vinogradov (C-spectral) sequence]] and [[Secondary calculus and cohomological physics|secondary calculus]].\n\nHe also organized a series of small conferences called \u201cCurrent Geometry\u201d that took place in Italy from 2000 to 2010, as well as the large Moscow conference \u201cSecondary Calculus and Cohomological Physics\u201d (1997) [[#9|[9]]]. \nVinogradov was one of the initial organizers of the [https://www.esi.ac.at/about/people Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute] in Mathematical Physics in Vienna, as well as of the mathematical journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/differential-geometry-and-its-applications Differential Geometry and its Applications], remaining one of the editors to his last days. \n\nIn 1985, he created a laboratory that studied various aspects of the geometry of differential equations at the Institute of Programming Systems in Pereslavl-Zalessky and headed it until he left for Italy. \nIn 1978, he was one of the organizers and first lecturers in the so-called [[Jewish_People's_University|People's University]] for students who were not accepted to Mekhmat because they were ethnically Jewish (he ironically called this school the \u201cPeople\u2019s Friendship University\u201d).\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n# {{Citation | first1 = A.

A few remained in service until 1949.<ref name=\"Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 186\"/>\n\n==Development==\nFilippo Zappata was one of the foremost Italian aircraft designers. He worked for [[Cantieri Aeronautici e Navali Triestini]] (CANT) for some years, but went to France in 1927 to work for [[Bl\u00e9riot A\u00e9ronautique|Bl\u00e9riot]]. He returned to Italy at the prompting of [[Italo Balbo]] and resumed work at CANT on a series of new aircraft. The first of these was the Z.501, designed to replace the [[Savoia-Marchetti S.78]]. The prototype Z.501 was first flown in 1934 by test pilot [[Mario Stoppani]].<ref name=Marcon>Marcon 1995, pp. 10\u201321.</ref>\n\n===Design===\n\n[[File:CANT Z501.jpg|thumb|left|Z.501 in flight]]\nThe aircraft had a very slim [[fuselage]], a high [[parasol wing]] and a single wing-mounted engine nacelle. In the prototype a 560&nbsp;kW (750&nbsp;hp) inline [[Isotta Fraschini]] Asso-750.RC engine was fitted, with an annular (circular) [[radiator]] that made the installation resemble a [[radial engine]], although it was actually a liquid-cooled inline. Some versions of other planes such as the Ju 88 and Fw 190D had this same feature. The engine nacelle was extended to carry a rear-facing [[machine gun]], while other guns were mounted in the centre fuselage and nose. All were 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) [[Breda-SAFAT machine gun]]s. [[Bomb]]s up to 640&nbsp;kg/1,410&nbsp;lb (4 \u00d7 160&nbsp;kg/350&nbsp;lb) were carried under the wings. The aerodynamic low-drag design was typical of Zappata-designed aircraft, as was the wooden construction.\n\nProduction of the Z.501 began in 1935 with 24 aircraft ordered from CANT, and 30 from [[Aeronautica Sicula]], a company in [[Palermo]]. Registration numbers started with MM.35168.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Record flights===\nThe production aircraft had an endurance of 12 hours. However, the record-breaking version, as was quite common at the time (mainly due to the low fuel consumption of the piston engine), greatly exceeded this. The USA had established a new endurance record of 3,860&nbsp;km (2,400&nbsp;mi); a Z.501 with the civilian registration ''I-AGIL'' was used to re-take the record in accordance with dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s wishes. It was manned by Stoppani and two others, fitted with a special metal three-blade propeller, and other modifications.<ref name=Marcon/>{{Page needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nOn 19\u201320 May 1934, the modified Z.501 established a new [[seaplane]] distance record of 4,130&nbsp;km (2,570&nbsp;mi), by flying from [[Monfalcone]] to [[Massawa]], in [[Eritrea]], in 26 hours and 35 minutes. This distance record was lost to a French aircraft that flew 4,335&nbsp;km (2,694&nbsp;mi) on 23 June the same year, so another record flight was made on 16 July. The plan was to fly to [[Djibouti]], a distance of 4,700&nbsp;km (2,900&nbsp;mi{{Page needed|date=November 2011}}),<ref name=\"jackson\">Jackson 2002</ref> but instead the aircraft flew 4,930&nbsp;km (3,060&nbsp;mi) to [[Berbera]], Somaliland, in 25 hours.\n\n===Military service===\nZ.501's were used for search-and-rescue missions and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]]. The Z.501 was put into service with some modifications, including; [[Gun turret|turrets]] for the machine guns, and some reinforcement of the airframe that increased the overall weight by 500&nbsp;kg (1,100&nbsp;lb). The more powerful 656&nbsp;kW (880&nbsp;hp) [[Isotta Fraschini Asso XI.RC]] engine was fitted, but even with an additional 97&nbsp;kW (130&nbsp;hp), the maximum speed dropped to 245&nbsp;km/h (152&nbsp;mph), cruise speed to 200&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph), and range to 2,400&nbsp;km (1,500&nbsp;mi).<ref name=Marcon/>{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe first units equipped were No.141 Sqn., [[Eritrea]], No.83 Group, [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]], No.85, [[Elmas]], and No.62, [[Spain]] (for operations).<ref name=Marcon/> By the time Italy entered [[World War II]] on 10 June 1940, 202 aircraft were in service in 15 squadrons. They were used by 20 Sqn. and patrolled the [[Mediterranean]], as well as performing air-sea rescue operations.<ref name=\"jackson\"/>{{Page needed|date=March 2012}} During the short campaign against [[France]], seven Z.501s were destroyed by a French attack on their base in Sardinia. Another crashed the next day. In July, encounters with Royal Navy [[Fleet Air Arm]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] and accidents claimed many Z.501s, with a total of 11 destroyed in action, while the number that were operational dropped to 77.<ref name=Marcon/>{{Page needed|date=March 2012}} The Z.501 operated in all theatres and 62 aircraft were lost in 1940, leaving 126, of which only 87 were operational.

Strangely, the number of operational aircraft increased to an average of 100, rising six months later to 108 in 11 squadrons, probably due to the arrival of new aircraft.<ref name=Marcon/>{{Page needed|date=March 2012}}They were responsible, in collaboration with Italian ships, for the destruction of {{HMS|Union|N56|6}} and damaged three other [[submarine]]s.

By September 1943, there were still 240 aircraft assigned to maritime reconnaissance: only 84 were Z.501s, in three squadrons, and another 11 (mixed), out of 20 in total. Only around 40 aircraft were operational.<ref name=Marcon/> Total production, 218 by CANT and 236 by Aeronautica Sicula, but 12 incomplete aircraft were captured after the [[Operation Husky|invasion of Sicily]]. Later, Aeronautica Sicula repaired many of the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force|ICAF]] aircraft. Some modifications were adopted during production, such as the removal of the nose machine gun; it was replaced by an enclosed fairing.\n\nSome Z.501s were supplied to [[Romania]] and to the Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Following [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italy's surrender]] in 1943, a few of these flying boats continued to operate with both the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] ''[[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]]'' and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]].<ref name=\"jackson\"/>  After the armistice, several flew to southern Italy, including the nine aircraft of 149 Sqn with 80 persons aboard. In October, there were 16 aircraft operational in southern Italy, which dropped to 10 by May 1945. The squadrons involved were Nos 141, 147, and 183. After the war 183 Sqn. was based at Elmas with four Z.501s, and these were scrapped in 1950.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\n====Romanian service====\nIn 1941, twelve Z.501s were exported to Romania.<ref>[https://www.google.ro/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enRO763RO763&biw=1536&bih=759&tbm=bks&ei=iX1HW73mH4HXwQLU2R0&q=too%2C+exported+aircraft+to+Romania+-+not+only+SM.79B+bombers%2C+but+also+numerous+seaplanes%2C+including+12+Cant+Z.501s+in&oq=too%2C+exported+aircraft+to+Romania+-+not+only+SM.79B+bombers%2C+but+also+numerous+seaplanes%2C+including+12+Cant+Z.501s+in&gs_l=psy-ab.3...88174.88174.0.88586.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.i_l8EpsaBRY Hans Werner Neulen, ''In the Skies of Europe: Air Forces Allied to the Luftwaffe 1939\u20131945'', Crowood, 2000, p. 92]</ref> One of these 12 flying boats was lost during the war, shot down in the autumn of 1943 by Soviet ace [[Grigoriy Rechkalov]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Mellinger|first=George|title=Soviet Lend-Lease Fighter Aces of World War 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1b2nCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA72|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78200-586-5|page=72}}</ref> The ''Gabbianos'' performed well in the [[Black Sea]], a single unit managing to sink two Soviet submarines in August 1941.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Frank|title=The Axis Air Forces: Flying in Support of the German Luftwaffe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4PgwCKQQP1gC&pg=PA166|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39590-1|page=166}}</ref>\n\n==Combat performance==\n\n[[File:CRDA Cant. Cant Z.501 \"Gabbiano\".jpg|thumb|left|Close view of nose showing gunner and cockpit positions]]\nGenerally, the Z.501 had a mixed reputation. It was pleasant to fly, having low [[wing loading]] and good performance (when it was first introduced). It was quite reliable despite having only one liquid-cooled engine. However, there were problems with the durability of the wooden fuselage, particularly the aircraft built during the war. Its seafaring qualities were poor and the aircraft was susceptible to bad weather conditions. The fuselage would often break up in rough seas. Another problem was the engine nacelle: if the aircraft landed heavily the propeller could crash down into the cockpit.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\nThe aircraft was used in the reconnaissance role thanks to its long endurance, but it was very vulnerable to enemy fighters or even [[bomber]]s. Perhaps its only air victory was in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], when a fighter stalled while chasing a Z.501. The aircraft was more often relegated to second-line duties. Sometimes, with well-trained crews, it was able to attack submarines, damaging several of them (perhaps six in total) and contributing to the destruction of two others. The aircraft had no advanced detection systems, only [[depth charge]]s.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\nGenerally the aircraft's main task was search and rescue missions, and perhaps because of this it was called ''Mammaiuto'' (which means \"Mamma help me!\" in Italian). Another theory is that it earned the nickname because it was helpless against enemy aircraft. Even its sea capabilities were poor, and often the Z.501 needed to be helped by ships. As for its flying qualities, it was too slow, unmanoeuvrable, and under-armed to put up a defence against enemy fighters. As a result, many were shot down.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\n==Military operators==\n;{{flag|Kingdom of Italy}}\n* [[Regia Aeronautica]]\n* [[Aviazione Legionaria]] operated 9 aircraft\n* [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]]\n* [[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]]\n;{{ITA}}\n* [[Italian Air Force]] operated few aircraft until 1948<ref>[http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/italy/af/ital-af2-all-time.htm aeroflight]</ref>\n;{{flag|Spain|1945}}\n* [[Spanish Air Force]]\n;{{flagcountry|Kingdom of Romania}}\n* [[Royal Romanian Naval Aviation]] (12 purchased in 1941)\n\n==Specifications (Z.501)==\n\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II,<ref name='wwii'>{{cite book |editor1-last=Bishop |editor1-first=Chris |title=The encyclopedia of weapons of World War II |date=1998 |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |location=New York |isbn=0-7607-1022-8}}</ref> Italian Civil and Military Aircraft 1930\u20131945<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Jonathon W. |title=Italian Civil and Military Aircraft 1930\u20131945 |year=1963 |publisher=Aero Publishers Inc. |location=USA |isbn=0-8168-6500-0|pages=52\u201354}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=4-5\n|length m=14.3\n|length note=\n|span m=22.5\n|span note=\n|height m=4.4\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=667.4\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=3850\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=7050\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=[[Isotta Fraschini Asso XI R.2C.15]]\n|eng1 type=\n|eng1 kw=656\n|eng1 note=\n\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=metal propeller\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia note=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|max speed kmh=275\n|max speed note=at {{cvt|8200|ft|0|order=flip}}\n|max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft -->\n|cruise speed kmh=240\n|cruise speed note=at {{cvt|6560|ft|0|order=flip}}\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=999\n|range note=\n|combat range km=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=2398\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude={{cvt|131200|ft|0|order=flip}} in 16 minutes\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=<!--\n* '''Take-off run:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n* '''Take-off run to {{cvt|15|m|0}}:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n* '''Landing run:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n* '''Landing run from {{cvt|15|m|0}}:''' {{cvt||m|0}}-->\n<!--\n        Armament\n-->\n|guns=3 \u00d7 7.7 mm (0.303 in) [[Breda-SAFAT machine gun]]s (initially Vickers), but many had only two when the nose position was removed\n|bombs=640 kg (1,400 lb) carried externally\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Aircontent\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=\n* [[Aichi H9A]]\n* [[Beriev Be-4]]\n* [[Dornier Do 18]]\n* [[Fairchild 91]]\n* [[Saunders-Roe A.36 Lerwick]]\n|see also=\n |lists=\n* [[List of aircraft of World War II]]\n* [[List of Interwar military aircraft]]\n* [[List of Regia Aeronautica aircraft used in World War II]]\n* [[List of seaplanes and amphibious aircraft]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n{{refbegin}}\n* Angelucci, Enzo and Paolo Matricardi.

Cant Z.501 \"Gabbiano\".jpg|thumb|left|Close view of nose showing gunner and cockpit positions]]\nGenerally, the Z.501 had a mixed reputation. It was pleasant to fly, having low [[wing loading]] and good performance (when it was first introduced). It was quite reliable despite having only one liquid-cooled engine. However, there were problems with the durability of the wooden fuselage, particularly the aircraft built during the war. Its seafaring qualities were poor and the aircraft was susceptible to bad weather conditions. The fuselage would often break up in rough seas. Another problem was the engine nacelle: if the aircraft landed heavily the propeller could crash down into the cockpit.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\nThe aircraft was used in the reconnaissance role thanks to its long endurance, but it was very vulnerable to enemy fighters or even [[bomber]]s. Perhaps its only air victory was in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], when a fighter stalled while chasing a Z.501. The aircraft was more often relegated to second-line duties. Sometimes, with well-trained crews, it was able to attack submarines, damaging several of them (perhaps six in total) and contributing to the destruction of two others. The aircraft had no advanced detection systems, only [[depth charge]]s.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\nGenerally the aircraft's main task was search and rescue missions, and perhaps because of this it was called ''Mammaiuto'' (which means \"Mamma help me!\" in Italian). Another theory is that it earned the nickname because it was helpless against enemy aircraft. Even its sea capabilities were poor, and often the Z.501 needed to be helped by ships. As for its flying qualities, it was too slow, unmanoeuvrable, and under-armed to put up a defence against enemy fighters. As a result, many were shot down.<ref name=Marcon/>\n\n==Military operators==\n;{{flag|Kingdom of Italy}}\n*[[Regia Aeronautica]]\n*[[Aviazione Legionaria]] operated 9 aircraft\n*[[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]]\n*[[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]]\n;{{ITA}}\n*[[Italian Air Force]] operated few aircraft until 1948<ref>[http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/italy/af/ital-af2-all-time.htm aeroflight]</ref>\n;{{flag|Spain|1945}}\n*[[Spanish Air Force]]\n;{{flagcountry|Kingdom of Romania}}\n*[[Royal Romanian Naval Aviation]] (12 purchased in 1941)\n\n==Specifications (Z.501)==\n\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II,<ref name='wwii'>{{cite book |editor1-last=Bishop |editor1-first=Chris |title=The encyclopedia of weapons of World War II |date=1998 |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |location=New York |isbn=0-7607-1022-8}}</ref> Italian Civil and Military Aircraft 1930\u20131945<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Jonathon W. |title=Italian Civil and Military Aircraft 1930\u20131945 |year=1963 |publisher=Aero Publishers Inc. |location=USA |isbn=0-8168-6500-0|pages=52\u201354}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=4-5\n|length m=14.3\n|length note=\n|span m=22.5\n|span note=\n|height m=4.4\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=667.4\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=3850\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=7050\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=[[Isotta Fraschini Asso XI R.2C.15]]\n|eng1 type=\n|eng1 kw=656\n|eng1 note=\n\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=metal propeller\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia note=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|max speed kmh=275\n|max speed note=at {{cvt|8200|ft|0|order=flip}}\n|max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft -->\n|cruise speed kmh=240\n|cruise speed note=at {{cvt|6560|ft|0|order=flip}}\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=999\n|range note=\n|combat range km=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=2398\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude={{cvt|131200|ft|0|order=flip}} in 16 minutes\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=<!--</br>\n*'''Take-off run:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n*'''Take-off run to {{cvt|15|m|0}}:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n*'''Landing run:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n*'''Landing run from {{cvt|15|m|0}}:''' {{cvt||m|0}}-->\n<!--\n        Armament\n-->\n|guns=3 \u00d7 7.7 mm (0.303 in) [[Breda-SAFAT machine gun]]s (initially Vickers), but many had only two when the nose position was removed\n|bombs=640 kg (1,400 lb) carried externally\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Aircontent\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=\n* [[Aichi H9A]]\n* [[Beriev Be-4]]\n* [[Dornier Do 18]]\n* [[Fairchild 91]]\n* [[Saunders-Roe A.36 Lerwick]]\n|see also=\n |lists=\n* [[List of aircraft of World War II]]\n* [[List of Interwar military aircraft]]\n* [[List of Regia Aeronautica aircraft used in World War II]]\n* [[List of seaplanes and amphibious aircraft]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* Angelucci, Enzo and Paolo Matricardi.

Al-Q\u0101dir continued to give stiff resistance in the west.  Finally driven into [[Morocco]] in 1842 by large-scale and heavy-handed French military action, he continued to wage a guerilla war until Morocco, under French diplomatic pressure following its defeat in the [[First Franco-Moroccan War]], drove him out of Morocco.

The [[First Franco-Moroccan War]] took place in 1844, as a consequence of Morocco's alliance with [[Algeria]]'s [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd-El-Kader]] against [[France]].

They wanted to cut all ties to the numerous colonies in French [[sub-Saharan Africa]].   During the war, de Gaulle had successfully based his Free France movement and the African colonies. After a visit in 1958, he made a commitment to make sub-Saharan French Africa a major component of his foreign-policy.<ref>Julian Jackson, ''De Gaulle'' (2018), pp 490\u201393, 525, 609\u2013615.</ref>  All the colonies in 1958, except [[Guinea]], voted to remain in the French Community, with representation in Parliament  and a guarantee of French aid.

The French colonial system had always been based primarily on local leadership, in sharp contrast to the situation in British colonies. The French colonial goal had been to assimilate the natives into mainstream French culture, with a strong emphasis on the French language. From de Gaulle's point of view, close association gave legitimacy to his visions of global client grandeur, certified his humanitarian credentials, provided access to oil, uranium and other minerals, and provided a small but steady market for French manufacturers. Above all it guaranteed the vitality of French language and culture in a large slice of  the world that was rapidly growing in population. De Gaulle's successors [[Georges Pompidou]] (1959\u201374) and  [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] (1974\u20131981) continued de Gaulle's African policy. It was supported with French military units, and a large naval presence in the Indian Ocean. Over 260,000 Frenchmen worked in Africa, focused especially on delivering oil supplies. There was some effort to build up oil refineries and aluminum smelters, but little effort to develop small-scale local industry, which the French wanted to monopolize for the mainland. [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Gabon]], and [[Cameroon]] were the largest and most reliable African allies, and received most of the investments. <ref>John R.

In practice, nearly all the colonies became independent in the late 1950s, but maintained very strong connections.<ref>Patrick Manning, ''Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa 1880\u20131995'' (1999) pp 137\u201341, 149\u201350, 158\u201362.</ref> Under close supervision from the president, French advisors played a major role in civil and military affairs, thwarted coups, and, occasionally, replaced upstart local leaders. The French colonial system had always been based primarily on local leadership, in sharp contrast to the situation in British colonies. The French colonial goal had been to assimilate the natives into mainstream French culture, with a strong emphasis on the French language. From de Gaulle's point of view, close association gave legitimacy to his visions of global client grandeur, certified his humanitarian credentials, provided access to oil, uranium and other minerals, and provided a small but steady market for French manufacturers. Above all it guaranteed the vitality of French language and culture in a large slice of  the world that was rapidly growing in population. De Gaulle's successors [[Georges Pompidou]] (1959\u201374) and  [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] (1974\u20131981) continued de Gaulle's African policy. It was supported with French military units, and a large naval presence in the Indian Ocean. Over 260,000 Frenchmen worked in Africa, focused especially on delivering oil supplies. There was some effort to build up oil refineries and aluminum smelters, but little effort to develop small-scale local industry, which the French wanted to monopolize for the mainland. [[Senegal]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Gabon]], and [[Cameroon]] were the largest and most reliable African allies, and received most of the investments. <ref>John R. Frears, ''France in the Giscard Presidency'' (1981) pp 109\u2013127.</ref> During the Nigerian Civil War (1967\u20131970), France supported breakaway [[Biafra]], but only on a limited scale, providing mercenaries and  obsolete weaponry.  De Gaulle's goals were to protect its nearby ex-colonies from Nigeria, to stop Soviet advances, and to acquire a foothold in the oil-rich Niger delta.<ref> Christopher Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War, 1967\u20131970.\" ''Small Wars & Insurgencies'' 26.1 (2015): 114\u2013135.</ref>\n==Mitterrand: 1981\u20131996==\n\n{{main|Foreign policy of the Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand administration}}\nSocialist rhetoric had long attacked the imperialistic program of the French overseas empire, and his continuity in Francophone Africa after those states gained independence.
