The later period (1817\u20131835) witnessed a peaceful consolidation of political power of the increasingly autonomous Serbia, culminating in the recognition of the right to hereditary rule by [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian princes]] in 1830 and 1833 and the territorial expansion of the young monarchy.<ref name=\"Mitev2010\">{{cite book|author=Plamen Mitev|title=Empires and Peninsulas: Southeastern Europe Between Karlowitz and the Peace of Adrianople, 1699\u20131829|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz7pbGvCqhwC&pg=PA147|year=2010|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=978-3-643-10611-7|pages=147\u2013}}</ref> The adoption of the first written [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]] in 1835 abolished [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ius.bg.ac.rs/Anali/A2010-1/abstract2010-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306131543/http://www.ius.bg.ac.rs/Anali/A2010-1/abstract2010-1.htm |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref> and made the country [[suzerainty|suzerain]].<ref name=Mitev2010/> The term ''Serbian Revolution'' was coined by a German academic historiographer, [[Leopold von Ranke]], in his book ''Die Serbische Revolution'', published in 1829.<ref>English translation: Leopold Ranke, A History of Serbia and the Serbian Revolution. Translated from the German by Mrs Alexander Kerr (London: John Murray, 1847)</ref> These events marked the foundation of [[Principality of Serbia|modern Serbia]].<ref>L. S. Stavrianos, The Balkans since 1453 (London: Hurst and Co., 2000), pp. 248\u2013250.</ref>\n\nThe period is further divided as follows:\n*[[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), led by [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]]\n*[[Had\u017ei Prodanova buna|Had\u017ei Prodan's revolt]] (1814)\n*[[Second Serbian Uprising]] (1815\u201317), led by [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]]\n* Official recognition of the Serbian state (1815\u20131833)\n\n''The Proclamation'' (1809) by [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] in the capital [[Belgrade]] probably represented the apex of the first phase. It called for national unity, drawing on [[History of the Serbs|Serbian history]] to demand the [[freedom of religion]] and formal, written [[rule of law]], both of which the Ottoman Empire had failed to provide. It also called on [[Serbs]] to stop paying [[tax]]es to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], deemed unfair as based on religious affiliation. Apart from dispensing with a poll tax on non-Muslims ([[jizya]]), the revolutionaries also abolished all [[ziamet|feudal]] obligations in 1806, only 15 years after the [[French Revolution]], peasant and serf emancipation thus representing a major social break with the past. The rule of Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 consolidated the achievements of the Uprisings, leading to the proclamation of the [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107|first constitution in the Balkans]] and the establishment of the first Serbian institution of higher learning still in existence, the [[University of Belgrade|Great Academy of Belgrade]] (1808). In 1830 and again in 1833, Serbia was recognized as an autonomous principality, with hereditary princes paying an annual tribute to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. Finally, ''de facto'' independence came in 1867, with the withdrawal of Ottoman garrisons from the Principality; ''de jure'' independence was formally recognized at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Sanjak of Smederevo|Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)|Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)}}\n\nNew circumstances, such as the [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Austrian occupation of Serbia]], the rise of the Serbian elite across the [[Danube]], [[Illyrian provinces|Napoleon's conquests in the Balkans]], and reforms in the Russian Empire, exposed Serbs to new ideas. They could now clearly compare how their compatriots made progress in Christian Austria, the [[Illyrian provinces]] and elsewhere, while the Ottoman Serbs were still subjected to a religion-based tax that treated them as second class citizens.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Austrian occupation of Serbia]] (1788\u201391), many Serbs served as soldiers and officers in Habsburg armies, where they acquired knowledge about military tactics, organization, and weapons. Others were employed in administrative offices in Hungary or the occupied zone. They began to travel in search of trade and education, and were exposed to European ideas about secular society, politics, law, and philosophy, including both [[rationalism]] and [[Romanticism]]. They met with the values of the [[French Revolution]], which would affect many Serbian merchants and educated people. There was an active Serbian community in the southern [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], from where ideas made their way southwards (across the Danube). Another role model was the Russian Empire, the only independent Slavic and Orthodox country, which had recently reformed itself and was now a serious menace to the Turks. The Russian experience implied hope for Serbia.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nOther Serbian thinkers found strengths in the Serbian nation itself. Two top Serbian scholars were influenced by Western learning to turn their attention to Serbia's language and literature. One was [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]] (1743), a former priest who left for Western Europe. Disappointed that his people had so little secular literature which was mainly written not in the vernacular but either in [[Old Church Slavonic]] or in newly emerging Russo-Serbian hybrid language called [[Slavo-Serbian]], he decided to bring written communication closer to vernacular Serbian language ordinary people spoke and thus assembled grammars and dictionaries, wrote some books himself and translated others. Others followed his lead and revived tales of Serbia's medieval glory. He later became the first Minister of Education of modern Serbia (1805).\n\nThe second figure was [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] (1787). Vuk was less influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism like Dositej Obradovi\u0107 and more by [[Romanticism]], which romanticized rural and peasant communities. Vuk collected and published Serbian epic poetry, work that helped to build Serbian awareness of a collective identity-based in shared customs and shared history. This kind of linguistic and cultural self-awareness was a central feature of German nationalism in this period, and Serbian intellectuals now applied the same ideas to the Balkans.\n\n==First Serbian Uprising (1804\u20131813)==\n{{see also|First Serbian Uprising|}}\n [[File:Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, by Vladimir Borovikovsky, 1816.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]] (''Black George'') leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]]]]\n\nDuring the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u20131813), Serbia perceived itself as an independent state for the first time after 300 years of [[History of Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman]] and short-lasting [[Treaty of Belgrade|Austrian]] occupations. Encouraged by the Russian Empire, the demands for self-government within the Ottoman Empire in 1804 evolved into a war of independence by 1807. Combining patriarchal peasant democracy with common national goals, the Serbian revolution was attracting thousands of volunteers among the Serbs from across the [[Balkans]] and Central Europe. The Serbian Revolution ultimately became a symbol of the nation-building process in the Balkans, provoking peasant unrest among the Christians in both Greece and [[Bulgaria]]. Following a successful siege with 25,000 men, on January 8 1807, the charismatic leader of the revolt, [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]], proclaimed Belgrade the capital of [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]].\n\n[[File:Serbia1809.png|thumb|200px|Revolutionary Serbia in 1809]]\n[[File:Serbia1813.png|thumb|200px|Revolutionary Serbia in 1813]]\n\nSerbs responded to [[Massacre of Serbian knights|Ottoman brutalities]] by establishing separate institutions: [[Government of Serbia|Governing Council]] (Praviteljstvuju\u0161\u010di Sovjet), the [[Belgrade University|Great Academy]] (Velika \u0161kola), the Theological Academy (Bogoslovija) and other administrative bodies. Kara\u0111or\u0111e and other revolutionary leaders sent their children to the Great Academy, which had among its students [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] (1787\u20131864), the reformer of the [[Serbian alphabet]]. Belgrade was repopulated by local military leaders, merchants, and artisans, but also by an essential group of enlightened Serbs from the Habsburg Empire who gave a new cultural and political framework to the egalitarian peasant Society of Serbia. [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]], a prominent figure of the Balkan [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the founder of the Great Academy, became the first [[Ministry of Education and Sports (Serbia)|Minister of Education of Serbia]] in 1811.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]] (May 1812) and [[French invasion of Russia|French invasion]] of Russia in June 1812, the Russian Empire withdrew its support for the Serb rebels; unwilling to accept anything less than [[independence]], a quarter of Serbia's population (at the moment around 100,000 people) were exiled into Habsburg Empire, including the leader of the Uprising, [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]].<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://staff.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lecture5.html|title=The Serbian Revolution and the Serbian State|website=staff.lib.msu.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010154406/http://staff.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lecture5.html|archivedate=10 October 2017}}</ref> Recaptured by the Ottomans in October 1813, Belgrade became a scene of brutal revenge, with hundreds of its citizens [[wikt:massacre|massacre]]d and thousands sold into slavery as far as Asia. Direct Ottoman rule also meant the [[University of Belgrade|abolition of all Serbian institutions]] and the return of Ottoman Turks to Serbia.\n\n===Had\u017ei-Prodan's Revolt (1814)===\n{{see also|Had\u017ei Prodanova buna}}\n\n[[File:Had\u017ei-Prodan vojvoda.jpg|thumb|Had\u017ei-Prodan]]\n\nDespite the lost battle, tensions nevertheless persisted. In 1814 an unsuccessful ''Had\u017ei Prodan's revolt'' was launched by Had\u017ei Prodan Gligorijevi\u0107, one of the veterans of the First Serbian Uprising. He knew the Turks would arrest him, so he decided to resist them. Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, another veteran, felt the time was not right for an uprising and did not provide assistance.\n\nHad\u017ei Prodan's Uprising soon failed, and he fled to Austria. After a riot at a Turkish estate in 1814, the Turkish authorities massacred the local population and publicly impaled 200 prisoners at Belgrade.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/> By March 1815, Serbs had held several meetings and decided upon a new revolt.\n\n==Second Serbian Uprising (1815\u20131817)==\n{{see also|Second Serbian Uprising|}}\n[[File:Knez Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]], leader of the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] and the first\n[[Prince of Serbia]]]]\n\nThe [[Second Serbian Uprising]] (1815\u20131817) was a second phase of the national revolution of the Serbs against the Ottoman Empire, which erupted shortly after the brutal annexation of the country to the Ottoman Empire and the failed Had\u017ei Prodan's revolt. The revolutionary council proclaimed an uprising in [[Takovo]] on April 23, 1815, with Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 chosen as the leader (while Kara\u0111or\u0111e was still in exile in Austria). \nThe decision of the Serb leaders was based on two reasons. First, they feared a general massacre of knezes. Secondly, they learned that Kara\u0111or\u0111e was planning to return from exile in Russia. The anti-Kara\u0111or\u0111e faction, including Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, was anxious to forestall Kara\u0111or\u0111e and keep him out of power.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\n[[File:Serbia1817.png|thumb|[[Principality of Serbia]] in 1817]]\n\nFighting resumed at Easter in 1815, and Milo\u0161 became the supreme leader of the new revolt. When the Ottomans discovered this, they sentenced all of its leaders to death. The Serbs fought in battles at Ljubic, \u010ca\u010dak, Palez, Po\u017earevac, and Dublje and managed to reconquer the [[Pashaluk of Belgrade]].\nMilo\u0161 advocated a policy of ''restraint'':<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/> captured Ottoman soldiers were not killed, and civilians were released. His announced goal was not independence put an end to abusive misrule.\n\nWider [[Congress of Vienna|European events]] now helped the [[Principality of Serbia|Serbian]] cause. Political and diplomatic means in negotiations between the [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107|Prince of Serbia]] and the [[Ottoman Porte]], instead of further war clashes coincided with the political rules within the framework of [[Metternich]]'s Europe. [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107|Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]], an astute politician and able [[diplomat]], to confirm his hard-won loyalty to the Porte in 1817 ordered the assassination of [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]]. The final defeat of Napoleon in 1815 raised Turkish fears that Russia might again intervene in the [[Balkans]]. To avoid this, the sultan agreed to make Serbia a [[suzerainty|vassal state]], semi-independent but nominally responsible to the Porte.\n\n==Legal status of Serbia (1815\u201330)==\n [[File:The Constitution of 1835.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Constitution of 15 February 1835.]]\nIn mid-1815, the first negotiations began between Obrenovi\u0107 and Marashli Ali Pasha, the Ottoman governor. The result was the acknowledgment of a [[Principality of Serbia|Serbian Principality]] by the Ottoman Empire. Although a [[vassal state]] of the Porte (yearly tax tribute), it was, in most respects, an independent state. By 1817, Obrenovi\u0107 succeeded in forcing Marashli Ali Pasha to negotiate an unwritten agreement, thus ending the [[Second Serbian Uprising]]. The same year, Kara\u0111or\u0111e, the leader of the First Uprising (and Obrenovi\u0107's rival for the throne) returned to Serbia and was assassinated by Obrenovi\u0107's orders; Obrenovi\u0107 subsequently received the title of ''Prince of Serbia''.\n\nDuring the ''intermezzo period'' (\"virtual autonomy\" \u2013 the negotiation process between Belgrade and Constantinople 1817\u20131830) Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I]] secured a gradual but effective reduction of Turkish power and Serbian institutions inevitably filled the vacuum. Despite opposition from the Porte, Milo\u0161 created the Serbian army, transferred properties to the young Serbian [[bourgeoisie]] and passed the \"homestead laws\" which protected peasants from usurers and bankruptcies.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nThe new school curriculum and the re-establishment of the Serbian Orthodox Church reflected the Serbian national interest. Unlike the Serbian medieval tradition, Prince Milo\u0161 separated education from religion, because he could oppose the Church through independent education (secularism) more easily. By that time the Great Academy in Belgrade had been in operation for decades (since 1808).<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nThe [[Akkerman Convention]] (1828), the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (1829) and finally, the [[Hatt-i Sharif]] (1830), formally recognized the [[Principality of Serbia]] as a [[vassal state]] with [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I]] as its hereditary Prince.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Serbia}}\n*[[Timeline of the Serbian Revolution]]\n*[[Principality of Serbia]]\n*[[Military history of Serbia]]\n*[[List of Serbian\u2013Ottoman conflicts]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

The later period (1817\u20131835) witnessed a peaceful consolidation of political power of the increasingly autonomous Serbia, culminating in the recognition of the right to hereditary rule by [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian princes]] in 1830 and 1833 and the territorial expansion of the young monarchy.<ref name=\"Mitev2010\">{{cite book|author=Plamen Mitev|title=Empires and Peninsulas: Southeastern Europe Between Karlowitz and the Peace of Adrianople, 1699\u20131829|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz7pbGvCqhwC&pg=PA147|year=2010|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=978-3-643-10611-7|pages=147\u2013}}</ref> The adoption of the first written [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]] in 1835 abolished [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ius.bg.ac.rs/Anali/A2010-1/abstract2010-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306131543/http://www.ius.bg.ac.rs/Anali/A2010-1/abstract2010-1.htm |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref> and made the country [[suzerainty|suzerain]].<ref name=Mitev2010/> The term ''Serbian Revolution'' was coined by a German academic historiographer, [[Leopold von Ranke]], in his book ''Die Serbische Revolution'', published in 1829.<ref>English translation: Leopold Ranke, A History of Serbia and the Serbian Revolution.

Stavrianos, The Balkans since 1453 (London: Hurst and Co., 2000), pp. 248\u2013250.</ref>\n\nThe period is further divided as follows:\n*[[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), led by [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]]\n*[[Had\u017ei Prodanova buna|Had\u017ei Prodan's revolt]] (1814)\n*[[Second Serbian Uprising]] (1815\u201317), led by [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]]\n* Official recognition of the Serbian state (1815\u20131833)\n\n''The Proclamation'' (1809) by [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] in the capital [[Belgrade]] probably represented the apex of the first phase. It called for national unity, drawing on [[History of the Serbs|Serbian history]] to demand the [[freedom of religion]] and formal, written [[rule of law]], both of which the Ottoman Empire had failed to provide. It also called on [[Serbs]] to stop paying [[tax]]es to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], deemed unfair as based on religious affiliation. Apart from dispensing with poll tax on non-Muslims ([[jizya]]), the revolutionaries also abolished all [[ziamet|feudal]] obligations in 1806, only 15 years after the [[French revolution]], peasant and serf emancipation thus representing a major social break with the past. The rule of Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 consolidated the achievements of the Uprisings, leading to the proclamation of the [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107|first constitution in the Balkans]] and the establishment of the first Serbian institution of higher learning still in existence, the [[University of Belgrade|Great Academy of Belgrade]] (1808). In 1830 and again in 1833, Serbia was recognized as an autonomous principality, with hereditary princes paying annual tribute to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. Finally, ''de facto'' independence came in 1867, with the withdrawal of Ottoman garrisons from the principality; ''de jure'' independence was formally recognized at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Sanjak of Smederevo|Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)|Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)}}\n\nNew circumstances, such as the [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Austrian occupation of Serbia]], rise of the Serbian elite across the [[Danube]], [[Illyrian provinces|Napoleon's conquests in the Balkans]], and reforms in the Russian Empire, exposed Serbs to new ideas. They could now clearly compare how their compatriots made progress in Christian Austria, the [[Illyrian provinces]] and elsewhere, while the Ottoman Serbs were still subjects to a religion-based tax that treated them as second class citizens.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Austrian occupation of Serbia]] (1788\u201391), many Serbs served as soldiers and officers in Habsburg armies, where they acquired knowledge about military tactics, organization and weapons. Others were employed in administrative offices in Hungary or in the occupied zone. They began to travel in search of trade and education, and were exposed to European ideas about secular society, politics, law and philosophy, including both [[rationalism]] and [[Romanticism]]. They met with the values of the [[French Revolution]], which would affect many Serbian merchants and educated people. There was an active Serbian community in the southern [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], from where ideas made their way southwards (across the Danube). Another role model was the Russian Empire, the only independent Slavic and Orthodox country, which had recently reformed itself and was now a serious menace to the Turks. The Russian experience implied hope for Serbia.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nOther Serbian thinkers found strengths in the Serbian nation itself. Two top Serbian scholars were influenced by Western learning to turn their attention to Serbia's own language and literature. One was [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]] (1743), a former priest who left for Western Europe. Disappointed that his people had so little secular literature which was mainly written not in the vernacular but either in [[Old Church Slavonic]] or in newly emerging Russo-Serbian hybrid language called [[Slavo-Serbian]], he decided to bring written language closer to vernacular Serbian language common people spoke and thus assembled grammars and dictionaries, wrote some books himself and translated others. Others followed his lead and revived tales of Serbia's medieval glory. He later became the first Minister of Education of modern Serbia (1805).\n\nThe second figure was [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] (1787). Vuk was less influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism like Dositej Obradovi\u0107  and more by [[Romanticism]], which romanticized rural and peasant communities. Vuk collected and published Serbian epic poetry, work that helped to build Serbian awareness of a common identity based in shared customs and shared history. This kind of linguistic and cultural self-awareness was a central feature of German nationalism in this period, and Serbian intellectuals now applied the same ideas to the Balkans.\n\n==First Serbian Uprising (1804\u20131813)==\n{{see also|First Serbian Uprising|}}\n [[File:Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, by Vladimir Borovikovsky, 1816.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]] (''Black George'') leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]]]]\n\nDuring the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u20131813), Serbia perceived itself as an independent state for the first time after 300 years of [[History of Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman]] and short-lasting [[Treaty of Belgrade|Austrian]] occupations. Encouraged by the Russian Empire, the demands for self-government within the Ottoman Empire in 1804 evolved into a war of independence by 1807. Combining patriarchal peasant democracy with modern national goals the Serbian revolution was attracting thousands of volunteers among the Serbs from across the [[Balkans]] and Central Europe. The Serbian Revolution ultimately became a symbol of the nation-building process in the Balkans, provoking peasant unrest among the Christians in both Greece and [[Bulgaria]]. Following a successful siege with 25,000 men, on 8 January 1807 the charismatic leader of the revolt, [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]], proclaimed Belgrade the capital of [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]].\n\n[[File:Serbia1809.png|thumb|200px|Revolutionary Serbia in 1809]]\n[[File:Serbia1813.png|thumb|200px|Revolutionary Serbia in 1813]]\n\nSerbs responded to [[Massacre of Serbian knights|Ottoman brutalities]] by establishing separate institutions: [[Government of Serbia|Governing Council]] (Praviteljstvuju\u0161\u010di Sovjet), the [[Belgrade University|Great Academy]] (Velika \u0161kola), the Theological Academy (Bogoslovija) and other administrative bodies. Kara\u0111or\u0111e and other revolutionary leaders sent their children to the Great Academy, which had among its students [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] (1787\u20131864), the reformer of the [[Serbian alphabet]]. Belgrade was repopulated by local military leaders, merchants and craftsmen, but also by an important group of enlightened Serbs from the Habsburg Empire who gave a new cultural and political framework to the egalitarian peasant society of Serbia. [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]], a prominent figure of the Balkan [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the founder of the Great Academy, became the first [[Ministry of Education and Sports (Serbia)|Minister of Education of Serbia]] in 1811.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]] (May 1812) and [[French invasion of Russia|French invasion]] of Russia in June 1812, the Russian Empire withdrew its support for the Serb rebels; unwilling to accept anything less than [[independence]], a quarter of Serbia's population (at the moment around 100,000 people) were exiled into Habsburg Empire, including the leader of the Uprising, [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]].<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://staff.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lecture5.html|title=The Serbian Revolution and the Serbian State|website=staff.lib.msu.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010154406/http://staff.lib.msu.edu/sowards/balkan/lecture5.html|archivedate=10 October 2017}}</ref> Recaptured by the Ottomans in October 1813, Belgrade became a scene of brutal revenge, with hundreds of its citizens [[wikt:massacre|massacre]]d and thousands sold into slavery as far as Asia. Direct Ottoman rule also meant the [[University of Belgrade|abolition of all Serbian institutions]] and the return of Ottoman Turks to Serbia.\n\n===Had\u017ei-Prodan's Revolt (1814)===\n{{see also|Had\u017ei Prodanova buna}}\n\n[[File:Had\u017ei-Prodan vojvoda.jpg|thumb|Had\u017ei-Prodan]]\n\nDespite the lost battle, tensions nevertheless persisted. In 1814 an unsuccessful ''Had\u017ei Prodan's revolt'' was launched by Had\u017ei Prodan Gligorijevi\u0107, one of the veterans of the First Serbian Uprising. He knew the Turks would arrest him, so he decided to resist them. Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, another veteran, felt the time was not right for an uprising and did not provide assistance.\n\nHad\u017ei Prodan's Uprising soon failed and he fled to Austria. After a riot at a Turkish estate in 1814, the Turkish authorities massacred the local population and publicly impaled 200 prisoners at Belgrade.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/> By March 1815, Serbs had held several meetings and decided upon a new revolt.\n\n==Second Serbian Uprising (1815\u20131817)==\n{{see also|Second Serbian Uprising|}}\n[[File:Knez Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]], leader of the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] and the first\n[[Prince of Serbia]]]]\n\nThe [[Second Serbian Uprising]] (1815\u20131817) was a second phase of the national revolution of the Serbs against the Ottoman Empire, which erupted shortly after the brutal annexation of the country to the Ottoman Empire and the failed Had\u017ei Prodan's revolt. The revolutionary council proclaimed an uprising in [[Takovo]] on April 23, 1815, with Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 chosen as the leader (while Kara\u0111or\u0111e was still in exile in Austria). \nThe decision of the Serb leaders was based on two reasons. First, they feared a general massacre of knezes. Secondly, they learned that Kara\u0111or\u0111e was planning to return from exile in Russia. The anti-Kara\u0111or\u0111e faction, including Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, was anxious to forestall Kara\u0111or\u0111e and keep him out of power.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\n[[File:Serbia1817.png|thumb|[[Principality of Serbia]] in 1817]]\n\nFighting resumed at Easter in 1815, and Milo\u0161 became supreme leader of the new revolt. When the Ottomans discovered this they sentenced all of its leaders to death. The Serbs fought in battles at Ljubic, \u010ca\u010dak, Palez, Po\u017earevac and Dublje and managed to reconquer the [[Pashaluk of Belgrade]].\nMilo\u0161 advocated a policy of ''restraint'':<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/> captured Ottoman soldiers were not killed and civilians were released. His announced goal was not independence but an end to abusive misrule.\n\nWider [[Congress of Vienna|European events]] now helped the [[Principality of Serbia|Serbian]] cause. Political and diplomatic means in negotiations between the [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107|Prince of Serbia]] and the [[Ottoman Porte]], instead of further war clashes coincided with the political rules within the framework of [[Metternich]]'s Europe. [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107|Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]], an astute politician and able [[diplomat]], in order to confirm his hard won loyalty to the Porte in 1817 ordered the assassination of [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107]]. The final defeat of Napoleon in 1815 raised Turkish fears that Russia might again intervene in the [[Balkans]]. To avoid this the sultan agreed to make Serbia a [[suzerainty|vassal state]], semi-independent but nominally responsible to the Porte.\n\n==Legal status of Serbia (1815\u201330)==\n [[File:The Constitution of 1835.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Constitution of 15 February 1835.]]\nIn mid-1815, the first negotiations began between Obrenovi\u0107 and Marashli Ali Pasha, the Ottoman governor. The result was acknowledgment of a [[Principality of Serbia|Serbian Principality]] by the Ottoman Empire. Although a [[vassal state]] of the Porte (yearly tax tribute), it was, in most respects, an independent state. By 1817, Obrenovi\u0107 succeeded in forcing Marashli Ali Pasha to negotiate an unwritten agreement, thus ending the [[Second Serbian uprising]]. The same year, Kara\u0111or\u0111e, the leader of the First Uprising (and Obrenovi\u0107's rival for the throne) returned to Serbia and was assassinated by Obrenovi\u0107's orders; Obrenovi\u0107 subsequently received the title of ''Prince of Serbia''.\n\nDuring the ''intermezzo period'' (\"virtual autonomy\" \u2013 the negotiation process between Belgrade and Constantinople 1817\u20131830) Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I]] secured a gradual but effective reduction of Turkish power and Serbian institutions inevitably filled the vacuum. Despite opposition from the Porte, Milo\u0161 created the Serbian army, transferred properties to the young Serbian [[bourgeoisie]] and passed the \"homestead laws\" which protected peasants from usurers and bankruptcies.<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nNew school curriculum and the re-establishment of the Serbian Orthodox Church reflected the Serbian national interest. Unlike the Serbian medieval tradition, Prince Milo\u0161 separated education from religion, on the grounds that he could oppose the Church through independent education (secularism) more easily. By that time the Great Academy in Belgrade had been in operation for decades (since 1808).<ref name=\"staff.lib.msu.edu\"/>\n\nThe [[Akkerman Convention]] (1828), the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (1829) and finally, the [[Hatt-i Sharif]] (1830), formally recognized the [[Principality of Serbia]] as a [[vassal state]] with [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I]] as its hereditary Prince.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Serbia}}\n*[[Timeline of the Serbian Revolution]]\n*[[Principality of Serbia]]\n*[[Military history of Serbia]]\n*[[List of Serbian\u2013Ottoman conflicts]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

The airport is run by Aeropuertos Dominicanos Siglo XXI (AERODOM), a private corporation based in the Dominican Republic under a 25-year concession to [[Build\u2013operate\u2013transfer|build, operate, and transfer]] (BOT) six of the country's airports. Las Am\u00e9ricas usually receives a wide variety of long-, mid- and short-haul aircraft.\n\nThe airport is the second-busiest in the country, after [[Punta Cana International Airport]], and one of the largest in the Caribbean, handling 3.5 million passengers in 2015 through its air terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo/|title=BCRD - Estad\u00edsticas Econ\u00f3micas|website=www.bancentral.gov.do|access-date=2016-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203221506/http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo|archive-date=2017-02-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> And is also the busiest cargo hub in the Caribbean and Central America with 205,000,000 lbs of cargo transported in 2019\n\n== History ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport opened in 1959 as the official airport of [[Santo Domingo]]. The official name of the airport was changed in 2002 to \"Aeropuerto Internacional Las Am\u00e9ricas- Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez (AIJFPG)\" but is most commonly referred to as \"Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport\", or locally, \"Las Am\u00e9ricas Airport\" or \"El Aeropuerto\".\n\nUp until January 2020, the airport operates on private land which hasn't been paid to the original owners, the current administration has been plague with multiple lawsuits, with the lower courts siding with the land owners, the case is currently in the Supreme Court\n\nOn February 15, 1970, a [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]] [[DC-9]] that was flying to [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], crashed, killing all 102 persons on board (see: [[Dominicana DC-9 air disaster]]).\n\n''Las Am\u00e9ricas'' was the hub for [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]], [[APA Dominicana International]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[PAWA Dominicana]], and a number of other, smaller airlines. Currently [[Servicios A\u00e9reos Profesionales|SAP Air]] is based there.\n\nLas Am\u00e9ricas also has served as a hub for airlines such as [[Aeromar L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Dominicanas]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[Aero Continente Dominicana]] and [[Queen Air]].\n[[File:Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport (14688446824).jpg|thumb|Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport terminal exterior]]\nRecently, the expressway leading from Santo Domingo to the airport (roughly 20&nbsp;km east of the city center) was expanded and modernised. The airport was also modernised, and two more terminals were added, including 20 more gates. The new expressway crosses a new [[suspension bridge]] which spans the [[Ozama River]], connecting traffic into the city's Elevated Freeway and Tunnel system onto the city's main street, Av. 27 de Febrero. A more scenic route following the coastal shore provides beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea and of the city. This secondary road crosses the Ozama River by means of a floating bridge, connecting traffic onto the Av. George Washington (el Malec\u00f3n) which leads into the heart of the colonial city.\n\n== Addition of northern terminal ==\nOn 18 April 2007, a new terminal was completed and opened for operations. It can accommodate four [[Boeing 747]]s simultaneously. This new terminal has four gates with boarding bridges, an air-conditioning system, and maintenance facilities for aircraft.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Runway ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport's runway direction is north\u2013south (designated 17\u201335). This runway is the largest in the country, and one of the largest in the Caribbean. With a length of 3,355&nbsp;m, it is able to support a [[Boeing 747]]. The runway of SDQ was last renovated in June 2008. The old taxi-way was also renovated and converted into a full runway while the old runway was being renovated, then it was converted back into a taxiway after the normal runway was finished. The runway accommodated the [[Antonov An-225]] to supply goods after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |title=Antonov-225 Delivered Humanitarian Aids to Japan |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |archivedate=2018-04-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |title=AN-225 Mriya / Super Heavy Transport |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |archivedate=2018-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n== Concourses ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas has five gates on the main satellite concourse (A), A2 through A6. Other gate facilities are for the flights departing from a parking in the taxiway. back in the 1960s and 70s the airport used to be much smaller, The original building was half the size of today's newest structure but with a still modern look.\n\nConcourse B has four gates (B1 through B4) and remote stand (P8). Terminal&nbsp;B now features a co-branded [[United Club|Copa Club]] operated jointly by [[United Airlines]] and [[Copa Airlines]], and a Private Lounge exclusive to members and business people.\n\nThe average number of daily flights in and out of Las Am\u00e9ricas ranges between 68 and 84 flights.

The airport is run by Aeropuertos Dominicanos Siglo XXI (AERODOM), a private corporation based in the Dominican Republic under a 25-year concession to [[Build\u2013operate\u2013transfer|build, operate, and transfer]] (BOT) six of the country's airports. Las Am\u00e9ricas usually receives a wide variety of long-, mid- and short-haul aircraft.\n\nThe airport is the second-busiest in the country, after [[Punta Cana International Airport]], and one of the largest in the Caribbean, handling 3.5 million passengers in 2015 through its air terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo/|title=BCRD - Estad\u00edsticas Econ\u00f3micas|website=www.bancentral.gov.do|access-date=2016-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203221506/http://www.bancentral.gov.do/estadisticas_economicas/turismo|archive-date=2017-02-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport opened in 1959 as the official airport of [[Santo Domingo]]. The official name of the airport was changed in 2002 to \"Aeropuerto Internacional Las Am\u00e9ricas- Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez (AIJFPG)\" but is most commonly referred to as \"Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport\", or locally, \"Las Am\u00e9ricas Airport\" or \"El Aeropuerto\".\n\nUp until January 2020, the airport operates on private land which hasn't been paid to the original owners, the current administration has been plague with multiple lawsuits, with the lower courts siding with the land owners, the case is currently in the Supreme Court\n\nOn February 15, 1970, a [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]] [[DC-9]] that was flying to [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], crashed, killing all 102 persons on board (see: [[Dominicana DC-9 air disaster]]).\n\n''Las Am\u00e9ricas'' was the hub for [[Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n]], [[APA Dominicana International]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[PAWA Dominicana]], and a number of other, smaller airlines. Currently [[Servicios A\u00e9reos Profesionales|SAP Air]] is based there.\n\nLas Am\u00e9ricas also has served as a hub for airlines such as [[Aeromar L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Dominicanas]], [[Air Santo Domingo]], [[Aero Continente Dominicana]] and [[Queen Air]].\n[[File:Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport (14688446824).jpg|thumb|Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport terminal exterior]]\nRecently, the expressway leading from Santo Domingo to the airport (roughly 20&nbsp;km east of the city center) was expanded and modernised. The airport was also modernised, and two more terminals were added, including 20 more gates. The new expressway crosses a new [[suspension bridge]] which spans the [[Ozama River]], connecting traffic into the city's Elevated Freeway and Tunnel system onto the city's main street, Av. 27 de Febrero. A more scenic route following the coastal shore provides beautiful views of the Caribbean Sea and of the city. This secondary road crosses the Ozama River by means of a floating bridge, connecting traffic onto the Av. George Washington (el Malec\u00f3n) which leads into the heart of the colonial city.\n\n== Addition of northern terminal ==\nOn 18 April 2007, a new terminal was completed and opened for operations. It can accommodate four [[Boeing 747]]s simultaneously. This new terminal has four gates with boarding bridges, an air-conditioning system, and maintenance facilities for aircraft.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Runway ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas Airport's runway direction is north\u2013south (designated 17\u201335). This runway is the largest in the country, and one of the largest in the Caribbean. With a length of 3,355&nbsp;m, it is able to support a [[Boeing 747]]. The runway of SDQ was last renovated in June 2008. The old taxi-way was also renovated and converted into a full runway while the old runway was being renovated, then it was converted back into a taxiway after the normal runway was finished. The runway accommodated the [[Antonov An-225]] to supply goods after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |title=Antonov-225 Delivered Humanitarian Aids to Japan |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/news/183 |archivedate=2018-04-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |title=AN-225 Mriya / Super Heavy Transport |accessdate=2016-12-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/aircraft/transport-aircraft/an-225-mriya |archivedate=2018-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n== Concourses ==\nLas Am\u00e9ricas has five gates on the main satellite concourse (A), A2 through A6. Other gate facilities are for the flights departing from a parking in the taxiway. back in the 1960s and 70s the airport used to be much smaller, The original building was half the size of today's newest structure but with a still modern look.\n\nConcourse B has four gates (B1 through B4) and remote stand (P8). Terminal&nbsp;B now features a co-branded [[United Club|Copa Club]] operated jointly by [[United Airlines]] and [[Copa Airlines]], and a Private Lounge exclusive to members and business people.\n\nThe average number of daily flights in and out of Las Am\u00e9ricas ranges between 68 and 84 flights.
