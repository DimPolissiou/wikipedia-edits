It is a major telephone operator in the Nordic and Baltic countries and an alternative provider in many others, with about 17 million customers in 7 countries and under franchise in 2 additional countries.\n\nTele2 started as a telecommunications company in Sweden in 1993 by the company [[Kinnevik AB|Investment AB Kinnevik]].\n\nTele2 operates in [[Telecommunications in Sweden|Sweden]], [[Telecommunications in Estonia|Estonia]], [[Telecommunications in Latvia|Latvia]], [[Telecommunications in Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Telecommunications in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Telecommunications in Sweden|Russia]] and [[Telecommunications in Germany|Germany]]. It previously operated in [[Telecommunications in Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Telecommunications in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] but the company has since divested its licence and ownership to other companies in those markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tele2.com/about/who-we-are/where-we-operate/|title=Where we operate|publisher=Tele2|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1981, a mobile phone provider called ''Comvik'' started as an alternative mobile phone operator to Televerket (today known as [[Telia Company]]). The cable television provider ''Kabelvision AB'' started in 1986. Comvik changed its name to become [[Comviq]] when the company got a [[GSM]] license in 1988 and started operating in 1992.\n\nIn 1991, Sweden's first commercial ISP was started with the Swedish IP Network ('''Swipnet''' <small>([[:sv:Swipnet|sv]])</small>, AS1257) by Investment AB Kinnevik, later renamed as  ''Tele2'', and in 1993 with telephone liberalisation in Sweden, Tele2 started to offer international calls.\n\nThe three companies of Comviq, Kabelvision, and Tele2 came together as the ''Tele2'' brand on fixed-line services and ''Comviq'' on mobile services in Sweden in 1997. The Swipnet branding was phased out in 2014. International growth came in the form of acquisitions in Estonia,Lithuania, Latvia, Russia and France.\n\n==Divestments==\nTele2's most recent development has been to realign its geographic footprint towards [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Nordic countries|Nordic region]] focusing on own infrastructure based operations which provide higher growth options and possibly better margins for the future.  One area of notable success has been the growth of the mobile Internet broadband connectivity. Tele2 has achieved the most success in Russian market, with a customer base increasing by the hundreds of thousands yearly.\n[[Image:Map Tele2.svg|left|thumb|150px|Countries in which Tele2 operates are in green, countries in which Tele2 no longer operates are in red.]]\nIn 2007 the company sold its holdings in Belgium to Dutch operator [[KPN]], in France to [[SFR]] and activities in Spain and Italy to [[Vodafone Italy]], in Portugal to [[Clix (ISP)|Clix]] and in Switzerland to TDC Sunrise. In March 2008 Tele2 divested its Austrian [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] operations to [[Telekom Austria]], although retaining its fixed line and internet services. In June 2008 Tele2 sold its Liechtenstein and Luxembourg holdings to Belgian operator [[Belgacom]].
