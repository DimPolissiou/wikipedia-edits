In December, Ryback started a feud with [[Alexander Rusev|Rusev]] after interrupting Rusev and the returning [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]] on ''Miz TV'', which would lead to a match between the two at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2015)|TLC]], where Ryback was defeated by Rusev by technical knockout. On January 24, 2016, Ryback competed in the [[Royal Rumble (2016)|Royal Rumble]] [[Royal Rumble match|match]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] as the ninth entrant, but was eliminated by Big Show.\n\n==== Final feuds and departure (2016) ==== \n[[File:Ryback April 2016.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Ryback in April 2016]]\nOn the February 4 episode of ''SmackDown'', Ryback debuted a new look, abandoning his [[Wrestling singlet|singlet]] and now sporting black trunks, where he defeated [[Erick Rowan]], but was attacked by [[The Wyatt Family]]. Ryback teamed up with Big Show and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], being billed as \"the titans\" of WWE, to defeat Wyatt Family members Erick Rowan, [[Luke Harper]] and [[Braun Strowman]] in a six-man tag team match at [[Fastlane (2016)|Fastlane]], with Ryback pinning Harper for the victory. The next night on ''Raw'', during a rematch between the two teams, Ryback walked out on Big Show and Kane, and later proclaimed that he was tired of being in tag team matches, turning [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in the process for the first time since 2014.\n\nOn the March 7 episode of ''Raw'', Ryback confronted [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Kalisto (wrestler)|Kalisto]] backstage, leading to a title match between them on the [[WrestleMania 32]] pre-show, which Ryback lost. In a non-title rematch between the two on the April 21 episode of ''SmackDown'', Ryback defeated Kalisto, reigniting their feud. With the win, he earned another shot at Kalisto's United States Championship at [[Payback (2016)|Payback]], but was again defeated on the pre-show, this was his last match in WWE.\n\nOn May 2, it was reported that WWE had sent Reeves home from television due to a contract dispute, and he did not participate in a battle royal match he was promoted for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2637526-ryback-reportedly-removed-from-wwe-programming-due-to-contract-dispute|title=Ryback moved indefinitely from TV|last=Webster|first=Danny|date=May 2, 2016|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref> The following day on May 3, Reeves posted a long explanation on his personal [[Tumblr]] page, confirming that he himself made the decision to go home, and cited a lack of equal pay for talent and creative frustration as primary reasons for his departure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2637701-ryback-comments-on-contract-negotiations-pay-inequality-in-wwe-and-more|title=Ryback comments on unequal pay|last=Zucker|first=Joseph|date=May 3, 2016|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn August 5, Reeves announced on his [[Instagram]] that he and WWE had parted ways.<ref name=\"WWE exit\">{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/08/05/ryback-announces-wwe-exit/|title=Ryback announces WWE exit, reveals pro wrestling future|date=August 5, 2016|accessdate=August 5, 2016|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808125954/http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/08/05/ryback-announces-wwe-exit/|archivedate=August 8, 2016}}</ref> Three days later, WWE released Ryback.<ref>{{cite web|title=WWE parts ways with Ryback|url=http://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-ryback-part-ways|publisher=WWE|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent circuit (2016\u20132017) ===\nImmediately after announcing his WWE departure, Reeves announced via his Instagram that he would be taking [[Independent circuit|independent bookings]].

By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles, [[triceps]], and anterior [[deltoid muscle|deltoids]], with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, [[serratus anterior muscle|serratus anterior]], [[coracobrachialis muscle|coracobrachialis]] and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or [[physical education]] and commonly in [[Military Fitness|military physical training]]. They are also a common form of [[punishment]] used in the military, school sport, or some [[martial arts]] disciplines.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe American English term ''push-up'' was first used between 1905 and 1910,<ref>{{cite web | title=push-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/push-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> while the British ''press-up'' was first recorded between 1945 and 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=press-up |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/press-upp |year=2006 |author= Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=press-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/press-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Body mass supported during push-ups==\nAccording to the study published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of their [[body mass]] in the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where [[knees]] are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of their body mass in up and down positions, respectively.<ref name=\"suprak\">{{cite journal|last1=Suprak|first1=David N|last2=Dawes|first2=Jay|last3=Stephenson|first3=Mark D|title=The Effect of Position on the Percentage of Body Mass Supported During Traditional and Modified Push-up Variants|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|date=February 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=497\u2013503|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bde2cf|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Dawes/publication/41548700_The_Effect_of_Position_on_the_Percentage_of_Body_Mass_Supported_During_Traditional_and_Modified_Push-up_Variants/links/549983200cf2d6581ab14a6d.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Muscles worked==\nWhile the push-up primarily targets the muscles of the chest, arms, and shoulders, support required from other muscles results in a wider range of muscles integrated into the exercise.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/41/push-up/ |title=Push-up |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>\n[[File: Marines do pushups.jpg|thumb|Military recruits will often perform push-ups as part of their physical training. Here, U.S. Marine recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego perform push-ups in May 2005, as a part of their basic recruit training.]]\n\n=== Abdominals ===\nThe [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus abdominis]] and [[Transversus abdominis muscle|transversus abdominis]] contract continually while performing push-ups to hold the body off the floor and keep the legs and [[torso]] aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The transversus abdominis lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.\n\n=== Deltoid ===\nThe anterior portion of the [[deltoid muscle]] is one of the major shoulder-joint horizontal adductors, moving the upper arms toward the chest during the upward phase of a push-up. It also helps control the speed of movement during the downward phase. The deltoid attaches to parts of the [[clavicle]] and [[scapula]], just above the [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]] on one end, and to the outside of the [[humerus bone]] on the other. Along with horizontal adduction, the anterior deltoid assists with flexion and internal rotation of the humerus within the shoulder socket.\n\n=== Chest muscles ===\nThe push up requires the work of many muscle groups, with one of the primary muscle groups being the chest muscles, the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] and the [[Pectoralis minor muscle|minor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.md-health.com/What-Muscles-Do-Push-Ups-Work.html|title=What Muscles Do Push-Ups Work?|work=MDhealth.com}}</ref> These are the two large chest muscles and the main pushing muscle group of the upper body. When pushing and lowering the body during a push-up, the pectoralis major is doing most of the work. As a result, these muscles become very strong and can become defined as lean muscle after doing push-ups regularly.\n\n=== Stabilizers: back body ===\nThe push-up depends on stabilizer muscles as the body is pushed and lowered. The [[Erector spinal muscles|erector spinae]] is the main stabilizer muscle in the back. Made up of three muscles including the spinal, longissimus, and iliocostalis. The spinal runs adjacent to the spine, the longissimus runs adjacent to the spinal and the iliocostalis runs adjacent to the longissimus and over the ribs. Two muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus stabilizes the upper leg. The medius and minimus sit under the largest butt muscle, the gluteus maximus.\n\n=== Triceps brachii ===\nWhile the anterior deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward phase of a push-up, the [[triceps brachii]] muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle is divided into three heads \u2014 the lateral head, long head, and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach to the back of the humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/341958-which-muscles-does-a-push-up-work/|title=Which Muscles Does a Push-Up Work?|author=Matthew Schirm|work=Live Well - Jillian Michaels}}</ref>\nThere is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond-shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand are placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond. This special diamond push-up is done by the United States Marine Corps. The lips must come within 1 inch of the floor while keeping the neck in line with the straight spine to qualify as a valid push-up. This can be verified by placing a 1-inch foam disposable earplug on the floor in the center of the diamond and picking it up with the lips.\n\n=== Forearms ===\nStabilizers include wrist and forearm muscles, the knee extensors, and the hip/spine flexors, which all work isometrically to maintain a proper plank position in the standard prone push-up.\n\n=== Biceps ===\nDuring the push-up exercise, the short head of the [[biceps brachii]] muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer. This means the muscle activates at both ends\u2014the elbow and the shoulder\u2014to help stabilize the joints.\n\n=== Joints and tendons ===\nInner muscles that support the operation of the fingers, wrists, forearms, and elbows are also worked isometrically. Some push-up modifications that require to have the arms at different heights effectively engage the rotator cuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehealthsciencejournal.com/10-level-push-ups-series-building-ultimate-strength/|title=10 Level Push-ups Series for Building Ultimate Strength|author=Melissa Bell|work=www.thehealthsciencejournal.com |publisher=[[The Health Science Journal]] |accessdate=21 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nIn the \"full push-up\", the back and legs are straight and off the floor. There are several variations besides the common push-up. These include bringing the thumbs and index fingers of both hands together (a \"diamond push-up\") as well as having the elbows pointed towards the knees. These variations are intended to put greater emphasis on the [[triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] or shoulders, rather than the chest muscles. When both hands are unbalanced or on uneven surfaces, this exercise works the body core. Raising the feet or hands onto elevated surfaces during the exercise emphasizes the upper (minor) or lower (major) pectorals, respectively. Raising the hands with the aid of push-up bars or a dumbbell allows for a greater range of motion, providing further stress for the muscles.\n===Weighted push-ups=== \nProgressively overloading classic push-ups using barbell plates, resistance bands (or any form of weight). The load is positioned on the upper back. This very effective exercise is not commonly performed because of the difficulty of loading the human body in that position. HI WHO EVER SEES THIS HAVE A GOOD DAY\n\n===Planche push-ups===\n[[Image:Planche.jpg|thumb|right|Planche position]]\nAn extremely difficult variation is to perform a push-up using only hands, without resting the feet on the floor, i.e., starting from and returning to the [[Planche (exercise)|planche]] position. These are known as \"planche push-ups\". To do this variation, the body's center of gravity must be kept over the hands while performing the push-up by leaning forward while the legs are elevated in the air, which requires great strength and a high level of balance. The entire body weight is lifted in this variation.\n\n===Knuckle push-ups===\nAnother variation is to perform push-ups on the knuckles of the fist, rather than with palms of the hands on the floor. This method is also commonly used in [[martial arts]], such as [[Karate]] and [[Tae Kwon Do]], and may be used in boxing training while wearing [[boxing gloves]].\n\nThe intent, in addition to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the amount of strain in the wrist, compared to the typical \"palms on floor\" approach, and so it is sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors.\n\n===Maltese push-up===\nThe ''Maltese push-up'' is a gymnastic variation of the push-up, in which the hands are positioned further down towards the [[hip (anatomy)|hips]] (as opposed to roughly alongside the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectorals]]), but with a wide distance between them.\n\n===Hindu push-up===\n{{see also|sun salutation}}\n[[File:Dand (Basic).gif|thumb|The Hindu push-up, also known as a dand. This is the most basic version, similar to that used by Bruce Lee who referred to it as a cat stretch.]]\nThe most basic form of ''Hindu push-up'' starts from the [[downward dog]] [[yoga]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the posterior raised) and transitions to a [[cobra pose]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the torso arched forwards and the legs close to the floor). It is also known as a ''dand''. It is common in [[India]]n physical culture and [[Indian martial arts]], particularly [[Pehlwani]].<ref>Mujumdar D.C., ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Physical Culture'', 1950, p.460, plate 131</ref> Bruce Lee also used it in his training regime and referred to it as a 'cat stretch'.<ref>Lee, Bruce,\n'Preliminaries' in ''The Tao of Jeet Kune Do'', California: Ohara Publications, 1975, p.29</ref> It is an effective core strength exercise because it dynamically involves both the [[anterior chain| anterior]] and [[posterior chain|posterior]] chains in a harmonious fashion. There are numerous variations of the Hindu push-up although most incorporate the two postures used in the most basic version. It may also be known as a [[Hanuman]], [[judo]], or dive-bomber push-up.\n\n===Guillotine push-up===\nThe ''guillotine push-up'' is a form of push-up done from an elevated position (either hands-on elevated platforms or traditionally [[medicine balls]]) wherein the practitioner lowers the [[chest]], [[human head|head]], and [[neck]] (thus the name) past the plane of the hands. The goal is to stretch the [[shoulder]]s and put extra emphasis on the [[muscle]]s there.\n\n===Backhanded push-up===\nThe ''backhanded push-up'' is a form of push-ups performed using the back of the hands, rather than the palms. Currently, the record holder of the backhanded push-ups is Bill Kathan who broke the world record in 2010, by performing 2,396 on [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.grandcanyonnews.com/news/2010/feb/23/grand-canyon-record-breaker-does-it-again/|title=Grand Canyon record-breaker does it again - Grand Canyon News - Grand Canyon, Arizona|last=Whitehurst|first=Patrick|work=Grand Canyon News|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===One arm versions===\n[[File: US Army 52113 FORSCOM employee excels at fitness competition.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army employee demonstrates a one-arm push-up in an extended position.]]\nMany of the push-up variations can be done using one arm instead of two. This will further increase the resistance put upon the trainee.\n\n===Single-leg push-up===\nLift one leg off the ground and do a set. Switch legs on the next set.\n\n===Narrow-grip push-up===\nDo a normal push-up with your hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath the chest.\n\n===Wide-grip push-up===\nSimilar to a normal push-up but with wider spacing of the hands. This works the chest and shoulders more.\n\n===Clap push-up===\nAt the peak of the push-up, push yourself up off the ground and quickly clap in midair. The fast jolting force of clap push-ups will help develop explosive power while also bulking up the pectoral muscles for a more defined chest.\n\n===Spiderman push-up===\nDo a normal push-up but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as you rise. Switch knees with each rep.\nAlso, add more stress to your abs with a 2-second hold.\n\n===Other versions===\nThere are some less difficult versions, which reduce the effort by supporting some of the bodyweights in some way. One can move on to the standard push-up after progress is made.\n\n\"Wall\" push-ups are performed by standing close to a wall and pushing away from the wall with the arms; one can increase the difficulty by moving one's feet farther from the wall.\n\n\"Table\" or \"chair\" push-ups are performed by pushing away from a table, chair, or other object. The lower the object, the more difficult the push-up. One should be sure that the object is securely stationary before attempting to push up from it.\n\n\"Modified\" or \"knee\" push-ups are performed by supporting the lower body on the knees instead of the toes, which reduces the difficulty. This is useful for warm-ups/downs, pyramids/drop sets, endurance training, and rehab. It can also be used to train in a more explosive plyometric manner (like clapping push-ups) when one can't perform them with the feet. It can also be used with the 1-arm variations as a transition.\n\n\"Three-phase\" push-ups involve simply breaking a standard push up into three components and doing each one slowly and deliberately. Participants usually start face down on the floor with hands outstretched either perpendicular or parallel to the body. The first phase involves the arms being brought palms down on a 90-degree angle at the elbows. The second phase involves the body being pushed into the up position. The third phase is returning to the starting position. This technique is commonly used after a large block of regular push-ups, as it poses less stress and requires less effort.\n\n\"Diamond\" or \"Triceps\" push-ups are done by placing both palms on the ground and touching together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups because, at the bottom of the stroke, the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in a much higher mechanical load on the triceps.\n\n\"Hollow-Body\" push-ups are performed in the position gymnasts call the \"hollow body\". In the plank version of the hollow body, the shoulders are protracted into a pronounced curve in the upper back while the abdominal muscles are tightened and the legs are locked and squeezed together. This variation requires full-body tension to execute and results in greater integration of the hips, shoulders, and core.\n\n===Plyometrics===\nTwo platforms are placed beside the trainee, one on either side. The exercise begins with the hands-on either platform supporting the body, then the subject drops to the ground and explosively rebounds with a push-up, extending the torso and arms completely off the ground and returning the hands to the platforms.\n\nAnother is simply an explosive push-up where a person attempts to push quickly and with enough force to raise his or her hands' several centimeters off the ground, with the body completely suspended on the feet for a moment, a variation of the drop push. This is necessary for performing 'clap push-ups' - i.e. clapping the hands while in the air.\n\n'''Aztec push-ups'''\n\nThe Aztec push-up is one of the most difficult plyometric push-ups.  A person performs an Aztec push-up by beginning in the normal push-up starting position and exploding upward with both the hands and feet, driving the entire body into the air.  While in the air, the body is bent at the waist and the hands quickly touch the toes.  The body is then quickly straightened and the hands and feet break the fall, returning the body to the normal push-up position for another repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/|title=Bodyweight Exercises Periodic Table with How-To Videos|work=Strength Stack 52}}</ref>\n\n'''360 push ups'''\n\nThe 360 push-up is a variation of the superman push-up where one rotates 360 degrees while in the air.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mNQsPMuHQ|title=19 Variations of Push Up Exercises (The Best Chest Builders Ever!)|date=26 December 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n''' Falling and explosive rebound push ups'''<br />\nHere one falls to the ground from standing position and then using an explosive push-up gets back to standing position.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naRaVsFn_g4|title=10-15 Crazy Extreme Push Ups - Calisthenics Street Workout 2013 (HD)|date=1 June 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nWith push-ups, many possibilities for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand can be set on a higher platform than the other or be farther away from the other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform push-ups by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, push-ups can be performed on one arm or using weights.\n\nPush-ups between chairs form an integral part of the \"Dynamic Tension\" Course devised by [[Charles Atlas]], and similar systems.\n\n==Record breakers and attempts==\n* The first record for push-ups documented by Guinness World Records was 6,006 non-stop push-ups by Charles Linster on 5 October 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|title=World Records for Non-Stop Push-Ups - Ulysses Yield|author=Ralf Laue and Charles Linster|work=recordholders.org}}</ref>\n* The record for the most push-ups non-stop was 10,507, set by Minoru Yoshida of Japan in October 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Record for Non-Stop Push-Ups|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|work=World Records for Push-Ups (Press-Ups)|publisher=The International World Record Breakers' Club|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> Yoshida's record was the last for non-stop push-ups to be published by Guinness World Records.

By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles, [[triceps]], and anterior [[deltoid muscle|deltoids]], with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, [[serratus anterior muscle|serratus anterior]], [[coracobrachialis muscle|coracobrachialis]] and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or [[physical education]] and commonly in [[Military Fitness|military physical training]]. They are also a common form of [[punishment]] used in the military, school sport, or some [[martial arts]] disciplines.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe American English term ''push-up'' was first used between 1905 and 1910,<ref>{{cite web | title=push-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/push-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref> while the British ''press-up'' was first recorded between 1945 and 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=press-up |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/press-upp |year=2006 |author= Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=press-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/press-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Body mass supported during push-ups==\nAccording to the study published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of their [[body mass]] in the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where [[knees]] are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of their body mass in up and down positions, respectively.<ref name=\"suprak\">{{cite journal|last1=Suprak|first1=David N|last2=Dawes|first2=Jay|last3=Stephenson|first3=Mark D|title=The Effect of Position on the Percentage of Body Mass Supported During Traditional and Modified Push-up Variants|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|date=February 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=497\u2013503|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bde2cf|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Dawes/publication/41548700_The_Effect_of_Position_on_the_Percentage_of_Body_Mass_Supported_During_Traditional_and_Modified_Push-up_Variants/links/549983200cf2d6581ab14a6d.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Muscles worked==\nWhile the push-up primarily targets the muscles of the chest, arms, and shoulders, support required from other muscles results in a wider range of muscles integrated into the exercise.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/41/push-up/ |title=Push-up |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>\n[[File: Marines do pushups.jpg|thumb|Military recruits will often perform push-ups as part of their physical training. Here, U.S. Marine recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego perform push-ups in May 2005, as a part of their basic recruit training.]]\n\n=== Abdominals ===\nThe [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus abdominis]] and [[Transversus abdominis muscle|transversus abdominis]] contract continually while performing push-ups to hold the body off the floor and keep the legs and [[torso]] aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The transversus abdominis lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.\n\n=== Deltoid ===\nThe anterior portion of the [[deltoid muscle]] is one of the major shoulder-joint horizontal adductors, moving the upper arms toward the chest during the upward phase of a push-up. It also helps control the speed of movement during the downward phase. The deltoid attaches to parts of the [[clavicle]] and [[scapula]], just above the [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]] on one end, and to the outside of the [[humerus bone]] on the other. Along with horizontal adduction, the anterior deltoid assists with flexion and internal rotation of the humerus within the shoulder socket.\n\n=== Chest muscles ===\nThe push up requires the work of many muscle groups, with one of the primary muscle groups being the chest muscles, the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] and the [[Pectoralis minor muscle|minor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.md-health.com/What-Muscles-Do-Push-Ups-Work.html|title=What Muscles Do Push-Ups Work?|work=MDhealth.com}}</ref> These are the two large chest muscles and the main pushing muscle group of the upper body. When pushing and lowering the body during a push-up, the pectoralis major is doing most of the work. As a result, these muscles become very strong and can become defined as lean muscle after doing push-ups regularly.\n\n=== Stabilizers: back body ===\nThe push-up depends on stabilizer muscles as the body is pushed and lowered. The [[Erector spinal muscles|erector spinae]] is the main stabilizer muscle in the back. Made up of three muscles including the spinal, longissimus, and iliocostalis. The spinal runs adjacent to the spine, the longissimus runs adjacent to the spinal and the iliocostalis runs adjacent to the longissimus and over the ribs. Two muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus stabilizes the upper leg. The medius and minimus sit under the largest butt muscle, the gluteus maximus.\n\n=== Triceps brachii ===\nWhile the anterior deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward phase of a push-up, the [[triceps brachii]] muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle is divided into three heads \u2014 the lateral head, long head, and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach to the back of the humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/341958-which-muscles-does-a-push-up-work/|title=Which Muscles Does a Push-Up Work?|author=Matthew Schirm|work=Live Well - Jillian Michaels}}</ref>\nThere is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond-shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand are placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond. This special diamond push-up is done by the United States Marine Corps. The lips must come within 1 inch of the floor while keeping the neck in line with the straight spine to qualify as a valid push-up. This can be verified by placing a 1-inch foam disposable earplug on the floor in the center of the diamond and picking it up with the lips.\n\n=== Forearms ===\nStabilizers include wrist and forearm muscles, the knee extensors, and the hip/spine flexors, which all work isometrically to maintain a proper plank position in the standard prone push-up.\n\n=== Biceps ===\nDuring the push-up exercise, the short head of the [[biceps brachii]] muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer. This means the muscle activates at both ends\u2014the elbow and the shoulder\u2014to help stabilize the joints.\n\n=== Joints and tendons ===\nInner muscles that support the operation of the fingers, wrists, forearms, and elbows are also worked isometrically. Some push-up modifications that require to have the arms at different heights effectively engage the rotator cuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehealthsciencejournal.com/10-level-push-ups-series-building-ultimate-strength/|title=10 Level Push-ups Series for Building Ultimate Strength|author=Melissa Bell|work=www.thehealthsciencejournal.com |publisher=[[The Health Science Journal]] |accessdate=21 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nIn the \"full push-up\", the back and legs are straight and off the floor. There are several variations besides the common push-up. These include bringing the thumbs and index fingers of both hands together (a \"diamond push-up\") as well as having the elbows pointed towards the knees. These variations are intended to put greater emphasis on the [[triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] or shoulders, rather than the chest muscles. When both hands are unbalanced or on uneven surfaces, this exercise works the body core. Raising the feet or hands onto elevated surfaces during the exercise emphasizes the upper (minor) or lower (major) pectorals, respectively. Raising the hands with the aid of push-up bars or a dumbbell allows for a greater range of motion, providing further stress for the muscles.\n===Weighted push-ups=== \nProgressively overloading classic push-ups using barbell plates, resistance bands (or any form of weight). The load is positioned on the upper back. This very effective exercise is not commonly performed because of the difficulty of loading the human body in that position.\n\n===Planche push-ups===\n[[Image:Planche.jpg|thumb|right|Planche position]]\nAn extremely difficult variation is to perform a push-up using only hands, without resting the feet on the floor, i.e., starting from and returning to the [[Planche (exercise)|planche]] position. These are known as \"planche push-ups\". To do this variation, the body's center of gravity must be kept over the hands while performing the push-up by leaning forward while the legs are elevated in the air, which requires great strength and a high level of balance. The entire body weight is lifted in this variation.\n\n===Knuckle push-ups===\nAnother variation is to perform push-ups on the knuckles of the fist, rather than with palms of the hands on the floor. This method is also commonly used in [[martial arts]], such as [[Karate]] and [[Tae Kwon Do]], and may be used in boxing training while wearing [[boxing gloves]].\n\nThe intent, in addition to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the amount of strain in the wrist, compared to the typical \"palms on floor\" approach, and so it is sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors.\n\n===Maltese push-up===\nThe ''Maltese push-up'' is a gymnastic variation of the push-up, in which the hands are positioned further down towards the [[hip (anatomy)|hips]] (as opposed to roughly alongside the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectorals]]), but with a wide distance between them.\n\n===Hindu push-up===\n{{see also|sun salutation}}\n[[File:Dand (Basic).gif|thumb|The Hindu push-up, also known as a dand. This is the most basic version, similar to that used by Bruce Lee who referred to it as a cat stretch.]]\nThe most basic form of ''Hindu push-up'' starts from the [[downward dog]] [[yoga]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the posterior raised) and transitions to a [[cobra pose]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the torso arched forwards and the legs close to the floor). It is also known as a ''dand''. It is common in [[India]]n physical culture and [[Indian martial arts]], particularly [[Pehlwani]].<ref>Mujumdar D.C., ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Physical Culture'', 1950, p.460, plate 131</ref> Bruce Lee also used it in his training regime and referred to it as a 'cat stretch'.<ref>Lee, Bruce,\n'Preliminaries' in ''The Tao of Jeet Kune Do'', California: Ohara Publications, 1975, p.29</ref> It is an effective core strength exercise because it dynamically involves both the [[anterior chain| anterior]] and [[posterior chain|posterior]] chains in a harmonious fashion. There are numerous variations of the Hindu push-up although most incorporate the two postures used in the most basic version. It may also be known as a [[Hanuman]], [[judo]], or dive-bomber push-up.\n\n===Guillotine push-up===\nThe ''guillotine push-up'' is a form of push-up done from an elevated position (either hands-on elevated platforms or traditionally [[medicine balls]]) wherein the practitioner lowers the [[chest]], [[human head|head]], and [[neck]] (thus the name) past the plane of the hands. The goal is to stretch the [[shoulder]]s and put extra emphasis on the [[muscle]]s there.\n\n===Backhanded push-up===\nThe ''backhanded push-up'' is a form of push-ups performed using the back of the hands, rather than the palms. Currently, the record holder of the backhanded push-ups is Bill Kathan who broke the world record in 2010, by performing 2,396 on [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.grandcanyonnews.com/news/2010/feb/23/grand-canyon-record-breaker-does-it-again/|title=Grand Canyon record-breaker does it again - Grand Canyon News - Grand Canyon, Arizona|last=Whitehurst|first=Patrick|work=Grand Canyon News|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n===One arm versions===\n[[File: US Army 52113 FORSCOM employee excels at fitness competition.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army employee demonstrates a one-arm push-up in an extended position.]]\nMany of the push-up variations can be done using one arm instead of two. This will further increase the resistance put upon the trainee.\n\n===Single-leg push-up===\nLift one leg off the ground and do a set. Switch legs on the next set.\n\n===Narrow-grip push-up===\nDo a normal push-up with your hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath the chest.\n\n===Wide-grip push-up===\nSimilar to a normal push-up but with wider spacing of the hands. This works the chest and shoulders more.\n\n===Clap push-up===\nAt the peak of the push-up, push yourself up off the ground and quickly clap in midair. The fast jolting force of clap push-ups will help develop explosive power while also bulking up the pectoral muscles for a more defined chest.\n\n===Spiderman push-up===\nDo a normal push-up but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as you rise. Switch knees with each rep.\nAlso, add more stress to your abs with a 2-second hold.\n\n===Other versions===\nThere are some less difficult versions, which reduce the effort by supporting some of the bodyweights in some way. One can move on to the standard push-up after progress is made.\n\n\"Wall\" push-ups are performed by standing close to a wall and pushing away from the wall with the arms; one can increase the difficulty by moving one's feet farther from the wall.\n\n\"Table\" or \"chair\" push-ups are performed by pushing away from a table, chair, or other object. The lower the object, the more difficult the push-up. One should be sure that the object is securely stationary before attempting to push up from it.\n\n\"Modified\" or \"knee\" push-ups are performed by supporting the lower body on the knees instead of the toes, which reduces the difficulty. This is useful for warm-ups/downs, pyramids/drop sets, endurance training, and rehab. It can also be used to train in a more explosive plyometric manner (like clapping push-ups) when one can't perform them with the feet. It can also be used with the 1-arm variations as a transition.\n\n\"Three-phase\" push-ups involve simply breaking a standard push up into three components and doing each one slowly and deliberately. Participants usually start face down on the floor with hands outstretched either perpendicular or parallel to the body. The first phase involves the arms being brought palms down on a 90-degree angle at the elbows. The second phase involves the body being pushed into the up position. The third phase is returning to the starting position. This technique is commonly used after a large block of regular push-ups, as it poses less stress and requires less effort.\n\n\"Diamond\" or \"Triceps\" push-ups are done by placing both palms on the ground and touching together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups because, at the bottom of the stroke, the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in a much higher mechanical load on the triceps.\n\n\"Hollow-Body\" push-ups are performed in the position gymnasts call the \"hollow body\". In the plank version of the hollow body, the shoulders are protracted into a pronounced curve in the upper back while the abdominal muscles are tightened and the legs are locked and squeezed together. This variation requires full-body tension to execute and results in greater integration of the hips, shoulders, and core.\n\n===Plyometrics===\nTwo platforms are placed beside the trainee, one on either side. The exercise begins with the hands-on either platform supporting the body, then the subject drops to the ground and explosively rebounds with a push-up, extending the torso and arms completely off the ground and returning the hands to the platforms.\n\nAnother is simply an explosive push-up where a person attempts to push quickly and with enough force to raise his or her hands' several centimeters off the ground, with the body completely suspended on the feet for a moment, a variation of the drop push. This is necessary for performing 'clap push-ups' - i.e. clapping the hands while in the air.\n\n'''Aztec push-ups'''\n\nThe Aztec push-up is one of the most difficult plyometric push-ups.  A person performs an Aztec push-up by beginning in the normal push-up starting position and exploding upward with both the hands and feet, driving the entire body into the air.  While in the air, the body is bent at the waist and the hands quickly touch the toes.  The body is then quickly straightened and the hands and feet break the fall, returning the body to the normal push-up position for another repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/|title=Bodyweight Exercises Periodic Table with How-To Videos|work=Strength Stack 52}}</ref>\n\n'''360 push ups'''\n\nThe 360 push-up is a variation of the superman push-up where one rotates 360 degrees while in the air.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mNQsPMuHQ|title=19 Variations of Push Up Exercises (The Best Chest Builders Ever!)|date=26 December 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n''' Falling and explosive rebound push ups'''<br />\nHere one falls to the ground from standing position and then using an explosive push-up gets back to standing position.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naRaVsFn_g4|title=10-15 Crazy Extreme Push Ups - Calisthenics Street Workout 2013 (HD)|date=1 June 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nWith push-ups, many possibilities for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand can be set on a higher platform than the other or be farther away from the other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform push-ups by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, push-ups can be performed on one arm or using weights.\n\nPush-ups between chairs form an integral part of the \"Dynamic Tension\" Course devised by [[Charles Atlas]], and similar systems.\n\n==Record breakers and attempts==\n* The first record for push-ups documented by Guinness World Records was 6,006 non-stop push-ups by Charles Linster on 5 October 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|title=World Records for Non-Stop Push-Ups - Ulysses Yield|author=Ralf Laue and Charles Linster|work=recordholders.org}}</ref>\n* The record for the most push-ups non-stop was 10,507, set by Minoru Yoshida of Japan in October 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Record for Non-Stop Push-Ups|url=http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/ulysses.html|work=World Records for Push-Ups (Press-Ups)|publisher=The International World Record Breakers' Club|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> Yoshida's record was the last for non-stop push-ups to be published by Guinness World Records.

She is friends with psychiatrist [[Dr. Marlena Evans|Dr Marlena Evans (]][[Deidre Hall]]), and is actually a former patient of hers. Kate kept a journal back when she was Marlena's patient, and Kate breaks in to the house she used to live in Salem trying to find it. At Titan, Kate is given a manuscript of a novel to consider for publication. When she reads it, she realizes it is her life story, plagiarized from her journal, and she blocks its publication.\n\nKate's son [[Lucas Roberts]] ([[Bryan Dattilo]]) joins her in Salem, on a spring break from [[West Point Military Academy]]. When Kate meets [[Dr. Tom Horton|Dr Tom]] and [[Alice Horton]] ([[Macdonald Carey]] and [[Frances Reid]]), Alice realizes Kate used to be a tenant in a house owned by her son [[Bill Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Bill Horton]] (now occupied by his daughter [[Jennifer Horton|Jennifer]], and her husband [[Jack Deveraux]], who found her journal, and wrote the novel); and Tom recognizes her as a former patient, a battered woman. Tom remembers that he delivered her a baby boy (this was Lucas). Kate wants the secrets about her past to remain hidden, but Lucas wants to know the identity of his father. Kate has told him that his father was \"Alan Roberts\" and given him a photo, but Lucas discovers that the photo is of a random stranger, and \"Alan Roberts\" does not exist. In response to Lucas's anger, Kate tells him she does not know his father's name. Kate informs a stunned Lucas that before he was born, she was married to an abusive man, with whom she had two children, and she turned to Lucas's father for comfort. She cries when she tells him the children, his half-brother and half-sister, later died in a motor accident.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate and Victor have become close, and she and [[Vivian Alamain]] ([[Louise Sorel]]), who loves Victor, have become rivals in their pursuit of his love. It looks like Kate is the winner, when Victor asks Kate to marry him \u2013 he wants to have a child with her \u2013 and Kate accepts, and they marry.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" />\n\nA man named [[Curtis Reed (Days of Our Lives)|Curtis Reed]] ([[Nick Benedict]]) arrives in Salem, and starts blackmailing Kate about her past. Lucas learns that this is Kate's former husband, who was violent to her. Then suddenly, in November 1993, Curtis is found shot dead, apparently murdered. Found next to his body in a drugged state is [[Billie Reed]] ([[Lisa Rinna]]), whom Curtis drugged and abused before his death. Kate, Lucas, Billie, and her brother Austin Reed ([[Patrick Muldoon]]) all come under suspicion for Curtis's murder, but Billie becomes the prime suspect. There is a trial where they all have to testify.\n\nMeanwhile, Vivian Alamain has rescued Bill Horton's wife, [[Laura Horton]] ([[Jaime Lyn Bauer]]) from the sanitarium where she was being kept comatose by corrupt staff (in order to extort money for her care from the Horton family). Vivian and Laura crash the trial, and Laura tells the whole court that Kate was married to Curtis (a fact she knows from them both being former tenants of Bill and hers). Then Billie admits on the stand that she is Curtis's daughter, and was sexually abused by Curtis during her childhood. Billie and Austin realize that Kate is their mother, and ''vice versa''. Initially Billie blames Kate for the abuse she suffered; but when Curtis had found out Kate was pregnant with another man's child, he beat her and left her abanded by the side of a road, and vanished with Austin and Billie. Billie is found to be innocent when it is discovered that Curtis was accidentally shot during a scuffle with [[Stefano DiMera]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]).\n\nVivian, who wants to break up Kate and Victor, urges Laura to go public with the fact that Kate had a sexual affair with Laura's husband Bill Horton. Bill was the other man \u2013 the father of Lucas. Laura crashes a party Victor is holding for Kate and tells all. Lucas is outraged that Kate has kept his father from him. Victor also learns from a tabloid reporter that his marriage to Kate is invalid, as Curtis was still alive when they married.\n\nKate wants to marry Victor legally, and Victor promises to marry her, but only if she gives him an heir; and when Kate learns she will have difficulty in conceiving another child, they decide to use [[in vitro fertilization]]. Some embryos begin to form, but Vivian swaps the embryos and has Victor and Kate's embryos implanted in her.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" /> Vivian gives birth to a healthy baby boy, [[Philip Kiriakis]] on February 21, 1995. While pregnant with Philip, Vivian drives a wedge between Kate and Victor's relationship, and tricks Victor into marrying her. Vivian poisons the pilot of a plane transporting Kate, and when the plane crashes on April 24, 1995, Kate is believed killed.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" />\n\nAfter surviving the crash, Kate (now [[Lauren Koslow]]) returns to Salem on January 25, 1996, determined to win custody of her son Philip. Learning Vivian and Victor are together, Kate seeks revenge. Kate vows to take Victor's Titan Corporation and his son Philip (still an infant at the time) away from them. Victor suffers a stroke, and Vivian is arrested for her schemes.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\"/> Kate is now in charge of Victor's empire. Billie also returns, closely followed by [[Franco Kelly]] ([[Victor Alfieri]]). Kate hires Franco to break up Bo and Hope, so Billie can be happy with Bo.\n\nKate is also now a grandmother: [[Sami Brady]] ([[Alison Sweeney]]) gave birth to a son whilst Kate was away. His name is [[Will Roberts (Days of Our Lives)|Will]], and Sami claims he is Austin's, but he is actually Lucas's child. Sami misleads everyone in her bid to get Austin to marry her, and when the truth of Will's paternity comes out, Sami fights Lucas for custody. Thus begins an epic battle between Kate and Sami. Sami finds out that Kate was once a prostitute and blackmails Kate. Sami falls in love with Franco and they prepare to marry. Kate wants to stop it, because she fears Lucas will lose Will. Kate tries to blackmail Franco about his mob past, but Franco attacks Kate with a poker on the eve of the wedding. Lucas saves Kate by shooting Franco, who dies instantly, and Kate frames Sami for the killing. At the trial for Franco's death, Sami is convicted and is sentenced to death. As she is about to be executed, Lucas confesses in a bid to save her. However, Kate has just persuaded a dying man to sign a false confession and Sami is saved, and she and Lucas both go free.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate is still battling with Vivian for control over Titan. Kate begins a relationship with Vivian's nephew, [[Nicholas Alamain]], but he leaves town. She then attempts to sly her way back into Victor's good graces. She blows her chances, however, when she is caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' with [[Mob Boss|mob boss]] [[Vincent Moroni]] ([[Carl Weintraub]]). She conspires with him to kill Victor at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. The plan accidentally kills Vincent's only child, [[Angela Moroni]] ([[Ayda Field]]), and causes Vincent to commit suicide. Victor, realizing Kate's plan, flees for his life and fakes his death. He reveals himself to her the night she sets the Kiriakis mansion on fire and attempts to kill him with a poker. Victor escapes, but Lucas is severely burned.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\"/> Victor kicks Kate out of the house, but does not tell Philip about his mother's murder attempts on him. Philip's plea causes Victor to provide Kate with a small allowance.\n\nKate gets a job at ''Basic Black'', and begins dating [[Roman Brady]] ([[Josh Taylor (actor)|Josh Taylor]]). Kate and Roman find out that they are the biological parents of twins [[Rex Brady]] ([[Eric Winter]]) and [[Cassie Brady]] ([[Alexis Thorpe]]). Roman asks Kate to marry him, and she agrees. They have a beautiful wedding, but the reception is shattered when Kate finds Roman's apparently-dead body. She mourns him deeply, but it doesn't stop her from destroying his daughter Sami's relationship with her son Lucas. Kate encourages Philip to spend more time with [[Belle Black]] ([[Martha Madison]]). Cassie, too, is apparently murdered. Her body is found with multiple stab wounds in a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] [[Pi\u00f1ata|pinata]]. Kate is found holding the bloody knife and is arrested but, in reality, Cassie's and Roman's apparent deaths, as well as several other Salem residents, are staged in a plot by [[Andr\u00e9 DiMera]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]).\n\nKate begins a relationship with [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]] ([[Drake Hogestyn]]), after helping him deal with a [[Drug-addiction|drug addiction]]. However, as soon as the John and Kate make plans to marry, both their spouses return to Salem alive. Roman ends things with Kate for good. Lucas and Sami are to marry, but Kate stops the wedding in the nick of time, thanks to her discovery and revelation that Sami has been disguising herself as a man called Stan, and selling John the illicit drugs he became addicted to. Kate invites John Black to live with her after Marlena kicks him out of her home. Kate comforts Philip when [[Belle Black]]'s daughter [[Claire Brady (Days of Our Lives)|Claire Brady]], whom Philip believes is his, turns out [[Shawn-Douglas Brady]]'s. Philip leaves town. She is terrified when he goes missing, but comes back after receiving extensive amounts of surgery. He is granted temporary custody of Claire, but is devastated when Shawn and Belle kidnap her.\n\nKate, in her ongoing efforts to keep Lucas from marrying Sami, enlists the help of [[EJ DiMera]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]), who is using the alias EJ Wells, to seduce Sami away from Lucas. Her efforts fail when EJ is revealed to be the son of [[Stefano DiMera]]. Lucas and Sami are deeply in love, and are set to marry again, and this time Kate fails to stop it, despite her best effforts. Sami and Lucas start their life together despite Kate's interference. In retaliation for their scheming, Lucas turns Kate and EJ in to the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] for their questionable financial records. Kate turns to [[Stefano DiMera]] after learning she is broke. Stefano provides her with enough money to start her own business called ''Kate's Hearth and Home'', a [[Martha Stewart]]-like brand of housewares. She hires Stefano's son [[Tony DiMera]] ([[Thaao Penghlis|Thaao Penghis]]) to do the advertising. Kate no longer worries about Lucas and Sami, because Stefano has blackmailed Sami into a marriage with EJ, and Sami has fallen for him.\n\nKate turns her attention back to Philip, who is in trouble with [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]], and to her granddaughter [[Chelsea Brady]] ([[Rachel Melvin]]), who is recovering from surgery. Chelsea's surgery is successful, and soon starts dating her surgeon [[Daniel Jonas]] ([[Shawn Christian|Shawn Cristian]]). In November 2008, Kate is diagnosed with [[Lung cancer staging|stage IV]] [[lung cancer]], and receives [[bone marrow]] from [[Chloe Lane]]. Lucas begins a relationship with [[Chloe Lane]]. Kate learns that Chloe cheated on Lucas with [[Daniel Jonas]], and is set on revenge. She poisons her, and Chloe is put in a [[coma]]. Kate becomes the only suspect, and to avoid jail time she marries [[Stefano DiMera]] who destroys the evidence against her.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" /> Later Phillip has a one-night stand with Chloe, resulting in grandson [[Parker Jonas|Parker]] being born, one month premature. When the truth comes out, Kate does everything in her power to make sure Chloe doesn't see her son, including driving her to suicide (which failed, thanks to Phillip saving her) and calling Phillip (as Chloe), using a recording of Chloe's voice that she edited to make Chloe sound like an unfit mother. When Phillip subsequently moves to [[Chicago]] with Parker, Kate blames Chloe (even though it was Kate's own doing) and later hires a thug named Quinn who forces Chloe to become a prostitute, much like Kate was forced to be in her own youth.\n\nOn August 31, 2011, Kate announces to Victor plans to resurrect ''Countess Wilhelmina Cosmetics'' with brand expansion and new product ideas, under Titan's rule, with Billie's blessing. However, Victor seems apprehensive about the deal, believing Stefano turned down her deal. She later brings back her daughter, Billie, to help run the company by her side. She also interacts with new arrival, [[Ian McAllister (Days of Our Lives)|Ian McAllister]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]), with whom she once had a romantic relationship in [[Paris]]. The two fall into bed in April 2012, which she later regrets. Upon Stefano's return from Alamania, he holds a romantic dinner for Kate with all of her favorite foods, then reveals that he knows about her affair with Ian McAllister. Kate tries to explain but Stefano ends their marriage and takes control of ''Countess Wilhelmina Cosmetics'' and ''Kate's Hearth and Home'', making Kate's longtime enemy, Sami Brady, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]. Ian then offers Kate a job as co-CEO of ''MadWorld'', to work alongside [[Madison James]] as competition against Sami. Kate and Ian continue their relationship as Kate begins to get along with Madison. Stefano is apparently murdered, and with so many enemies, there are many suspects, including Kate. However, during a town-wide disaster, when Salem is rocked with a series of explosions, Ian reveals that he is behind the death of Stefano and framing of EJ, and that he only loved Madison, and is merely using Kate to take the DiMera fortune. Kate ends their relationship, and he is sent to jail; but it is revealed that only an imposter of Stefano died, and that Stefano was really alive and held captive by Ian. Stefano fails to make amends with his son, EJ, and heads to Europe for business. Kate tracks down Stefano, insisting he give her another chance, but they finalize the divorce, and Kate realizes that she and Stefano are finished.\n\nKate takes [[Chad DiMera]] ([[Casey Deidrick]]) under her wing, kind of as a proxy mother, after his own mother dies. Kate supports her grandson Will ([[Chandler Massey]]), when he comes out as gay. Kate also makes amends with Daniel Jonas, and updates him on Parker. Kate is challenged in 2013 when Chloe Lane and her mother, [[Nancy Wesley]] ([[Patrika Darbo]]), return to Salem, and it turns out that Parker is Daniel Jonas's son after all. Kate eventually starts a secret relationship with [[Rafe Hernandez]] ([[Galen Gering]]) after they have a drunken one-night stand. She worries that Stefano may threaten Rafe because of this. Kate later breaks things off with Rafe. Kate becomes a great-grandmother when Will has a daughter, [[Arianna Horton]] (Harper and Sydnee Udell), with his ex-girlfriend [[Gabi Hernandez]] ([[Camila Banus|Camilla Banus]]). Kate offers to have Gabi and Arianna live with her, but Gabi chooses to live with [[Will Horton and Sonny Kiriakis|Will and his partner Sonny]], thanking Kate for the offer.\n\nKate begins a series of ill-fated short-lived romantic relationships with some extremely dubious and villainous men: the drug lord [[Clyde Weston]] (jailed); her ex-husband [[Victor Kiriakis]]'s no-good half-brother [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Deimos Kiriakis|Deimos Kiriakis]] (murdered); Rafe and Gabi's assassin father Eduardo Hernandez (jailed); and then the serial-killer Andr\u00e9 DiMera, whom she marries. She runs ''DiMera Enterprises'' with Chad (now [[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]) and Andr\u00e9, until Andr\u00e9 betrays them, selling them out to her old rival Vivian Alamain and her ill-begotten son with Stefano DiMera: Stefan O. DiMera ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]). And then Andr\u00e9 is killed by Chad's wife [[Abigail Deveraux|Abigail]] when she learns he has betrayed them all. Kate finds out that Vivian is framing [[Sonny Kiriakis]] ([[Freddie Smith]]), the current CEO of ''Titan Industries'' for sexual harassment. When Kate confronts her, Vivian, cornered, pulls a gun on her, and they scuffle for possession. Vivian is killed, and Kate claims the gun went off accidentally, but Salem [[Police Department|PD]] are not so sure, but they do not have enough evidence to charge her. Stefan is certain that Kate murdered his mother Vivian, and sets out to destroy her. Meanwhile, Kate, being sacked from DiMera, takes over Vivian's scheme to frame Sonny Kiriakis, in the hope she can take over Titan when Sonny is inevitably fired. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anyone, Vivian has been revived, and is being held in a secret lab.\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100109131655/http://daysofourlives.com/show_guide/char_bio_detail_145.html Kate at Sony Pictures]\n*[http://soaps.sheknows.com/days-of-our-lives/characters/kate-roberts-dimera Kate at SheKnows Soaps]\n*[http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/kate.php Kate at soapcentral.com]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roberts, Kate}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Fictional prostitutes]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{short description|Fictional character from Days of Our Lives}}\n{{italic dab}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Kate Roberts\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer      = {{unbulleted list|[[Deborah Adair]] (1993\u20131995)|[[Lauren Koslow]] (1996\u2013present)}}\n| years          = 1993\u2013\n| first          = February 24, 1993\n| last           =  \n| cause          = \n| creator        = [[Sheri Anderson]]\n| introducer     = [[Ken Corday]] and Tom Langan (1993, 1996)\n| classification = [[List of Days of Our Lives cast members#Main cast|Present; regular]]\n| image          = Lauren Koslow as Kate Roberts.png\n| caption        = Lauren Koslow as Kate Roberts\n| image2         = Kate Roberts-Adair.jpg\n| caption2       = Deborah Adair as Kate Roberts\n| image3         = \n| caption3       = \n| nickname       = Katherina (by [[Stefano DiMera|Stefano]])<br> Katie (by [[Roman Brady|Roman]])\n| alias          = Katherine Elizabeth Roberts <br>Kate Brown<br>Kate Kiriakis<br>Kate Brady<br>Kate DiMera\n\n| occupation     = {{unbulleted list|[[Businesswoman]]|[[CEO]] of various companies|[[Bed and breakfast|B&B]] landlady|Waitress|Prostitute (in back story)}}\n| family         = Roberts \n| parents        =\n| siblings       =\n| spouse         = {{unbulleted list|[[Curtis Reed (Days of our Lives)|Curtis Reed]] (1969\u20131993)|[[Victor Kiriakis]] (1993\u20131995){{efn|Victor and Kate were originally married on September 8, 1993.

She is friends with psychiatrist [[Dr. Marlena Evans|Dr Marlena Evans (]][[Deidre Hall]]), and is actually a former patient of hers. Kate kept a journal back when she was Marlena's patient, and Kate breaks in to the house she used to live in Salem trying to find it. At Titan, Kate is given a manuscript of a novel to consider for publication. When she reads it, she realizes it is her life story, plagiarized from her journal, and she blocks its publication.\n\nKate's son [[Lucas Roberts]] ([[Bryan Dattilo]]) joins her in Salem, on a spring break from [[West Point Military Academy]]. When Kate meets [[Dr. Tom Horton|Dr Tom]] and [[Alice Horton]] ([[Macdonald Carey]] and [[Frances Reid]]), Alice realizes Kate used to be a tenant in a house owned by her son [[Bill Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Bill Horton]] (now occupied by his daughter [[Jennifer Horton|Jennifer]], and her husband [[Jack Deveraux]], who found her journal, and wrote the novel); and Tom recognizes her as a former patient, a battered woman. Tom remembers that he delivered her a baby boy (this was Lucas). Kate wants the secrets about her past to remain hidden, but Lucas wants to know the identity of his father. Kate has told him that his father was \"Alan Roberts\" and given him a photo, but Lucas discovers that the photo is of a random stranger, and \"Alan Roberts\" does not exist. In response to Lucas's anger, Kate tells him she does not know his father's name. Kate informs a stunned Lucas that before he was born, she was married to an abusive man, with whom she had two children, and she turned to Lucas's father for comfort. She cries when she tells him the children, his half-brother and half-sister, later died in a motor accident.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate and Victor have become close, and she and [[Vivian Alamain]] ([[Louise Sorel]]), who loves Victor, have become rivals in their pursuit of his love. It looks like Kate is the winner, when Victor asks Kate to marry him \u2013 he wants to have a child with her \u2013 and Kate accepts, and they marry.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" />\n\nA man named [[Curtis Reed (Days of Our Lives)|Curtis Reed]] ([[Nick Benedict]]) arrives in Salem, and starts blackmailing Kate about her past. Lucas learns that this is Kate's former husband, who was violent to her. Then suddenly, in November 1993, Curtis is found shot dead, apparently murdered. Found next to his body in a drugged state is [[Billie Reed]] ([[Lisa Rinna]]), whom Curtis drugged and abused before his death. Kate, Lucas, Billie, and her brother Austin Reed ([[Patrick Muldoon]]) all come under suspicion for Curtis's murder, but Billie becomes the prime suspect. There is a trial where they all have to testify.\n\nMeanwhile, Vivian Alamain has rescued Bill Horton's wife, [[Laura Horton]] ([[Jaime Lyn Bauer]]) from the sanitarium where she was being kept comatose by corrupt staff (in order to extort money for her care from the Horton family). Vivian and Laura crash the trial, and Laura tells the whole court that Kate was married to Curtis (a fact she knows from them both being former tenants of Bill and hers). Then Billie admits on the stand that she is Curtis's daughter, and was sexually abused by Curtis during her childhood. Billie and Austin realize that Kate is their mother, and ''vice versa''. Initially Billie blames Kate for the abuse she suffered; but when Curtis had found out Kate was pregnant with another man's child, he beat her and left her abanded by the side of a road, and vanished with Austin and Billie. Billie is found to be innocent when it is discovered that Curtis was accidentally shot during a scuffle with [[Stefano DiMera]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]).\n\nVivian, who wants to break up Kate and Victor, urges Laura to go public with the fact that Kate had a sexual affair with Laura's husband Bill Horton. Bill was the other man \u2013 the father of Lucas. Laura crashes a party Victor is holding for Kate and tells all. Lucas is outraged that Kate has kept his father from him. Victor also learns from a tabloid reporter that his marriage to Kate is invalid, as Curtis was still alive when they married.\n\nKate wants to marry Victor legally, and Victor promises to marry her, but only if she gives him an heir; and when Kate learns she will have difficulty in conceiving another child, they decide to use [[in vitro fertilization]]. Some embryos begin to form, but Vivian swaps the embryos and has Victor and Kate's embryos implanted in her.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" /> Vivian gives birth to a healthy baby boy, [[Philip Kiriakis]] on February 21, 1995. While pregnant with Philip, Vivian drives a wedge between Kate and Victor's relationship, and tricks Victor into marrying her. Vivian poisons the pilot of a plane transporting Kate, and when the plane crashes on April 24, 1995, Kate is believed killed.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" />\n\nAfter surviving the crash, Kate (now [[Lauren Koslow]]) returns to Salem on January 25, 1996, determined to win custody of her son Philip. Learning Vivian and Victor are together, Kate seeks revenge. Kate vows to take Victor's Titan Corporation and his son Philip (still an infant at the time) away from them. Victor suffers a stroke, and Vivian is arrested for her schemes.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\"/> Kate is now in charge of Victor's empire. Billie also returns, closely followed by [[Franco Kelly]] ([[Victor Alfieri]]). Kate hires Franco to break up Bo and Hope, so Billie can be happy with Bo.\n\nKate is also now a grandmother: [[Sami Brady]] ([[Alison Sweeney]]) gave birth to a son whilst Kate was away. His name is [[Will Roberts (Days of Our Lives)|Will]], and Sami claims he is Austin's, but he is actually Lucas's child. Sami misleads everyone in her bid to get Austin to marry her, and when the truth of Will's paternity comes out, Sami fights Lucas for custody. Thus begins an epic battle between Kate and Sami. Sami finds out that Kate was once a prostitute and blackmails Kate. Sami falls in love with Franco and they prepare to marry. Kate wants to stop it, because she fears Lucas will lose Will. Kate tries to blackmail Franco about his mob past, but Franco attacks Kate with a poker on the eve of the wedding. Lucas saves Kate by shooting Franco, who dies instantly, and Kate frames Sami for the killing. At the trial for Franco's death, Sami is convicted and is sentenced to death. As she is about to be executed, Lucas confesses in a bid to save her. However, Kate has just persuaded a dying man to sign a false confession and Sami is saved, and she and Lucas both go free.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate is still battling with Vivian for control over Titan. Kate begins a relationship with Vivian's nephew, [[Nicholas Alamain]], but he leaves town. She then attempts to sly her way back into Victor's good graces. She blows her chances, however, when she is caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' with [[Mob Boss|mob boss]] [[Vincent Moroni]] ([[Carl Weintraub]]). She conspires with him to kill Victor at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. The plan accidentally kills Vincent's only child, [[Angela Moroni]] ([[Ayda Field]]), and causes Vincent to commit suicide. Victor, realizing Kate's plan, flees for his life and fakes his death. He reveals himself to her the night she sets the Kiriakis mansion on fire and attempts to kill him with a poker. Victor escapes, but Lucas is severely burned.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\"/> Victor kicks Kate out of the house, but does not tell Philip about his mother's murder attempts on him. Philip's plea causes Victor to provide Kate with a small allowance.\n\nKate gets a job at ''Basic Black'', and begins dating [[Roman Brady]] ([[Josh Taylor (actor)|Josh Taylor]]). Kate and Roman find out that they are the biological parents of twins [[Rex Brady]] ([[Eric Winter]]) and [[Cassie Brady]] ([[Alexis Thorpe]]). Roman asks Kate to marry him, and she agrees. They have a beautiful wedding, but the reception is shattered when Kate finds Roman's apparently-dead body. She mourns him deeply, but it doesn't stop her from destroying his daughter Sami's relationship with her son Lucas. Kate encourages Philip to spend more time with [[Belle Black]] ([[Martha Madison]]). Cassie, too, is apparently murdered. Her body is found with multiple stab wounds in a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] [[Pi\u00f1ata|pinata]]. Kate is found holding the bloody knife and is arrested but, in reality, Cassie's and Roman's apparent deaths, as well as several other Salem residents, are staged in a plot by [[Andr\u00e9 DiMera]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]).\n\nKate begins a relationship with [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]] ([[Drake Hogestyn]]), after helping him deal with a [[Drug-addiction|drug addiction]]. However, as soon as the John and Kate make plans to marry, both their spouses return to Salem alive. Roman ends things with Kate for good. Lucas and Sami are to marry, but Kate stops the wedding in the nick of time, thanks to her discovery and revelation that Sami has been disguising herself as a man called Stan, and selling John the illicit drugs he became addicted to. Kate invites John Black to live with her after Marlena kicks him out of her home. Kate comforts Philip when [[Belle Black]]'s daughter [[Claire Brady (Days of Our Lives)|Claire Brady]], whom Philip believes is his, turns out [[Shawn-Douglas Brady]]'s. Philip leaves town. She is terrified when he goes missing, but comes back after receiving extensive amounts of surgery. He is granted temporary custody of Claire, but is devastated when Shawn and Belle kidnap her.\n\nKate, in her ongoing efforts to keep Lucas from marrying Sami, enlists the help of [[EJ DiMera]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]), who is using the alias EJ Wells, to seduce Sami away from Lucas. Her efforts fail when EJ is revealed to be the son of [[Stefano DiMera]]. Lucas and Sami are deeply in love, and are set to marry again, and this time Kate fails to stop it, despite her best effforts. Sami and Lucas start their life together despite Kate's interference. In retaliation for their scheming, Lucas turns Kate and EJ in to the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] for their questionable financial records. Kate turns to [[Stefano DiMera]] after learning she is broke. Stefano provides her with enough money to start her own business called ''Kate's Hearth and Home'', a [[Martha Stewart]]-like brand of housewares. She hires Stefano's son [[Tony DiMera]] ([[Thaao Penghlis|Thaao Penghis]]) to do the advertising. Kate no longer worries about Lucas and Sami, because Stefano has blackmailed Sami into a marriage with EJ, and Sami has fallen for him.\n\nKate turns her attention back to Philip, who is in trouble with [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]], and to her granddaughter [[Chelsea Brady]] ([[Rachel Melvin]]), who is recovering from surgery. Chelsea's surgery is successful, and soon starts dating her surgeon [[Daniel Jonas]] ([[Shawn Christian|Shawn Cristian]]). In November 2008, Kate is diagnosed with [[Lung cancer staging|stage IV]] [[lung cancer]], and receives [[bone marrow]] from [[Chloe Lane]]. Lucas begins a relationship with [[Chloe Lane]]. Kate learns that Chloe cheated on Lucas with [[Daniel Jonas]], and is set on revenge. She poisons her, and Chloe is put in a [[coma]]. Kate becomes the only suspect, and to avoid jail time she marries [[Stefano DiMera]] who destroys the evidence against her.<ref name=\"Kate Robers Bio\" /> Later Phillip has a one-night stand with Chloe, resulting in grandson [[Parker Jonas|Parker]] being born, one month premature. When the truth comes out, Kate does everything in her power to make sure Chloe doesn't see her son, including driving her to suicide (which failed, thanks to Phillip saving her) and calling Phillip (as Chloe), using a recording of Chloe's voice that she edited to make Chloe sound like an unfit mother. When Phillip subsequently moves to [[Chicago]] with Parker, Kate blames Chloe (even though it was Kate's own doing) and later hires a thug named Quinn who forces Chloe to become a prostitute, much like Kate was forced to be in her own youth.\n\nOn August 31, 2011, Kate announces to Victor plans to resurrect ''Countess Wilhelmina Cosmetics'' with brand expansion and new product ideas, under Titan's rule, with Billie's blessing. However, Victor seems apprehensive about the deal, believing Stefano turned down her deal. She later brings back her daughter, Billie, to help run the company by her side. She also interacts with new arrival, [[Ian McAllister (Days of Our Lives)|Ian McAllister]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]), with whom she once had a romantic relationship in [[Paris]]. The two fall into bed in April 2012, which she later regrets. Upon Stefano's return from Alamania, he holds a romantic dinner for Kate with all of her favorite foods, then reveals that he knows about her affair with Ian McAllister. Kate tries to explain but Stefano ends their marriage and takes control of ''Countess Wilhelmina Cosmetics'' and ''Kate's Hearth and Home'', making Kate's longtime enemy, Sami Brady, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]. Ian then offers Kate a job as co-CEO of ''MadWorld'', to work alongside [[Madison James]] as competition against Sami. Kate and Ian continue their relationship as Kate begins to get along with Madison. Stefano is apparently murdered, and with so many enemies, there are many suspects, including Kate. However, during a town-wide disaster, when Salem is rocked with a series of explosions, Ian reveals that he is behind the death of Stefano and framing of EJ, and that he only loved Madison, and is merely using Kate to take the DiMera fortune. Kate ends their relationship, and he is sent to jail; but it is revealed that only an imposter of Stefano died, and that Stefano was really alive and held captive by Ian. Stefano fails to make amends with his son, EJ, and heads to Europe for business. Kate tracks down Stefano, insisting he give her another chance, but they finalize the divorce, and Kate realizes that she and Stefano are finished.\n\nKate takes [[Chad DiMera]] ([[Casey Deidrick]]) under her wing, kind of as a proxy mother, after his own mother dies. Kate supports her grandson Will ([[Chandler Massey]]), when he comes out as gay. Kate also makes amends with Daniel Jonas, and updates him on Parker. Kate is challenged in 2013 when Chloe Lane and her mother, [[Nancy Wesley]] ([[Patrika Darbo]]), return to Salem, and it turns out that Parker is Daniel Jonas's son after all. Kate eventually starts a secret relationship with [[Rafe Hernandez]] ([[Galen Gering]]) after they have a drunken one-night stand. She worries that Stefano may threaten Rafe because of this. Kate later breaks things off with Rafe. Kate becomes a great-grandmother when Will has a daughter, [[Arianna Horton]] (Harper and Sydnee Udell), with his ex-girlfriend [[Gabi Hernandez]] ([[Camila Banus|Camilla Banus]]). Kate offers to have Gabi and Arianna live with her, but Gabi chooses to live with [[Will Horton and Sonny Kiriakis|Will and his partner Sonny]], thanking Kate for the offer.\n\nKate begins a series of ill-fated short-lived romantic relationships with some extremely dubious and villainous men: the drug lord [[Clyde Weston]] (jailed); her ex-husband [[Victor Kiriakis]]'s no-good half-brother [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Deimos Kiriakis|Deimos Kiriakis]] (murdered); Rafe and Gabi's assassin father Eduardo Hernandez (jailed); and then the serial-killer Andr\u00e9 DiMera, whom she marries. She runs ''DiMera Enterprises'' with Chad (now [[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]) and Andr\u00e9, until Andr\u00e9 betrays them, selling them out to her old rival Vivian Alamain and her ill-begotten son with Stefano DiMera: Stefan O. DiMera ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]). And then Andr\u00e9 is killed by Chad's wife [[Abigail Deveraux|Abigail]] when she learns he has betrayed them all. Kate finds out that Vivian is framing [[Sonny Kiriakis]] ([[Freddie Smith]]), the current CEO of ''Titan Industries'' for sexual harassment. When Kate confronts her, Vivian, cornered, pulls a gun on her, and they scuffle for possession. Vivian is killed, and Kate claims the gun went off accidentally, but Salem [[Police Department|PD]] are not so sure, but they do not have enough evidence to charge her. Stefan is certain that Kate murdered his mother Vivian, and sets out to destroy her. Meanwhile, Kate, being sacked from DiMera, takes over Vivian's scheme to frame Sonny Kiriakis, in the hope she can take over Titan when Sonny is inevitably fired. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anyone, Vivian has been revived, and is being held in a secret lab.\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100109131655/http://daysofourlives.com/show_guide/char_bio_detail_145.html Kate at Sony Pictures]\n*[http://soaps.sheknows.com/days-of-our-lives/characters/kate-roberts-dimera Kate at SheKnows Soaps]\n*[http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/kate.php Kate at soapcentral.com]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roberts, Kate}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Fictional prostitutes]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Aliveness Cascade", "label": "safe", "comment": "hyperlinking \"backstory\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Roberts_(Days_of_Our_Lives)"}

In 1998, ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction|general nonfiction]] and the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Aventis Prize for Best Science Book]].

Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various [[positive feedback|positive feedback loops]]. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, [[written language]] or the development among Eurasians of resistance to [[endemic disease]]s), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian [[genome]]s.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinean]] politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the [[Europeans]] who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term \"[[Cargo cult|cargo]]\" for inventions and manufactured goods, \"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\" (p.&nbsp;14)\n\nDiamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: \"People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power.\" Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, \"have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.\" (p.&nbsp;15)\n\nThe peoples of other continents ([[sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[New Guineans]], and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases \u2013 referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous [[Khoisan]] peoples \u2013 largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. He believes this is due to these societies' technological and immunological advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last [[Ice Age]].\n\n=== Title ===\nThe book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance, despite sometimes being vastly outnumbered \u2013 superior weapons provided immediate military superiority ([[guns]]); Eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations, who had no immunity, making it easier to maintain control over them ([[Microorganism|germs]]); and durable means of transport ([[Infrastructure|steel]]) enabled imperialism.\n\nDiamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable [[Agrarian society|agricultural societies]] ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized [[State (polity)|states]] capable of dominating others.\n\n=== Outline of theory ===\nDiamond argues that Eurasian [[civilization]] is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.\n\nThe first step towards civilization is the move from [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a [[climate]] dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for [[domestication]] and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of [[crops]] and livestock leads to food [[Excess supply|surpluses]]. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technological innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop [[ruling class]]es and supporting [[bureaucracies]], which in turn lead to the organization of [[nation-state]]s and empires.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\">{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton & Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. In particular, Eurasia has [[barley]], two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] for food; [[flax]] for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.\n\nAs early Western Asian civilizations began to trade, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, most notably horses and [[donkey]]s for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over {{convert|100|lb}} domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to [[extinction]], probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the [[Pleistocene]], whilst the only [[Domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] in [[New Guinea]] came from the East Asian mainland during the [[Austronesian]] settlement some 4,000\u20135,000 years ago. Biological relatives of the horse, including [[zebra]]s and [[onager]]s, proved untameable; and although [[African elephant]]s can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity;<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\" /><ref name=\"McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond\" /> Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 \"candidates\") as an instance of the [[Anna Karenina principle]]: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He also makes the argument that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.{{R|Diamond1997GGS|pages=168\u2013174}}\n\nEurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; [[ox|bullocks]] for [[tillage]] of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.\n\n[[File:Continental axes by Jared Diamond.png|thumb|[[Continent]]al axes according to [[Jared Diamond]] in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''.]]\n\nEurasia's large landmass and long east-west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication, and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases. Its east-west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons. The Americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one [[latitude]] for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east-west orientation: in the [[first millennium BCE]], the [[Mediterranean]] areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the [[first millennium]] CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\" /><ref name=\"McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond\" />\n\nThe plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made [[division of labor]] possible. The rise of non-farming specialists such as craftsmen and [[scribe]]s accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.\n\nEurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[influenza]] were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans.  [[Natural selection]] forced Eurasians to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a wide range of [[pathogen]]s. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around (the \"trade\" in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia: endemic malaria and [[yellow fever]] made these regions notorious as the \"white man's grave\";<ref name=\"RossMacGregor1903 offightAgainstMalaria\">{{cite journal\n|title = The Fight against Malaria: An Industrial Necessity for Our African Colonies |author1=Ross, R. |author2=MacGregor, W. |journal=Journal of the Royal African Society |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=January 1903 |pages=149\u2013160 |jstor=714548 }}</ref> and [[syphilis]] may have originated in the Americas).{{NoteTag|The origin of syphilis is still debated.

Threats posed by immediate neighbors ensured governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly, whilst the region's leading powers changed over time. Other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires, without competitors that might have forced the nation to reverse mistaken policies such as China [[Haijin|banning the building of ocean-going ships]]. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged [[desertification]], and hurt [[soil fertility]].\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Jared Diamond's big five.jpg|thumb|The \"big five\"]]\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' argues that [[urbanization|cities]] require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, division of labor allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.\n\nThe crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the [[Fertile Crescent]] since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, [[teosinte]].\n\nAlso important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of 'large' domesticable animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Eurasia]]. Of the remaining nine, only two (the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.\n\nDue to the [[Anna Karenina principle]], surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the zebra, [[antelope]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[African elephant]] were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The [[Holocene extinction event]] eliminated many of the [[megafauna]] that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and [[Holocene extinction event#North America|Diamond argues]] that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).\n\nSmaller domesticable animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and [[guinea pig]]s may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain a large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.\n\n=== Geography ===\nDiamond also argues that geography shaped [[Migration (human)|human migration]], not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun.\n\nThe dominant [[Out of Africa theory]] holds that modern humans developed east of the [[Great Rift Valley]] of the African continent at one time or another. The [[Sahara]] kept people from migrating north to the Fertile Crescent, until later when the [[Nile River]] valley became accommodating.\n\nDiamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.\n\nDiamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian (especially Chinese). The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many [[natural barrier]]s allowed the development of competing nation-states. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.\n\n=== Germs ===\nIn the later context of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|killed off by diseases]] brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in [[History of Australia (1788\u20131850)|Australia]] and [[History of South Africa|South Africa]]. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were decimated by smallpox, measles, influenza and other diseases.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=A short history of the world|url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofwo00blai|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1566635073}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Smallpox Epidemic Strikes at the Cape|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|website=South Africa History Online|date=16 March 2011|access-date=April 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428140710/https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|archive-date=April 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHow was it then that diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through [[natural selection]] (see the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[hunter-gatherers]] and farmers.\n\nHe mentions the tropical diseases (mainly [[malaria]]) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.\n\n=== Success and failure ===\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' focuses on why some populations succeeded. His later book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.\n\n== Intellectual background ==\nIn the 1930s, the [[Annales School]] in France undertook the study of [[Longue dur\u00e9e|long-term historical structures]] by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Cohen1998GeographyRedux\">{{cite news| title= Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are | newspaper = The New York Times | date=March 21, 1998 | author=Cohen, P. | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D81738F932A15750C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Jared Diamond already considered the question of \"why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?\" in ''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (part four).\n\n== Reception ==\nThe reception of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' by academics has been mixed.\n\nMany have praised the book for its synthesis of different subjects, but note that the large scope of the work will inevitably lead to some inaccuracies and oversimplifications. International Relations scholars [[Iver B. Neumann]] (of the London School of Economics and Political Science) and Einar Wigen (of University of Oslo) use ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' as a foil for their own inter-disciplinary work. They write that \"while empirical details should, of course, be correct, the primary yardstick for this kind of work cannot be attention to detail.\" They state, \"Diamond stated clearly that any problematique of this magnitude had to be radically multi-causal and then set to work on one complex of factors, namely ecological ones\", and note that while Diamond \"immediately came in for heavy criticism from specialists working in the disparate fields on which he drew.... Until somebody can come up with a better way of interpreting and adding to Diamond\u2019s material with a view to understanding the same overarching problematique, his is the best treatment available of the ecological preconditions for why one part of the world, and not another, came to dominate.\"<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Introduction|last=Wigen|first=Einar|last2=Neumann|first2=Iver B.|date=2018|website=The Steppe Tradition in International Relations: Russians, Turks and European State Building 4000 BCE\u20132017 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/9781108355308.003|url-status=live|title=The Steppe Tradition in International Relations|pages=1\u201325|isbn=9781108355308}}</ref> In a review of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' that ultimately commended the book, historian Tom Tomlinson wrote, \"Given the magnitude of the task he has set himself, it is inevitable that Professor Diamond uses very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument.\"<ref name=\"Tomlinson1998GGSreview\">{{cite web|date = May 1998|url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|title = Review:Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|publisher = Institute of Historical Research|accessdate = 2008-03-14|last = Tom Tomlinson|quote = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210040/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|archive-date = September 27, 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nEmory University historian Tonio Andrade writes that Diamond's book \"may not satisfy professional historians on all counts\" but that it \"does make a bold and compelling case for the different developments that occurred in the Old World versus the New (he is less convincing in his attempts to separate Africa from Eurasia).\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Tonio|date=2010-01-01|title=Beyond Guns, Germs, and Steel: European Expansion and Maritime Asia, 1400-1750|journal=Journal of Early Modern History|language=en|volume=14|issue=1\u20132|pages=165\u2013186|doi=10.1163/138537810X12632734397142|issn=1385-3783}}</ref> Another historian, professor [[J.

Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various [[positive feedback|positive feedback loops]]. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, [[written language]] or the development among Eurasians of resistance to [[endemic disease]]s), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian [[genome]]s.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinean]] politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the [[Europeans]] who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term \"[[Cargo cult|cargo]]\" for inventions and manufactured goods, \"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\" (p.&nbsp;14)\n\nDiamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: \"People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power.\" Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, \"have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.\" (p.&nbsp;15)\n\nThe peoples of other continents ([[sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[New Guineans]], and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases \u2013 referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous [[Khoisan]] peoples \u2013 largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. He believes this is due to these societies' technological and immunological advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last [[Ice Age]].\n\n=== Title ===\nThe book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance, despite sometimes being vastly outnumbered \u2013 superior weapons provided immediate military superiority ([[guns]]); Eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations, who had no immunity, making it easier to maintain control over them ([[Microorganism|germs]]); and durable means of transport ([[Infrastructure|steel]]) enabled imperialism.\n\nDiamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable [[Agrarian society|agricultural societies]] ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized [[State (polity)|states]] capable of dominating others.\n\n=== Outline of theory ===\nDiamond argues that Eurasian [[civilization]] is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.\n\nThe first step towards civilization is the move from [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a [[climate]] dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for [[domestication]] and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of [[crops]] and livestock leads to food [[Excess supply|surpluses]]. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technological innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop [[ruling class]]es and supporting [[bureaucracies]], which in turn lead to the organization of [[nation-state]]s and empires.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\">{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W.

In particular, Eurasia has [[barley]], two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] for food; [[flax]] for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.\n\nAs early Western Asian civilizations began to trade, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, most notably horses and [[donkey]]s for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over {{convert|100|lb}} domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to [[extinction]], probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the [[Pleistocene]], whilst the only [[Domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] in [[New Guinea]] came from the East Asian mainland during the [[Austronesian]] settlement some 4,000\u20135,000 years ago.

He also makes the argument that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.{{R|Diamond1997GGS|pages=168\u2013174}}\n\nEurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; [[ox|bullocks]] for [[tillage]] of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.\n\n[[File:Continental axes by Jared Diamond.png|thumb|[[Continent]]al axes according to [[Jared Diamond]] in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''.]]\n\nEurasia's large landmass and long east-west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication, and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases. Its east-west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons. The Americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one [[latitude]] for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east-west orientation: in the [[first millennium BCE]], the [[Mediterranean]] areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the [[first millennium]] CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.<ref name=\"Diamond1997GGS\" /><ref name=\"McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond\" />\n\nThe plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made [[division of labor]] possible. The rise of non-farming specialists such as craftsmen and [[scribe]]s accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.\n\nEurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[influenza]] were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans.  [[Natural selection]] forced Eurasians to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a wide range of [[pathogen]]s. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around (the \"trade\" in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia: endemic malaria and [[yellow fever]] made these regions notorious as the \"white man's grave\";<ref name=\"RossMacGregor1903 offightAgainstMalaria\">{{cite journal\n|title = The Fight against Malaria: An Industrial Necessity for Our African Colonies |author1=Ross, R. |author2=MacGregor, W. |journal=Journal of the Royal African Society |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=January 1903 |pages=149\u2013160 |jstor=714548 }}</ref> and [[syphilis]] may have originated in the Americas).{{NoteTag|The origin of syphilis is still debated.

Threats posed by immediate neighbors ensured governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly, whilst the region's leading powers changed over time. Other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires, without competitors that might have forced the nation to reverse mistaken policies such as China [[Haijin|banning the building of ocean-going ships]]. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged [[desertification]], and hurt [[soil fertility]].\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Jared Diamond's big five.jpg|thumb|The \"big five\"]]\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' argues that [[urbanization|cities]] require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, division of labor allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.\n\nThe crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the [[Fertile Crescent]] since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, [[teosinte]].\n\nAlso important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of 'large' domesticable animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Eurasia]]. Of the remaining nine, only two (the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.\n\nDue to the [[Anna Karenina principle]], surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the zebra, [[antelope]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[African elephant]] were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The [[Holocene extinction event]] eliminated many of the [[megafauna]] that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and [[Holocene extinction event#North America|Diamond argues]] that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).\n\nSmaller domesticable animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and [[guinea pig]]s may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.\n\n=== Geography ===\nDiamond also argues that geography shaped [[Migration (human)|human migration]], not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun.\n\nThe dominant [[Out of Africa theory]] holds that modern humans developed east of the [[Great Rift Valley]] of the African continent at one time or another. The [[Sahara]] kept people from migrating north to the Fertile Crescent, until later when the [[Nile River]] valley became accommodating.\n\nDiamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.\n\nDiamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian (especially Chinese). The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many [[natural barrier]]s allowed the development of competing nation-states. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.\n\n=== Germs ===\nIn the later context of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|killed off by diseases]] brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in [[History of Australia (1788\u20131850)|Australia]] and [[History of South Africa|South Africa]]. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were decimated by smallpox, measles, influenza and other diseases.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=A short history of the world|url=https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofwo00blai|url-access=registration|date=2002|publisher=Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1566635073}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Smallpox Epidemic Strikes at the Cape|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|website=South Africa History Online|date=16 March 2011|access-date=April 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428140710/https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|archive-date=April 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHow was it then that diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through [[natural selection]] (see the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[hunter-gatherers]] and farmers.\n\nHe mentions the tropical diseases (mainly [[malaria]]) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.\n\n=== Success and failure ===\n''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' focuses on why some populations succeeded. His later book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.\n\n== Intellectual background ==\nIn the 1930s, the [[Annales School]] in France undertook the study of [[Longue dur\u00e9e|long-term historical structures]] by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Cohen1998GeographyRedux\">{{cite news| title= Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are | newspaper = The New York Times | date=March 21, 1998 | author=Cohen, P. | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D81738F932A15750C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Jared Diamond already considered the question of \"why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?\" in ''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (part four).\n\n== Reception ==\nThe reception of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' by academics has been mixed.\n\nMany have praised the book for its synthesis of different subjects, but note that the large scope of the work will inevitably lead to some inaccuracies and oversimplifications.

Neumann]] (of the London School of Economics and Political Science) and Einar Wigen (of University of Oslo) use ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' as a foil for their own inter-disciplinary work. They write that \"while empirical details should, of course, be correct, the primary yardstick for this kind of work cannot be attention to detail.\" They state, \"Diamond stated clearly that any problematique of this magnitude had to be radically multi-causal and then set to work on one complex of factors, namely ecological ones\", and note that while Diamond \"immediately came in for heavy criticism from specialists working in the disparate fields on which he drew....

In 1984, he became the first $100,000 grand champion winner in the comedy category of the TV show ''[[Star Search]]''. This led to his first appearance, at age 23, on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', making him one of the youngest comedians ever to perform on the show.

He also opened in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for [[Frank Sinatra]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], the [[Beach Boys]], [[The Righteous Brothers]] and [[Julio Iglesias]].\n\nAfter achieving a strong measure of success with stand-up comedy, Garrett decided to change gears and try his luck with performing on TV.

He also appeared for a week on the game show ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'' in 1987. He also appeared on [[Hollywood Squares]] including a memorable moment when he impersonated [[Bill Cosby]] during a question about [[Jell-o]]. He then appeared in the short-lived summer comedy ''[[First Impressions (TV series)|First Impressions]]'' ([[CBS]], 1988), in which he was a divorced father who makes a living doing impressions, in a one-time spot as a bank loan officer on ''[[Roseanne]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), and ''[[The Pursuit of Happiness (TV series)|The Pursuit of Happiness]]'' ([[NBC]], 1995\u201396), in which he was the hero's gay best friend.

Garrett has also made an appearance on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' playing a [[hitman]] who attempts to kill [[Will Smith]]'s character.\n\n[[File:Brad Garrett.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Garrett in May 2007]]\nGarrett's distinctive deep voice has landed him prolific work as a [[voice actor]], such as on ''[[Mighty Ducks (TV series)|Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]'', ''[[The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper]]'', ''[[Project Geeker]]'', ''[[Biker Mice from Mars]]'', ''Steven Spielberg Presents: [[Toonsylvania]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Asterix and the Vikings]]'', ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'',  and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' as [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].\n\nHis role on ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' won him five [[Emmy Award]] nominations, and the 2002, 2003 and 2005 Emmy Awards for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]].\n\nIn 1990, Garrett appeared as a semi-regular panelist on the revival of ''[[Match Game]]''.

Garrett was hoping to do a spin-off with his character Robert Barone from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' when the show ended its nine-year run in 2005, but he withdrew in October 2005 due to inaction from CBS that led to a number of the writers from ''Raymond'' leaving and taking other jobs.\n\nIn 2005, Garrett appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] playing Murray the Cop in the revival of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'' with [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Matthew Broderick]].

The act was introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Parliament, on 19 July 2019 by the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Thawar Chand Gehlot]], in light of the lapse of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018. The 2019 act and the immediately preceding 2018 bill, were both preceded by a 2016 version,. They were met with protests and criticism by transgender persons, lawyers, and activists in India. The 2016 bill was sent to a [[Standing committee (India)|standing committee]] which submitted its report in July  2017. Following this, the Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill in December 2018. However, it did not incorporate many of the committee's recommendations. Although members of the opposition criticised the 2019 act and assured transgender persons of not voting in favour of it, it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019 and by the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of the Parliament, on 26 November 2019. The [[President of India|president]] assented to it on 5 December 2019, upon which the act was notified in the ''[[Gazette of India]]''. It was brought into effect from 10 January 2020 onwards vide a notification in the ''Gazette'' on the same day.\n\nFollowing protests by the [[LGBT|queer community]] against the 2016 and 2018 bills, the 2019 act has done away with few of the severely criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as criminalisation of begging and the establishment of a district screening committee to process applications for issuance of transgender person certificates. However, it fails to incorporate yet other principles in line with the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judgment in ''[[National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India]]'' (''NALSA v. UOI'') in 2014, such as the right of transgender persons to self-perceived gender identity without undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], and mandatory reservations in jobs and educational institutions. The act has also been criticised for the lesser punishment for crimes against transgender persons compared with punishment for crimes against [[cisgender|cisgender persons]]. On 27 January 2020, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the central government in a petition filed challenging the constitutionality of the 2019 legislation\n\nIn January 2014, while judicial pronouncement in the ''NALSA'' petition was pending, the ministry had published an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender persons, after consultations with transgender persons. [[Tiruchi Siva]], of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party, had introduced the [[Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014|Rights of Transgender Persons Bill]] in 2014, in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the house in 2015. The 2014 bill contains provisions progressive to those in the bills introduced in between 2016 and 2019, but has been pending in the Lok Sabha since 2015. Prior to the [[Indian general elections, 2019|2019 general elections]], parties such as the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] had promised in their respective electoral manifestoes to, respectively, withdraw the 2018 bill \u2014 while introducing a new one consulting members of the queer community \u2014 and pass the 2014 bill.\n\n==History and background==\n[[File:Hijra and companions in Eastern Bengal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hijras in eastern Bengal, ''circa'' 1860]]\n{{LGBT rights}}\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in ''National Legal Services Authority v.

(law)|act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] with the objective to provide for protection of rights of [[Transgender|transgender persons]], their welfare, and other related matters. The act was introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Parliament, on 19 July 2019 by the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Thawar Chand Gehlot]], in light of the lapse of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018. The 2019 act and the immediately preceding 2018 bill, were both preceded by a 2016 version,. They were met with protests and criticism by transgender persons, lawyers, and activists in India. The 2016 bill was sent to a [[Standing committee (India)|standing committee]] which submitted its report in July  2017. Following this, the Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill in December 2018. However, it did not incorporate many of the committee's recommendations. Although members of the opposition criticised the 2019 act and assured transgender persons of not voting in favour of it, it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019 and by the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of the Parliament, on 26 November 2019. The [[President of India|president]] assented to it on 5 December 2019, upon which the act was notified in the ''[[Gazette of India]]''. It was brought into effect from 10 January 2020 onwards vide a notification in the ''Gazette'' on the same day.\n\nFollowing protests by the [[LGBT|queer community]] against the 2016 and 2018 bills, the 2019 act has done away with few of the severely criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as criminalisation of begging and the establishment of a district screening committee to process applications for issuance of transgender person certificates. However, it fails to incorporate yet other principles in line with the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judgment in ''[[National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India]]'' (''NALSA v. UOI'') in 2014, such as the right of transgender persons to self-perceived gender identity without undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], and mandatory reservations in jobs and educational institutions. The act has also been criticised for the lesser punishment for crimes against transgender persons compared with punishment for crimes against [[cisgender|cisgender persons]]. On 27 January 2020, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the central government in a petition filed challenging the constitutionality of the 2019 legislation\n\nIn January 2014, while judicial pronouncement in the ''NALSA'' petition was pending, the ministry had published an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender persons, after consultations with transgender persons. [[Tiruchi Siva]], of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party, had introduced the [[Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014|Rights of Transgender Persons Bill]] in 2014, in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the house in 2015. The 2014 bill contains provisions progressive to those in the bills introduced in between 2016 and 2019, but has been pending in the Lok Sabha since 2015. Prior to the [[Indian general elections, 2019|2019 general elections]], parties such as the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] had promised in their respective electoral manifestoes to, respectively, withdraw the 2018 bill \u2014 while introducing a new one consulting members of the queer community \u2014 and pass the 2014 bill.\n\n==History and background==\n[[File:Hijra and companions in Eastern Bengal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hijras in eastern Bengal, ''circa'' 1860]]\n{{LGBT rights}}\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in ''National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India'' (also known as, ''NALSA v.

The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\n\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood.

Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Jack Epps</ref> Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker [[Saab automobile|Saab]] in the early 1980s, where a [[Saab 900]] turbo is shown racing a [[Saab 37 Viggen]] fighter jet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Matthew Modine]] turned down the role of [[Pete Mitchell (Top Gun)|LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell]] (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film's pro-military stance went against his politics.

The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to [[Cuba]], the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with the producers</ref> Maverick's love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the US military's prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> The \"Charlie\" character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to [[Christine Fox|Christine \"Legs\" Fox]], a civilian mathematician employed by the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense.<ref name=Richman1985/>\n\n[[Julianne Phillips]] was in consideration for the role of Charlie, and had been scheduled to perform a screen test opposite Tom Cruise.<ref name=AFI/>\n\nRear Admiral Pete \"Viper\" Pettigrew, a former Navy aviator, Vietnam War veteran, and Topgun instructor served as a technical advisor on the film, and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a colleague of Charlie's.\n\nFormer Top Gun instructor pilot and Congressman [[Duke Cunningham|Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham]] claimed to have been the inspiration for Pete Mitchell, although the film's producers have denied that the character was based on any specific Naval Aviator.<ref>{{cite news| first=Alex| last=Roth| newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune| url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20060115-9999-lz1n15legend.html| title= down Cunningham's legend| date=2006-01-15| page=A-1| accessdate=2006-02-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:VF-111 TOPGUN MOVIE.jpg|thumb|F-14A Tomcats of Fighter Squadrons [[VF-51]] \"Screaming Eagles\" and [[VF-111 (1956-95)|VF-111]] \"Sundowners\", and F-5E/F Tiger IIs of the Navy Fighter Weapons School]]\n\nThe Navy made several aircraft from F-14 fighter squadron [[VF-51]] \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Tom Skerritt mentions in the scene at his home) available for the film. Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|7800|1985|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties.

During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to shoot aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|25000|1985|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier's captain a US$25,000 check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Tony Scott and Pete Pettigrew</ref>\n\n[[File:Filming of Top Gun movie (01) 1985.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Filming and [[clapperboard]] of ''Top Gun'' on July 5, 1985.]]\n\nMost of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at [[Naval Air Station Fallon]], in [[Nevada]], using ground-mounted cameras.

The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl's body nor his aircraft was recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown.<ref>Ashurst, Sam (November 4, 2008).

The [[Top Gun (1986 video game)|original game]] was released in 1986 under the same title as the film. It was released on [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Atari ST]]. Another game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (1987 video game)|Top Gun]]'', was released in 1987 for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, ''Top Gun: The Second Mission'', was released for the NES three years later.\n\nAnother game, ''[[Top Gun: Fire at Will]]'', was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the [[PlayStation|Sony PlayStation]] platform. ''[[Top Gun: Hornet's Nest]]'' was released in 1998. ''[[Top Gun: Combat Zones]]'' was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001 and was subsequently released for the [[GameCube]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Combat Zones'' features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled ''Top Gun'' was released for the [[Nintendo DS]]. A 2010 game, also titled ''[[Top Gun (2010 video game)|Top Gun]]'', retells the film's story. At E3 2011, a new game was announced, ''Top Gun: Hard Lock'', which was released in March 2012 for [[Xbox 360]], PC, and [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Top Gun (film, 1986)}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|id=57496}}\n* {{IMDb title|0092099}}\n* {{tcmdb title|16475}}\n* [http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/top-gun-30th-anniversary-remember-the-movie-with-this-exclusive-artwork-750546 'Top Gun' 30th Anniversary Exclusive Art Work] on [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]]\n* {{Allmovie title|50435}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|top_gun}}\n* [https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=topgun.htm Top Gun] at [[Box Office Mojo]]\n* [https://www.paramountmovies.com/movies/top-gun Paramount Movies]\n{{Tony Scott}}\n{{Jerry Bruckheimer}}\n\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s action drama films]]\n[[Category:2013 3D films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American action drama films]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Cold War aviation films]]\n[[Category:Films about aviators]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Don Simpson]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tony Scott]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Diego]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Diego]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Top Gun]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Harold Faltermeyer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Giorgio Moroder]]\n[[Category:3D re-releases]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the film}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Top Gun\n| image          = Top Gun Movie.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Tony Scott]]\n| producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Don Simpson]]\n* [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n}}\n| writer         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Jim Cash]]\n* [[Jack Epps Jr.]]\n}}\n| based on       = {{based on|''\"Top Guns\"''|Ehud Yonay}}\n| starring       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Tom Cruise]]\n* [[Kelly McGillis]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]]\n* [[Anthony Edwards]]\n* [[Tom Skerritt]]}}<!--NAMES ON POSTER ONLY-->\n| music          = [[Harold Faltermeyer]]\n| cinematography = [[Jeffrey L.

The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in ''[[California (magazine)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. It also marked the debut of actor [[Adrian Pasdar]]. Cruise plays [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].\n\n''Top Gun'' was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent.<ref name=bomweekly>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=topgun.htm |title=Top Gun Weekly |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=boxofficemojo.com |access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref> Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing [[US$]]356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an [[IMAX]] 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Take My Breath Away]]\" performed by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Top Gun: Maverick]]'' is scheduled for release on December 23, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title=\u2018Top Gun Maverick\u2019 Flies To Christmas Corridor, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Eyes Late Summer, \u2018Quiet Place II\u2019 To Debut Labor Day |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/top-gun-maverick-flies-to-christmas-corridor-spongebob-eyes-late-summer-quiet-place-ii-to-debut-labor-day-1202898738/ |accessdate=April 2, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=April 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: According to WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n\n[[United States Naval Aviator]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his [[Radar Intercept Officer]] [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw fly the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14A Tomcat]] aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a [[Northrop F-5]]), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his [[Wings of Gold|wings]], citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun{{sic}},<ref>https://www.fighterpilotpodcast.com/podcast/007-topgun-vs-top-gun/</ref> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nAt a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Topgun instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.\n\nDuring Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two [[rules of engagement]] and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but wouldn't trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\n\nDuring a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper, who is impressed with his flying abilities but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman.\"\n\nMaverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]].  Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose hits the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]] head-first and is killed.\n\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\n\nDuring the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to ''Enterprise'' to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.\n\nMaverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\n\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood.

Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Jack Epps</ref> Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker [[Saab automobile|Saab]] in the early 1980s, where a [[Saab 900]] turbo is shown racing a [[Saab 37 Viggen]] fighter jet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Matthew Modine]] turned down the role of [[Pete Mitchell (Top Gun)|LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell]] (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film's pro-military stance went against his politics.

The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to [[Cuba]], the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with the producers</ref> Maverick's love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the US military's prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel.<ref name=\"Top Gun Movie -The 80s Rewind\" /> The \"Charlie\" character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to [[Christine Fox|Christine \"Legs\" Fox]], a civilian mathematician employed by the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense.<ref name=Richman1985/>\n\n[[Julianne Phillips]] was in consideration for the role of Charlie, and had been scheduled to perform a screen test opposite Tom Cruise.<ref name=AFI/>\n\nRear Admiral Pete \"Viper\" Pettigrew, a former Navy aviator, Vietnam War veteran, and Topgun instructor served as a technical advisor on the film, and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a colleague of Charlie's.\n\nFormer Top Gun instructor pilot and Congressman [[Duke Cunningham|Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham]] claimed to have been the inspiration for Pete Mitchell, although the film's producers have denied that the character was based on any specific Naval Aviator.<ref>{{cite news| first=Alex| last=Roth| newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune| url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20060115-9999-lz1n15legend.html| title= down Cunningham's legend| date=2006-01-15| page=A-1| accessdate=2006-02-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:VF-111 TOPGUN MOVIE.jpg|thumb|F-14A Tomcats of Fighter Squadrons [[VF-51]] \"Screaming Eagles\" and [[VF-111 (1956-95)|VF-111]] \"Sundowners\", and F-5E/F Tiger IIs of the Navy Fighter Weapons School]]\n\nThe Navy made several aircraft from F-14 fighter squadron [[VF-51]] \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Tom Skerritt mentions in the scene at his home) available for the film. Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|7800|1985|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties.

During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to shoot aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|25000|1985|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier's captain a US$25,000 check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes.<ref>Special Edition DVD, Interview with Tony Scott and Pete Pettigrew</ref>\n\n[[File:Filming of Top Gun movie (01) 1985.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Filming and [[clapperboard]] of ''Top Gun'' on July 5, 1985.]]\n\nMost of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at [[Naval Air Station Fallon]], in [[Nevada]], using ground-mounted cameras. Air-to-air shots were filmed using a [[Learjet]], piloted by Astrovision inventor and legendary pilot [[Clay Lacy]]. His name is misspelled in the closing credits, as Clay Lacey.

The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.\n\nRenowned aerobatic pilot [[Art Scholl]] was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a [[Spin (flight)|flat spin]], which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his [[Pitts Special]] bi-plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the Southern California coast near [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] on September 16, 1985.
