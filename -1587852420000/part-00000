He was modest and quiet, \"governing his troops without ever being demanding.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 />  A Spanish journalist, frustrated that he could find nothing interesting about him, asked \"I wonder if his wife knows who this man is who sleeps beside her.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 /> A teammate, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bernard]] said: \"When he comes down for his meal, you don't even hear him move his chair.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\n''Procycling'' wrote:\n\nHis five straight Tour crowns paralleled Spain's coming of age following decades of repression under the dictatorship of General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and his face became a symbol of a new, more assertive Spain stepping confidently on to the European stage.<ref name=autogenerated7 />\n\nPhilippe Brunel in ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' called him \"humble and sublime, taciturn some days.

During his five consecutive Tour de France wins he never won a stage that was not a time trial.

Near the end he caught [[Laurent Fignon]], who had started six minutes before him. The [[1992 Tour de France|1992 Tour]] was remarkable for a long breakaway by [[Claudio Chiappucci]] on a stage to [[Sestriere]] that included six mountains. Indur\u00e1in seemed to crack on the final climb to Sestriere being passed by [[Franco Vona]] but managed to finish third, enough to claim the yellow jersey once more.

After winning the early time trial, Indur\u00e1in gained a decisive advantage on stage 9 to Latina-Terminillo.

Though the [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|\u03b22-adrenergic agonist]], found in nasal inhalers, was on the controlled substances list of both the [[IOC]] and [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]], both organizations permitted sportsmen with [[asthma]] to use it.

The following day Indur\u00e1in won the first time trial, organised on a demanding circuit at [[Seraing]]. Jean-Paul Ollivier wrote: \"It offered him another chance to assert his authority.

He was modest and quiet, \"governing his troops without ever being demanding.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 />  A Spanish journalist, frustrated that he could find nothing interesting about him, asked \"I wonder if his wife knows who this man is who sleeps beside her.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 /> A teammate, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bernard]] said: \"When he comes down for his meal, you don't even hear him move his chair.\"<ref name=autogenerated9 />\n\n''Procycling'' wrote:\n\nHis five straight Tour crowns paralleled Spain's coming of age following decades of repression under the dictatorship of General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and his face became a symbol of a new, more assertive Spain stepping confidently on to the European stage.<ref name=autogenerated7 />\n\nPhilippe Brunel in ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' called him \"humble and sublime, taciturn some days.

(corporation)|S.A.]]''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] hotel and leisure company domiciled in [[Luxembourg]] that owns and operates luxury restaurants and clubs around the world including [[Harry's Bar (Venice)|Harry's Bar]] in Venice and formerly the [[Rainbow Room]] in New York City. It specialises in simple, traditional Italian food.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120121014045/http://www.crestaurant.co.uk/home.php]</ref>\n\nCipriani S.A. traces its history to family patriarch Giuseppe Cipriani (1900\u20131980)\n<ref name=google-books/> who founded Harry's Bar in Venice in 1931.\nAccording to the company history, Harry Pickering, a young [[Boston]]ian, had been frequenting Hotel Europa in Venice, where Giuseppe Cipriani was a bartender. When Pickering explained that he was broke because his family had found out his drinking habits and cut him off financially, Cipriani loaned Pickering 10,000 lire (about $500 US [$7,839 in 2015 dollars]). Two years later, Pickering returned to the hotel bar, ordered a drink, and gave Cipriani 50,000 lire in return. \"Mr. Cipriani, thank you,\" he said, according to the Cipriani website. \"Here's the money. And to show you my appreciation, here's 40,000 more, enough to open a bar. We will call it Harry's Bar.\"\n\nHarry's Bar became a popular spot for celebrities like [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]].  Mr. Cipriani created the  [[Bellini (cocktail)|Bellini]] cocktail there, and the food dish [[Carpaccio]] is also reputed to have originated there.\n\nGiuseppe's son Arrigo Cipriani (born 1932) is the majority owner. Arrigo is Italian for Harry.<ref name=google-books/>  His son [[Giuseppe Cipriani (racing driver)|Giuseppe Cipriani]] (born 1965) is the main business manager.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1958 the elder Cipriani built the [[Hotel Cipriani]] in Venice.  In 1967 Cipriani Sr. sold rights to the Cipriani name trademark.<ref name=reuters-20081210/>\n\nHowever the family went international in 1985 under the Cipriani name when it opened a Harry's Bar branch in New York City in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.<ref name=nytimes-20070801/>  Within two years the family was evicted from the hotel and opened the Cipriani Bellini bar nearby.<ref name=google-books/>  Eventually they would return to the hotel.\n[[File:Bowery-savings-bank.jpg|thumb|110 East 42nd Street]]\nIn 1997 the Ciprianis bought [[National City Bank Building|55 Wall Street]], noted for its huge ornate former [[Citigroup|First National Bank]] lobby.

(corporation)|S.A.]]''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] hotel and leisure domiciled in [[Luxembourg]] that owns and operates luxury restaurants and clubs around the world including [[Harry's Bar (Venice)|Harry's Bar]] in Venice and formerly the [[Rainbow Room]] in New York City. It specialises in simple, traditional Italian food.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120121014045/http://www.crestaurant.co.uk/home.php]</ref>\n\nCipriani S.A. traces its history to family patriarch Giuseppe Cipriani (1900\u20131980)\n<ref name=google-books/> who founded Harry's Bar in Venice in 1931.\nAccording to the company history, Harry Pickering, a young [[Boston]]ian, had been frequenting Hotel Europa in Venice, where Giuseppe Cipriani was a bartender. When Pickering explained that he was broke because his family had found out his drinking habits and cut him off financially, Cipriani loaned Pickering 10,000 lire (about $500 US [$7,839 in 2015 dollars]). Two years later, Pickering returned to the hotel bar, ordered a drink, and gave Cipriani 50,000 lire in return. \"Mr. Cipriani, thank you,\" he said, according to the Cipriani website. \"Here's the money. And to show you my appreciation, here's 40,000 more, enough to open a bar. We will call it Harry's Bar.\"\n\nHarry's Bar became a popular spot for celebrities like [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]].  Mr. Cipriani created the  [[Bellini (cocktail)|Bellini]] cocktail there, and the food dish [[Carpaccio]] is also reputed to have originated there.\n\nGiuseppe's son Arrigo Cipriani (born 1932) is the majority owner. Arrigo is Italian for Harry.<ref name=google-books/>  His son [[Giuseppe Cipriani (racing driver)|Giuseppe Cipriani]] (born 1965) is the main business manager.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1958 the elder Cipriani built the [[Hotel Cipriani]] in Venice.  In 1967 Cipriani Sr. sold rights to the Cipriani name trademark.<ref name=reuters-20081210/>\n\nHowever the family went international in 1985 under the Cipriani name when it opened a Harry's Bar branch in New York City in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.<ref name=nytimes-20070801/>  Within two years the family was evicted from the hotel and opened the Cipriani Bellini bar nearby.<ref name=google-books/>  Eventually they would return to the hotel.\n[[File:Bowery-savings-bank.jpg|thumb|110 East 42nd Street]]\nIn 1997 the Ciprianis bought [[National City Bank Building|55 Wall Street]], noted for its huge ornate former [[Citigroup|First National Bank]] lobby.

Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, who is accused of being a [[Russia]]n [[sleeper agent]] and goes on the run to try to clear her name.\n\nOriginally written with a male protagonist, with [[Tom Cruise]] initially secured for the lead, the script was ultimately rewritten by [[Brian Helgeland]] for Jolie. Filming took place on location in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[New York City]] area, and [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]], between March and June 2009, with reshoots in January 2010. Action scenes were primarily performed with practical stunts, [[computer-generated imagery]] being used mostly for creating digital environments.\n\nThe film had a panel at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] on July 22 and was released in North America on July 23, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2010. ''Salt'' grossed $294 million at the worldwide [[box office]] and received generally positive reviews, with praise for the action scenes and Jolie's performance, but drawing criticism on the writing, with reviewers finding the plot implausible and convoluted. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released December 21, 2010, and featured two alternate cuts providing [[alternate ending|different endings]] for the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nEvelyn Salt ([[Angelina Jolie]]) is being tortured in a prison in [[North Korea]] on suspicion of being an American spy. Her boyfriend, [[Arachnology|arachnologist]] Mike Krause ([[August Diehl]]), generates so much publicity about Salt's imprisonment that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] is forced to arrange a prisoner exchange despite the agency's policy against it. Salt's CIA colleague Ted Winter ([[Liev Schreiber]]) greets Salt at the border. As they drive away, Mike proposes marriage, despite Salt's admission to Mike that she is, in fact, a CIA operative.\n\nTwo years later, on Salt and Krause's wedding anniversary, a Russian defector named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov ([[Daniel Olbrychski]]) walks into Salt's office. Salt interrogates him with Winter and CIA counter-intelligence officer Darryl Peabody ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) observing. Orlov claims that on \"Day X\", highly trained Russian sleeper agents known as \"KAs\" will destroy the U.S. Orlov tells them that Agent \"KA-12\" will assassinate [[President of Russia|Russian president]] Boris Matveyev ([[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]]) at the funeral of the [[Vice President of the United States|American Vice President]]. Orlov reveals that KA-12 is named Evelyn Salt, and lie detectors confirm his entire story. Peabody orders Salt be detained, while Orlov kills two agents and escapes. In confusion, Salt is able to escape from the building, running barefoot through the street. While the CIA is searching for her, Salt discovers that her husband was kidnapped.\n\nA while later at the funeral, Salt shoots President Matveyev and then surrenders herself. Matveyev is declared dead. Salt escapes again and heads to a barge where Orlov is hiding with other sleeper agents. In a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Salt recalls growing up in the [[Soviet Union]] and being trained with other children. On the barge, Orlov welcomes her back and has Mike killed in front of her. When Salt shows no reaction, Orlov is convinced she is loyal and begins briefing her on her next mission. She is to rendezvous with another KA who will help her assassinate the American president. She kills Orlov and the other agents before leaving. She then meets with KA Shnaider ([[Corey Stoll]]), who uses his cover as a [[Army of the Czech Republic|Czech]] [[NATO]] liaison to get Salt into the [[White House]]. Once inside, Shnaider launches a suicide attack to force agents to move the President ([[Hunt Block]]) to an underground bunker, accompanied by Winter. Salt follows them and manages to enter the bunker before it is sealed.\n\nThe U.S. President learns that Russia has mobilized its nuclear arsenal in response to their president's death. He orders American nuclear weapons readied in response. CIA Agent Winter suddenly kills everyone except the President and introduces himself as Nikolai Tarkovsky, another member of the KA. Winter incapacitates the President and begins aiming nuclear missiles at [[Mecca]] and [[Tehran]] to incite a billion Muslims against the United States. Salt tries to persuade Winter to let her inside the sealed room, but then he sees a television report saying President Matveyev is alive and well; Salt had used spider venom to cause a simulated death of Matveyev. Winter refuses her entry and reveals that Mike's kidnapping and murder and her blown cover were all his idea. Winter plans to place full blame for the nuclear attacks on Salt. Salt breaks into the room before he can launch the missiles. The two wrestle for control of the [[nuclear football]], with Salt aborting the missile strikes before being captured.\n\nAs Salt is being led out in chains, Winter grabs a pair of scissors planning to kill her as she is led by him. She unexpectedly hooks her chain around Winter's neck and jumps over the stair railing, strangling him to death. On the helicopter ride to be interrogated, Peabody questions her. Salt explains that she killed Winter because he orchestrated the death of her husband, and promises to hunt down the remaining KA agents if freed. Peabody is convinced after receiving a text that Salt's fingerprints were found on the barge where the sleeper agents were killed, supporting her story. Salt is allowed to escape, jumping out of the helicopter into the river below and escaping into the woods.\n\nIn an alternate ending, Salt, disguised as a [[nun]], arrives at the building where she was trained as a child in the former Soviet Union. She confronts Orlov in his office, telling him that she came to inform him that she's \"free\". The two then engage in a brief fight, where Orlov is then shot by Salt multiple times. She is later seen by the water as she pushes Orlov, who is tied to a large rock, into the water, and watches him drown. The building is then shown exploding.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Evelyn Salt, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent accused of being a [[double agent]] for the [[KGB]]\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Theodore \"Ted\" Winter / Nikolai Tarkovsky, the head of the fictional CIA's Russia House<ref name=\"totalfilmpg77\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Cover Story (Salt) |journal=[[Total Film]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|volume=August 2010 |issue=170 |page=77 |doi= }}</ref>\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Peabody, an [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|ONCIX]] agent in pursuit of Salt<ref name=\"totalfilmpg78\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Cover Story (Salt)|journal=Total Film |publisher=Future Publishing|volume=August 2010 |issue=170 |page=78 |doi= }}</ref>\n* [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as Oleg Vassily Orlov, the Russian [[Defection|defector]] and [[spymaster]]\n* Daniel Pearce as a younger Orlov in the flashbacks\n* [[August Diehl]] as Mike Krause, Salt's husband\n* [[Olek Krupa]] as Boris Matveyev, the [[President of Russia]]\n* [[Hunt Block]] as Howard Lewis, the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Shnaider, the Russian suicide-bomber sent to his death by Orlov\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nThe early development of the script began while Kurt Wimmer was doing interviews promoting ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]''. In a November 2002 interview, he discussed what scripts he was working on. He stated that \"I have several scripts\u2014foremost of which is one called ''The Far-Reaching Philosophy of Edwin A. Salt''\u2014kind of a high-action spy thriller...\"<ref name=\"chud\"/> In another interview, Wimmer described the project as \"very much about me and my wife\".<ref name=\"10 questions\"/> The plot incorporated many elements from ''Equilibrium'', with an oppressive and [[paranoid]] political system of [[brainwashing]] that gets overthrown by one of its high-ranking members who rebels due to an emotional transformation.<ref name=\"EquilibriumSaltSimilarity\"/> With the shortened title ''Edwin A. Salt'', the script was sold to [[Columbia Pictures]] in January 2007.<ref name=\"AllBusiness\"/> By July 2007, the script had attracted the attention of Tom Cruise.<ref name=\"Variety2007\"/>\n\n[[Terry George]] was the first director to join the project, and he also did some revisions to the script, but he soon left the project. [[Peter Berg]] was the next director to consider, but he too eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"EW\" /> A year later it was confirmed that [[Phillip Noyce]] would direct.<ref name=\"variety\"/> Noyce was attracted to ''Salt'' for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography,<ref name=\"kcrw\"/> as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of.<ref name=comm/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Liev Schreiber 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Schreiber was chosen for his \"hidden emotionality\" and his performance in ''[[Defiance (2008 film)|Defiance]]''.<ref name=comm/>|alt=Liev Schreiber'']]\n\nInitial discussions took place in 2008 between [[Tom Cruise]] and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing for more than a year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script because he feared that the character was too close to his ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' character [[Ethan Hunt]].<ref name=\"director interview\" /> Cruise decided to work on ''[[Knight and Day]]'' instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said \"But, you know, he had a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he'd already played. It's like playing the brother, or the cousin, of somebody that you played in another movie\".<ref name=\"director interview\" />\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[Amy Pascal]] suggested [[Angelina Jolie]] to Noyce, who had often spoken to Jolie in the past about a desire to create a female [[spy film|spy franchise]].<ref name=\"director interview\" /> Pascal even invited Jolie for a [[Bond girl]] role, but the actress playfully replied that she was more interested in playing [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] himself instead.<ref name=notes/> Jolie was sent ''Salt''{{'}}s script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] went to visit Jolie at her home in [[France]] to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer [[Brian Helgeland]] helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.<ref name=\"director interview\" />\n\nOne of Jolie's requests was to rework the third act, which originally had Salt rescue his wife and son from a coalition of villains because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided then to make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into \"a place harder than [[Fort Knox]]\"\u2014after considering [[Camp David]], Wimmer settled on the [[White House]].<ref name=comm/> When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said \"I think that it's just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas\u2014the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], and has to go on the run to defend himself. That's been the same since day one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In the same way, I guess, as\u2014you know\u2014action thrillers have changed along the lines of the [[James Bond (film series)|Bond film]]s and the [[Bourne (film series)|Bourne film]]s\".<ref name=\"director interview\" /><ref name=\"jolie\" />\n\nOn February 19, 2009, it was reported that [[Liev Schreiber]] would play the role of Ted Winter, Evelyn Salt's friend and colleague in the CIA.<ref name=\"Liev\" /> Three days later [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] named as CIA Officer Peabody, who is in pursuit of Salt.<ref name=\"variety2\" /> Noyce said Ejiofor, whom he first saw in ''[[Dirty Pretty Things (film)|Dirty Pretty Things]]'', seemed to have the \"intelligence and disarming sort of obsessiveness\" that a [[counter-intelligence]] officer would need.<ref name=comm/> [[August Diehl]], who played Salt's husband Mike Krause, came after a recommendation from Jolie's partner [[Brad Pitt]], who had worked with Diehl in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', and [[Daniel Olbrychski]] was chosen for Orlov because [[Andrei Konchalovsky]] told Noyce that such an evil Russian character could only be played by a Polish actor.<ref name=comm/>\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $110 million, [[principal photography]] took place mostly on location in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"budget\" /><ref name=\"first look\" /> from March to June 2009.<ref name=\"about\" /><ref name=\"filming\" /><ref name=\"access\" /> Noyce decided to avoid \"typical post-card views of Washington DC\" to reflect \"the more day-to-day environment of massive federal buildings inhabited by the typical bureaucrat\".<ref name=notes/> The opening sequence in North Korea was shot at the [[Floyd Bennett Field]], with an extra who had experience with [[prisoner exchange]] acting as a consultant. Salt's rendezvous with Orlov was shot on the \"Frying Pan\", a former lighthouse ship, now moored in the Hudson River, at 26th Street in New York. The outside of the KA training facility was the [[Makaryev Monastery]] in Russia,<ref name=comm/> while the interior was the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Cathedral of the Holy Virgin Protection in New York's East Village.<ref name=\"notes\" /> Filming for a chase sequence took place in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] on Water Street near the [[Interstate 787]] ramp between April and May.<ref name=\"wten\"/> Studio production took place at [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York|Bethpage]], [[Long Island]], New York.<ref name=\"Grumanstudios\"/><ref name=\"libn\"/> While the film was in post-production, di Bonaventura became dissatisfied with some scenes.<ref name=nypost/> [[Steven Zaillian]] was brought for uncredited rewrites,<ref name=\"Variety2010\"/> and reshoots, mostly of action scenes, were held in New York during January 2010.<ref name=nypost/> Filming also took place in upper Manhattan's neighborhood [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] on 157th St and Riverside Dr. Some scenes were also filmed outside of Manhattan including [[The Bronx]], [[Queens]], [[Staten Island]], and in [[Westchester County]].\n\nAfter Jolie had just given birth to twins,<ref name=ultimate/> she spent time training before filming to get fit in order to perform almost all of the stunts herself. Bonaventura said, \"She is so prepared and so ready and gung-ho, she'll do any stunt. We had her jumping out of helicopters, shooting, jumping off of all sorts of things and infiltrating places that are impossible to infiltrate\".<ref name=\"LAtimes1\"/> Salt's fighting style was described as a mixture of [[Muay Thai]], [[Shaolin Kung-Fu]], and [[Jeet Kune Do]], which was considered by the stunt team the most suitable for Jolie's physique, and [[Krav Maga]], for its rawness and aggressiveness. Noyce wanted to film the scene where Salt hangs from the edge of the building in a studio with [[chroma key]], but Jolie insisted on doing it herself in the actual location.<ref name=ultimate/> On May 29, 2009, filming was temporarily halted after Jolie suffered a minor head injury while filming an action scene. She was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and released on the same day with no serious injuries, allowing filming to resume.<ref name=\"injury\"/> Salt's escape after being captured in St. Bartholomew's originally involved her jumping off a building into a window cleaning machine, but budgetary constraints caused the scene to be changed into a car chase.<ref name=comm/>\n\n[[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was used extensively throughout the film to create environments and elements, such as bullet holes and flames. More dangerous objects such as a [[taser]] or the handcuffs used to strangle Winter were also made from CGI. Five companies were responsible for [[visual effects]]. The two most involved were [[Rainmaker Digital Effects|CIS Vancouver]] and [[Framestore]]. CIS Vancouver recreated the White House since the crew did not have permission to shoot in the building, and made a digital elevator shaft for the scene where Salt goes down into the White House bunker. Framestore was responsible for the assassination attempt on the Russian president, which combined actual shots of St. Bartholomew's Church, a digital recreation of the church's interior, and scenes with actor Olek Krupa falling down a collapsing floor.<ref name=\"awn\"/><ref name=\"Grasmere\"/>\n\nFemale CIA officers were consulted about the creation of disguises, leading to the scene where Salt undergoes subtle changes to disguise herself as a Czech. The \"sweet and caring\" blonde Salt dyeing her hair black would represent the shift to Chenkov, the menacing Russian agent. For the scene where Salt disguises herself as a Major, pictures of Angelina Jolie were treated on [[Adobe Photoshop]] to create a believable male version, with the resulting image being used by the make-up team as an inspiration for the [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]].<ref name=\"Spy Disguise\"/>\n\n===Versions===\nDirector [[Phillip Noyce]] has said that due to the extensive usage of flashbacks, \"there was always going to be a mountain of alternative material that would not fit into the theatrical version\".<ref name=\"moviehole\" /> The film ended up having two extra versions, the director's cut, and the extended cut\u2014which Noyce refers to in his [[audio commentary]] as the film's original cut\u2014both included on the [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] Disc deluxe editions.<ref name=\"igndvd\" />\n\nThe director's cut was described by Noyce as \"my own personal take on the material, free from the politics and restrictions of producers, studio or censorship ratings\".<ref name=\"moviehole\" /> Four minutes of film are added, leading to a running time of 104 minutes.<ref name=\"igndvd\" /> More flashbacks are added, and the violence is amped up\u2014for example, Mike being drowned rather than shot to death.<ref name=\"latimes2\" /> The ending is also different: in the bunker scene, Winter shoots the President instead of only knocking him unconscious,<ref name=\"comm\" /><ref name=\"moviehole\" /> and a media report during the final scene reports that the new US president had been orphaned on a family visit to Russia, implying he is also a sleeper agent.<ref name=\"PopWrap\" /> Noyce has described this ending as \"an ending yet just a beginning\u2014and it's an ending that turns the whole story on its head.\"<ref name=\"latimes2\" />\n\nThe extended cut increases the running time by only one minute but rewrites the plot by removing, rearranging and adding scenes.<ref name=\"igndvd\" /> The ending has Salt escaping from CIA custody and going to Russia, where she kills Orlov\u2014his death scene at the barge does not appear in this cut, along with the facility where new child spies are being trained being blown up at the end of the cut.<ref name=\"PopWrap\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Anchor|Music|Score}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Salt: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[James Newton Howard]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2010|6|20}} ([[iTunes]])<br />{{Start date|2010|08|11}} ([[Compact Disc|CD]])\n| recorded   = 2010\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary classical]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=59|s=10}}\n| label      = [[Madison Gate Records]]\n| producer   = James Newton Howard\n| prev_title = [[The Last Airbender (soundtrack)|The Last Airbender]]\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n'''''Salt: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was released on July 20, 2010 on [[iTunes]]<ref name=\"soundtrack\"/> and on August 11, 2010 as on-demand [[CD-R]] from [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]].

Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, who is accused of being a [[Russia]]n [[sleeper agent]] and goes on the run to try to clear her name.\n\nOriginally written with a male protagonist, with [[Tom Cruise]] initially secured for the lead, the script was ultimately rewritten by [[Brian Helgeland]] for Jolie. Filming took place on location in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[New York City]] area, and [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]], between March and June 2009, with reshoots in January 2010. Action scenes were primarily performed with practical stunts, [[computer-generated imagery]] being used mostly for creating digital environments.\n\nThe film had a panel at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] on July 22 and was released in North America on July 23, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2010. ''Salt'' grossed $294 million at the worldwide [[box office]] and received generally positive reviews, with praise for the action scenes and Jolie's performance, but drawing criticism on the writing, with reviewers finding the plot implausible and convoluted. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released December 21, 2010, and featured two alternate cuts providing [[alternate ending|different endings]] for the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nEvelyn Salt ([[Angelina Jolie]]) is being tortured in a prison in [[North Korea]] on suspicion of being an American spy. Her boyfriend, [[Arachnology|arachnologist]] Mike Krause ([[August Diehl]]), generates so much publicity about Salt's imprisonment that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] is forced to arrange a prisoner exchange despite the agency's policy against it. Salt's CIA colleague Ted Winter ([[Liev Schreiber]]) greets Salt at the border. As they drive away, Mike proposes marriage, despite Salt's admission to Mike that she is, in fact, a CIA operative.\n\nTwo years later, on Salt and Krause's wedding anniversary, a Russian defector named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov ([[Daniel Olbrychski]]) walks into Salt's office. Salt interrogates him with Winter and CIA counter-intelligence officer Darryl Peabody ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) observing. Orlov claims that on \"Day X\", highly trained Russian sleeper agents known as \"KAs\" will destroy the U.S. Orlov tells them that Agent \"KA-12\" will assassinate [[President of Russia|Russian president]] Boris Matveyev ([[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]]) at the funeral of the [[Vice President of the United States|American Vice President]]. Orlov reveals that KA-12 is named Evelyn Salt, and lie detectors confirm his entire story. Peabody orders Salt be detained, while Orlov kills two agents and escapes. In confusion, Salt is able to escape from the building, running barefoot through the street. While the CIA is searching for her, Salt discovers that her husband was kidnapped.\n\nA while later at the funeral, Salt appears to succeed in killing President Matveyev and then surrenders herself. Matveyev is declared dead. Salt escapes again and heads to a barge where Orlov is hiding with other sleeper agents. In a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Salt recalls growing up in the [[Soviet Union]] and being trained with other children. On the barge, Orlov welcomes her back and has Mike killed in front of her. When Salt shows no reaction, Orlov is convinced she is loyal and begins briefing her on her next mission. She is to rendezvous with another KA who will help her assassinate the American president. She kills Orlov and the other agents before leaving. She then meets with KA Shnaider ([[Corey Stoll]]), who uses his cover as a [[Army of the Czech Republic|Czech]] [[NATO]] liaison to get Salt into the [[White House]]. Once inside, Shnaider launches a suicide attack to force agents to move the President ([[Hunt Block]]) to an underground bunker, accompanied by Winter. Salt follows them and manages to enter the bunker before it is sealed.\n\nThe U.S. President learns that Russia has mobilized its nuclear arsenal in response to their president's death. He orders American nuclear weapons readied in response. CIA Agent Winter suddenly kills everyone except the President and introduces himself as Nikolai Tarkovsky, another member of the KA. Winter incapacitates the President and begins aiming nuclear missiles at [[Mecca]] and [[Tehran]] to incite a billion Muslims against the United States. Salt tries to persuade Winter to let her inside the sealed room, but then he sees a television report saying President Matveyev is alive and well; Salt had used spider venom to cause a simulated death of Matveyev. Winter refuses her entry and reveals that Mike's kidnapping and murder and her blown cover were all his idea. Winter plans to place full blame for the nuclear attacks on Salt. Salt breaks into the room before he can launch the missiles. The two wrestle for control of the [[nuclear football]], with Salt aborting the missile strikes before being captured.\n\nAs Salt is being led out in chains, Winter grabs a pair of scissors planning to kill her as she is led by him. She unexpectedly hooks her chain around Winter's neck and jumps over the stair railing, strangling him to death. On the helicopter ride to be interrogated, Peabody questions her. Salt explains that she killed Winter because he orchestrated the death of her husband, and promises to hunt down the remaining KA agents if freed. Peabody is convinced after receiving a text that Salt's fingerprints were found on the barge where the sleeper agents were killed, supporting her story. Salt is allowed to escape, jumping out of the helicopter into the river below and escaping into the woods.\n\nIn an alternate ending, Salt, disguised as a [[nun]], arrives at the building where she was trained as a child in the former Soviet Union. She confronts Orlov in his office, telling him that she came to inform him that she's \"free\". The two then engage in a brief fight, where Orlov is then shot by Salt multiple times. She is later seen by the water as she pushes Orlov, who is tied to a large rock, into the water, and watches him drown. The building is then shown exploding.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Evelyn Salt, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent accused of being a [[double agent]] for the [[KGB]]\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Theodore \"Ted\" Winter / Nikolai Tarkovsky, the head of the fictional CIA's Russia House<ref name=\"totalfilmpg77\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Cover Story (Salt) |journal=[[Total Film]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|volume=August 2010 |issue=170 |page=77 |doi= }}</ref>\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Peabody, an [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|ONCIX]] agent in pursuit of Salt<ref name=\"totalfilmpg78\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Cover Story (Salt)|journal=Total Film |publisher=Future Publishing|volume=August 2010 |issue=170 |page=78 |doi= }}</ref>\n* [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as Oleg Vassily Orlov, the Russian [[Defection|defector]] and [[spymaster]]\n* Daniel Pearce as a younger Orlov in the flashbacks\n* [[August Diehl]] as Mike Krause, Salt's husband\n* [[Olek Krupa]] as Boris Matveyev, the [[President of Russia]]\n* [[Hunt Block]] as Howard Lewis, the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Shnaider, the Russian suicide-bomber sent to his death by Orlov\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nThe early development of the script began while Kurt Wimmer was doing interviews promoting ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]''. In a November 2002 interview, he discussed what scripts he was working on. He stated that \"I have several scripts\u2014foremost of which is one called ''The Far-Reaching Philosophy of Edwin A. Salt''\u2014kind of a high-action spy thriller...\"<ref name=\"chud\"/> In another interview, Wimmer described the project as \"very much about me and my wife\".<ref name=\"10 questions\"/> The plot incorporated many elements from ''Equilibrium'', with an oppressive and [[paranoid]] political system of [[brainwashing]] that gets overthrown by one of its high-ranking members who rebels due to an emotional transformation.<ref name=\"EquilibriumSaltSimilarity\"/> With the shortened title ''Edwin A. Salt'', the script was sold to [[Columbia Pictures]] in January 2007.<ref name=\"AllBusiness\"/> By July 2007, the script had attracted the attention of Tom Cruise.<ref name=\"Variety2007\"/>\n\n[[Terry George]] was the first director to join the project, and he also did some revisions to the script, but he soon left the project. [[Peter Berg]] was the next director to consider, but he too eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"EW\" /> A year later it was confirmed that [[Phillip Noyce]] would direct.<ref name=\"variety\"/> Noyce was attracted to ''Salt'' for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography,<ref name=\"kcrw\"/> as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of.<ref name=comm/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Liev Schreiber 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Schreiber was chosen for his \"hidden emotionality\" and his performance in ''[[Defiance (2008 film)|Defiance]]''.<ref name=comm/>|alt=Liev Schreiber'']]\n\nInitial discussions took place in 2008 between [[Tom Cruise]] and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing for more than a year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script because he feared that the character was too close to his ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' character [[Ethan Hunt]].<ref name=\"director interview\" /> Cruise decided to work on ''[[Knight and Day]]'' instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said \"But, you know, he had a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he'd already played. It's like playing the brother, or the cousin, of somebody that you played in another movie\".<ref name=\"director interview\" />\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[Amy Pascal]] suggested [[Angelina Jolie]] to Noyce, who had often spoken to Jolie in the past about a desire to create a female [[spy film|spy franchise]].<ref name=\"director interview\" /> Pascal even invited Jolie for a [[Bond girl]] role, but the actress playfully replied that she was more interested in playing [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] himself instead.<ref name=notes/> Jolie was sent ''Salt''{{'}}s script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] went to visit Jolie at her home in [[France]] to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer [[Brian Helgeland]] helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.<ref name=\"director interview\" />\n\nOne of Jolie's requests was to rework the third act, which originally had Salt rescue his wife and son from a coalition of villains because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided then to make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into \"a place harder than [[Fort Knox]]\"\u2014after considering [[Camp David]], Wimmer settled on the [[White House]].<ref name=comm/> When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said \"I think that it's just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas\u2014the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], and has to go on the run to defend himself. That's been the same since day one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In the same way, I guess, as\u2014you know\u2014action thrillers have changed along the lines of the [[James Bond (film series)|Bond film]]s and the [[Bourne (film series)|Bourne film]]s\".<ref name=\"director interview\" /><ref name=\"jolie\" />\n\nOn February 19, 2009, it was reported that [[Liev Schreiber]] would play the role of Ted Winter, Evelyn Salt's friend and colleague in the CIA.<ref name=\"Liev\" /> Three days later [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] named as CIA Officer Peabody, who is in pursuit of Salt.<ref name=\"variety2\" /> Noyce said Ejiofor, whom he first saw in ''[[Dirty Pretty Things (film)|Dirty Pretty Things]]'', seemed to have the \"intelligence and disarming sort of obsessiveness\" that a [[counter-intelligence]] officer would need.<ref name=comm/> [[August Diehl]], who played Salt's husband Mike Krause, came after a recommendation from Jolie's partner [[Brad Pitt]], who had worked with Diehl in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', and [[Daniel Olbrychski]] was chosen for Orlov because [[Andrei Konchalovsky]] told Noyce that such an evil Russian character could only be played by a Polish actor.<ref name=comm/>\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $110 million, [[principal photography]] took place mostly on location in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"budget\" /><ref name=\"first look\" /> from March to June 2009.<ref name=\"about\" /><ref name=\"filming\" /><ref name=\"access\" /> Noyce decided to avoid \"typical post-card views of Washington DC\" to reflect \"the more day-to-day environment of massive federal buildings inhabited by the typical bureaucrat\".<ref name=notes/> The opening sequence in North Korea was shot at the [[Floyd Bennett Field]], with an extra who had experience with [[prisoner exchange]] acting as a consultant. Salt's rendezvous with Orlov was shot on the \"Frying Pan\", a former lighthouse ship, now moored in the Hudson River, at 26th Street in New York. The outside of the KA training facility was the [[Makaryev Monastery]] in Russia,<ref name=comm/> while the interior was the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Cathedral of the Holy Virgin Protection in New York's East Village.<ref name=\"notes\" /> Filming for a chase sequence took place in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] on Water Street near the [[Interstate 787]] ramp between April and May.<ref name=\"wten\"/> Studio production took place at [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York|Bethpage]], [[Long Island]], New York.<ref name=\"Grumanstudios\"/><ref name=\"libn\"/> While the film was in post-production, di Bonaventura became dissatisfied with some scenes.<ref name=nypost/> [[Steven Zaillian]] was brought for uncredited rewrites,<ref name=\"Variety2010\"/> and reshoots, mostly of action scenes, were held in New York during January 2010.<ref name=nypost/> Filming also took place in upper Manhattan's neighborhood [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] on 157th St and Riverside Dr. Some scenes were also filmed outside of Manhattan including [[The Bronx]], [[Queens]], [[Staten Island]], and in [[Westchester County]].\n\nAfter Jolie had just given birth to twins,<ref name=ultimate/> she spent time training before filming to get fit in order to perform almost all of the stunts herself. Bonaventura said, \"She is so prepared and so ready and gung-ho, she'll do any stunt. We had her jumping out of helicopters, shooting, jumping off of all sorts of things and infiltrating places that are impossible to infiltrate\".<ref name=\"LAtimes1\"/> Salt's fighting style was described as a mixture of [[Muay Thai]], [[Shaolin Kung-Fu]], and [[Jeet Kune Do]], which was considered by the stunt team the most suitable for Jolie's physique, and [[Krav Maga]], for its rawness and aggressiveness. Noyce wanted to film the scene where Salt hangs from the edge of the building in a studio with [[chroma key]], but Jolie insisted on doing it herself in the actual location.<ref name=ultimate/> On May 29, 2009, filming was temporarily halted after Jolie suffered a minor head injury while filming an action scene. She was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and released on the same day with no serious injuries, allowing filming to resume.<ref name=\"injury\"/> Salt's escape after being captured in St. Bartholomew's originally involved her jumping off a building into a window cleaning machine, but budgetary constraints caused the scene to be changed into a car chase.<ref name=comm/>\n\n[[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was used extensively throughout the film to create environments and elements, such as bullet holes and flames. More dangerous objects such as a [[taser]] or the handcuffs used to strangle Winter were also made from CGI. Five companies were responsible for [[visual effects]]. The two most involved were [[Rainmaker Digital Effects|CIS Vancouver]] and [[Framestore]]. CIS Vancouver recreated the White House since the crew did not have permission to shoot in the building, and made a digital elevator shaft for the scene where Salt goes down into the White House bunker. Framestore was responsible for the assassination attempt on the Russian president, which combined actual shots of St. Bartholomew's Church, a digital recreation of the church's interior, and scenes with actor Olek Krupa falling down a collapsing floor.<ref name=\"awn\"/><ref name=\"Grasmere\"/>\n\nFemale CIA officers were consulted about the creation of disguises, leading to the scene where Salt undergoes subtle changes to disguise herself as a Czech. The \"sweet and caring\" blonde Salt dyeing her hair black would represent the shift to Chenkov, the menacing Russian agent. For the scene where Salt disguises herself as a Major, pictures of Angelina Jolie were treated on [[Adobe Photoshop]] to create a believable male version, with the resulting image being used by the make-up team as an inspiration for the [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]].<ref name=\"Spy Disguise\"/>\n\n===Versions===\nDirector [[Phillip Noyce]] has said that due to the extensive usage of flashbacks, \"there was always going to be a mountain of alternative material that would not fit into the theatrical version\".<ref name=\"moviehole\" /> The film ended up having two extra versions, the director's cut, and the extended cut\u2014which Noyce refers to in his [[audio commentary]] as the film's original cut\u2014both included on the [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] Disc deluxe editions.<ref name=\"igndvd\" />\n\nThe director's cut was described by Noyce as \"my own personal take on the material, free from the politics and restrictions of producers, studio or censorship ratings\".<ref name=\"moviehole\" /> Four minutes of film are added, leading to a running time of 104 minutes.<ref name=\"igndvd\" /> More flashbacks are added, and the violence is amped up\u2014for example, Mike being drowned rather than shot to death.<ref name=\"latimes2\" /> The ending is also different: in the bunker scene, Winter shoots the President instead of only knocking him unconscious,<ref name=\"comm\" /><ref name=\"moviehole\" /> and a media report during the final scene reports that the new US president had been orphaned on a family visit to Russia, implying he is also a sleeper agent.<ref name=\"PopWrap\" /> Noyce has described this ending as \"an ending yet just a beginning\u2014and it's an ending that turns the whole story on its head.\"<ref name=\"latimes2\" />\n\nThe extended cut increases the running time by only one minute but rewrites the plot by removing, rearranging and adding scenes.<ref name=\"igndvd\" /> The ending has Salt escaping from CIA custody and going to Russia, where she kills Orlov\u2014his death scene at the barge does not appear in this cut, along with the facility where new child spies are being trained being blown up at the end of the cut.<ref name=\"PopWrap\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Anchor|Music|Score}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Salt: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[James Newton Howard]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2010|6|20}} ([[iTunes]])<br />{{Start date|2010|08|11}} ([[Compact Disc|CD]])\n| recorded   = 2010\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary classical]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=59|s=10}}\n| label      = [[Madison Gate Records]]\n| producer   = James Newton Howard\n| prev_title = [[The Last Airbender (soundtrack)|The Last Airbender]]\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n'''''Salt: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was released on July 20, 2010 on [[iTunes]]<ref name=\"soundtrack\"/> and on August 11, 2010 as on-demand [[CD-R]] from [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]].

As, both concepts relate to the ways individuals are exposed to content devoid of clashing opinions, and colloquially might be used interchangeably. However, echo chamber refers to the overall phenomenon by which individuals are exposed only to information from like-minded individuals, while filter bubbles are a result of algorithms that choose content based on previous online behavior, as with search histories or online shopping activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bakshy|first=Eytan|last2=Messing|first2=Solomon|last3=Adamic|first3=Lada A.|date=2015-06-05|title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook|journal=Science|language=en|volume=348|issue=6239|pages=1130\u20131132|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25953820}}</ref>\n\n== Implications of Echo Chamber's ==\nThe echo chamber effect occurs online due to a harmonious group of people amalgamating and developing [[Tunnel vision (metaphor)|tunnel vision]].

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline. A 2016 study found that \u201cTwitter users who felt their audience on Twitter agreed with their opinion were more willing to speak out on that issue in the workplace\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Alleged examples ==\nIdeological echo chambers have existed in many forms, for centuries.

Social discussion and sharing suffer when people have a narrow information base and don't reach outside their network. The echo chambers can be detrimental to the well-being of a person. Essentially, the filter bubble can distort our very own realities that we thought could not be altered by outside sources. The Farnam Street academic blog explains that the filter bubble can have a bigger impact on us than we think. It can create echo chambers that leads us to believe that what you are seeing through ads is the only opinion or perspective that is right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=Farnam Street}}</ref> This goes back to political ads that were constantly in circulation on the internet making the user think that it is the only correct opinion out there. Put otherwise, \u201cIf we don\u2019t like facts, we don\u2019t believe them. If we DO like something presented to us as fact, even if it is false, we tend to believe it. If we see too much of our viewpoint and perspectives everyday, we believe that there are no other opinions and that ours is the correct one in all cases.\"\n\nMany offline communities are also segregated by political beliefs and cultural views. The echo chamber effect may prevent individuals from noticing changes in language and culture involving groups other than their own. Online echo chambers can sometimes influence an individual\u2019s willingness to participate in similar discussions offline.
