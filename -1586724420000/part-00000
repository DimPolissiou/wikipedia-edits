The film expands the original story to include [[sex in film|sex]] and broad adult humor, as well as original songs. The film was directed by Bud Townsend, produced by [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], and written by Bucky Searles, based on a concept by Jason Williams.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe plot revolves around Alice ([[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]]), a librarian who falls asleep reading the book ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and dreams of the [[White Rabbit]] ([[Larry Gelman]]), who she follows into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], where she begins to experiment with her unexplored sexuality. Through a series of sexual encounters, Alice loses her sexual inhibitions and allows herself to become sexually liberated. The film is a [[softcore pornography|softcore]] erotic comedy with orchestrated musical numbers which move the plot forward, and contribute to the film's humor.\n\nAfter premiering in a longer version, three minutes were edited from the film, and it was [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|rated R]] by the [[MPAA]], and released theatrically by General National, a company formed by producers Jason Williams and William Osco, due to other distributors being unwilling to distribute a sex film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film grossed over $90 million at the box office.<ref name=\"Alice Beyond Wonderland\"/> Osco later re-edited the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, incorporating explicit sex that was not part of the film's original production.<ref name=RialtoReport/> In 2004, Osco staged an [[Off-Broadway]] stage adaptation of the musical.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Off Broadway Musicals\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter rejecting the advances of her boyfriend, William (Ron Nelson), mousy librarian Alice falls asleep reading ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The [[White Rabbit]] appears to her in a dream and she follows him into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]]. Finding herself in a room and too large to fit through the small door, Alice drinks a potion which causes her to shrink while her dress remains the same size, leaving her naked. While chasing the Rabbit, she falls into a river and begins to drown, but is saved by a group of local inhabitants. After making friends with them, Alice is given a new (albeit very revealing) dress before setting off after the Rabbit again. While walking through the woods, she begins to experiment with her sexuality by stripping naked and masturbating.The Rabbit happens upon her and takes her to meet the [[Mad Hatter]].\n\nAfter being initially uncomfortable when the Mad Hatter exposes his penis to her, Alice ultimately performs fellatio on him. She is then called to assist [[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]], who has fallen off a wall, causing him to lose the ability to achieve an erection. The situation is rectified when Alice performs fellatio on Dumpty. She is then taken to meet siblings [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]], whom she watches having passionate but incestuous intercourse. Following this encounter, Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Mad Hatter continue on toward the [[King's Ball]]. On the way, they come across a couple having sex in an open field; Alice chastises them, but she is ignored. At the royal court, [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the King]] converses with Alice, speaking with her about self-empowerment and ignoring the judgements of others; he ultimately seduces her.\n\n[[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen]] suddenly appears, catching Alice and the king in bed together. A hurried trial is held and Alice is \"convicted\" of being a virgin. As punishment, the Queen orders Alice to have sex with her. A number of sexual escapades ensue among various characters as Alice prepares to carry out her sentence, including a brief lesbian encounter between Alice and the Queen's maids. Alice and the Queen engage in lesbian sex, but, as a result of the cunnilingus she receives from Alice, the Queen experiences an orgasm so strong it briefly incapacitates her. The Mad Hatter and White Rabbit assist Alice in escaping the Queen, who pursues to no avail.\n\nWaking from her dream and thereby returning to the real world, Alice meets William again. Having experienced a sexual awakening while in Wonderland, Alice accepts William's advances and they have sex in the library. In a closing sequence, Alice travels through Wonderland naked before she and William set off toward their new home where they live \"happily ever after.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] as Alice\n* [[Larry Gelman]] as the [[White Rabbit]]\n* Alan Novak as the [[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]]\n* Terry Hall as Nurse\n* Jason Williams as the [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Knight]]\n* Ron Nelson as William\n* Bucky Searles as [[Humpty Dumpty]] / Queen of Hearts's Brother\n* [[Gela Nash-Taylor|Gila Havana]] as the Black Knight's Girl\n* J.P.

Williams pitched the film to producer [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], who liked the idea, and hired comedian Bucky Searles to write the screenplay and songs, and raised $100,000 for the budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nProduction took place in New York City. Williams ran an ad in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' seeking auditions for a \"X-rated musical\", instructing that applicants \"must be able to sing and dance\".<ref name=RialtoReport/> Williams was too busy with other aspects of the film's production to direct, so Bud Townsend was hired to direct instead. Townsend was a prolific director of television commercials, who Williams had met auditioning for his horror film ''[[Terror at Red Wolf Inn]]''. Though Townsend had never directed a sex film before, he was hired to helm ''Alice in Wonderland'', along with his wife, Patty, who served as the script supervisor.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The dancing was choreographed by Buddy Schwab, who was a successful choreographer with Broadway credits.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film was initially going to be shot on [[16mm film]], but Townsend talked the producers into filming on [[35 mm movie film|35mm film]].<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nJuliet Graham auditioned for the role of Alice, but was offered the role of the Queen of Hearts instead, which she accepted. Through a modeling agency, [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] was cast as Alice. The 20-year-old fashion model had a background in musical theater, and could sing and dance. Many of the actors were regulars of New York's porn scene, while others were prominent character actors such as Larry Gelman, a friend of the screenwriter, who agreed to play the White Rabbit if he didn't have to appear nude, and if his wife and children could be flown out to New York on the production's budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The auditions for singing and dancing performers primarily emphasized the actors' dancing abilities, as the producers planned to re-record most of the singing with professional singers.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nFilming took place in 10 continuous days in either June or July 1975.<ref name=RialtoReport/> During filming, most of the actors stayed in the house used in the film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> A scratch track of the film's musical numbers was used for the actors to lip synch to during filming.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nThe initial plan was to produce the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, but once filming commenced, Williams said \"the vision for the film rapidly started expanding.

The film expands the original story to include [[sex in film|sex]] and broad adult humor, as well as original songs. The film was directed by Bud Townsend, produced by [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], and written by Bucky Searles, based on a concept by Jason Williams.<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nThe plot revolves around Alice ([[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]]), a librarian who falls asleep reading the book ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', and dreams of the [[White Rabbit]] ([[Larry Gelman]]), who she follows into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], where she begins to experiment with her unexplored sexuality. Through a series of sexual encounters, Alice loses her sexual inhibitions and allows herself to become sexually liberated. The film is a [[softcore pornography|softcore]] erotic comedy with orchestrated musical numbers which move the plot forward, and contribute to the film's humor.\n\nAfter premiering in a longer version, three minutes were edited from the film, and it was [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|rated R]] by the [[MPAA]], and released theatrically by General National, a company formed by producers Jason Williams and William Osco, due to other distributors being unwilling to distribute a sex film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film grossed over $90 million at the box office.<ref name=\"Alice Beyond Wonderland\"/> Osco later re-edited the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, incorporating explicit sex that was not part of the film's original production.<ref name=RialtoReport/> In 2004, Osco staged an [[Off-Broadway]] stage adaptation of the musical.<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Off Broadway Musicals\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter rejecting the advances of her boyfriend, William (Ron Nelson), mousy librarian Alice falls asleep reading ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The [[White Rabbit]] appears to her in a dream and she follows him into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]]. Finding herself in a room and too large to fit through the small door, Alice drinks a potion which causes her to shrink while her dress remains the same size, leaving her naked. While chasing the Rabbit, she falls into a river and begins to drown, but is saved by a group of local inhabitants. After making friends with them, Alice is given a new (albeit very revealing) dress before setting off after the Rabbit again. While walking through the woods, she begins to experiment with her sexuality by stripping naked and masturbating.The Rabbit happens upon her and takes her to meet the [[Mad Hatter]].\n\nAfter being initially uncomfortable when the Mad Hatter exposes his penis to her, Alice ultimately performs fellatio on him. She is then called to assist [[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]], who has fallen off a wall, causing him to lose the ability to achieve an erection. The situation is rectified when Alice performs fellatio on Dumpty. She is then taken to meet siblings [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]], whom she watches having passionate but incestuous intercourse. Following this encounter, Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Mad Hatter continue on toward the [[King's Ball]]. On the way, they come across a couple having sex in an open field; Alice chastises them but she is ignored. At the royal court, [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the King]] converses with Alice, speaking with her about self-empowerment and ignoring the judgements of others; he ultimately seduces her.\n\n[[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen]] suddenly appears, catching Alice and the king in bed together. A hurried trial is held and Alice is \"convicted\" of being a virgin. As punishment, the Queen orders Alice to have sex with her. A number of sexual escapades ensue among various characters as Alice prepares to carry out her sentence, including a brief lesbian encounter between Alice and the Queen's maids. Alice and the Queen engage in lesbian sex, but as a result of the cunnilingus she receives from Alice, the Queen experiences an orgasm so strong it briefly incapacitates her. The Mad Hatter and White Rabbit assist Alice in escaping the Queen, who pursues to no avail.\n\nWaking from her dream and thereby returning to the real world, Alice meets William again. Having experienced a sexual awakening while in Wonderland, Alice accepts William's advances and they have sex in the library. In a closing sequence, Alice travels through Wonderland naked before she and William set off toward their new home where they live \"happily ever after.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] as Alice\n* [[Larry Gelman]] as the [[White Rabbit]]\n* Alan Novak as the [[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]]\n* Terry Hall as Nurse\n* Jason Williams as the [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Knight]]\n* Ron Nelson as William\n* Bucky Searles as [[Humpty Dumpty]] / Queen of Hearts's Brother\n* [[Gela Nash-Taylor|Gila Havana]] as the Black Knight's Girl\n* J.P.

Williams pitched the film to producer [[Bill Osco|William Osco]], who liked the idea, and hired comedian Bucky Searles to write the screenplay and songs, and raised $100,000 for the budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nProduction took place in New York City. Williams ran an ad in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' seeking auditions for a \"X-rated musical\", instructing that applicants \"must be able to sing and dance\".<ref name=RialtoReport/> Williams was too busy with other aspects of the film's production to direct, so Bud Townsend was hired to direct instead. Townsend was a prolific director of television commercials, who Williams had met auditioning for his horror film ''[[Terror at Red Wolf Inn]]''. Though Townsend had never directed a sex film before, he was hired to helm ''Alice in Wonderland'', along with his wife, Patty, who served as the script supervisor.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The dancing was choreographed by Buddy Schwab, who was a successful choreographer with Broadway credits.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The film was initially going to be shot on [[16mm film]], but Townsend talked the producers into filming on [[35 mm movie film|35mm film]].<ref name=RialtoReport/>\n\nJuliet Graham auditioned for the role of Alice, but was offered the role of the Queen of Hearts instead, which she accepted. Through a modeling agency, [[Kristine DeBell|Kristine De Bell]] was cast as Alice. The 20-year-old fashion model had a background in musical theater, and could sing and dance. Many of the actors were regulars of New York's porn scene, while others were prominent character actors such as Larry Gelman, a friend of the screenwriter, who agreed to play the White Rabbit if he didn't have to appear nude, and if his wife and children could be flown out to New York on the production's budget.<ref name=RialtoReport/> The auditions for singing and dancing performers primarily emphasized the actors' dancing abilities, as the producers planned to re-record most of the singing with professional singers.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nFilming took place in 10 continuous days in either June or July 1975.<ref name=RialtoReport/> During filming, most of the actors stayed in the house used in the film.<ref name=RialtoReport/> A scratch track of the film's musical numbers was used for the actors to lip synch to during filming.<ref name=RialtoReport/> \n\nThe initial plan was to produce the film as a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] film, but once filming commenced, Williams said \"the vision for the film rapidly started expanding. We had these big sets, elaborate design, and we had this big opportunity.

For male Macropodia Rostrata, the largest pre puberty carapace lengths are 18mm, while the mean is generally 16.4mm<ref name=\":0\" />. Male macropodia Rostrata can reach a maximum post-puberty carapace length of 23mm. Females of the same species are generally smaller, and reach a maximum post puberty carapace length of 20mm. The largest pre-puberty length a female can reach is about 14 mm, while the average length after puberty is 14.4mm. As macropodia mature sexually, several interesting physiological changes occur. In males sexual maturity is indicated by the swelling and color change of their sperm ducts<ref name=\":0\" />. This is caused by the production of sperm that is enclosed within spermatophores and gives the ducts a white appearance. In females of the species, change in shape and diameter of ovaries dicattes sexual maturity. For both males and females of the species, the \u201cmoult of puberty\u201d is required to reproduce, as females do not ovulate before then and males do not produce sperm. Macropodia Rostrata can then copulate at any time after the \u201cmoult of puberty\u201d. After copulation, sperm are stored in a spermathecae and the females can use this for several ovulations. Macropodia Rostrata produce eggs around the size of 0.6mm, and several factors influence how many they can produce<ref name=\":0\" />. Macropodia Rostrata are continuous breeders, and do not have mating seasons. \n\n==Taxonomy==\n''M.&nbsp;rostrata'' was [[alpha taxonomy|first described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1761 work ''{{lang|la|[[Fauna Suecica]]}}'', under the name ''Cancer rostratus''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Mary J.

For male Macropodia Rostrata, the largest pre puberty carapace lengths are 18mm, while the mean is generally 16.4mm<ref name=\":0\" />. Male macropodia Rostrata can reach a maximum post-puberty carapace length of 23mm. Females of the same species are generally smaller, and reach a maximum post puberty carapace length of 20mm. The largest pre-puberty length a female can reach is about 14 mm, while the average length after puberty is 14.4mm. As macropodia mature sexually, several interesting physiological changes occur. In males sexual maturity is indicated by the swelling and color change of their sperm ducts<ref name=\":0\" />. This is caused by the production of sperm that is enclosed within spermatophores and gives the ducts a white appearance. In females of the species, change in shape and diameter of ovaries dicattes sexual maturity. For both males and females of the species, the \u201cmoult of puberty\u201d is required to reproduce, as females do not ovulate before then and males do not produce sperm. Macropodia Rostrata can then copulate at any time after the \u201cmoult of puberty\u201d. After copulation, sperm are stored in a spermathecae and the females can use this for several ovulations. Macropodia Rostrata produce eggs around the size of 0.6mm, and several factors influence how many they can produce<ref name=\":0\" />. Macropodia Rostrata are continuous breeders, and do not have mating seasons. \n\n==Taxonomy==\n''M.&nbsp;rostrata'' was [[alpha taxonomy|first described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1761 work ''{{lang|la|[[Fauna Suecica]]}}'', under the name ''Cancer rostratus''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Mary J.

The club was founded on 25 May 1896 by a group of German Jews in Prague, which at the time of its founding was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in [[Austria-Hungary]]. DFC Prag was one of the strongest teams in Europe in the beginning of the 1900s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/deutscher-fussball-club-prag-ein-traditionsverein-beginnt.2165.de.html?dram:article_id=386869 |title=Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Club Prag: Ein Traditionsverein beginnt von vorn |last=Heinlein |first=Stefan |date=23 May 2017 |website=deutschlandfunkkultur.de |location=[[Cologne]] |publisher=[[Deutschlandradio]] |language=German |access-date=28 November 2019 }}</ref> The team took part in the [[1903 German football championship|1903 German football championship final]] and became Bohemian champions at several times. The club was dissolved in 1939, following the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupation of Czechoslovakia]] by [[Nazi Germany]]. A new DFC Prag was founded on 9 June 2016, in the tradition of the original club.\n\n== History ==\n=== Founding member of the German Football Association ===\n\nThe multi-national character of Austria-Hungary meant that footballers in the monarchy could find themselves playing in the leagues of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[States of Austria#Historical development|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] or Bohemia. It was common for sports clubs to be founded based on the shared ethnicity of their members. DFC Prag was founded on 25 May 1893, by a group of German Jews from the football department of Deutscher Eis- und Ruder-Club Regatta Prag, established in 1891.\n\nWhen it was formed in 1900, the [[German Football Association|German Football Association (DFB)]], actively sought out members among ethnically German clubs from outside of the country. DFC Prag was a [[Founding Clubs of the DFB|founding member]] of the German association and its president, Dr. Ferdinand Hueppe, became the first president of this new national association.\n\n=== Contesting Germany's first championship ===\nDFC Prag was a very strong side at the end of the 1800s and early 1900s: they were Bohemian champions in 1896, and played in Germany's first ever national final in 1903, and became again Bohemian champions in 1917.\n\nThe story of the team's appearance in the [[1903 German football championship|1903 final]] is an odd one as they got there without having to play the scheduled playoff match against [[Karlsruher FV]]. The opponents received a telegram, supposedly from the DFB, indicating that the game had been rescheduled and consequently did not travel to the appointed match-up. DFC Prag, already waiting in [[Leipzig]] for the arrival of Karlsruher FV, were declared the winners by forfeit and advanced to the final, over the loud protests of the opponents. To this day the origin of the telegram is unknown. The second team to advance to the final was [[VfB Leipzig]], and the match was scheduled for 31 May 1903 at the home ground of [[FC 93 Altona Hamburg|FC 93 Altona]] in [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe heavily favoured DFC Prag arrived in Hamburg a day in advance and took themselves off on an ill-advised pub crawl the night before the final. Most of the team were students at the [[Charles University]] in Prague and took the opportunity to explore Hamburg. And so the team arrived to the final in less than ideal shape.<ref>{{cite news |last=Muras |first=Udo |date=31 May 2003 |title=So sehen Meister aus |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article237766/So-sehen-Meister-aus.html |language=German |newspaper=Die Welt |location=Berlin |publisher=WeltN24 GmbH |access-date=28 November 2019 }}</ref> The match was delayed half an hour as officials scrambled to find a football that was in good enough condition to play the match. The Altona club provided a new ball and eleven minutes in DFC Prag scored the first goal. At the end of the half, the score stood at 1\u20131, but VfB Leipzig then pulled away to emerge as the first German champions with a 7\u20132 victory. VfB Leipzig later the same year agreed to challenge Karlsruher FV and were again victorious, this time by a 7\u20133 score.\n\n[[Image:Deutscher FC-Prag-(Praha)-Team-1904.jpg|thumb|300px|DFC Prag in 1904: Fischer&nbsp;\u2013 Sedlaczek&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Fischl&nbsp;\u2013 Meissner&nbsp;\u2013 Weil; Schwarz&nbsp;\u2013 \u00d6sterreicher&nbsp;\u2013 Kurpiel&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Frey&nbsp;\u2013 Robicek; Eisenstein&nbsp;\u2013 Pick]]\n\n=== Play outside of Germany and dissolution ===\nWhen Germany joined [[FIFA]] in 1904, DFC Prag was no longer eligible for play in the country. FIFA also rebuffed attempts to create ethnic German and Slavic football associations within the borders of the fractious Austro-Hungarian Empire, preferring to stay clear of politics. DFC Prag played variously in Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia and remained a strong side until about 1914.  The club sent a number of players to the Austrian national team in spite of the club's uncertain status. DFC Prag dominated the [[Sudetenland|Sudeten]] league in the ethnically German area of Czechoslovakia, and in the period immediately prior to World War II, the club won a pair of amateur championships, in 1931 and 1933.<ref>{{cite book|first=Lubo\u0161|last=Je\u0159\u00e1bek|title=\u010cesk\u00fd a \u010deskoslovensk\u00fd fotbal&nbsp;\u2013 lexikon osobnost\u00ed a klub\u016f|publisher=Grada Publishing|language=Czech|year=2007|location=Prague, Czech Republic|isbn=978-80-247-1656-5|page=162}}</ref>\n\nThe rise to power of the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] in Germany in the early 1930s led to discrimination against Jews. By 1933, Jewish teams were excluded from general competition and limited to play in separate leagues or tournaments. In 1938, Jewish players and teams were banned outright as discrimination turned to persecution.\n\nWith the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] by Germany in 1938, these policies were quickly imposed in the area. DFC Prag, its players and officials, were, despite their mostly Jewish descent, suggested to join the movement of [[Konrad Henlein]], the [[Sudeten German Party]]. As players and officials refused, the club was immediately banned as a \"Jewish club\" after the German seizure of Prague in 1939, and dissolved due to the ban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfcprag.com/deutsch/historie/ |title=Geschichte des DFC |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=n.d. |website=dfcprag.com |location=[[Prague]] |publisher=Deutscher Fussball-Club Prag z.s. |language=German |access-date=11 November 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 June 2017 |title=Fu\u00dfball-International: So erzielte Dessauer Kicker in Prag ein historisches Tor |url=https://www.mz-web.de/dessau-rosslau/sport/fussball-international-so-erzielte-dessauer-kicker-in-prag-ein-historisches-tor-27799942 |language=German |newspaper=Mitteldeutsche Zeitung |location=[[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] |publisher=Mediengruppe Mitteldeutsche Zeitung GmbH & Co.

As other countries or regions came under German control, new leagues were formed, such as the [[Gauliga Ostmark]] in Austria after the [[Anschluss]] and the [[Gauliga Sudetenland]] after the seizure of the area from Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe remains of DFC Prag and FC Deutscher Sportbr\u00fcder Prag were merged in 1940, into a politically acceptable side under the regime, known as Nationalsozialistische Turngemeinde Prag, commonly known as NSTG Prag. The team began play in the 1940\u201341 Gauliga Sudetenland Group 2, where they won the division and the league championship, leading to participation in the [[1941 German football championship]] and the [[1941 Tschammerpokal|1941 German Cup]]. The next season they particated in the Gauliga Sudetenland-Mitte, where they again won the division, leading to participation in the [[1942 Tschammerpokal|1942 German Cup]]. However, the club voluntarily withdrew from participation in the national championship or further Gauliga play. The team disappeared with the end of World War II.\n\n=== Refounding ===\nA refounding of the club after World War II would have been hopeless, as a [[Bene\u0161 decrees|decree]] by Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] in 1945 forced Germans to leave Czechoslovakia and have their assets confiscated.<ref name=\"DieZukunftL\u00e4uft\"/> But in July 2016, 77 years after the original German-Jewish club had been dissolved, a new DFC Prag was founded with the aim of establishing a youth department, followed by a senior team in the following years.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/de/rubrik/tagesecho/deutsch-juedischer-fussballverein-dfc-prag-nach-77-jahren-wiedergegruendet Deutsch-j\u00fcdischer Fu\u00dfballverein DFC Prag nach 77 Jahren wiedergegr\u00fcndet] (in German) [[Radio Prag]], published: 1 July 2016, accessed: 5 July 2016</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\nDFC Prag played its first matches at a sports field on the so-called K\u00f6nigswiese. The K\u00f6nigsweise, which later came to be known as the Kaiserwiese (C\u00edsa\u0159sk\u00e1 louka in [[Czech language|Czech]]), is a man-made island on the [[Vltava River]], in the district of [[Sm\u00edchov]] in Prague. The sport field was also used by other football teams, and was the site of the first derby between [[SK Slavia Prague]] and [[AC Sparta Prague]] in 1896.\n\nHowever, the club was soon to find itself a new home at the underdeveloped [[Letn\u00e1]] area. For this purpose, the club tore up a tent in the southeastern corner of the area and built a sports field, which in addition to a fence also had a covered grandstand. The stadium was named Stadion Belvedere ([[:de:Stadion Belvedere|de]]) and came to hold 18,000 spectators. The stadium of SK Slavia Prague, one of the biggest rivals of the DFC Prag, was at the time located in the immediate vicinity.\n\nStadion Belvedere was situated in the southeast corner of the [[Letn\u00e1 Park]]. The stadium was completely demolished in 1939, to make place for the National Agricultural Museum, which was constructed on the site in 1937\u20131939.

DFC Prag was founded on 25 May 1893, by a group of German Jews from the football department of Deutscher Eis- und Ruder-Club Regatta Prag, established in 1891.\n\nWhen it was formed in 1900, the [[German Football Association|German Football Association (DFB)]], actively sought out members among ethnically German clubs from outside of the country. DFC Prag was a [[Founding Clubs of the DFB|founding member]] of the German association and its president, Dr. Ferdinand Hueppe, became the first president of this new national association.\n\n=== Contesting Germany's first championship ===\nDFC Prag was a very strong side at the end of the 1800s and early 1900s: they were Bohemian champions in 1896, and played in Germany's first ever national final in 1903, and became again Bohemian champions in 1917.\n\nThe story of the team's appearance in the [[1903 German football championship|1903 final]] is an odd one as they got there without having to play the scheduled playoff match against [[Karlsruher FV]]. The opponents received a telegram, supposedly from the DFB, indicating that the game had been rescheduled and consequently did not travel to the appointed match-up. DFC Prag, already waiting in [[Leipzig]] for the arrival of Karlsruher FV, were declared the winners by forfeit and advanced to the final, over the loud protests of the opponents. To this day the origin of the telegram is unknown. The second team to advance to the final was [[VfB Leipzig]], and the match was scheduled for 31 May 1903 at the home ground of [[FC 93 Altona Hamburg|FC 93 Altona]] in [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe heavily favoured DFC Prag arrived in Hamburg a day in advance and took themselves off on an ill-advised pub crawl the night before the final. Most of the team were students at the [[Charles University]] in Prague and took the opportunity to explore Hamburg. And so the team arrived to the final in less than ideal shape.<ref>{{cite news |last=Muras |first=Udo |date=31 May 2003 |title=So sehen Meister aus |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article237766/So-sehen-Meister-aus.html |language=German |newspaper=Die Welt |location=Berlin |publisher=WeltN24 GmbH |access-date=28 November 2019 }}</ref> The match was delayed half an hour as officials scrambled to find a football that was in good enough condition to play the match. The Altona club provided a new ball and eleven minutes in DFC Prag scored the first goal. At the end of the half, the score stood at 1\u20131, but VfB Leipzig then pulled away to emerge as the first German champions with a 7\u20132 victory. VfB Leipzig later the same year agreed to challenge Karlsruher FV and were again victorious, this time by a 7\u20133 score.\n\n[[Image:Deutscher FC-Prag-(Praha)-Team-1904.jpg|thumb|300px|DFC Prag in 1904: Fischer&nbsp;\u2013 Sedlaczek&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Fischl&nbsp;\u2013 Meissner&nbsp;\u2013 Weil; Schwarz&nbsp;\u2013 \u00d6sterreicher&nbsp;\u2013 Kurpiel&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Frey&nbsp;\u2013 Robicek; Eisenstein&nbsp;\u2013 Pick]]\n\n=== Play outside of Germany and dissolution ===\nWhen Germany joined [[FIFA]] in 1904, DFC Prag was no longer eligible for play in the country. FIFA also rebuffed attempts to create ethnic German and Slavic football associations within the borders of the fractious Austro-Hungarian Empire, preferring to stay clear of politics. DFC Prag played variously in Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia and remained a strong side until about 1914.  The club sent a number of players to the Austrian national team in spite of the club's uncertain status. DFC Prag dominated the [[Sudetenland|Sudeten]] league in the ethnically German area of Czechoslovakia, and in the period immediately prior to World War II, the club won a pair of amateur championships, in 1931 and 1933.<ref>{{cite book|first=Lubo\u0161|last=Je\u0159\u00e1bek|title=\u010cesk\u00fd a \u010deskoslovensk\u00fd fotbal&nbsp;\u2013 lexikon osobnost\u00ed a klub\u016f|publisher=Grada Publishing|language=Czech|year=2007|location=Prague, Czech Republic|isbn=978-80-247-1656-5|page=162}}</ref>\n\nThe rise to power of the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] in Germany in the early 1930s led to discrimination against Jews. By 1933, Jewish teams were excluded from general competition and limited to play in separate leagues or tournaments. In 1938, Jewish players and teams were banned outright as discrimination turned to persecution.\n\nWith the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] by Germany in 1938, these policies were quickly imposed in the area. DFC Prag, its players and officials, were, despite their mostly Jewish descent, suggested to join the movement of [[Konrad Henlein]], the [[Sudeten German Party]]. As players and officials refused, the club was immediately banned as a \"Jewish club\" after the German seizure of Prague in 1939, and dissolved due to the ban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfcprag.com/deutsch/historie/ |title=Geschichte des DFC |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=n.d. |website=dfcprag.com |location=[[Prague]] |publisher=Deutscher Fussball-Club Prag z.s. |language=German |access-date=11 November 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 June 2017 |title=Fu\u00dfball-International: So erzielte Dessauer Kicker in Prag ein historisches Tor |url=https://www.mz-web.de/dessau-rosslau/sport/fussball-international-so-erzielte-dessauer-kicker-in-prag-ein-historisches-tor-27799942 |language=German |newspaper=Mitteldeutsche Zeitung |location=[[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] |publisher=Mediengruppe Mitteldeutsche Zeitung GmbH & Co.

As other countries or regions came under German control, new leagues were formed, such as the [[Gauliga Ostmark]] in Austria after the [[Anschluss]] and the [[Gauliga Sudetenland]] after the seizure of the area from Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe remains of DFC Prag and FC Deutscher Sportbr\u00fcder Prag were merged in 1940, into a politically acceptable side under the regime, known as Nationalsozialistische Turngemeinde Prag, commonly known as NSTG Prag. The team began play in the 1940\u201341 Gauliga Sudetenland Group 2, where they won the division and the league championship, leading to participation in the [[1941 German football championship]] and the [[1941 Tschammerpokal|1941 German Cup]]. The next season they particated in the Gauliga Sudetenland-Mitte, where they again won the division, leading to participation in the [[1942 Tschammerpokal|1942 German Cup]]. However, the club voluntarily withdrew from participation in the national championship or further Gauliga play. The team disappeared with the end of World War II.\n\n=== Refounding ===\nA refounding of the club after World War II would have been hopeless, as a [[Bene\u0161 decrees|decree]] by Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] in 1945 forced Germans to leave Czechoslovakia and have their assets confiscated.<ref name=\"DieZukunftL\u00e4uft\"/> But in July 2016, 77 years after the original German-Jewish club had been dissolved, a new DFC Prag was founded with the aim of establishing a youth department, followed by a senior team in the following years.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/de/rubrik/tagesecho/deutsch-juedischer-fussballverein-dfc-prag-nach-77-jahren-wiedergegruendet Deutsch-j\u00fcdischer Fu\u00dfballverein DFC Prag nach 77 Jahren wiedergegr\u00fcndet] (in German) [[Radio Prag]], published: 1 July 2016, accessed: 5 July 2016</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\nDFC Prag played its first matches at a sports field on the so-called K\u00f6nigswiese. The K\u00f6nigsweise, which later came to be known as the Kaiserwiese (C\u00edsa\u0159sk\u00e1 louka in [[Czech language|Czech]]), is a man-made island on the [[Vltava River]], in the district of [[Sm\u00edchov]] in Prague. The sport field was also used by other football teams, and was the site of the first derby between [[SK Slavia Prague]] and [[AC Sparta Prague]] in 1896.\n\nHowever, the club was soon to find itself a new home at the underdeveloped [[Letn\u00e1]] area. For this purpose, the club tore up a tent in the southeaste corner of the area and built a sports field, which in addition to a fence also had a covered grandstand. The stadium was named Stadion Belvedere ([[:de:Stadion Belvedere|de]]) and came to hold 18,000 spectators. The stadium of SK Slavia Prague, one of the biggest rivals of the DFC Prag, was at the time located in the immediate vicinity.\n\nStadion Belvedere was situated in the southeast corner of the [[Letn\u00e1 Park]]. The stadium was completely demolished in 1939, to make place for the National Agricultural Museum, which was constructed on the site in 1937\u20131939.

In addition, they destroy submerged vegetation that holds sediments in place and provides shelter for native fish populations. Without vegetation, winds can more easily stir up sediment from the bottom of the lake, which is already a problem due to the lake's shallowness, resulting in greater turbidity and less sunlight reaching the remaining vegetation. Without cover for their young, native fish, such as the June sucker, become easy prey for white bass, walleye, and other predators.<ref>{{Harvnb|Effects_of_common_carp|2006|pp=85\u201386}}</ref>\n\nEfforts are underway to reduce the population of carp in Utah Lake by employing local commercial fishermen, led by Bill Loy, Jr. to remove 5 million pounds of carp each year, as part of the June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program's efforts to restore Utah Lake to a habitat in which the June sucker can survive.

In addition, they destroy submerged vegetation that holds sediments in place and provides shelter for native fish populations. Without vegetation, winds can more easily stir up sediment from the bottom of the lake, which is already a problem due to the lake's shallowness, resulting in greater turbidity and less sunlight reaching the remaining vegetation.
