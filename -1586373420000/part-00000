He was educated at [[Hawkshead Grammar School]] (where [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] was a contemporary),<ref name=Thornton>{{cite book|last1=Thornton|first1=David|title=Mr Mercury - a biographical study of Edward Baines with special reference to his role as editor, author and politician|date=1999|publisher=University of Leeds, School of History|location=Leeds|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/441/1/uk_bl_ethos_269708.pdf}} (e-published PhD thesis)</ref> and then in the lower school of the grammar school in Preston.<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|42}}  He then became a weaver, but at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed for seven years to a printer in Preston. In the fifth year of his apprenticeship, he terminated it and moved to [[Leeds]], where he finished his apprenticeship with the printer of the ''[[Leeds Mercury]]'', one of two Leeds weekly newspapers. In later years, both Baines and his political opponents would have it that he arrived in Leeds with little more than the clothes on his back  {{efn| but where Baines and his admirers thought ambition (or disagreement with his master) the reason for his move some of his opponents (such as [[Richard Oastler]])said he was escaping a pregnant fiancee in Preston<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|46\u20137}}}} but on completion of his apprenticeship he set up his own printworks with the aid of a loan of \u00a3100 from his father.<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|55}} He became a member of the Leeds Reasoning Society (a discussion group which eschewed religious or political issues) and of the local subscription library. He became attracted to [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformism]], and after attending the chapels of both Unitarians and Congregationalists settled for the latter (although he did not formally become a member until 1840).<ref name=\"Thornton\" />{{rp|290}} (He married Charlotte Talbot in 1798; she and their children were also lifelong non-conformists, with the exception of the eldest son [[Matthew Talbot Baines]] who became an [[Church of England|Anglican]], and therefore was able to take a degree at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].)\n\n==Journalism==\n===Revitalisation of ''Leeds Mercury''===\nIn 1801, he was approached to start a third Leeds newspaper to support the interests of Dissent and Reform ; the ''Mercury'' was not a reliable friend of Dissent and the leading paper, the ''[[Leeds Intelligencer]]'', was avowedly opposed. In the event, the owner of the ''Mercury'' offered to sell up, and with the help of loans from like-minded supporters Baines bought the paper for \u00a31552.<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|61\u20132}}  The paper he acquired was published every Saturday, cost sixpence (including fourpence newspaper tax) for four pages, and had a circulation of 700\u2013800. Baines set about improving content and circulation. Baines rapidly introduced material reflecting the commercial interests of Leeds: regular agricultural and commercial reports, shipping news (from Hull and from Liverpool) and a report of the state of the London markets. Political affairs were not neglected; a digest of parliamentary proceedings in the previous week was also added.  The ''Mercury'' soon outsold the ''Intelligencer'', and by 1807 it was selling up to 3 000 copies in a good week. Production methods were improved and outclassed those of the ''Intelligencer'', with new fonts allowing more text per page, and cast-iron handpresses allowing clearer printing than wooden ones. He encouraged \"letters to the editor\" and was amongst the first provincial newspaper editors to make editorial comment a routine feature of their paper. His leading articles could be vigorous and pointed.

In 1805 a new editor of the ''Leeds Intelligencer'' attacked the ''Mercury'' as \"bespattered with ... sedition\"; together with Baines' heated response this initiated a long-lasting state of mutual incivility between the two papers which makes each an unreliable source for the other's deeds and motives.{{efn| For example, in 1817 Baines spoke ('after acknowledging that spontaneous burst of public favour which had called him forth' according to the report in the ''Mercury'')<ref>{{cite news|title=Leeds Meeting to Address the Prince Regent|work=Leeds Mercury|date=1 March 1817|page=3}}</ref> at a Leeds meeting drawing up a loyal address to the Prince Regent.

It noted that they had been arrested the previous week at a meeting near Dewsbury between them and a [[William J. Oliver|Mr Oliver]], who had represented himself as a delegate from a central organising committee in London; its readers would probably infer that 'Oliver' was a spy. Following the arrest of the men, there had been disturbances at Huddersfield and Ossett.  The second edition made three further charges, supported by the evidence of respectable named moderate reformers: firstly that 'Oliver' had repeatedly urged one of them a Dewsbury bookseller, to attend the meeting: secondly, that 'Oliver' had been seen by another of them at Wakefield after the arrests, and with no satisfactory explanation why he was still at liberty: thirdly that he had been seen in conversation with a liveried man-servant of General Byng, the army officer responsible for internal security in the North of England, the man-servant later saying that on a previous occasion he had driven Oliver from Byng's house to Wakefield to catch a coach. The Mercury made no charge against Byng, but asked who were the employers of 'this double-distilled traitor' and called upon local magistrates to investigate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Projected Insurrection in Yorkshire|work=Leeds Mercury|date=14 June 1817|page=3}}</ref> \"On the 16th the exposure of Oliver in the Leeds Mercury was read in both houses of parliament, by Earl Grey in the lords and Sir Francis Burdett in the commons.

Fitzwilliam advised the Huddersfield magistrates not to gather evidence against their rioters; that could only come from accomplices and hence be highly objectionable. At York assizes, the judge in his direction to the jury was even harsher than Fitzwilliam on the unreliability of the evidence of accomplices, and no convictions were secured. Whilst the ''Mercury''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s exposure of Oliver prevented the conviction of the Yorkshire prisoners, in Derbyshire the participants in the '[[Pentrich rising|Pentridge rebellion]]' (also triggered by Oliver) were not so fortunate, having by mischance killed a man before dispersing when faced with the magistrates and twenty dragoons.

Oliver had made a previous tour of the North and Midlands with Mitchell, who knew and introduced him to potential insurrectionists. Mitchell was arrested in early May and Oliver made his second tour alone. After Oliver's exposure, Baines prevented Mitchell speaking at meetings of Yorkshire fellow reformers, alleging that Mitchell was under the gravest suspicion of being a spy too.

His first book - a ''History of the Wars of the French Revolution'' - was published in 1817, having first been published as a part-work from 1814 onwards.  Its account up to 1801 borrowed extensively (and sometimes ''verbatim'') from another author's earlier work of 1803 on the same topic (A Stephens ''The History of the Wars Which Arose out of the French Revolution to Which is Prefixed a Review of the Causes of that Event'' (London 1803)). This went unacknowledged until Baines revised, expanded and retitled the work as a ''History of the Reign of King George III'' (1820); his new preface stating \"To facilitate ... progress, and at the recommendation of the publisher and proprietor of Mr Alexander Stephens' s History of the Wars published in 1803, nearly half the details of the first volume were abridged from that work.\"  This later led to denunciation of Baines as a plagiarist by one of the editors of the ''Intelligencer''. He also produced history/directory/gazetteers for Yorkshire and for Lancashire, later reworking the latter as a county history, ''The History of the County Palatine of Lancaster''.\n\n==Political career==\n===Leeds===\nAs proprietor and editor of the ''Mercury'' Baines became an important figure in the affairs of Leeds.  An obituary in 1848 noted <blockquote>Mr Baines took a part in the formation and support of many, if not most of the public institutions of Leeds.  In early youth he was a visitor of the Benevolent, or Strangers' Friend Society, to which he always continued a warm friend.  He assisted to establish the House of Recovery, the Dispensary, the Lancasterian School, the Philosophical Society, the Mechanics' Institution, the Literary Society, the New Library, the Tradesman's Benevolent Society, the Leeds and Yorkshire Insurance Company, our Provident institutions, our Waterworks\u2026- in short, nearly all the institutions for public utility and benevolence established in Leeds within the last half century<ref name=\"Ltimesobit\">{{cite news|title=Death of Edward Baines, Esq|work=Leeds Times|date=5 August 1848|page=5}}</ref></blockquote>\nHe also became an important figure in Leeds politics, although as a Dissenter and a Reformer he was effectively excluded from Leeds Corporation which until the 1830s was a 'closed corporation'; vacancies were filled by election by the existing members of the corporation; they were Tories and generally Anglicans, and hence so were their successors. One area of political life from which Reformers and Dissenters could not be excluded was the vestry meeting of the (Anglican) parish church - all property owners (including Dissenters and other non-conformists) had to pay church rates and rate-payers were entitled to attend and vote. Baines fought a prolonged campaign to impose strict economy on church outgoings, starting in 1819 with a demand that accounts be published, and finally in 1828 managing to secure the election of churchwardens committed to economy.<ref name=\"Thornton\" />{{rp|192}}{{efn|By 1833, church out goings had been reduced from \u00a31500 a year to \u00a3500. Although Baines had some Anglican allies, the 1832 Leeds election showed a strong denominational tinge to Leeds politics: helped by the fact that the Tory candidate ([[Michael Thomas Sadler]] (a vocal opponent of Baines at vestry meetings) although now an Anglican was well-known to have been a Methodist in his earlier years}}\n \nIn the decade before the Great Reform Act of 1832 Leeds was not a parliamentary borough but was included in the Yorkshire constituency, now returning four MPs (normally two Whigs and two Tories, normally unopposed). In the 1830 General Election, Baines organised West Riding reformers to ensure that their interests were reflected by the choice of [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]] as one of the two Whig nominees. On the Whigs coming to power, Brougham became [[Lord Chancellor]], necessitating a by-election: this time the Whigs of rural Yorkshire forestalled the West Riding and secured a more traditional candidate: Sir [[John Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone]] of Harkness Hall, near Scarborough  <!-- http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/vanden-bempde-johnstone-sir-john-1799-1869 -->\n\nBaines was a leading light in reform agitation in Leeds, and was commissioned by [[Lord John Russell]] to determine whether qualification in borough constituencies could safely be set as low as \u00a310 (rates paid a year).<ref name=\"Thornton\" /> Baines found that in Leeds a \u00a310 franchise would give the vote to the middle classes but still exclude the working classes: the results of Baines' investigation were reported by Russell in parliamentary debate as showing that \"the \u00a310 qualification does not admit any person who may not safely be intrusted with the elective franchise\".<ref name = LJR>{{cite journal|title=PARLIAMENTARY REFORM\u2014BILL FOR ENGLAND\u2014SECOND READING\u2014ADJOURNED DEBATE.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=17 December 1831|volume=9|issue=cc429-547|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1831/dec/17/parliamentary-reform-bill-for-england|accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>{{efn|... Leeds has been regularly canvassed for the purposes of election, by twenty or thirty gentlemen, of respectable station and known character, in that chief seat of our woollen manufacture. The result of their canvass has been, that, in the quarters of the town chiefly inhabited by the working classes, not more than one in every fifty householders will have a vote under the 10l. clause. In the principal streets for shops, almost every male householder will have a vote. In the parts of the town occupied by dwelling houses, the number occupied by females makes a very material deduction from the number of votes. The working classes in Leeds, almost all live in houses of from 5l. to 8l. rent; out of 140 householders, heads of families (including several overlookers) employed in the mill of Messrs. Marshall and Co., not more than two will have votes; out of 160 householders in the mill of Messrs. C.

The township of Wortley has nearly 6,000 individuals, and 130 voters. Armley, with 5,000 inhabitants, will have only 150 votes. Upon the whole, the unanimous opinion of the canvassers was, that the 10l. qualification does not admit any person who may not safely be intrusted with the elective franchise...<ref name = LJR />}} As the reform crisis of 1831-2 developed, Radicals (who wanted a more thorough-going reform: significantly wider suffrage, annual parliaments and the secret ballot) broke away from the Leeds reform organisation (the Leeds Association, set up by Baines and his associates) and founded the Leeds Radical Reform Union, pressing for Whig reform bills to be more thorough-going with a minority holding that they should be opposed (as a half-measure intended to choke off thorough reform). Baines strove to minimise the Radical breakaway, and to retain Radical support for moderate reform, by his own actions, by encouraging formation of a rival Leeds Political Union, by editorials in the ''Mercury'' and by ensuring that Radical meetings and manifestations were reported upon unfavourably by the ''Mercury''. The ''Leeds Patriot'', a Radical paper, soon found itself under attack from Baines, responding that \"veracity has no charms for Mr Baines, when he has an object to carry...he will stoop to the meanest prevarication and the most contemptible falsehoods\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Baines and His Audacious Falsehoods|work=Leeds Patriot and Yorkshire Advertiser|date=30 April 1831|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn the expectation that the Reform Bill of 1831, would pass, and would establish [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds as a two-member borough constituency]], the Leeds reformers chose two candidates in August 1831: [[John Marshall (MP for Leeds, died 1836)|John Marshall]] (whose father, also [[John Marshall (industrialist)|John Marshall]] was a leading Leeds millowner and had served as an MP for Yorkshire), and (at Baines's urging) [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], a gifted Whig orator with a national reputation, but no previous connection with Leeds. When elections for the first reformed parliament eventually took place in December 1832, the two Whigs comfortably defeated the sole Tory candidate [[Michael Thomas Sadler]] despite active support for Sadler from the Leeds radical reformers.  Sadler had taken up the issue of [[Factory Acts|factory reform]]; the ''Mercury'' (which had printed [[Richard Oastler]]'s first letter on \"Yorkshire Slavery\" (the over-working and ill-treatment of children in the West Riding textile industry) before cooling on the issue) denounced this as a Tory trick to lure the gullible away from the Whig reform programme.  (Baines and the ''Mercury'' were to hold similar views on the anti-Poor Law movement of the late 1830s; the underlying cause of working-class discontent was the Corn Laws, and all efforts should go into removing the underlying cause, rather than palliating its symptoms). Years of activity by Sadler and his brother in Leeds meant that much was known for and against him, and the ''Mercury'' was assiduous in reminding its readers of the 'against'.\n\nThe Tories and their Radical allies had attacked Macaulay as a placeman and a stranger: interested in Leeds only as providing him with a seat in Parliament; interested in a seat in Parliament largely as a means of securing comfortable sinecures for himself and his family (whose government appointments were currently yielding them a total annual income of over \u00a34000).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Common Sense|title=Letter to an Elector of Leeds|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=18 October 1832|page=4}} goes into this in detail</ref> The Macaulay family was seriously financially embarrassed, and Macaulay soon decided that income from posts held only for so long as the Whigs held power was insufficiently secure. He resigned from parliament and went out to India in 1834 as a member of the supreme council of India, on an annual salary of \u00a310,000.  Baines was the Whig candidate at the ensuing by-election; there was a separate Radical candidate, but Baines's chief opponent was the Tory [[Sir John Beckett, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Beckett]].  Beckett was Leeds-born and educated; the Beckett family bank was pre-eminent in Leeds (\"The Rothschilds and Barings of Leeds\") and was recognised to have acted in the interests of Leeds as a whole in past crises, but Sir John had pursued a legal career away from Leeds, culminating in his appointment in mid-1817 (soon after his marriage to a daughter of the [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale|Earl of Lonsdale]]) as [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Judge Advocate-General]], and consequent entry into Parliament in 1818 in [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]], one of his father-in-law's [[pocket borough]]s. As the ''Mercury'' pointed out,<ref>quoted at length in {{cite news|title=Leeds Election|work=Morning Chronicle|date=27 January 1834|page=3}}</ref> he had been Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office from 1806 to 1817, the ''Mercury'' going on to claim that it was from him that Oliver had received his instructions {{efn|Beckett was employed as a lawyer, not a politician, and was (he asserted) ignorant of the existence of Oliver until his exposure.  There is (to this day) at least plausible deniability that the Home Office knew precisely what Oliver was up to.

In the fifth year of his apprenticeship, he terminated it and moved to [[Leeds]], where he finished his apprenticeship with the printer of the ''[[Leeds Mercury]]'', one of two Leeds weekly newspapers. In later years, both Baines and his political opponents would have it that he arrived in Leeds with little more than the clothes on his back  {{efn| but where Baines and his admirers thought ambition (or disagreement with his master) the reason for his move some of his opponents (such as [[Richard Oastler]])said he was escaping a pregnant fiancee in Preston<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|46\u20137}}}} but on completion of his apprenticeship he set up his own printworks with the aid of a loan of \u00a3100 from his father.<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|55}} He became a member of the Leeds Reasoning Society (a discussion group which eschewed religious or political issues) and of the local subscription library. He became attracted to [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformism]], and after attending the chapels of both Unitarians and Congregationalists settled for the latter (although he did not formally become a member until 1840).<ref name=\"Thornton\" />{{rp|290}} (He married Charlotte Talbot in 1798; she and their children were also lifelong non-conformists, with the exception of the eldest son [[Matthew Talbot Baines]] who became an [[Church of England|Anglican]], and therefore was able to take a degree at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].)\n\n==Journalism==\n===Revitalisation of ''Leeds Mercury''===\nIn 1801, he was approached to start a third Leeds newspaper to support the interests of Dissent and Reform ; the ''Mercury'' was not a reliable friend of Dissent and the leading paper, the ''[[Leeds Intelligencer]]'', was avowedly opposed. In the event, the owner of the ''Mercury'' offered to sell up, and with the help of loans from like-minded supporters Baines bought the paper for \u00a31552.<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|61\u20132}}  The paper he acquired was published every Saturday, cost sixpence (including fourpence newspaper tax) for four pages, and had a circulation of 700-800. Baines set about improving content and circulation. Baines rapidly introduced material reflecting the commercial interests of Leeds: regular agricultural and commercial reports, shipping news (from Hull and from Liverpool) and a report of the state of the London markets. Political affairs were not neglected; a digest of parliamentary proceedings in the previous week was also added.  The ''Mercury'' soon outsold the ''Intelligencer'', and by 1807 it was selling up to 3 000 copies in a good week. Production methods were improved and outclassed those of the ''Intelligencer'', with new fonts allowing more text per page, and cast-iron handpresses allowing clearer printing than wooden ones. He encouraged \"letters to the editor\" and was amongst the first provincial newspaper editors to make editorial comment a routine feature of their paper. His leading articles could be vigorous and pointed. In the first ''Mercury'' under new ownership, Baines promised \"Our Paper shall never be made the Vehicle of Party or Personal Abuse\"<ref>editorial on page 1 of the ''Leeds Mercury'' for 7 March 1801 which was reproduced in facsimile as page 7 of the ''Leeds Mercury'' of 17 September 1836</ref> but within the year the ''Mercury'' was exchanging insults with the ''[[Cambridge Intelligencer]]'', which accused the ''Mercury'' of dancing to the Government's tune with vague reports of (and editorial comment deploring) nocturnal meetings of the disaffected. In 1805 a new editor of the ''Leeds Intelligencer'' attacked the ''Mercury'' as \"bespattered with ... sedition\"; together with Baines' heated response this initiated a long-lasting state of mutual incivility between the two papers which makes each an unreliable source for the other's deeds and motives.{{efn| For example, in 1817 Baines spoke ('after acknowledging that spontaneous burst of public favour which had called him forth' according to the report in the ''Mercury'')<ref>{{cite news|title=Leeds Meeting to Address the Prince Regent|work=Leeds Mercury|date=1 March 1817|page=3}}</ref> at a Leeds meeting drawing up a loyal address to the Prince Regent.  The report of the speech finished with an assertion to which the next Intelligencer (3 March)responded at length, inviting its readers to \"read your assertion that \"THE DELIVERY OF THAT SPEECH \u2026 MADE THE PROPRIETOR OF THE INTELLIGENCER, WITH THE PUSILLANIMITY FOR WHICH HE IS REMARKABLE, SHRINK BACK IN SILENT DISMAY!\" - let them read this assertion; and then let them have mercy on the feelings of Mr Baines, if he has any, when they are told (what is the fact) that the Proprietor of the Intelligencer had actually ''retired from the Meeting'', immediately after the Address was carried, ''long before Mr Baines began to speak'' - never dreaming, impudent as the \"factious editor\" of the Mercury is, that at such a meeting, ''even he'' could have the effrontery to intrude his well-known canting trash upon the public!\"}}  According to counsel in an 1820 libel case \"When there was a dearth of political news, nothing was more common for one Editor to attack another, and the public appeared to find amusement in their squabbles\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Yorkshire Spring Assizes: Important to Newspaper Editors - Libel Watts v Baines|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=1 April 1824|page=3}}</ref>\nThe ''Mercury'' sent its own reporters to significant events outside its circulation area, such as York Assizes: a ''Mercury'' reporter was present and taking shorthand notes at the giant Reform meeting at Manchester which became the [[Peterloo massacre]].  That reporter was Baines' second son Edward, who from 1820 onwards progressively took over the everyday running of the ''Mercury'' as his father became more involved in local politics.<ref name=Thornton />{{rp|182}}  Not only did the ''Mercury'' displace the ''Intelligencer'' as the leading Leeds paper, by 1832 it could be described by another provincial paper as \"the leading provincial paper in England\"<ref>so described by the ''Western Times''; comment was reprinted in the ''Mercury'', and the ''Mercury''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s response reprinted (with sardonic comments on false modesty) as {{cite news|title=The ''Western Times'' and the ''Leeds Mercury''|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=16 February 1832|page=4}}</ref>\n\n=== \"The spy Oliver\"===\nOn 14 June 1817, the first edition of the ''Mercury'' reported that ten Yorkshire men were held in Wakefield jail accused of planning insurrection. It noted that they had been arrested the previous week at a meeting near Dewsbury between them and a [[William J. Oliver|Mr Oliver]], who had represented himself as a delegate from a central organising committee in London; its readers would probably infer that 'Oliver' was a spy. Following the arrest of the men, there had been disturbances at Huddersfield and Ossett.  The second edition made three further charges, supported by the evidence of respectable named moderate reformers: firstly that 'Oliver' had repeatedly urged one of them a Dewsbury bookseller, to attend the meeting: secondly, that 'Oliver' had been seen by another of them at Wakefield after the arrests, and with no satisfactory explanation why he was still at liberty: thirdly that he had been seen in conversation with a liveried man-servant of General Byng, the army officer responsible for internal security in the North of England, the man-servant later saying that on a previous occasion he had driven Oliver from Byng's house to Wakefield to catch a coach. The Mercury made no charge against Byng, but asked who were the employers of 'this double-distilled traitor' and called upon local magistrates to investigate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Projected Insurrection in Yorkshire|work=Leeds Mercury|date=14 June 1817|page=3}}</ref> \"On the 16th the exposure of Oliver in the Leeds Mercury was read in both houses of parliament, by Earl Grey in the lords and Sir Francis Burdett in the commons.

[[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Earl Fitzwilliam]], a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] magnate and Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding, wrote to the Home Office saying that any disturbances in the Riding had been minor and were brought about by Oliver's activities (of which he complained) : the government should not use them to justify a renewed suspension of [[Habeas Corpus]]. Fitzwilliam advised the Huddersfield magistrates not to gather evidence against their rioters; that could only come from accomplices and hence be highly objectionable. At York assizes, the judge in his direction to the jury was even harsher than Fitzwilliam on the unreliability of the evidence of accomplices, and no convictions were secured. Whilst the ''Mercury''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s exposure of Oliver prevented the conviction of the Yorkshire prisoners, in Derbyshire the participants in the '[[Pentrich rising|Pentridge rebellion]]' (also triggered by Oliver) were not so fortunate, having by mischance killed a man before dispersing when faced with the magistrates and twenty dragoons. Thirty-five were tried for high treason and twenty-three convicted; four being executed.<ref name=skilled>{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=J L|authorlink1 = John Lawrence Hammond|last2=Hammond|first2=Barbara|authorlink2 = Barbara Hammond|title=The Skilled Labourer 1760-1832|date=1995|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=0-7509-0967-6|edition=paperback}}</ref>{{rp|362\u2013366}}  Baines could therefore claim to have saved the lives of fellow-Yorkshiremen., and the unmasking of 'Oliver' gave Baines a national reputation.\n\nHowever, critics such as [[William Cobbett]] pointed out that it was the suspicions of a linen-draper, rather than any investigation by the editor of the ''Mercury'', that had unmasked Oliver.,<ref name=\"CobbettLeeds1830\">{{cite news|title=Northern Tour|work=Cobbett's Weekly Political Register|date=6 February 1830|pages=1\u20132}}</ref> and objected to Baines's treatment of Joseph Mitchell. Oliver had made a previous tour of the North and Midlands with Mitchell, who knew and introduced him to potential insurrectionists. Mitchell was arrested in early May and Oliver made his second tour alone. After Oliver's exposure, Baines prevented Mitchell speaking at meetings of Yorkshire fellow reformers, alleging that Mitchell was under the gravest suspicion of being a spy too. No evidence (other than 'guilt by association') to support Mitchell being an informer - let alone an ''agent provocateur'' -  was produced at the time, nor has any been revealed by subsequent investigation in Home Office archives.<ref name=\"skilled\" />\n\n===\"The Great Liar of the North\"===\nBaines used the ''Mercury'' to advance the causes he supported, and to resist those he opposed, not only in its editorials, but also in its news reporting.  This went beyond the selective choice of events to report, and non-neutral reporting of events covered, to the confident assertion of convenient untruths: for example on factory reform the Mercury asserted that [[Michael Thomas Sadler]] had never spoken, attended a debate or voted on Hobhouse's Bill of 1831, (a statement promptly contradicted by Hobhouse);<ref>untitled editorial item on page 3 following generic header of {{cite news|title=The Leeds Intelligencer; Thursday 15 December 1831|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=15 December 1831|page=2}}</ref> it put into the mouth of [[Sir George Strickland, 7th Baronet|Sir George Strickland]] a speech in Parliament calling for Sadler's Bill of 1832 to go to a Select Committee, when Strickland had made no such speech and had called for the Bill to be considered by a \"Committee of the whole House\" and not be delayed by a Select Committee;<ref>{{cite journal|title=LABOUR OF CHILDREN IN FACTORIES|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=10 February 1832|volume=10|pages=cc190-5|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1832/feb/10/labour-of-children-in-factories#S3V0010P0_18320210_HOC_5}}</ref> when Strickland attended a great county meeting in York on factory reform and disowned the words put in his mouth by the ''Mercury'' the ''Mercury''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s report put into Strickland's mouth its explanation of its mistake, avoiding any mention of the ''Leeds Mercury''.

This went unacknowledged until Baines revised, expanded and retitled the work as a ''History of the Reign of King George III'' (1820); his new preface stating \"To facilitate ... progress, and at the recommendation of the publisher and proprietor of Mr Alexander Stephens' s History of the Wars published in 1803, nearly half the details of the first volume were abridged from that work.\"  This later led to denunciation of Baines as a plagiarist by one of the editors of the ''Intelligencer''. He also produced history/directory/gazetteers for Yorkshire and for Lancashire, later reworking the latter as a county history, ''The History of the County Palatine of Lancaster''.\n\n==Political career==\n===Leeds===\nAs proprietor and editor of the ''Mercury'' Baines became an important figure in the affairs of Leeds.  An obituary in 1848 noted <blockquote>Mr Baines took a part in the formation and support of many, if not most of the public institutions of Leeds.  In early youth he was a visitor of the Benevolent, or Strangers' Friend Society, to which he always continued a warm friend.  He assisted to establish the House of Recovery, the Dispensary, the Lancasterian School, the Philosophical Society, the Mechanics' Institution, the Literary Society, the New Library, the Tradesman's Benevolent Society, the Leeds and Yorkshire Insurance Company, our Provident institutions, our Waterworks\u2026- in short, nearly all the institutions for public utility and benevolence established in Leeds within the last half century<ref name=\"Ltimesobit\">{{cite news|title=Death of Edward Baines, Esq|work=Leeds Times|date=5 August 1848|page=5}}</ref></blockquote>\nHe also became an important figure in Leeds politics, although as a Dissenter and a Reformer he was effectively excluded from Leeds Corporation which until the 1830s was a 'closed corporation'; vacancies were filled by election by the existing members of the corporation; they were Tories and generally Anglicans, and hence so were their successors. One area of political life from which Reformers and Dissenters could not be excluded was the vestry meeting of the (Anglican) parish church - all property owners (including Dissenters and other non-conformists) had to pay church rates and rate-payers were entitled to attend and vote. Baines fought a prolonged campaign to impose strict economy on church outgoings, starting in 1819 with a demand that accounts be published, and finally in 1828 managing to secure the election of churchwardens committed to economy.<ref name=\"Thornton\" />{{rp|192}}{{efn|By 1833, church out goings had been reduced from \u00a31500 a year to \u00a3500. Although Baines had some Anglican allies, the 1832 Leeds election showed a strong denominational tinge to Leeds politics: helped by the fact that the Tory candidate ([[Michael Thomas Sadler]] (a vocal opponent of Baines at vestry meetings) although now an Anglican was well-known to have been a Methodist in his earlier years}}\n \nIn the decade before the Great Reform Act of 1832 Leeds was not a parliamentary borough but was included in the Yorkshire constituency, now returning four MPs (normally two Whigs and two Tories, normally unopposed). In the 1830 General Election, Baines organised West Riding reformers to ensure that their interests were reflected by the choice of [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]] as one of the two Whig nominees. On the Whigs coming to power, Brougham became [[Lord Chancellor]], necessitating a by-election: this time the Whigs of rural Yorkshire forestalled the West Riding and secured a more traditional candidate: Sir [[John Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone]] of Harkness Hall, near Scarborough  <!-- http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/vanden-bempde-johnstone-sir-john-1799-1869 -->\n\nBaines was a leading light in reform agitation in Leeds, and was commissioned by [[Lord John Russell]] to determine whether qualification in borough constituencies could safely be set as low as \u00a310 (rates paid a year).<ref name=\"Thornton\" /> Baines found that in Leeds a \u00a310 franchise would give the vote to the middle classes but still exclude the working classes: the results of Baines' investigation were reported by Russell in parliamentary debate as showing that \"the \u00a310 qualification does not admit any person who may not safely be intrusted with the elective franchise\".<ref name = LJR>{{cite journal|title=PARLIAMENTARY REFORM\u2014BILL FOR ENGLAND\u2014SECOND READING\u2014ADJOURNED DEBATE.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=17 December 1831|volume=9|issue=cc429-547|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1831/dec/17/parliamentary-reform-bill-for-england|accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>{{efn|... Leeds has been regularly canvassed for the purposes of election, by twenty or thirty gentlemen, of respectable station and known character, in that chief seat of our woollen manufacture. The result of their canvass has been, that, in the quarters of the town chiefly inhabited by the working classes, not more than one in every fifty householders will have a vote under the 10l. clause. In the principal streets for shops, almost every male householder will have a vote. In the parts of the town occupied by dwelling houses, the number occupied by females makes a very material deduction from the number of votes. The working classes in Leeds, almost all live in houses of from 5l. to 8l. rent; out of 140 householders, heads of families (including several overlookers) employed in the mill of Messrs. Marshall and Co., not more than two will have votes; out of 160 householders in the mill of Messrs. C. Willans and Sons, Holbeck (including fifteen overlookers) many earning 25s. to 30s. a-week, not one will have a vote; out of 100 householders in the works of Messrs. Taylor and Wordsworth, machine makers, only one, even of this high class of mechanics, will have a vote; out of 11,000 inhabitants of the township of Holbeck, chiefly occupied by the working classes, but also containing mills, dye-houses, public-houses, and some respectable dwellings, there would be only 150 voters. The township of Wortley has nearly 6,000 individuals, and 130 voters. Armley, with 5,000 inhabitants, will have only 150 votes. Upon the whole, the unanimous opinion of the canvassers was, that the 10l. qualification does not admit any person who may not safely be intrusted with the elective franchise...<ref name = LJR />}} As the reform crisis of 1831-2 developed, Radicals (who wanted a more thorough-going reform: significantly wider suffrage, annual parliaments and the secret ballot) broke away from the Leeds reform organisation (the Leeds Association, set up by Baines and his associates) and founded the Leeds Radical Reform Union, pressing for Whig reform bills to be more thorough-going with a minority holding that they should be opposed (as a half-measure intended to choke off thorough reform). Baines strove to minimise the Radical breakaway, and to retain Radical support for moderate reform, by his own actions, by encouraging formation of a rival Leeds Political Union, by editorials in the ''Mercury'' and by ensuring that Radical meetings and manifestations were reported upon unfavourably by the ''Mercury''. The ''Leeds Patriot'', a Radical paper, soon found itself under attack from Baines, responding that \"veracity has no charms for Mr Baines, when he has an object to carry...he will stoop to the meanest prevarication and the most contemptible falsehoods\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Baines and His Audacious Falsehoods|work=Leeds Patriot and Yorkshire Advertiser|date=30 April 1831|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn the expectation that the Reform Bill of 1831, would pass, and would establish [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds as a two-member borough constituency]], the Leeds reformers chose two candidates in August 1831: [[John Marshall (MP for Leeds, died 1836)|John Marshall]] (whose father, also [[John Marshall (industrialist)|John Marshall]] was a leading Leeds millowner and had served as an MP for Yorkshire), and (at Baines's urging) [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], a gifted Whig orator with a national reputation, but no previous connection with Leeds. When elections for the first reformed parliament eventually took place in December 1832, the two Whigs comfortably defeated the sole Tory candidate [[Michael Thomas Sadler]] despite active support for Sadler from the Leeds radical reformers.  Sadler had taken up the issue of [[Factory Acts|factory reform]]; the ''Mercury'' (which had printed [[Richard Oastler]]'s first letter on \"Yorkshire Slavery\" (the over-working and ill-treatment of children in the West Riding textile industry) before cooling on the issue) denounced this as a Tory trick to lure the gullible away from the Whig reform programme.  (Baines and the ''Mercury'' were to hold similar views on the anti-Poor Law movement of the late 1830s; the underlying cause of working-class discontent was the Corn Laws, and all efforts should go into removing the underlying cause, rather than palliating its symptoms). Years of activity by Sadler and his brother in Leeds meant that much was known for and against him, and the ''Mercury'' was assiduous in reminding its readers of the 'against'.\n\nThe Tories and their Radical allies had attacked Macaulay as a placeman and a stranger: interested in Leeds only as providing him with a seat in Parliament; interested in a seat in Parliament largely as a means of securing comfortable sinecures for himself and his family (whose government appointments were currently yielding them a total annual income of over \u00a34000).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Common Sense|title=Letter to an Elector of Leeds|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=18 October 1832|page=4}} goes into this in detail</ref> The Macaulay family was seriously financially embarrassed, and Macaulay soon decided that income from posts held only for so long as the Whigs held power was insufficiently secure. He resigned from parliament and went out to India in 1834 as a member of the supreme council of India, on an annual salary of \u00a310,000.  Baines was the Whig candidate at the ensuing by-election; there was a separate Radical candidate, but Baines's chief opponent was the Tory [[Sir John Beckett, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Beckett]].  Beckett was Leeds-born and educated; the Beckett family bank was pre-eminent in Leeds (\"The Rothschilds and Barings of Leeds\") and was recognised to have acted in the interests of Leeds as a whole in past crises, but Sir John had pursued a legal career away from Leeds, culminating in his appointment in mid-1817 (soon after his marriage to a daughter of the [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale|Earl of Lonsdale]]) as [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Judge Advocate-General]], and consequent entry into Parliament in 1818 in [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]], one of his father-in-law's [[pocket borough]]s. As the ''Mercury'' pointed out,<ref>quoted at length in {{cite news|title=Leeds Election|work=Morning Chronicle|date=27 January 1834|page=3}}</ref> he had been Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office from 1806 to 1817, the ''Mercury'' going on to claim that it was from him that Oliver had received his instructions {{efn|Beckett was employed as a lawyer, not a politician, and was (he asserted) ignorant of the existence of Oliver until his exposure.  There is (to this day) at least plausible deniability that the Home Office knew precisely what Oliver was up to. When the Whig opposition objected strongly in Parliament to Oliver having been sent on tour as an ''agent provocateur'', Lord Liverpool said Oliver had been positively instructed not to going beyond information-gathering to the encouragement or incitement of insurrection<ref>{{cite journal|title=HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL|journal=Hansard House of Lords Debates|date=16 June 1817|volume=36|pages=cc975-1016}}</ref> Informants present at other meetings attended by 'Oliver' took him at face value (as a genuine delegate from insurrectionists in London) and reported to local magistrates his presence and incitement of insurrection, but the magistrates to whom they reported had not been informed by the Home Office that Oliver was working for it.<ref name=\"skilled\" />}} These and other accusations against Beckett were widely placarded across Leeds.

Environmental health is focused on the natural and built environments for the benefit of human health. The major subdisciplines of environmental health are: [[environmental science]]; environmental and occupational medicine, [[toxicology]] and [[epidemiology]].\n\nOther terms referring to or concerning environmental health are environmental public health, public health protection, and environmental health protection.\n\n==Definitions==\nEnvironmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the [World Health Organization] (WHO) as:\nThose aspects of the human health and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially affect health.\n\n:Environmental health as used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, includes both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the effects (often indirect) on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment, which includes housing, urban development, land use and transport.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Novice| first = Robert (editor) | title = Overview of the environment and health in Europe in the 1990s| work = | publisher = World Health Organization| date =  1999-03-29| url = http://www.euro.who.int/document/e66792.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2016 the WHO website on environmental health states \"Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, as well as genetics.\"<ref>{{cite web| title = Health topics: Environmental health| url = http://www.who.int/topics/environmental_health/en/|author=WHO|date=n.d.|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe WHO has also defined environmental health services as \"those services which implement environmental health policies through monitoring and control activities. They also carry out that role by promoting the improvement of environmental parameters and by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly and healthy technologies and behaviors. They also have a leading role in developing and suggesting new policy areas.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe term [[environmental medicine]] may be seen as a medical specialty, or branch of the broader field of environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Terminology is not fully established, and in many European countries they are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Disciplines ==\n\n'''Five basic disciplines''' generally contribute to the field of environmental health: '''environmental epidemiology, toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, and environmental law'''. Each of these disciplines contributes different information to describe problems and solutions in environmental health, but there is some overlap among them.\n\n:*[[Environmental epidemiology]] studies the relationship between environmental exposures (including exposure to chemicals, radiation, microbiological agents, etc.) and human health. Observational studies, which simply observe exposures that people have already experienced, are common in environmental epidemiology because humans cannot ethically be exposed to agents that are known or suspected to cause disease. While the inability to use experimental study designs is a limitation of environmental epidemiology, this discipline directly observes effects on human health rather than estimating effects from animal studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n:*[[Toxicology]] studies how environmental exposures lead to specific health outcomes, generally in animals, as a means to understand possible health outcomes in humans. Toxicology has the advantage of being able to conduct randomized controlled trials and other experimental studies because they can use animal subjects.

Environmental health is focused on the natural and built environments for the benefit of human health. The major subdisciplines of environmental health are: [[environmental science]]; environmental and occupational medicine, [[toxicology]] and [[epidemiology]].\n\nOther terms referring to or concerning environmental health are environmental public health, public health protection, and environmental health protection.\n\n==Definitions==\nEnvironmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the [World Health Organization] (WHO) as:\nThose aspects of the human health and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially affect health.\n\n:Environmental health as used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, includes both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the effects (often indirect) on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment, which includes housing, urban development, land use and transport.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Novice| first = Robert (editor) | title = Overview of the environment and health in Europe in the 1990s| work = | publisher = World Health Organization| date =  1999-03-29| url = http://www.euro.who.int/document/e66792.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2016 the WHO website on environmental health states \"Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, as well as genetics.\"<ref>{{cite web| title = Health topics: Environmental health| url = http://www.who.int/topics/environmental_health/en/|author=WHO|date=n.d.|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe WHO has also defined environmental health services as \"those services which implement environmental health policies through monitoring and control activities. They also carry out that role by promoting the improvement of environmental parameters and by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly and healthy technologies and behaviors. They also have a leading role in developing and suggesting new policy areas.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe term [[environmental medicine]] may be seen as a medical specialty, or branch of the broader field of environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Terminology is not fully established, and in many European countries they are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Disciplines ==\n\n'''Five basic disciplines''' generally contribute to the field of environmental health: '''environmental epidemiology, toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, and environmental law'''. Each of these disciplines contributes different information to describe problems and solutions in environmental health, but there is some overlap among them.\n\n:*[[Environmental epidemiology]] studies the relationship between environmental exposures (including exposure to chemicals, radiation, microbiological agents, etc.) and human health. Observational studies, which simply observe exposures that people have already experienced, are common in environmental epidemiology because humans cannot ethically be exposed to agents that are known or suspected to cause disease. While the inability to use experimental study designs is a limitation of environmental epidemiology, this discipline directly observes effects on human health rather than estimating effects from animal studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n:*[[Toxicology]] studies how environmental exposures lead to specific health outcomes, generally in animals, as a means to understand possible health outcomes in humans. Toxicology has the advantage of being able to conduct randomized controlled trials and other experimental studies because they can use animal subjects. However there are many differences in animal and human biology, and there can be a lot of uncertainty when interpreting the results of [[animal studies]] for their implications for human health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n:*[[Exposure science]] studies human exposure to environmental contaminants by both identifying and quantifying exposures. Exposure science can be used to support environmental epidemiology by better describing environmental exposures that may lead to a particular health outcome, identify common exposures whose health outcomes may be better understood through a toxicology study, or can be used in a risk assessment to determine whether current levels of exposure might exceed recommended levels. Exposure science has the advantage of being able to very accurately quantify exposures to specific chemicals, but it does not generate any information about health outcomes like environmental epidemiology or toxicology.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n:*[[Environmental engineering]] applies scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and general improvement of environmental quality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n:*[[Environmental law]] includes the network of treaties, statutes, regulations, common and customary laws addressing the effects of human activity on the natural environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nInformation from epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science can be combined to conduct a [[risk assessment]] for specific chemicals, mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health (exposure would likely result in the development of [[List_of_pollution-related_diseases|pollution-related diseases]]).

O'Connell|O'Connell]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], [[George Smathers|Smathers]], and [[J. Wayne Reitz|Reitz]] in 1957.]]\n'''Florida Blue Key''' is a student leadership [[honor society]] at the [[University of Florida]] which was founded in 1923. \n\n==History==\n\n===Founding and early years===\n[[Image:Aamurphree.jpg|right|150px|thumb|President [[Albert Murphree]]]]\n\"Florida Blue Key was founded on November 1, 1923, several days prior to the University's Homecoming celebration.  At the suggestion of President Albert E. Murphree, Bert C. Riley, Dean of General Extension, brought together a group of student leaders to form an organization which would recognize leadership and promote service to the University.  Among the duties assigned to Florida Blue Key were playing host to campus visitors and to be at the call of the President of the University for any duty designated by him.\n\nIn this respect, Blue Key was given the task of planning and executing Homecoming activities that year and has continued to lead this activity ever since.  Also included in the 1923 Homecoming was Dad's Day, a time for parents to visit and acquaint themselves with campus life.  Dad's Day and Homecoming were held concurrently until the 1930s.\n\nThe organization quickly became so popular that Blue Key spread to colleges and universities across the country.\n\nInitially, membership in the organization was ''ex officio''; a student automatically belonged to the organization if he held one of the major student organization positions on campus.<ref name=\"auto\">Who's Who in Florida Blue Key; Volume XIII</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, the University of Florida was the state's only institution of higher learning where a white male could continue his education.<ref>Pursuant to the [[Buckman Act]], adopted by the Florida Legislature in 1905, the [[University of Florida]] was reserved for white male students, [[Florida State University|Florida State College for Women]] was reserved for white female students, and [[Florida A & M University|Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes]] was a coeducational institution for black students.</ref> During the same time, the leadership of the state was male, predominantly those from Florida. If one of those leaders were college educated, it was most likely he went to the University of Florida and, to a large measure, it was consistent that student leaders at the University of Florida would likely remain in Florida and would assume roles of leadership within the professional, political, governmental, business, education cultural, religious, and social life of the state. The networking of those students with each other, and with other alumni of the institution, provided a powerful force and unique opportunity for service to the University of Florida. While Florida Blue Key membership offered many opportunities for service to the University, it also provided opportunities for personal enhancement and advancement. Many doors were opened to young college graduates whose resume included membership in Florida Blue Key.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Separation with national chapters===\n\nThe concept of a group of student leaders pooling their talents and interests to plan and promote a major event for their campus was a popular idea.  Through Dean Riley's travels and professional contacts, similar organizations were developed on other campuses and it wasn't long before it seemed appropriate to organize into a national group.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the University of Florida chapter decided not to be part of the national organization between 1932 and 1935.  The Florida group thought the proposed Constitution of the national organization took too much control from the hands of the students; and it disagreed with some specific tenets of membership, including the requirement of a 2.5 grade point average.  The Florida group believed the organization was not an academic one but, rather, a leadership and service group; thus, if one was progressing satisfactorily toward a degree (i.e. 2.0), one should be eligible for membership. Since then, Florida Blue Key has changed its stance on the grade point average requirement, now requiring a 2.75 GPA in order to be tapped. The Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country. Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida. \n\nThe Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country.  Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida.  The dispute was a clear indication that FBK did not intend to serve as a passive honor for University of Florida students, but rather as an active force in shaping the events of the university and state.\n\nThe parting of the ways between the parent chapter and other chapters forming the national organization left deep wounds on many Florida students.  The perceptions of the conflict being a very important part of any subsequent discussions about the organization for years to come; including discussions of orientation of new members.  The active members at that time wanted nothing to do with the national organization once it was founded, and, further, wanted to be sure that their successors would not become involved in it.  Examples of such feelings are expressed in the last sentence of the Oath of Membership in Florida Blue Key and the Constitution.  Through the 1940s, the orientation of new members included hours on the discussion of this topic.\n\nToday, it is still part of the orientation, but only for the purposes of relating its historical significance and for emphasizing that Florida Blue Key is the name of the organization that it has no relationship to, and is not part of, The Blue Key National Honor Society.  A transfer student to the University of Florida often assumes his membership in a Blue Key National Honor Society chapter at another institution provides him with reciprocal membership in Florida Blue Key only to find out that is not the case.   To this day, Florida Blue Key controls the use of all trademark and intellectual property rights related to Blue Key.  Furthermore, Blue Key National Honor Society is prohibited from chartering or forming chapters at any institution within the State of Florida.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Grapski lawsuit===\n\nIn 1995, Florida Blue Key was sued by graduate student Charles Grapski, who claimed that some of the organization's members had [[defamation|defamed]] him during his candidacy for student body president. In his complaint, Grapski charged that several members of Florida Blue Key conspired to alter Grapski's criminal record, adding a false charge of child molestation, and circulate it on campus.  <ref>{{cite news|last1=Word|first1=Ron|title=Suit over fliers brings $6-million|url=https://apnews.com/5ea6b70315cdd87c4a4845fe7e4893d7|accessdate=3 April 2019|work=Associated Press News|date=April 16, 1998}}</ref> \n\nAccording to a 1997 lawsuit by Charles Grapski, Florida Blue Key maintains tight control over the Student Government and University of Florida. Florida Blue Key was found guilty of [[slander and libel|defamation of character]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy to defame]], and held liable for damages of $250,000. Grapski and FBK eventually settled for $85,000, and Florida Blue Key has since claimed no liability.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boedy|first1=Matthew|title=Suit over fliers brings $6-million|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/031500/State/Suit_over_fliers_brin.shtml|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=March 15, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Current responsibilities===\n[[Image:Miss UF.jpg|left|170px|thumb|[[Miss University of Florida]] in 1958]]\nThe organization continues to sponsor and organize the University of Florida's annual [[Homecoming]] celebration and Gator Growl.  These events are widely recognized as the largest Homecoming celebration in the country, which has grown to encompass dozens of events and community activities throughout the fall semester.\n\nOne of these events, [[Gator Growl]], is billed as the largest student-run [[pep rally]] in the world; an estimated 75,000 people have attended the event in past years. Gator Growl, nicknamed \"Growl\" by some students, usually features comedians such as [[Bill Cosby]], [[Frank Thornton]], and [[Dane Cook]] in addition to the school rallies, but occasionally a top-tier musical act headlines the show. The first Gator Growl occurred in 1932, and has been a tradition at the University of Florida for over 80 years.\n\nThe Blue Key Speech & Debate Tournament, sponsored by FBK since the early 1980s, is one of the largest and most prestigious [[high school]] speech & debate tournaments in the country.\n\nOther responsibilities include organizing UF's Legal Day, sponsoring the [[Miss University of Florida]] pageant, lobbying efforts on behalf of the university, and various community debates regarding issues concerning [[Florida]] and UF.\n\n==On-campus influence==\nFlorida Blue Key's control of politics has been compared to [[The Machine (social group)|The Machine]] at the [[University of Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Not so secret society: Raucous student election spotlights 'elite' Burning Spear group |url=https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/04/27/not-so-secret-society-raucous-student-election-spotlights-elite-burning-spear-group/543912002/}}</ref> For decades, members of Florida Blue Key have been the gatekeepers of student involvement on campus. \n\n==Famous alumni==\n[[Image:Bill Nelson.jpg|right|90px|thumb|[[Bill Nelson]]]]\n[[Image:Steve Spurrier 2006-09-02.jpg|right|90px|thumb|[[Steve Spurrier]]]]\nA short list of alumni include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
