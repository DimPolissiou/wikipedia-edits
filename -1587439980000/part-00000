After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.\n\nParton's music includes 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered ten [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life and career==\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee|Pittman Center]], a very small community in [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[East Tennessee]].{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Randy L.

Her father, known as \"Lee\", worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a [[sharecropper]] and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm's small income.

Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a [[Pentecostal]] preacher, so Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}\nWhile Dolly Parton was still very young, her family moved to a farm on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there, and it is the place about which she wrote the song \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home (song)|My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" in the 1970s.

She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby\", did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.\n\nAfter her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hello I'm Dolly \u2013 Dolly's first solo album 1967|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/hello-im-dolly-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n===1967\u20131975: Country music success===\n[[File:Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton in 1969]]\nIn 1967, musician and country music entertainer [[Porter Wagoner]] invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television program ''The Porter Wagoner Show'', and in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts \u2013 even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]\", which later became a standard \u2013 were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.\n\nBy 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]\". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits \u2013 including her signature song \"[[Coat of Many Colors]]\" (number four, 1971) \u2013 in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss\", (with Wagoner) \"[[Touch Your Woman]]\", (1972) \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).<ref name=\"DollyPartonEntertainment.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\".

(It eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated.

That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years. Parton had three solo singles reach number one on the country chart in 1974 (\"Jolene\", \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"[[Love Is Like a Butterfly (song)|Love Is Like a Butterfly]]\"), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, \"[[Please Don't Stop Loving Me]]\". In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"[[The Bargain Store]]\".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts \u2013 The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>\n\n===1976\u20131986: Pop transition===\n[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]\nFrom 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching number one.

In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" \u2013 and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering \u2013 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\n\nAfter ''New Harvest'''s disappointing crossover performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton and Burnett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With [[Carol Burnett]], 1980]]\nIn 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album.

During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher...

It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top-10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of \"I Will Always Love You,\" from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\", \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\", \"[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]\" (1984), \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), \"[[Don't Call It Love]]\" (1985) and \"[[Think About Love]]\" (1986) all reaching the country Top 10 (\"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"Think About Love\" reached number one; \"Real Love\" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit).

The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the top 10 on ''Billboard'''s Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]],'' (1987) including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]]\", Parton focused on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]]\".

Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart.

The songwriters (Ingram, [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and [[Clif Magness]]) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast.

After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.\n\nParton's music includes 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered ten [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life and career==\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee|Pittman Center]], a very small community in [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[East Tennessee]].{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Randy L.

Her father, known as \"Lee\", worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a [[sharecropper]] and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm's small income. Mr. Parton was illiterate but Dolly Parton often says despite that fact, he was one of the smartest people she's known in regards to business and making a profit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daddy's Dinner Bucket: Mr. Lee Parton|url=http://dollyparton.com/front-porch-stories/daddys-dinner-bucket-lee-parton/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref name=\"belfasttelegraphifightilliteracy\">{{cite news|title=Dolly Parton: 'I fight illiteracy for my father'|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/dolly-parton-i-fight-illiteracy-for-my-father-35185084.html|access-date=July 3, 2018|work=Belfast Telegraph|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> Avie Lee was homemaker for the large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a [[Pentecostal]] preacher, so Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly.

Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.\n\nAfter her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17.

As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts \u2013 even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]\", which later became a standard \u2013 were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored.

Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]\". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits \u2013 including her signature song \"[[Coat of Many Colors]]\" (number four, 1971) \u2013 in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss\", (with Wagoner) \"[[Touch Your Woman]]\", (1972) \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).<ref name=\"DollyPartonEntertainment.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\".

In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"[[The Bargain Store]]\".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts \u2013 The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>\n\n===1976\u20131986: Pop transition===\n[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]\nFrom 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching number one.

In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" \u2013 and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering \u2013 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\n\nAfter ''New Harvest'''s disappointing crossover performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously.

During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher...

In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].\nHer commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written \"[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]]\", \"[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name=\"allMusicGuide\"/> She had another Top 10 single that year with \"Making Plans\", a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], 1983]]\nThe theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], \"9 to 5\", not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one hit.

After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]],'' (1987) including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]]\", Parton focused on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]]\".

Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful.

The branches all travel downtown through the [[Tremont Street Subway]], the oldest subway tunnel in North America. The Tremont Street Subway opened its first section on September 1, 1897, to take streetcars off overcrowded downtown streets; it was extended five times <!-- 1898, 1912, 1914, 1932, 1941--> over the next five decades. The streetcar system peaked in size around 1930 and was gradually replaced with [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston|trackless trolleys]] and [[MBTA Bus|buses]], with cuts as late as 1985.

From south to north, they are as follows:\n\nThe \"D\" Branch surfaces onto the grade-separated [[Highland Branch]], a branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] until 1958. It runs about {{convert|10.5|mi}} through [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] to [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside Terminal]], the primary light rail maintenance facility and major park and ride facility, on the banks of the Charles River and {{convert|0.5|mi}} from the interchange of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] (I-90) and the western segment of the [[Massachusetts Route 128|Yankee Division Highway]] (I-95, originally designated as Route 128).\n\nThe \"C\" Branch surfaces onto [[Beacon Street (Boston)|Beacon Street]], running to its terminus at [[Cleveland Circle (MBTA station)|Cleveland Circle]] in Brookline, a short walk from the \"D\" Branch [[Reservoir (MBTA station)| Reservoir]] stop at the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]].\n\nThe \"B\" Branch surfaces onto [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], and runs the length of the [[Boston University]] campus. It then passes within {{convert|0.25|mi}} of Cleveland Circle (connected by non-revenue trackage on Chestnut Hill Avenue), and continues on to [[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|\"A\" Branch]] diverged from Commonwealth Avenue west of Boston University and ran to a terminus in [[Watertown Square (MBTA station)|Watertown]], across the Charles River from Watertown Square, until 1969. Although the route-letter scheme had been introduced two years prior to its closure, the \"A\" designation was never signed on streetcars to [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]]. It was, however, included in the [[destination sign]]s on the [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle|Boeing-Vertol LRV]]s ordered in the mid-1970s, when reopening service to Watertown was under consideration. The \"A\" line tracks remained in non-revenue service to access maintenance facilities at Watertown until 1994.\n\nThe [[Lechmere Viaduct]] originally connected to the Central Subway via the [[Causeway Street Elevated]], a {{convert|0.5|mi|adj=on}} structure running in front of [[North Station]] and the old [[Boston Garden]] sports complex. A new tunnel, running underneath Causeway Street to North Station and the new TD Garden (which replaced the Boston Garden) and connecting to a new underground Green Line and Orange Line transfer station, was built to replace it. \n\nThe original Tremont Street Subway tunnel south of [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]] station has been closed since 1962, when the last streetcar line feeding into it was [[43 (MBTA bus)|replaced by bus service]], and [[Pleasant Street Portal]] at its southern end has been covered over. Reuse of part of the tunnel for the [[Silver Line (MBTA)#Phase III|Silver Line Phase III]] was briefly considered, but the narrow bore was found too small for the Silver Line buses which (unlike trolleys) are not fixed to their guideway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/12/26/tour_of_abandoned_subway__network__offers_a_glimpse_of_how_the_t_was_built |title=Transit archeology: Tour of abandoned subway network offers a glimpse of how the T was built |author=Bierman, Noah |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=December 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> Plans for the Phase III tunnel were shifted further west to new alignments, then canceled due to questions over the project's cost-effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Environment/2010%20Annual%20Report.pdf |title=Annual Status Report |date=July 9, 2010 |author=Mohler, David J. |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Branches===\n[[File:MBTA Green Line.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.0|Schematic map of Green Line branches and stations]]\n[[File:Back of the Hill MBTA station, Boston MA.jpg|thumb|right|A train running in mixed traffic on the outer \"E\" Branch]]\n<!--{{MBTA Green Line full}}-->\n[[File:Type 8 under Longwood Avenue bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The \"D\" Branch is fully grade-separated]]\nThe branches were assigned letters in 1967, two years after the green color was assigned to the line on August 26, 1965. The letters were assigned to the five remaining branches, sequentially from north to south. \n\nNo branches had used the [[Canal Street Portal]] except as a terminal since 1949 with the {{MBTABus|93}} or the [[Pleasant Street Portal]] since 1961 with the {{MBTABus|43}}, and a shuttle until 1962. All Green Line trains stop at Park Street, Boylston, Arlington, and Copley. All trains except \"E\" also stop at Hynes Convention Center and Kenmore. Only \"E\" trains stop at Prudential and Symphony.\n\nAll trains except \"B\" stop at Government Center. On the eastern end, only \"C\" and \"E\" trains go past Government Center to Haymarket and North Station; the only train that services Science Park and Lechmere is the \"E\" Branch (although the \"D\" Branch will service these stations once the Medford extension is built). \n\nThe [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|\"B\", \"Boston College\" or \"Commonwealth Avenue\" Branch]] is the northernmost of the three lines that split west of Kenmore. It travels west in a reserved median of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], ending at [[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]]. {{As of|2019}}, regular \"B\" service turns around at [[Park Street station (MBTA)|Park Street]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|\"C\", \"Cleveland Circle\" or \"Beacon Street\" Branch]] is the middle one of the three branches heading west from Kenmore, and the straightest, running in a reserved median of [[Beacon Street (Boston)|Beacon Street]] through [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to [[Cleveland Circle (MBTA station)|Cleveland Circle]]. {{As of|2019}}, regular \"C\" service turns around at [[North Station]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|\"D,\" \"Riverside\" or \"Highland\" Branch]] is the southernmost of the three lines that separate west of Kenmore.  It is the longest branch, ending in [[Newton, MA|Newton]] at [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside]]. It is the most recent branch, opening in 1959 along the former right-of-way of the former Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]], and has an exclusive above-ground right-of-way, entering the Central Subway at the Fenway Portal. {{As of|2019}}, regular \"D\" service turns around at [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Government Center]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|\"E\" or \"Heath Street\" (formerly \"Arborway\") Branch]] diverges from the other three lines just west of Copley. It travels mainly on the surface along [[Huntington Avenue (Boston)|Huntington Avenue]], emerging from the Huntington Avenue Subway at the Northeastern Portal. The segment from the portal to [[Brigham Circle (MBTA station)|Brigham Circle]] runs in a reserved median, transitioning at that stop to [[street-running]] to its terminus at [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]]. Since 1985, service beyond Heath Street to [[Arborway (MBTA station)|Arborway]] is provided by the {{MBTABus|39}} bus. Regular \"E\" service extends to the terminus at [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]]. \n\n====Former branches====\n{{mainlist|Boston-area streetcar lines}}<!--A more complete list of services running into the subway is in the green rows on [[Boston-area streetcar lines]].-->\nThe [[Green Line \"A\" Branch]] was the northernmost of the branches, running from the [[Blandford Street (MBTA station)#History|Blandford Street Portal]] (still used by the \"B\" Branch), west to [[Watertown Square (MBTA station)|Watertown]], mostly [[street-running]]. The {{MBTABus|57}} bus replaced the streetcar line in 1969.\n\nThe [[Pleasant Street Portal]] hosted two services in its final days. The {{MBTABus|9}} to [[City Point (MBTA station)|City Point]] ended in 1953, and the {{MBTABus|43}} to [[Egleston (MBTA station)|Egleston]] was cut back to [[Lenox Street (MBTA station)|Lenox Street]] in 1956, cut back to the portal in 1961, and ended operation in 1962. Prior to that, the {{MBTABus|48}} ran out Tremont Street to Dover Street and [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]], ending at [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]], and last running in 1938.\n\nThe last two routes to continue beyond the [[Canal Street Portal]] both ran to [[Sullivan Square (MBTA station)|Sullivan]]. The {{MBTABus|92}} ran via Main Street, last running in 1948, and the {{MBTABus|93}} via [[Bunker Hill Street (Boston)|Bunker Hill Street]] last ran in 1949. Until 1997 trains continued to use the portal and its [[North Station]] surface station as a terminal.\n\nIn addition to the lines that later became the \"E\" Branch, the predecessors to the {{MBTABus|58}} and {{MBTABus|60}} split in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], one branch running into the current \"E\" tracks and into the [[Boylston Street Portal]], and the other running up [[Brookline Street (Boston)|Brookline Street]] to end at [[Hynes Convention Center (MBTA station)|Massachusetts Avenue]] station. These were truncated in 1932 into a shorter route from [[Brookline Village (MBTA station)|Brookline Village]] to the subway via the Boylston Street Portal, which itself stopped running in 1938 (being cut back to [[Brigham Circle (MBTA station)|Brigham Circle]] short-turn trips), three years before the closure of that portal.\n\nThe last \"foreign\" cars to operate in the subway were those of the [[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]], running from the [[Canal Street Portal]] to the [[Brattle Loop]] at [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Scollay Square]] until 1935. It was then that the old [[Mystic River Bridge]] to [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]] was closed to streetcars and the lines were replaced by bus service; the next year the BERy bought the Eastern Mass Chelsea Division and through-routed it with its lines connecting to the [[East Boston Tunnel]] at [[Maverick (MBTA station)|Maverick]].\n\nFrom the [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] terminal opening on July 10, 1922 to February 6, 1931, special service ran from Lechmere to various points on the subway. These trips were replaced on February 7, 1931 by extensions of the various branches from the west, which had terminated at Park Street, through to Lechmere.\n\n===Portals===\nCars entered the subway from the surface at a number of portals or inclines, listed here from north to south/east to west.\n\n====Lechmere====\n[[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] is the north end of the Green Line. From the opening of the [[Lechmere Viaduct]] leading to it in 1912 until 1922, streetcar lines simply fed onto the viaduct from Cambridge Street and Bridge Street (now [[Massachusetts Route 28|Monsignor O'Brien Highway]]). In 1922 a [[prepayment station]] was opened, with a new loop for subway trains to turn around and a separate loop for surface cars, and no intermingling between the two. The surface lines have since been replaced with [[bus]]es, but the Green Line still turns around at Lechmere.\n\n====Canal Street====\n[[File:Canal Street Incline north 1901.jpg|thumb|right|Canal Street Portal in 1901]]\nThe [[Canal Street Portal]] (also Haymarket Portal, North Station Portal or Causeway Street Portal, often referred to in revenue service as the Canal Street Loop) was part of the transition between subway and [[elevated railway]] on the Green Line, as it transitioned from the [[Tremont Street Subway]] to the [[Causeway Street Elevated]] towards the [[Lechmere Viaduct]] until 2004, when the Green Line north of [[North Station]] was closed for building of a new tunnel and portal. Certain trains turned at Canal Street, while others emerged from the subway to a viaduct to Lechmere. It was, however, possible for a passenger to alight from a train at Canal Street and proceed up a series of stairways to the Lechmere Viaduct. However, most passengers desiring to continue to Science Park or Lechmere would have changed to a Lechmere signed car from a North Station signed car prior to the emergence from the central subway.\n\n[[Image:Pleasant Street Incline junction.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flying junction]] on the [[Tremont Street Subway]] approaching the [[Pleasant Street Incline]]]]\n\nThe original four-track portal opened in 1898 at the north end of the first subway; cars could turn east or west on Causeway Street. In 1901 the [[Charlestown Elevated]] was connected to the outer tracks, and streetcars only operated via the inner tracks. The [[Washington Street Tunnel (Boston)|Washington Street Tunnel]] opened in 1908, connecting to the Elevated via a new portal just east of the streetcar one, and all four tracks were once again open for streetcar use until 1975. In 1912 the Lechmere Viaduct opened, again using the two outer tracks for an elevated line. The inner tracks continued to serve the surface, including a surface station at [[North Station]], until 1997, when they were closed for construction of the new tunnel and the Green Line was shifted to the old Orange Line (Charlestown Elevated) portal along the way. The {{MBTABus|93}} was the last service to continue onto surface streets from the portal, last running in 1949.\n\n====Pleasant Street====\nThe [[Pleasant Street Portal]] was the south end of the [[Tremont Street Subway]], opened one month after the original subway in 1897. It split from the Boylston Street Subway at a [[flying junction]] at [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]], and another flying junction split the tunnel into two side-by-side tunnels to the four-track portal. The two west tracks rose onto [[Tremont Street]] and the two east ones onto [[Pleasant Street (Boston)|Pleasant Street]], later part of Broadway. From 1901 to 1908 the portal was only used by [[Washington Street Elevated]] trains, after which streetcar service was restored\u2014though much of it had been cut back to [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]] for transfer to the Elevated. Until 1953 service ran to City Point at eastern end of [[South Boston]] as part of {{MBTABus|9}}. The last cars ran through the portal in 1961 as part of the {{MBTABus|43}}, and in 1962 a shuttle service from Boylston to the portal was ended. The portal has since been covered, but someday may become part of a new streetcar line that would partly replace access to rapid transit for southern Metro Boston neighborhoods, that had been severed from MBTA rapid transit service in 1987 with the demolishing of the [[Washington Street Elevated]] original southern section of the Orange Line. This proposed new streetcar service could go as far south as the Red Line's [[Mattapan station]], with a northern turnaround terminus at [[Government Center station (MBTA)|Government Center]], according to a 2012-dated proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Portals/17/docs/RDM/RDMReport_0912.pdf|title=Roxbury-Dorchester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study|date=September 2012|page=53 |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Public Garden and Boylston Street====\n[[File:Public Gardens portal.png|thumb|right|Streetcars using the Public Garden Portal in 1898]]\nThe first portal to open, on September 1, 1897, was the Public Garden Portal, providing an outlet for the subway on the north side of [[Boylston Street (Boston)|Boylston Street]] in the [[Public Garden (Boston, Massachusetts)|Public Garden]]. When the Boylston Street Subway opened in 1914, extending the subway west, the incline and portal were relocated to the center of Boylston Street as the Boylston Street Portal. The last cars to use the portal ran in 1941 from [[Huntington Avenue (Boston)|Huntington Avenue]], when the [[Huntington Avenue Subway]] opened as a branch off the main subway and the portal was closed.\n\n==== Northeastern ====\nThe Northeastern Portal lies in the [[median (highway)|median]] of [[Huntington Avenue (Boston)|Huntington Avenue]] at the end of the Huntington Avenue Subway, just east of [[Northeastern University (MBTA station)|Northeastern University]]. It opened in 1941 and carries [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|\"E\" Branch]] trains.\n\nThe incline was built as a wooden trestle to the street atop a level grade, as the original plans called for eventual extension of the subway; in the mid 1980s the trestle was replaced with fill (which greatly quieted the sound).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==== Kenmore ====\n[[File:Top of former Kenmore portal, September 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Top of the filled-in Kenmore Portal]]\nThe Kenmore Portal or Kenmore Square Portal opened in 1914 with the extension of the Boylston Street Subway westward to the east side of [[Kenmore Square (Boston)|Kenmore Square]], in the [[median (highway)|median]] of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]]. It closed in 1932 when the subway station at [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] was built and two new portals were opened to the west.\n\n==== Blandford Street, St. Marys Street, and Fenway ====\nThe Blandford Street Portal and St. Marys Street Portal, in the [[median (highway)|median]]s of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]] and [[Beacon Street (Boston)|Beacon Street]] respectively, opened in 1932 as part of the extension of the Boylston Street Subway under [[Kenmore Square (Boston)|Kenmore Square]] and the opening of the new [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] station. They are currently used by the [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|\"B\"]] and [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|\"C\"]] Branches respectively. The Fenway Portal opened in 1959 along with the opening of the [[Highland Branch]], and provides a third exit from Kenmore, south of the St. Marys Street Portal. It carries trains of the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|\"D\" Branch]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== Rolling stock ==\nLike the three other MBTA subway lines, the line uses [[standard gauge]] tracks. However, instead of heavy rail metro rolling stock, the Green Line uses modern streetcars (light rail vehicles) as heavy rail stock would be inappropriate for the surface branches with their numerous grade crossings.\n\n===Listing===\n\n====Active fleet====\nRolling stock {{as of|March 2020|lc=yes}}:<ref name=bluebook>{{MBTA Bluebook 2014}}</ref><ref name=roster /><ref name=overhaul>{{cite web |title=Green Line Fleet (Type 7) Overhaul \u2013 Project Update and Final Engineering Services |url=https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/fmcb-meeting-docs/2018/december/2018-12-10-fmcb-green-line-fleet-type7-overhaul-original.pdf |website=MBTA.com |accessdate=15 December 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215231619/https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/fmcb-meeting-docs/2018/december/2018-12-10-fmcb-green-line-fleet-type7-overhaul-original.pdf |date=December 10, 2018 |archivedate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year Built\n!Manufacturer\n!Model\n!Image\n!Length\n!Width\n!Fleet Numbers\n!Quantity\n|-\n| 1986\u20131988\n| rowspan=2 | [[Kinki Sharyo]]\n| rowspan=2 | Type 7 LRV\n| [[File:Causeway Elevated and Boston Garden.jpg|100px]]\n| rowspan=2 | {{convert|72|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=2 | {{convert|104|in|m|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}\n| 3600\u20133699\n| 100 (83 active) All overhauled\n*14 other non-overhauled cars have been scrapped. 3 overhauled cars out of service awaiting parts\n|-\n| 1997\n| [[File:MBTA 3715 at Park Street, August 2001.jpg|100px]]\n| 3700\u20133719\n| 20 (17 active, all overhauled)\n*3 other non-overhauled cars have been scrapped from an auction\n|-\n| 1998\u20132007\n| [[AnsaldoBreda]]\n| [[MBTA AnsaldoBreda Type_8|Type 8 LRV]]\n| [[File:MBTA Green Line B.jpg|100px]]\n| {{convert|74|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|104|in|m|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}\n| 3800\u20133894\n| 94 (85 active)\n|-\n|2018-2019\n|[[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF USA]] \n|Type 9 LRV\n| [[File:Type 9 on first day of revenue service, December 2018.jpg|100px]]\n| {{convert|74|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|104|in|m|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}\n| 3900\u20133923\n| 24 (13 active.

The Green Line originated as a [[tram|streetcar line]], and used a variety of streetcars before converting to light rail vehicles.\n\nOriginally all the Green Line stations had platforms at track level, and passengers had to ascend several steps up into the vehicles. This limited accessibility for persons with disabilities. To address this issue and comply with changing federal and state laws, additional facilities have been added:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/t_projects/projects_accessibility/|title=MBTA > About the MBTA > Transit Projects > Transit Projects and Accessibility<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=October 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122447/http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/t_projects/projects_accessibility/|archive-date=January 18, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n* Wheelchair lifts have been provided at some stops. They are rolled up to the car door and the lift mechanism is operated using a hand crank. They are quite time-consuming to operate, causing significant delays when used during peak periods.\n* Short platforms level with car floors, accessed by ramps, were installed just before or after selected stations. Because the car door arrangement required a large gap between the platform and the car, a bridge plate attached to the raised platform had to be positioned after the train stopped with a door at that platform.\n* The MBTA has followed the worldwide trend of operating [[low-floor tram|low-floor streetcars]]. As an ongoing project, not complete in 2012, platforms are being raised slightly to about the height of a street curb. Low-floor cars have remotely controlled bridge plates at the center doors to allow wheelchairs and strollers to reach the car floor a few inches higher.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the MBTA|Boston-area streetcar lines}}\n\nBeginning in the 1850s, Boston sprouted a large network of [[horsecar]] lines, the first public transit in the city. The [[West End Street Railway]] was created by the state legislature in 1887 to build a single line, but soon consolidated many of the existing lines into a single privately owned system with consistent fares and route designations. The Allston \u2013 Park Square line (which served the general area of the [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|\"A\" Branch]]) was the first section to be converted to [[electric traction]] in 1889. It used modified existing horsecars outfitted with [[Frank J. Sprague]]'s revolutionary electrical equipment, which had first been demonstrated the previous year in [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name=Cudahy>{{cite book|last1=Cudahy|first1=Brian J.|title=Change at Park Street Under; the story of Boston's subways|date=1972|publisher=S.

The [[Tremont Street Subway]], the first passenger subway in North America, was opened in stages in 1897 and 1898, with underground stations at [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]], Park Street, [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Scollay Square]], [[Adams Square (BERy station)|Adams Square]], and [[Haymarket (MBTA station)|Haymarket]]. The [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Main Line Elevated]] was run through the tunnel from 1901, displacing through-running streetcars,<ref name=\"Cudahy\"/>{{rp|19\u201321}} until it was rerouted to its own [[Washington Street Tunnel (Boston)|Washington Street Tunnel]] in 1908, and the streetcars were returned to the Tremont tunnel.<ref name=\"Cudahy\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThough initially intended merely to clear streetcars from the busiest sections of downtown streets, the Tremont Street Subway became useful as a rapid transit service in its own right. The 1912 completion of the [[Causeway Street Elevated]] and [[Lechmere Viaduct]] extended grade-separated service to [[Lechmere Square]] in Cambridge, and in 1922 the [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere transfer station]] was built.  In 1914, the [[Boylston Street Subway]] opened as a westward extension to just short of [[Kenmore Square]], and in 1933 [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore station]] and short tunnel extensions towards two surface lines were added. In 1941, the [[Huntington Avenue Subway]] and its two additional underground stations removed the last surface streetcars from downtown Boston.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, the [[Boston-area streetcar lines|massive surface streetcar system]] was \"[[bustitution|bustituted]]\" with buses and [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston|trackless trolleys]] which had lower operating costs and more flexible routes. As the 1950s closed out, the only remaining streetcar lines were the [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|Watertown Line]], [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|Commonwealth Avenue Line]], [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|Beacon Street Line]], [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|Arborway Line]], and the [[43 (MBTA bus)|Lenox Street Line]] plus several [[short turn]] services. In 1959, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]]'s Highland Branch was converted to the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|Riverside Line]], a fully grade-separated suburban service.  In 1961, the last through service to Lenox Street via the [[Pleasant Street Portal]] ended, though a Pleasant Street \u2013 Boylston shuttle continued for one more year. In 1963, part of the original subway was rebuilt under [[Government Center (Boston)|Government Center]], abandoning and partially demolishing Adams Square station.\n\nIn 1947, the now-bankrupt BERy was replaced by the public [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (Boston)|Metropolitan Transit Authority]] (M.T.A.). The new agency was unpopular, even spawning [[M.T.A. (song)|a popular protest song]]; in 1964, it was replaced with the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] which had an expanded funding area to preserve suburban commuter rail lines. In 1967, as part of a systemwide rebranding that included new station names and color names for the transit lines, the remaining streetcar services were designated the \"Green Line\" because several of them traveled near the [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. The streetcar lines were given letter designations: \"A\" to the Watertown Line, \"B\" to the Commonwealth Avenue Line, \"C\" to the Beacon Street Line, \"D\" to the Riverside Line, and \"E\" to the Arborway Line.\n\nThe Watertown Line ran mostly in [[street running|mixed traffic]] after diverging from Commonwealth Avenue; it was permanently replaced with buses in 1969. The section of the Arborway Line past [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]] was \"temporarily\" \u2013 ultimately permanently \u2013 bustituted in 1985. In 2001, with new low-floor streetcars entering service, the MBTA began retrofitting underground stations and major surface stops with low raised platforms for handicapped accessibility. In 2004, the Causeway Street Elevated was replaced with a new tunnel under the [[Boston Garden]], which consolidated the Orange Line and Green Line at a new [[North Station (MBTA station)|North Station]] \"superstation\", while continuing to connect to Commuter Rail service north of Boston.\n\nThe name \"Green Line\" was assigned in 1967 as part of a major reorganization of the MBTA system's branding.<ref name=netransit /> In the 1970s, the Green Line and all other MBTA lines were re-evaluated by the [[BTPR|Boston Transportation Planning Review]] for region-wide efficacy and future modernization alternatives initiated as far as physical plant and operating measures.\n\n==Operations and signalling==\n[[File:Newton Highlands outbound.jpg|thumb|right|Trains on the \"D\" Branch operate using wayside signals.]]\nUnlike the MBTA heavy rail subway lines, the Green Line has only limited central control and monitoring. This also means that it has lagged behind the other three rail lines in the availability of countdown signs and \"next train\" arrival information.\n\nThe line is signalled with advisory [[Railway signalling|wayside signals]], except on surface portions in street medians or [[street-running|in-street running]]. Wayside signal territory stretches from Lechmere to the surface portals at Kenmore, and along the entire length of the D\u2013Riverside branch. There are no [[Train protection system|automatic protection devices]], but the cars have [[Electromagnetic track brake|track brakes]], giving the ability to stop quickly under control of the operator. Interlockings are controlled through a wayside Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) system that relies on the operator properly entering the destination manually on a roto-wheel in the train cab at the beginning of a run.\n\nThe line is monitored from the [[Operations control center|Operations Control Center]] (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service is shared by the control room and field personnel along the right of way. Track circuit and signal indications are not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed in the control room to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines.<ref name=trackingstory /> The first real-time data\u2014location data on the surface lines\u2014became available in October 2014. Full tracking was expected by early 2015.<ref name=aboveground />\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the MBTA typically runs two-car trains on weekdays, with one-car trains used at some times on weekends. The last scheduled use of one-car trains on weekdays was in March 2007.<ref name=netransit />\nThree-car trains were added on the B and D branches in 2010 - their first use since 2005 - and a four-car train was tested in April 2011.<ref name=netransit /> In March 2011, the number of three-car trains was substantially increased, including use on the E Branch.<ref name=netransit /><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.mbta.com/news/2011-03-16/green-line-nearly-triple-the-number-3-car-trains |title=Green Line to nearly triple the number of 3-car trains |date=March 16, 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}</ref> However, three-car trains suffered from reliability problems and slow boarding.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2016/05/03/mbta-green-line-crowded|title=Why is the Green Line so crowded? |date=May 3, 2016 |newspaper=Boston Globe |first=Adam |last=Vaccaro}}</ref> The use of three-car trains ended in March 2016.<ref name=netransit />\n\n===Turnarounds===\n[[File:Kenmore loop track from outbound platform, January 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Loop track (left) at Kenmore station]]\n[[File:Scollay Square plan.png|thumb|right|The old Scollay Square Station's Brattle Loop (at bottom), still part of the Government Center station infrastructure.]]\nTrains can reverse direction at a number of stations where a [[balloon loop|turnaround loop]] is installed.  In addition, there are a number of [[Crossover (rail)|crossover switches]] where a train can cross to the opposite track and reverse its direction. Listed below are locations where cars routinely reverse direction or at least can reverse direction without the need for flagpersons to supervise the movement.\n\n* [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] is currently the northern terminus of the Green Line, and consists of a balloon-shaped turnaround, actually two concentric turning loops allowing complex staging of cars and trains.\n* At [[North Station]], trains heading westbound/outbound toward [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] can reverse direction using stub tracks just north of the station. No turnaround is available in the eastbound/inbound direction.\n* At [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Government Center]], Green Line trains entering from either the north or the west can turn around, using the [[Government Center station (MBTA)#Scollay Square|Brattle Loop]]. Trains from the north reversing direction must switch onto the Brattle Loop track prior to entering the station.\n* At Park Street, trains can turn around from one direction only. Trains headed toward [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] may instead enter Park Street on the inside track, often referred to as the \"fence rail\", and turn around on a tight loop after discharging passengers. {{As of|2015}}, the inside loading platform usually served trains bound for [[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]] ([[Green Line \"B\" Branch|\"B\"]]) and [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside]] ([[Green Line \"D\" Branch|\"D\"]]).\n* [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] is where inbound trains coming from the Cleveland Circle (\"C\") or the Riverside (\"D\") Branches can turn around to the corresponding outbound track. No turnaround is available for the Boston College/Commonwealth Avenue \"B\" Branch heading inbound. Outbound, trains can reverse direction using a storage track between the two service tracks just past Kenmore (on Commonwealth Ave. at Blandford St.) and return to the subway.\n\nPlans to reinstitute a crossover for through movements from the terminating (inner) northbound platform at Park Street to continue onwards towards Government Center are expected to increase capacity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web|title=MBTA Capital Investment Program FY15-FY19|url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Financials/FINAL%20FY15-19%20MBTA%20Capital%20Investment%20Program.pdf|publisher=MBTA|accessdate=April 23, 2015|page=124|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plans==\n\n===Somerville/Medford extension (Green Line Extension Project)===\n{{main|Green Line Extension}}\n[[File:Green Line Extension.svg|thumb|left|350px|Map of the Green Line Extension.

From south to north, they are as follows:\n\nThe \"D\" Branch surfaces onto the grade-separated [[Highland Branch]], a branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] until 1958. It runs about {{convert|10.5|mi}} through [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] to [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside Terminal]], the primary light rail maintenance facility and major park and ride facility, on the banks of the Charles River and {{convert|0.5|mi}} from the interchange of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] (I-90) and the western segment of the [[Massachusetts Route 128|Yankee Division Highway]] (I-95, originally designated as Route 128).\n\nThe \"C\" Branch surfaces onto [[Beacon Street (Boston)|Beacon Street]], running to its terminus at [[Cleveland Circle (MBTA station)|Cleveland Circle]] in Brookline, a short walk from the \"D\" Branch [[Reservoir (MBTA station)| Reservoir]] stop at the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]].\n\nThe \"B\" Branch surfaces onto [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], and runs the length of the [[Boston University]] campus. It then passes within {{convert|0.25|mi}} of Cleveland Circle (connected by non-revenue trackage on Chestnut Hill Avenue), and continues on to [[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|\"A\" Branch]] diverged from Commonwealth Avenue west of Boston University and ran to a terminus in [[Watertown Square (MBTA station)|Watertown]], across the Charles River from Watertown Square, until 1969. Although the route-letter scheme had been introduced two years prior to its closure, the \"A\" designation was never signed on streetcars to [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]]. It was, however, included in the [[destination sign]]s on the [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle|Boeing-Vertol LRV]]s ordered in the mid-1970s, when reopening service to Watertown was under consideration. The \"A\" line tracks remained in non-revenue service to access maintenance facilities at Watertown until 1994.\n\nThe [[Lechmere Viaduct]] originally connected to the Central Subway via the [[Causeway Street Elevated]], a {{convert|0.5|mi|adj=on}} structure running in front of [[North Station]] and the old [[Boston Garden]] sports complex. A new tunnel, running underneath Causeway Street to North Station and the new TD Garden (which replaced the Boston Garden) and connecting to a new underground Green Line and Orange Line transfer station, was built to replace it. \n\nThe original Tremont Street Subway tunnel south of [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]] station has been closed since 1962, when the last streetcar line feeding into it was [[43 (MBTA bus)|replaced by bus service]], and [[Pleasant Street Portal]] at its southern end has been covered over. Reuse of part of the tunnel for the [[Silver Line (MBTA)#Phase III|Silver Line Phase III]] was briefly considered, but the narrow bore was found too small for the Silver Line buses which (unlike trolleys) are not fixed to their guideway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/12/26/tour_of_abandoned_subway__network__offers_a_glimpse_of_how_the_t_was_built |title=Transit archeology: Tour of abandoned subway network offers a glimpse of how the T was built |author=Bierman, Noah |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=December 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> Plans for the Phase III tunnel were shifted further west to new alignments, then canceled due to questions over the project's cost-effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Environment/2010%20Annual%20Report.pdf |title=Annual Status Report |date=July 9, 2010 |author=Mohler, David J. |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Branches===\n[[File:MBTA Green Line.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.0|Schematic map of Green Line branches and stations]]\n[[File:Back of the Hill MBTA station, Boston MA.jpg|thumb|right|A train running in mixed traffic on the outer \"E\" Branch]]\n<!--{{MBTA Green Line full}}-->\n[[File:Type 8 under Longwood Avenue bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The \"D\" Branch is fully grade-separated]]\nThe branches were assigned letters in 1967, two years after the green color was assigned to the line on August 26, 1965. The letters were assigned to the five remaining branches, sequentially from north to south. \n\nNo branches had used the [[Canal Street Portal]] except as a terminal since 1949 with the {{MBTABus|93}} or the [[Pleasant Street Portal]] since 1961 with the {{MBTABus|43}}, and a shuttle until 1962. All Green Line trains stop at Park Street, Boylston, Arlington, and Copley. All trains except \"E\" also stop at Hynes Convention Center and Kenmore. Only \"E\" trains stop at Prudential and Symphony.\n\nAll trains except \"B\" stop at Government Center. On the eastern end, only \"C\" and \"E\" trains go past Government Center to Haymarket and North Station; the only train that services Science Park and Lechmere is the \"E\" Branch (although the \"D\" Branch will service these stations once the Medford extension is built). \n\nThe [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|\"B\", \"Boston College\" or \"Commonwealth Avenue\" Branch]] is the northernmost of the three lines that split west of Kenmore. It travels west in a reserved median of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], ending at [[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]]. {{As of|2019}}, regular \"B\" service turns around at [[Park Street station (MBTA)|Park Street]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|\"C\", \"Cleveland Circle\" or \"Beacon Street\" Branch]] is the middle one of the three branches heading west from Kenmore, and the straightest, running in a reserved median of [[Beacon Street (Boston)|Beacon Street]] through [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to [[Cleveland Circle (MBTA station)|Cleveland Circle]]. {{As of|2019}}, regular \"C\" service turns around at [[North Station]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|\"D,\" \"Riverside\" or \"Highland\" Branch]] is the southernmost of the three lines that separate west of Kenmore.  It is the longest branch, ending in [[Newton, MA|Newton]] at [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside]]. It is the most recent branch, opening in 1959 along the former right-of-way of the former Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]], and has an exclusive above-ground right-of-way, entering the Central Subway at the Fenway Portal. {{As of|2019}}, regular \"D\" service turns around at [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Government Center]].\n\nThe [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|\"E\" or \"Heath Street\" (formerly \"Arborway\") Branch]] diverges from the other three lines just west of Copley. It travels mainly on the surface along [[Huntington Avenue (Boston)|Huntington Avenue]], emerging from the Huntington Avenue Subway at the Northeastern Portal. The segment from the portal to [[Brigham Circle (MBTA station)|Brigham Circle]] runs in a reserved median, transitioning at that stop to [[street-running]] to its terminus at [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]]. Since 1985, service beyond Heath Street to [[Arborway (MBTA station)|Arborway]] is provided by the {{MBTABus|39}} bus. Regular \"E\" service extends to the terminus at [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]]. \n\n====Former branches====\n{{mainlist|Boston-area streetcar lines}}<!--A more complete list of services running into the subway is in the green rows on [[Boston-area streetcar lines]].-->\nThe [[Green Line \"A\" Branch]] was the northernmost of the branches, running from the [[Blandford Street (MBTA station)#History|Blandford Street Portal]] (still used by the \"B\" Branch), west to [[Watertown Square (MBTA station)|Watertown]], mostly [[street-running]]. The {{MBTABus|57}} bus replaced the streetcar line in 1969.\n\nThe [[Pleasant Street Portal]] hosted two services in its final days. The {{MBTABus|9}} to [[City Point (MBTA station)|City Point]] ended in 1953, and the {{MBTABus|43}} to [[Egleston (MBTA station)|Egleston]] was cut back to [[Lenox Street (MBTA station)|Lenox Street]] in 1956, cut back to the portal in 1961, and ended operation in 1962. Prior to that, the {{MBTABus|48}} ran out Tremont Street to Dover Street and [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]], ending at [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]], and last running in 1938.\n\nThe last two routes to continue beyond the [[Canal Street Portal]] both ran to [[Sullivan Square (MBTA station)|Sullivan]]. The {{MBTABus|92}} ran via Main Street, last running in 1948, and the {{MBTABus|93}} via [[Bunker Hill Street (Boston)|Bunker Hill Street]] last ran in 1949. Until 1997 trains continued to use the portal and its [[North Station]] surface station as a terminal.\n\nIn addition to the lines that later became the \"E\" Branch, the predecessors to the {{MBTABus|58}} and {{MBTABus|60}} split in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], one branch running into the current \"E\" tracks and into the [[Boylston Street Portal]], and the other running up [[Brookline Street (Boston)|Brookline Street]] to end at [[Hynes Convention Center (MBTA station)|Massachusetts Avenue]] station. These were truncated in 1932 into a shorter route from [[Brookline Village (MBTA station)|Brookline Village]] to the subway via the Boylston Street Portal, which itself stopped running in 1938 (being cut back to [[Brigham Circle (MBTA station)|Brigham Circle]] short-turn trips), three years before the closure of that portal.\n\nThe last \"foreign\" cars to operate in the subway were those of the [[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]], running from the [[Canal Street Portal]] to the [[Brattle Loop]] at [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Scollay Square]] until 1935. It was then that the old [[Mystic River Bridge]] to [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]] was closed to streetcars and the lines were replaced by bus service; the next year the BERy bought the Eastern Mass Chelsea Division and through-routed it with its lines connecting to the [[East Boston Tunnel]] at [[Maverick (MBTA station)|Maverick]].\n\nFrom the [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] terminal opening on July 10, 1922 to February 6, 1931, special service ran from Lechmere to various points on the subway. These trips were replaced on February 7, 1931 by extensions of the various branches from the west, which had terminated at Park Street, through to Lechmere.\n\n===Portals===\nCars entered the subway from the surface at a number of portals or inclines, listed here from north to south/east to west.\n\n====Lechmere====\n[[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] is the north end of the Green Line. From the opening of the [[Lechmere Viaduct]] leading to it in 1912 until 1922, streetcar lines simply fed onto the viaduct from Cambridge Street and Bridge Street (now [[Massachusetts Route 28|Monsignor O'Brien Highway]]). In 1922 a [[prepayment station]] was opened, with a new loop for subway trains to turn around and a separate loop for surface cars, and no intermingling between the two. The surface lines have since been replaced with [[bus]]es, but the Green Line still turns around at Lechmere.\n\n====Canal Street====\n[[File:Canal Street Incline north 1901.jpg|thumb|right|Canal Street Portal in 1901]]\nThe [[Canal Street Portal]] (also Haymarket Portal, North Station Portal or Causeway Street Portal, often referred to in revenue service as the Canal Street Loop) was part of the transition between subway and [[elevated railway]] on the Green Line, as it transitioned from the [[Tremont Street Subway]] to the [[Causeway Street Elevated]] towards the [[Lechmere Viaduct]] until 2004, when the Green Line north of [[North Station]] was closed for building of a new tunnel and portal. Certain trains turned at Canal Street, while others emerged from the subway to a viaduct to Lechmere. It was, however, possible for a passenger to alight from a train at Canal Street and proceed up a series of stairways to the Lechmere Viaduct. However, most passengers desiring to continue to Science Park or Lechmere would have changed to a Lechmere signed car from a North Station signed car prior to the emergence from the central subway.\n\n[[Image:Pleasant Street Incline junction.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flying junction]] on the [[Tremont Street Subway]] approaching the [[Pleasant Street Incline]]]]\n\nThe original four-track portal opened in 1898 at the north end of the first subway; cars could turn east or west on Causeway Street. In 1901 the [[Charlestown Elevated]] was connected to the outer tracks, and streetcars only operated via the inner tracks. The [[Washington Street Tunnel (Boston)|Washington Street Tunnel]] opened in 1908, connecting to the Elevated via a new portal just east of the streetcar one, and all four tracks were once again open for streetcar use until 1975. In 1912 the Lechmere Viaduct opened, again using the two outer tracks for an elevated line. The inner tracks continued to serve the surface, including a surface station at [[North Station]], until 1997, when they were closed for construction of the new tunnel and the Green Line was shifted to the old Orange Line (Charlestown Elevated) portal along the way. The {{MBTABus|93}} was the last service to continue onto surface streets from the portal, last running in 1949.\n\n====Pleasant Street====\nThe [[Pleasant Street Portal]] was the south end of the [[Tremont Street Subway]], opened one month after the original subway in 1897. It split from the Boylston Street Subway at a [[flying junction]] at [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]], and another flying junction split the tunnel into two side-by-side tunnels to the four-track portal. The two west tracks rose onto [[Tremont Street]] and the two east ones onto [[Pleasant Street (Boston)|Pleasant Street]], later part of Broadway. From 1901 to 1908 the portal was only used by [[Washington Street Elevated]] trains, after which streetcar service was restored\u2014though much of it had been cut back to [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]] for transfer to the Elevated. Until 1953 service ran to City Point at eastern end of [[South Boston]] as part of {{MBTABus|9}}. The last cars ran through the portal in 1961 as part of the {{MBTABus|43}}, and in 1962 a shuttle service from Boylston to the portal was ended. The portal has since been covered, but someday may become part of a new streetcar line that would partly replace access to rapid transit for southern Metro Boston neighborhoods, that had been severed from MBTA rapid transit service in 1987 with the demolishing of the [[Washington Street Elevated]] original southern section of the Orange Line. This proposed new streetcar service could go as far south as the Red Line's [[Mattapan station]], with a northern turnaround terminus at [[Government Center station (MBTA)|Government Center]], according to a 2012-dated proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Portals/17/docs/RDM/RDMReport_0912.pdf|title=Roxbury-Dorchester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study|date=September 2012|page=53 |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Public Garden and Boylston Street====\n[[File:Public Gardens portal.png|thumb|right|Streetcars using the Public Garden Portal in 1898]]\nThe first portal to open, on September 1, 1897, was the Public Garden Portal, providing an outlet for the subway on the north side of [[Boylston Street (Boston)|Boylston Street]] in the [[Public Garden (Boston, Massachusetts)|Public Garden]]. When the Boylston Street Subway opened in 1914, extending the subway west, the incline and portal were relocated to the center of Boylston Street as the Boylston Street Portal. The last cars to use the portal ran in 1941 from [[Huntington Avenue (Boston)|Huntington Avenue]], when the [[Huntington Avenue Subway]] opened as a branch off the main subway and the portal was closed.\n\n==== Northeastern ====\nThe Northeastern Portal lies in the [[median (highway)|median]] of [[Huntington Avenue (Boston)|Huntington Avenue]] at the end of the Huntington Avenue Subway, just east of [[Northeastern University (MBTA station)|Northeastern University]]. It opened in 1941 and carries [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|\"E\" Branch]] trains.\n\nThe incline was built as a wooden trestle to the street atop a level grade, as the original plans called for eventual extension of the subway; in the mid 1980s the trestle was replaced with fill (which greatly quieted the sound).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==== Kenmore ====\n[[File:Top of former Kenmore portal, September 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Top of the filled-in Kenmore Portal]]\nThe Kenmore Portal or Kenmore Square Portal opened in 1914 with the extension of the Boylston Street Subway westward to the east side of [[Kenmore Square (Boston)|Kenmore Square]], in the [[median (highway)|median]] of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]]. It closed in 1932 when the subway station at [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] was built and two new portals were opened to the west.\n\n==== Blandford Street, St. Marys Street, and Fenway ====\nThe Blandford Street Portal and St. Marys Street Portal, in the [[median (highway)|median]]s of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]] and [[Beacon Street (Boston)|Beacon Street]] respectively, opened in 1932 as part of the extension of the Boylston Street Subway under [[Kenmore Square (Boston)|Kenmore Square]] and the opening of the new [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] station. They are currently used by the [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|\"B\"]] and [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|\"C\"]] Branches respectively. The Fenway Portal opened in 1959 along with the opening of the [[Highland Branch]], and provides a third exit from Kenmore, south of the St. Marys Street Portal. It carries trains of the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|\"D\" Branch]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== Rolling stock ==\nLike the three other MBTA subway lines, the line uses [[standard gauge]] tracks.

Because the car door arrangement required a large gap between the platform and the car, a bridge plate attached to the raised platform had to be positioned after the train stopped with a door at that platform.\n* The MBTA has followed the worldwide trend of operating [[low-floor tram|low-floor streetcars]]. As an ongoing project, not complete in 2012, platforms are being raised slightly to about the height of a street curb. Low-floor cars have remotely controlled bridge plates at the center doors to allow wheelchairs and strollers to reach the car floor a few inches higher.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the MBTA|Boston-area streetcar lines}}\n\nBeginning in the 1850s, Boston sprouted a large network of [[horsecar]] lines, the first public transit in the city. The [[West End Street Railway]] was created by the state legislature in 1887 to build a single line, but soon consolidated many of the existing lines into a single privately owned system with consistent fares and route designations. The Allston \u2013 Park Square line (which served the general area of the [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|\"A\" Branch]]) was the first section to be converted to [[electric traction]] in 1889. It used modified existing horsecars outfitted with [[Frank J. Sprague]]'s revolutionary electrical equipment, which had first been demonstrated the previous year in [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name=Cudahy>{{cite book|last1=Cudahy|first1=Brian J.|title=Change at Park Street Under; the story of Boston's subways|date=1972|publisher=S.

The [[Tremont Street Subway]], the first passenger subway in North America, was opened in stages in 1897 and 1898, with underground stations at [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston]], Park Street, [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Scollay Square]], [[Adams Square (BERy station)|Adams Square]], and [[Haymarket (MBTA station)|Haymarket]]. The [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Main Line Elevated]] was run through the tunnel from 1901, displacing through-running streetcars,<ref name=\"Cudahy\"/>{{rp|19\u201321}} until it was rerouted to its own [[Washington Street Tunnel (Boston)|Washington Street Tunnel]] in 1908, and the streetcars were returned to the Tremont tunnel.<ref name=\"Cudahy\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThough initially intended merely to clear streetcars from the busiest sections of downtown streets, the Tremont Street Subway became useful as a rapid transit service in its own right. The 1912 completion of the [[Causeway Street Elevated]] and [[Lechmere Viaduct]] extended grade-separated service to [[Lechmere Square]] in Cambridge, and in 1922 the [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere transfer station]] was built.  In 1914, the [[Boylston Street Subway]] opened as a westward extension to just short of [[Kenmore Square]], and in 1933 [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore station]] and short tunnel extensions towards two surface lines were added. In 1941, the [[Huntington Avenue Subway]] and its two additional underground stations removed the last surface streetcars from downtown Boston.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, the [[Boston-area streetcar lines|massive surface streetcar system]] was \"[[bustitution|bustituted]]\" with buses and [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston|trackless trolleys]] which had lower operating costs and more flexible routes. As the 1950s closed out, the only remaining streetcar lines were the [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|Watertown Line]], [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|Commonwealth Avenue Line]], [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|Beacon Street Line]], [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|Arborway Line]], and the [[43 (MBTA bus)|Lenox Street Line]] plus several [[short turn]] services. In 1959, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]]'s Highland Branch was converted to the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|Riverside Line]], a fully grade-separated suburban service.  In 1961, the last through service to Lenox Street via the [[Pleasant Street Portal]] ended, though a Pleasant Street \u2013 Boylston shuttle continued for one more year. In 1963, part of the original subway was rebuilt under [[Government Center (Boston)|Government Center]], abandoning and partially demolishing Adams Square station.\n\nIn 1947, the now-bankrupt BERy was replaced by the public [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (Boston)|Metropolitan Transit Authority]] (M.T.A.). The new agency was unpopular, even spawning [[M.T.A. (song)|a popular protest song]]; in 1964, it was replaced with the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] which had an expanded funding area to preserve suburban commuter rail lines. In 1967, as part of a systemwide rebranding that included new station names and color names for the transit lines, the remaining streetcar services were designated the \"Green Line\" because several of them traveled near the [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. The streetcar lines were given letter designations: \"A\" to the Watertown Line, \"B\" to the Commonwealth Avenue Line, \"C\" to the Beacon Street Line, \"D\" to the Riverside Line, and \"E\" to the Arborway Line.\n\nThe Watertown Line ran mostly in [[street running|mixed traffic]] after diverging from Commonwealth Avenue; it was permanently replaced with buses in 1969. The section of the Arborway Line past [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]] was \"temporarily\" \u2013 ultimately permanently \u2013 bustituted in 1985. In 2001, with new low-floor streetcars entering service, the MBTA began retrofitting underground stations and major surface stops with low raised platforms for handicapped accessibility. In 2004, the Causeway Street Elevated was replaced with a new tunnel under the [[Boston Garden]], which consolidated the Orange Line and Green Line at a new [[North Station (MBTA station)|North Station]] \"superstation\", while continuing to connect to Commuter Rail service north of Boston.\n\nThe name \"Green Line\" was assigned in 1967 as part of a major reorganization of the MBTA system's branding.<ref name=netransit /> In the 1970s, the Green Line and all other MBTA lines were re-evaluated by the [[BTPR|Boston Transportation Planning Review]] for region-wide efficacy and future modernization alternatives initiated as far as physical plant and operating measures.\n\n==Operations and signalling==\n[[File:Newton Highlands outbound.jpg|thumb|right|Trains on the \"D\" Branch operate using wayside signals.]]\nUnlike the MBTA heavy rail subway lines, the Green Line has only limited central control and monitoring. This also means that it has lagged behind the other three rail lines in the availability of countdown signs and \"next train\" arrival information.\n\nThe line is signalled with advisory [[Railway signalling|wayside signals]], except on surface portions in street medians or [[street-running|in-street running]]. Wayside signal territory stretches from Lechmere to the surface portals at Kenmore, and along the entire length of the D\u2013Riverside branch. There are no [[Train protection system|automatic protection devices]], but the cars have [[Electromagnetic track brake|track brakes]], giving the ability to stop quickly under control of the operator. Interlockings are controlled through a wayside Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) system that relies on the operator properly entering the destination manually on a roto-wheel in the train cab at the beginning of a run.\n\nThe line is monitored from the [[Operations control center|Operations Control Center]] (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service is shared by the control room and field personnel along the right of way. Track circuit and signal indications are not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed in the control room to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines.<ref name=trackingstory /> The first real-time data\u2014location data on the surface lines\u2014became available in October 2014. Full tracking was expected by early 2015.<ref name=aboveground />\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the MBTA typically runs two-car trains on weekdays, with one-car trains used at some times on weekends. The last scheduled use of one-car trains on weekdays was in March 2007.<ref name=netransit />\nThree-car trains were added on the B and D branches in 2010 - their first use since 2005 - and a four-car train was tested in April 2011.<ref name=netransit /> In March 2011, the number of three-car trains was substantially increased, including use on the E Branch.<ref name=netransit /><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.mbta.com/news/2011-03-16/green-line-nearly-triple-the-number-3-car-trains |title=Green Line to nearly triple the number of 3-car trains |date=March 16, 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}</ref> However, three-car trains suffered from reliability problems and slow boarding.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2016/05/03/mbta-green-line-crowded|title=Why is the Green Line so crowded? |date=May 3, 2016 |newspaper=Boston Globe |first=Adam |last=Vaccaro}}</ref> The use of three-car trains ended in March 2016.<ref name=netransit />\n\n===Turnarounds===\n[[File:Kenmore loop track from outbound platform, January 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Loop track (left) at Kenmore station]]\n[[File:Scollay Square plan.png|thumb|right|The old Scollay Square Station's Brattle Loop (at bottom), still part of the Government Center station infrastructure.]]\nTrains can reverse direction at a number of stations where a [[balloon loop|turnaround loop]] is installed.  In addition, there are a number of [[Crossover (rail)|crossover switches]] where a train can cross to the opposite track and reverse its direction. Listed below are locations where cars routinely reverse direction or at least can reverse direction without the need for flagpersons to supervise the movement.\n\n* [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] is currently the northern terminus of the Green Line, and consists of a balloon-shaped turnaround, actually two concentric turning loops allowing complex staging of cars and trains.\n* At [[North Station]], trains heading westbound/outbound toward [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] can reverse direction using stub tracks just north of the station. No turnaround is available in the eastbound/inbound direction.\n* At [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Government Center]], Green Line trains entering from either the north or the west can turn around, using the [[Government Center station (MBTA)#Scollay Square|Brattle Loop]]. Trains from the north reversing direction must switch onto the Brattle Loop track prior to entering the station.\n* At Park Street, trains can turn around from one direction only. Trains headed toward [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] may instead enter Park Street on the inside track, often referred to as the \"fence rail\", and turn around on a tight loop after discharging passengers. {{As of|2015}}, the inside loading platform usually served trains bound for [[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]] ([[Green Line \"B\" Branch|\"B\"]]) and [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside]] ([[Green Line \"D\" Branch|\"D\"]]).\n* [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] is where inbound trains coming from the Cleveland Circle (\"C\") or the Riverside (\"D\") Branches can turn around to the corresponding outbound track. No turnaround is available for the Boston College/Commonwealth Avenue \"B\" Branch heading inbound. Outbound, trains can reverse direction using a storage track between the two service tracks just past Kenmore (on Commonwealth Ave. at Blandford St.) and return to the subway.\n\nPlans to reinstitute a crossover for through movements from the terminating (inner) northbound platform at Park Street to continue onwards towards Government Center are expected to increase capacity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web|title=MBTA Capital Investment Program FY15-FY19|url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Financials/FINAL%20FY15-19%20MBTA%20Capital%20Investment%20Program.pdf|publisher=MBTA|accessdate=April 23, 2015|page=124|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plans==\n\n===Somerville/Medford extension (Green Line Extension Project)===\n{{main|Green Line Extension}}\n[[File:Green Line Extension.svg|thumb|left|350px|Map of the Green Line Extension.

In August 2011, MassDOT announced that opening of the Extension would be postponed to fall (Q3 or Q4) 2018 at the earliest, with some stations not opening until 2019.

Originally known as '''Top of the Super Juniors''', the first tournament was held in [[#1988|1988]] with annual tournaments taking place since [[#1991|1991]]. The wrestlers in the tournament are typically [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|junior heavyweight]] wrestlers from promotions all over the world.<ref name=eddie75/> NJPW has held 28 Super Juniors tournaments. Two wrestlers have won the tournament three times, [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] and [[Koji Kanemoto]], while only one wrestler has won the tournament in two consecutive years as [[Tiger Mask IV]] won the tournament in both [[#2004|2004]] and [[#2005|2005]]. Kanemoto holds the record for the most final appearances, having wrestled eight finals between 1997 and 2009. Liger has participated in the most tournaments as he has wrestled in all tournaments except the [[#1995|1995]] and [[#2000|2000]] tournaments. His participation in the [[#2017|2017]] tournament marked his 26th and last Super Junior tournament.\n\n==History and format==\nThe tournament was formed in 1988 by NJPW.

Since 1996 the tournament has been divided into a two-block system used in many other [[Professional wrestling in Japan|puroresu]] tournaments. In this format the top two scorers in each block advance to the semifinals, at which point [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] rules take effect. During the round-robin portion, a win is worth two points, a draw is worth one, and a loss zero; all matches have a 30-minute time limit, though in the past it has been twenty minutes.\n\n==Top of the Super Juniors (1988-1993)==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Tournament\n!Year\n!Winner\n!{{Tooltip|TOSJ won|Top of the Super Juniors}}\n!Final Venue\n!Reference\n|-\n|{{sort|01|TOSJ 1988}} || [[#1988|1988]] || [[Shiro Koshinaka]] || 1 || || <ref name=BOSJ>{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter = Japan; Top of the Super Junior Heavyweight Champions| page = 375 |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref><ref name=BOSJ1988>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#88| title= Top of the Super Junior 1988 | date= January 4 \u2013 February 7, 1988| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|02|TOSJ 1991}} || [[#1991|1991]] || [[Norio Honaga]] || 1 || || <ref name=BOSJ/><ref name=BOSJ1991>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#91| title= Top of the Super Junior 1991 | date= April 15\u201330, 1991| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|03|TOSJ 1992}} || [[#1992|1992]] || [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] || 1 || || <ref name=BOSJ/><ref name=BOSJ1992>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#92| title= Top of the Super Junior 1992 | date= April 16\u201330, 1992| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|04|TOSJ 1993}} || [[#1993|1993]] || [[Chris Benoit|Pegasus Kid]] || 1 || || <ref name=BOSJ/><ref name=BOSJ1993>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#93| title= Top of the Super Junior 1993 | date= May 25 \u2013 June 15, 1993| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===1988===\nThe 1988 Top of the Super Juniors was a 12-man tournament held from January 4 to February 7.

The participants were all revealed bar one on April 23. In addition to NJPW regulars, the tournament will also feature [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) wrestlers [[Dragon Lee (wrestler)|Dragon Lee]] and [[Tit\u00e1n (wrestler)|Tit\u00e1n]] and [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) wrestlers [[Marty Scurll]], [[Jonathan Gresham]] and [[Bandido (wrestler)|Bandido]]. This is the first edition to have twenty wrestlers entering the tournament. Before the tournament, [[El Desperado (wrestler)|El Desperado]] had to pull out due to injury and was replaced by Douki. [[Flip Gordon]] also had to pull out due to visa issues, being replaced by [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#young boy|young lion]] [[Ren Narita]]. [[Taka Michinoku]] forfeited his final three matches due to a leg injury.\n\nThe 2019 edition included a record twenty participants; [[Shingo Takagi]] won all his matches in Block A, therefore becoming the first person to win nine matches within the same block, and setting a new record for most points scored at the tournament with 18 (apart from the inaugural 1988 edition, which used a different points system); the previous record for the current format was held by [[Finn B\u00e1lor|Prince Devitt]], who won all eight of his matches in 2013 and scored 16. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;text-align:center\"\n|+Final standings \n! colspan=\"2\" | Block A !! colspan=\"2\" | Block B\n|-\n![[Shingo Takagi]]\n|18\n![[Will Ospreay]]\n| style=\"width:35px\" |14\n|-\n![[Taiji Ishimori]]\n|14\n![[Ryusuke Taguchi]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Dragon Lee (wrestler)|Dragon Lee]]\n| style=\"width:35px\" |14\n![[El Phantasmo]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Sho Tanaka|Sho]]\n|10                                                                                                      \n![[Tetsuya Bushi|Bushi]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Marty Scurll]]\n|10\n![[Yohei Komatsu|Yoh]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Jonathan Gresham]]\n|8\n![[Bandido (wrestler)|Bandido]]\n|10\n|-\n![[Tit\u00e1n (wrestler)|Tit\u00e1n]]\n|6\n![[Robbie Eagles]] \n|10\n|-\n![[Yoshinobu Kanemaru]]\n|6\n![[Rocky Romero]]\n|6\n|-\n![[Tiger Mask IV|Tiger Mask]]\n|4\n![[Douki]]\n|2\n|-\n![[Taka Michinoku]]\n|0\n![[Ren Narita]]\n|0\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

Originally known as '''Top of the Super Juniors''', the first tournament was held in [[#1988|1988]] with annual tournaments taking place since [[#1991|1991]]. The wrestlers in the tournament are typically [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|junior heavyweight]] wrestlers from promotions all over the world.<ref name=eddie75/> NJPW has held 28 Super Juniors tournaments. Two wrestlers have won the tournament three times, [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] and [[Koji Kanemoto]], while only one wrestler has won the tournament in two consecutive years as [[Tiger Mask IV]] won the tournament in both [[#2004|2004]] and [[#2005|2005]]. Kanemoto holds the record for the most final appearances, having wrestled eight finals between 1997 and 2009. Liger has participated in the most tournaments as he has wrestled in all tournaments except the [[#1995|1995]] and [[#2000|2000]] tournaments. His participation in the [[#2017|2017]] tournament marked his 26th and last Super Junior tournament.\n\n==History and format==\nThe tournament was formed in 1988 by NJPW. It was originally called the Top of the Super Juniors.<ref name=eddie75>{{cite book|title=Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story|author=Guerrero, Eddie|authorlink=Eddie Guerrero|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2005|isbn=0-7434-9353-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/cheatingdeathste00guer/page/75 75]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cheatingdeathste00guer/page/75}}</ref> The tournament is a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] style tournament where a wrestler scores points.<ref name=eddie75/> The winner, assuming they are not already the champion, receives an opportunity to wrestle for the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] not long after the tournament is over. Since 2010, the title match has taken place at June/July's [[NJPW Dominion|Dominion]] event.\n\nIn 1994, the tournament was renamed to the Best of the Super Juniors. Since 1996 the tournament has been divided into a two-block system used in many other [[Professional wrestling in Japan|puroresu]] tournaments. In this format the top two scorers in each block advance to the semifinals, at which point [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] rules take effect. During the round-robin portion, a win is worth two points, a draw is worth one, and a loss zero; all matches have a 30-minute time limit, though in the past it has been twenty minutes.\n\n==Top of the Super Juniors (1988-1993)==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Tournament\n!Year\n!Winner\n!{{Tooltip|TOSJ won|Top of the Super Juniors}}\n!Reference\n|-\n|{{sort|01|TOSJ 1988}} || [[#1988|1988]] || [[Shiro Koshinaka]] || 1 || <ref name=BOSJ>{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter = Japan; Top of the Super Junior Heavyweight Champions| page = 375 |year= 2000 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref><ref name=BOSJ1988>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#88| title= Top of the Super Junior 1988 | date= January 4 \u2013 February 7, 1988| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|02|TOSJ 1991}} || [[#1991|1991]] || [[Norio Honaga]] || 1 || <ref name=BOSJ/><ref name=BOSJ1991>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#91| title= Top of the Super Junior 1991 | date= April 15\u201330, 1991| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|03|TOSJ 1992}} || [[#1992|1992]] || [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] || 1 || <ref name=BOSJ/><ref name=BOSJ1992>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#92| title= Top of the Super Junior 1992 | date= April 16\u201330, 1992| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|04|TOSJ 1993}} || [[#1993|1993]] || [[Chris Benoit|Pegasus Kid]] || 1 || <ref name=BOSJ/><ref name=BOSJ1993>{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/newjapan/superjr.html#93| title= Top of the Super Junior 1993 | date= May 25 \u2013 June 15, 1993| accessdate= May 10, 2010 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===1988===\nThe 1988 Top of the Super Juniors was a 12-man tournament held from January 4 to February 7.

The participants were all revealed bar one on April 23. In addition to NJPW regulars, the tournament will also feature [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) wrestlers [[Dragon Lee (wrestler)|Dragon Lee]] and [[Tit\u00e1n (wrestler)|Tit\u00e1n]] and [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) wrestlers [[Marty Scurll]], [[Jonathan Gresham]] and [[Bandido (wrestler)|Bandido]]. This is the first edition to have twenty wrestlers entering the tournament. Before the tournament, [[El Desperado (wrestler)|El Desperado]] had to pull out due to injury and was replaced by Douki. [[Flip Gordon]] also had to pull out due to visa issues, being replaced by [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#young boy|young lion]] [[Ren Narita]]. [[Taka Michinoku]] forfeited his final three matches due to a leg injury.\n\nThe 2019 edition included a record twenty participants; [[Shingo Takagi]] won all his matches in Block A, therefore becoming the first person to win nine matches within the same block, and setting a new record for most points scored at the tournament with 18 (apart from the inaugural 1988 edition, which used a different points system); the previous record for the current format was held by [[Finn B\u00e1lor|Prince Devitt]], who won all eight of his matches in 2013 and scored 16. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;text-align:center\"\n|+Final standings \n! colspan=\"2\" | Block A !! colspan=\"2\" | Block B\n|-\n![[Shingo Takagi]]\n|18\n![[Will Ospreay]]\n| style=\"width:35px\" |14\n|-\n![[Taiji Ishimori]]\n|14\n![[Ryusuke Taguchi]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Dragon Lee (wrestler)|Dragon Lee]]\n| style=\"width:35px\" |14\n![[El Phantasmo]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Sho Tanaka|Sho]]\n|10                                                                                                      \n![[Tetsuya Bushi|Bushi]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Marty Scurll]]\n|10\n![[Yohei Komatsu|Yoh]]\n|12\n|-\n![[Jonathan Gresham]]\n|8\n![[Bandido (wrestler)|Bandido]]\n|10\n|-\n![[Tit\u00e1n (wrestler)|Tit\u00e1n]]\n|6\n![[Robbie Eagles]] \n|10\n|-\n![[Yoshinobu Kanemaru]]\n|6\n![[Rocky Romero]]\n|6\n|-\n![[Tiger Mask IV|Tiger Mask]]\n|4\n![[Douki]]\n|2\n|-\n![[Taka Michinoku]]\n|0\n![[Ren Narita]]\n|0\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

[[Tsunami]]s affect New Zealand's coastline reasonably frequently and tend to be caused by earthquakes on the Pacific Plate both locally and as far away as [[South America]], [[Japan]], and [[Alaska]]. Some have been attributed to undersea landslides, volcanoes, and at least one meteor strike. New Zealand is affected by at least one tsunami with the a wave height greater than one metre every ten years on average.<ref name=TeAra>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/tsunamis/page-1Tsunamis Willem de Lange and Eileen McSaveney.

They had been gathering fish at the [[Waiau River (Southland)|Waiau River]] mouth in autumn as provisions for the winter period. The beach runs between the sea and a line of cliffs meaning that only a moderate tsunami of 2\u20134 metres high would have been needed to cause so many deaths. The likely source of the tsunami could have been an earthquake on the Fiordland or Puysegur faults.

The earthquake descriptions are considered consistent with a 7.6 to 8 magnitude quake given the extent of landslides and uplift. A tsunami or [[seiche]] caused by the uplift impacted the area where the sealers were. Its size has not been determined but it must have been significant (greater than 1 metre) to concern the sealers. They thought the small island on which they were residing was going to be swamped. There are questions around the accuracy of the year this event occurred.<ref name=NIWA /> Given that the earthquake responsible for this tsunami was felt as being violent by the sealers, it is unlikely to be the same tsunami as in the previous section, since in the earlier event was not foreshadowed by noticeable ground shaking.\n\n====1855 West Wairarapa====\n{{Main|1855 Wairarapa earthquake}}\nThe uplift from the earthquake on 23 January 1855 tilted the [[Wellington Region]] and with it [[Wellington Harbour]].

Like other early paravians, ''Anchiornis'' was small, about the size of a [[crow]].<ref name=\"tangle\">Witmer, L. M. (2009). Palaeontology: Feathered dinosaurs in a tangle. ''Nature'', '''461'''(7264): 601\u2013602.</ref> It had long, wing-bearing arms, long legs, and a long tail. Like all paravians, it was covered in feathers, though it also had scales on certain parts of the body. The wings, legs, and tail supported long but relatively narrow vaned feathers. Two types of simpler, [[Down feather|downy]] (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'': down feathers made up of filaments attached at their bases, and more complex down feathers with barbs attached along a central quill. Long, simple feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs, and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices).<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> Long feathers on the head (crown) may have formed a crest.<ref name=\"lietal2010\" /> While the first specimen of ''Anchiornis'' preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, many more well-preserved fossils have since been found. Studies of ''Anchiornis'' specimens using laser fluorescence have revealed not only more details of the feathers, but also of the skin and muscle tissue. Taken together, this evidence has given scientists a nearly complete picture of ''Anchiornis'' anatomy. Additional studies indicate that ''Anchiornis'' had body plumage that consisted of short quills with long and independent, flexible barbs. These barbs stuck out from the quills at low angles on two opposing blades. This also gave each feather an overall forked shape and resulted in the theropod possessing a softer textured and \"shaggier\" appearing plumage than is seen in modern birds. 'Shaggy' contour feathers probably influenced thermoregulatory and water repellence abilities, and, in combination with open-vaned wing feathers, would have decreased aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171128230425.htm|title=Feathered dinosaurs were even fluffier than we thought|website=sciencedaily.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Additional information on the primitive contour and wing feathering of paravian dinosaurs|first1=Evan T. |last1=Saitta |first2=Rebecca |last2=Gelernter |first3=Jakob |last3=Vinther |journal=Palaeontology |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages = 273\u2013288|doi=10.1111/pala.12342|year = 2018|hdl=1983/61351c6d-1517-4101-bac8-50cbb733761d |url=https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/additional-information-on-the-primitive-contour-and-wing-feathering-of-paravian-dinosaurs(61351c6d-1517-4101-bac8-50cbb733761d).html }}</ref>\n\nIts size was originally estimated at {{convert|34|cm}} and {{convert|0.11|kg}}, but some specimens show that is could in fact have grown somewhat larger, up to {{convert|40|cm}} and {{convert|0.25|kg}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paul | first=G.S. |year=2010 |title=The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs |url=https://archive.org/details/princetonfieldgu0000paul |url-access=registration |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/princetonfieldgu0000paul/page/128 128]}}</ref> ''Anchiornis'' had a wing span of up to {{convert|50|cm|ft}}.<ref name=\"Dececchi_2016\">Dececchi, T.A., Larsson, H.C.E., and Habib, M.B.

The wing of ''Anchiornis'' was composed of 11 [[Flight feather#Primaries|primary feathers]] and 10 [[Flight feather#Secondaries|secondary feathers]]. The primary feathers in ''Anchiornis'' were about as long as the secondaries, and formed a rounded wing. The wing feathers had curved but symmetrical central quills, with small and thin relative size, and rounded tips, all indicating poor aerodynamic ability. In the related [[dinosaur]]s ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', the longest wing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear relatively long and pointed. However, in ''Anchiornis'', the longest wing feathers were those nearest the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/>\n\nLike other [[maniraptora]]ns, ''Anchiornis'' had a pro[[patagium]], a flap of skin connecting the wrist to the shoulder and rounding out the front edge of the wing. In ''Anchiornis'', this part of the wing was covered in [[covert feather]]s which smoothed the wing and covered the gaps between the larger primary and secondary feathers. However, unlike modern [[bird]]s, the covert feathers of ''Anchiornis'' were not arranged in tracts or rows.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\" /> The arrangement of the covert feathers was also more primitive in ''Anchiornis'' than in birds and more advanced paravians. In modern birds, the coverts usually cover only the upper portion of the wing, with most of the wing surface made up of uncovered flight feathers. In some ''Anchiornis'' fossils, on the other hand, several layers of covert feathers seem to extend down to cover most of the wing's surface, so that the wing is essentially made of multiple layers of feathers, rather than a layer of broad feathers with only their bases hidden by layers of coverts. This multi-layered wing arrangement might have helped strengthen the wing, considering that the primary and secondary feathers themselves were narrow and weak.<ref name=\"coverts\">Longrich, N.R., Vinther, J., Meng, Q., Li, Q., & Russell, A.P. (2012). Primitive wing feather arrangement in ''Archaeopteryx lithographica'' and ''Anchiornis huxleyi''. ''Current Biology'', '''22'''(23): 2262\u20132267. {{doi|10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.052}}</ref>\n\nThe wing included three clawed fingers; however, unlike in some more primitive theropods, the longest two fingers were not separate, but were bound together by the skin and other tissue forming the wing, so ''Anchiornis'' was functionally two-fingered.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\">Wang X., Pittman, M., Zheng X., Kaye, T.G., Falk, A.R., Hartman, S.A., and Xu X.

Like the toes, the skin around the bottom of the fingers was covered in tiny, rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the finger bones was twice as thick as the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the fingers were straight and smooth without any major creases at the joints. Scales and skin around the fingers is very rarely preserved in fossils of early [[pennaraptora]]ns, the only notable exceptions being ''Anchiornis'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'', which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\" />\n\n=== Legs ===\n[[File:Anchiornis huxleyi skel hartman 2017.png|thumb|Skeletal restoration by Scott Hartman, 2017]]\nIn addition to the front wings, ''Anchiornis'' had long, vaned feathers on the hind legs. This has led many scientists to call ''Anchiornis'' a four-winged [[dinosaur]], along with similar animals like ''Microraptor'' and ''[[Sapeornis]]''.<ref name=\"integraive\">Xu X., Zhou Z., Dudley, R., Mackem, S., Chuong, C.M., Erickson, G.M., & Varricchio, D.J. (2014). An integrative approach to understanding bird origins. ''Science'', '''346'''(6215): 1253293. {{doi|10.1126/science.1253293}}</ref> However, the feathers on the hind legs in ''Anchiornis'' did not have the shape or arrangement expected from flight feathers, and it is likely that their primary role was in display rather than flight.<ref name=\"leg_display\">O\u2019Connor, J.K., & Chang, H. (2015). Hindlimb feathers in paravians: primarily \"wings\" or ornaments? ''Biology Bulletin'', '''42'''(7): 616\u2013621.</ref>\n\n''Anchiornis'' had very long legs, which is usually an indication that an animal is a strong runner. However, the extensive leg feathers indicate that this may be a vestigial trait, as running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their legs.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> Like most paravians, ''Anchiornis'' had four toes on the foot, with the third and fourth toes the longest. The first toe, or [[hallux]], was not reversed as in perching species.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> The hindwings of ''Anchiornis'' were also shorter than those of ''Microraptor'', and were made up of 12 to 13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10 to 11 to the tarsus (upper foot). Also unlike ''Microraptor'', the hindwing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/>\n\nUnlike many other paravians, the feet of ''Anchiornis'' (except for the claws) were completely covered in feathers, though these were much shorter than the ones making up the hindwing.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> Some specimens have preserved scales on the toes, tarsus, and even lower leg (tibia), suggesting that scales existed beneath the feathers. The underside of the toes were formed into fleshy pads with distinct creases at the joints. The foot pads were covered in small, pebble-like scales. Scales were also present on the top of the feet but these are very hard to see in all known fossils.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\" />\n\n=== Color ===\n[[File:Anchiornis BW.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression, illustrating feather arrangement and life coloration of the Beijing specimen]]\nIn 2010, a team of scientists examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well-preserved ''Anchiornis'' specimen in the [[Beijing Museum of Natural History]] to survey the distribution of ''melanosomes'', the pigment cells that give feathers their color. By studying the types of melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the specific colors and patterning present on this ''Anchiornis'' when it was alive. Though this technique had been used and described for isolated bird feathers and portions of other dinosaurs (such as the tail of ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]''), ''Anchiornis'' became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life coloration was known (note that the tail of this specimen was not preserved).<ref name=\"lietal2010\" /> The study found that most of the body feathers of this ''Anchiornis'' specimen were gray and black. The crown feathers were mainly [[rufous]] with a gray base and front, and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The forewing and hindwing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were gray, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long hindwing feathers, and the feet and toes were black.<ref name=\"lietal2010\" />\n\nIn 2015, a second ''Anchiornis'' fossil at the Yizhou Fossil & Geology Park was subjected to a similar study that included a survey of melanosome shapes across all the feathers. In contrast to the 2010 study, only gray-black type melanosomes were found. Even when the crown feathers were examined, none of the rounder, rufous-type melanosomes were seen. The scientists who conducted this second study suggested several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the different preservation of melanosomes or different investigative techniques might have influenced the results of the original study. Second, because the Beijing Museum specimen was smaller, it is possible that the rufous color was replaced as these animals aged. Third, it is possible that there were regional differences or even different species of ''Anchiornis'' which had different color patterns in their plumage.<ref name=\"microstructure\" /> If the second specimen does turn out to be a new species, it will be the first dinosaur species to be described from color.\n\n== Discovery and history ==\n[[File:Anchiornis feathers.jpg|thumb|The Beijing specimen which had its colouration examined in 2010]]\nThe first known fossil of ''Anchiornis'' (its [[type specimen]]) was dug up in the Yaolugou area of [[Jianchang County]], [[Liaoning]], [[China]].

According to the farmer, this second specimen had been found nearby in the area of Daxishan, also from Tiaojishan Formation rocks of about the same age as the first ''Anchiornis''. Two scientists visited the site in order to compare the new fossil with the rock types found there, and were able to confirm that the new specimen probably did come from the area the farmer described. They were able to dig up several fish fossils and a third ''Anchiornis'' fossil. The farmer's fossil underwent study which was published on September 24, 2009, in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. It was assigned the catalogue number {{nowrap|LPM \u2013 B00 169}} in the [[Liaoning Paleontological Museum]]. It is larger and much more complete than the first specimen, and preserved long wing feathers on the hands, arms, legs and feet, showing that it was a four-winged dinosaur similar to ''[[Microraptor]]''.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\" />\n\n[[File:Anchiornis martyniuk.png|thumb|Life restoration by M. Martyniuk, 2010, based on the color pattern of the Beijing specimen.]]\nWhile only a few specimens have been described in detail, many more have been identified and are held in both private collections and museums. One of these, a nearly complete skeleton missing the tail, also preserving extensive feather remains, was reported in 2010. This fossil also showed evidence that ''Anchiornis'' had a feathered crest on its head, and was used to determine the animal's life coloration. It is housed in the [[Beijing Museum of Natural History]] with the specimen number BMNHC PH828.<ref name=\"lietal2010\"/> Another specimen from the same fossil quarry as the type specimen was found by a local fossil dealer and sold to the [[Yizhou Fossil & Geology Park]] and catalogued there as YTGP-T5199. This fossil, a nearly complete skeleton, was prepared and studied by scientists at the Geology Park and identified as an ''Anchiornis''. It was then used for a [[scanning electron microscope]] study of ''Anchiornis'' feather microstructure. The study also examined the well-preserved melanosomes of the feathers to determine their color. The scientists involved in the study found that the coloration found for this specimen was different than the color reported for BMNHC PH828, and they noted that the BMNHC specimen may not in fact be ''Anchiornis'', as it was described before similar species from the same formation had been discovered.<ref name=\"microstructure\">Lindgren, J., Sj\u00f6vall, P., Carney, R.

This is similar to the condition in early avians such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', and the authors pointed out that long forelimbs are necessary for flight. ''Anchiornis'' also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods. The authors initially speculated that it would have been possible for ''Anchiornis'' to fly or glide. However, further finds showed that the wings of ''Anchiornis'', while well-developed, were short when compared to later species like ''Microraptor'', with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded, symmetrical tips, unlike the pointed, aerodynamically proportioned feathers of ''Microraptor''.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> A 2016 study of potential flight performance in early paravians concluded that while juvenile ''Anchiornis'' specimens may have been able to use their wings to assist running up an incline, and could possibly have achieved flapping flight if a very high-angle flapping wing stroke was used, the larger adult specimens would not have gained any aerodynamic benefit from their wings\u2014they were simply too heavy compared to their total wing area. The same study found that flapping the wings while running would have resulted in a small (10%) increase to its running speed. Similarly, use of the wings during leaping would have resulted in a 15 to 20% increase in height and distance.<ref name=\"Dececchi_2016\" /> Notably, ''Anchiornis'' seems to have lacked a breastbone ([[sternum]]), which may have been made of cartilage rather than bone, as in more primitive theropods.<ref name=\"sternum\">Zheng, X., O\u2019Connor, J., Wang, X., Wang, M., Zhang, X., & Zhou, Z.

In modern birds, especially those that live on the ground, the lower legs tend to show reduction or even loss of feathers.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> The hind wings of ''Anchiornis'' were smaller and made of more curved, symmetrical feathers than those of ''Microraptor'', suggesting that they were used mainly for display rather than flight.<ref name=\"leg_display\" /> However, they might still have granted the animal some kind of aerodynamic advantage, even if their primary purpose was for display or some other function.<ref name=\"tangle\" /><ref name=\"leg_feathers\">Zheng X., Zhou Z., Wang X., Zhang F., Zhang X., Wang Y., Wei G., Wang S., & Xu X.

Like other early paravians, ''Anchiornis'' was small, about the size of a [[crow]].<ref name=\"tangle\">Witmer, L. M. (2009). Palaeontology: Feathered dinosaurs in a tangle. ''Nature'', '''461'''(7264): 601\u2013602.</ref> It had long, wing-bearing arms, long legs, and a long tail. Like all paravians, it was covered in feathers, though it also had scales on certain parts of the body. The wings, legs, and tail supported long but relatively narrow vaned feathers. Two types of simpler, [[Down feather|downy]] (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'': down feathers made up of filaments attached at their bases, and more complex down feathers with barbs attached along a central quill. Long, simple feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs, and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices).<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> Long feathers on the head (crown) may have formed a crest.<ref name=\"lietal2010\" /> While the first specimen of ''Anchiornis'' preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, many more well-preserved fossils have since been found. Studies of ''Anchiornis'' specimens using laser fluorescence have revealed not only more details of the feathers, but also of the skin and muscle tissue. Taken together, this evidence has given scientists a nearly complete picture of ''Anchiornis'' anatomy. Additional studies indicate that ''Anchiornis'' had body plumage that consisted of short quills with long and independent, flexible barbs. These barbs stuck out from the quills at low angles on two opposing blades. This also gave each feather an overall forked shape and resulted in the theropod possessing a softer textured and \"shaggier\" appearing plumage than is seen in modern birds. 'Shaggy' contour feathers probably influenced thermoregulatory and water repellence abilities, and, in combination with open-vaned wing feathers, would have decreased aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171128230425.htm|title=Feathered dinosaurs were even fluffier than we thought|website=sciencedaily.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Additional information on the primitive contour and wing feathering of paravian dinosaurs|first1=Evan T. |last1=Saitta |first2=Rebecca |last2=Gelernter |first3=Jakob |last3=Vinther |journal=Palaeontology |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages = 273\u2013288|doi=10.1111/pala.12342|year = 2018|hdl=1983/61351c6d-1517-4101-bac8-50cbb733761d |url=https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/additional-information-on-the-primitive-contour-and-wing-feathering-of-paravian-dinosaurs(61351c6d-1517-4101-bac8-50cbb733761d).html }}</ref>\n\nIts size was originally estimated at {{convert|34|cm}} and {{convert|0.11|kg}}, but some specimens show that is could in fact have grown somewhat larger, up to {{convert|40|cm}} and {{convert|0.25|kg}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paul | first=G.S. |year=2010 |title=The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs |url=https://archive.org/details/princetonfieldgu0000paul |url-access=registration |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/princetonfieldgu0000paul/page/128 128]}}</ref> ''Anchiornis'' had a wing span of up to {{convert|50|cm|ft}}.<ref name=\"Dececchi_2016\">Dececchi, T.A., Larsson, H.C.E., and Habib, M.B.

The wing of ''Anchiornis'' was composed of 11 [[Flight feather#Primaries|primary feathers]] and 10 [[Flight feather#Secondaries|secondary feathers]]. The primary feathers in ''Anchiornis'' were about as long as the secondaries, and formed a rounded wing. The wing feathers had curved but symmetrical central quills, with small and thin relative size, and rounded tips, all indicating poor aerodynamic ability. In the related [[dinosaur]]s ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', the longest wing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear relatively long and pointed. However, in ''Anchiornis'', the longest wing feathers were those nearest the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/>\n\nLike other [[maniraptora]]ns, ''Anchiornis'' had a pro[[patagium]], a flap of skin connecting the wrist to the shoulder and rounding out the front edge of the wing. In ''Anchiornis'', this part of the wing was covered in [[covert feather]]s which smoothed the wing and covered the gaps between the larger primary and secondary feathers. However, unlike modern [[bird]]s, the covert feathers of ''Anchiornis'' were not arranged in tracts or rows.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\" /> The arrangement of the covert feathers was also more primitive in ''Anchiornis'' than in birds and more advanced paravians. In modern birds, the coverts usually cover only the upper portion of the wing, with most of the wing surface made up of uncovered flight feathers. In some ''Anchiornis'' fossils, on the other hand, several layers of covert feathers seem to extend down to cover most of the wing's surface, so that the wing is essentially made of multiple layers of feathers, rather than a layer of broad feathers with only their bases hidden by layers of coverts. This multi-layered wing arrangement might have helped strengthen the wing, considering that the primary and secondary feathers themselves were narrow and weak.<ref name=\"coverts\">Longrich, N.R., Vinther, J., Meng, Q., Li, Q., & Russell, A.P.

Like the toes, the skin around the bottom of the fingers was covered in tiny, rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the finger bones was twice as thick as the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the fingers were straight and smooth without any major creases at the joints. Scales and skin around the fingers is very rarely preserved in fossils of early [[pennaraptora]]ns, the only notable exceptions being ''Anchiornis'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'', which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\" />\n\n=== Legs ===\n[[File:Anchiornis huxleyi skel hartman 2017.png|thumb|Skeletal restoration by Scott Hartman, 2017]]\nIn addition to the front wings, ''Anchiornis'' had long, vaned feathers on the hind legs.

However, the extensive leg feathers indicate that this may be a vestigial trait, as running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their legs.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> Like most paravians, ''Anchiornis'' had four toes on the foot, with the third and fourth toes the longest. The first toe, or [[hallux]], was not reversed as in perching species.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> The hindwings of ''Anchiornis'' were also shorter than those of ''Microraptor'', and were made up of 12 to 13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10 to 11 to the tarsus (upper foot). Also unlike ''Microraptor'', the hindwing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/>\n\nUnlike many other paravians, the feet of ''Anchiornis'' (except for the claws) were completely covered in feathers, though these were much shorter than the ones making up the hindwing.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> Some specimens have preserved scales on the toes, tarsus, and even lower leg (tibia), suggesting that scales existed beneath the feathers. The underside of the toes were formed into fleshy pads with distinct creases at the joints. The foot pads were covered in small, pebble-like scales. Scales were also present on the top of the feet but these are very hard to see in all known fossils.<ref name=\"anchiornis_tissue\" />\n\n=== Color ===\n[[File:Anchiornis BW.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression, illustrating feather arrangement and life coloration of the Beijing specimen]]\nIn 2010, a team of scientists examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well-preserved ''Anchiornis'' specimen in the [[Beijing Museum of Natural History]] to survey the distribution of ''melanosomes'', the pigment cells that give feathers their color. By studying the types of melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the specific colors and patterning present on this ''Anchiornis'' when it was alive. Though this technique had been used and described for isolated bird feathers and portions of other dinosaurs (such as the tail of ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]''), ''Anchiornis'' became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life coloration was known (note that the tail of this specimen was not preserved).<ref name=\"lietal2010\" /> The study found that most of the body feathers of this ''Anchiornis'' specimen were gray and black. The crown feathers were mainly [[rufous]] with a gray base and front, and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The forewing and hindwing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were gray, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long hindwing feathers, and the feet and toes were black.<ref name=\"lietal2010\" />\n\nIn 2015, a second ''Anchiornis'' fossil at the Yizhou Fossil & Geology Park was subjected to a similar study that included a survey of melanosome shapes across all the feathers. In contrast to the 2010 study, only gray-black type melanosomes were found. Even when the crown feathers were examined, none of the rounder, rufous-type melanosomes were seen. The scientists who conducted this second study suggested several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the different preservation of melanosomes or different investigative techniques might have influenced the results of the original study. Second, because the Beijing Museum specimen was smaller, it is possible that the rufous color was replaced as these animals aged. Third, it is possible that there were regional differences or even different species of ''Anchiornis'' which had different color patterns in their plumage.<ref name=\"microstructure\" />\n\n== Discovery and history ==\n[[File:Anchiornis feathers.jpg|thumb|The Beijing specimen which had its colouration examined in 2010]]\nThe first known fossil of ''Anchiornis'' (its [[type specimen]]) was dug up in the Yaolugou area of [[Jianchang County]], [[Liaoning]], [[China]].

According to the farmer, this second specimen had been found nearby in the area of Daxishan, also from Tiaojishan Formation rocks of about the same age as the first ''Anchiornis''. Two scientists visited the site in order to compare the new fossil with the rock types found there, and were able to confirm that the new specimen probably did come from the area the farmer described. They were able to dig up several fish fossils and a third ''Anchiornis'' fossil. The farmer's fossil underwent study which was published on September 24, 2009, in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. It was assigned the catalogue number {{nowrap|LPM \u2013 B00 169}} in the [[Liaoning Paleontological Museum]].

One of these, a nearly complete skeleton missing the tail, also preserving extensive feather remains, was reported in 2010. This fossil also showed evidence that ''Anchiornis'' had a feathered crest on its head, and was used to determine the animal's life coloration. It is housed in the [[Beijing Museum of Natural History]] with the specimen number BMNHC PH828.<ref name=\"lietal2010\"/> Another specimen from the same fossil quarry as the type specimen was found by a local fossil dealer and sold to the [[Yizhou Fossil & Geology Park]] and catalogued there as YTGP-T5199. This fossil, a nearly complete skeleton, was prepared and studied by scientists at the Geology Park and identified as an ''Anchiornis''. It was then used for a [[scanning electron microscope]] study of ''Anchiornis'' feather microstructure. The study also examined the well-preserved melanosomes of the feathers to determine their color. The scientists involved in the study found that the coloration found for this specimen was different than the color reported for BMNHC PH828, and they noted that the BMNHC specimen may not in fact be ''Anchiornis'', as it was described before similar species from the same formation had been discovered.<ref name=\"microstructure\">Lindgren, J., Sj\u00f6vall, P., Carney, R.

This is similar to the condition in early avians such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', and the authors pointed out that long forelimbs are necessary for flight. ''Anchiornis'' also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods. The authors initially speculated that it would have been possible for ''Anchiornis'' to fly or glide. However, further finds showed that the wings of ''Anchiornis'', while well-developed, were short when compared to later species like ''Microraptor'', with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded, symmetrical tips, unlike the pointed, aerodynamically proportioned feathers of ''Microraptor''.<ref name=\"Hu et al.2009\"/> A 2016 study of potential flight performance in early paravians concluded that while juvenile ''Anchiornis'' specimens may have been able to use their wings to assist running up an incline, and could possibly have achieved flapping flight if a very high-angle flapping wing stroke was used, the larger adult specimens would not have gained any aerodynamic benefit from their wings\u2014they were simply too heavy compared to their total wing area. The same study found that flapping the wings while running would have resulted in a small (10%) increase to its running speed. Similarly, use of the wings during leaping would have resulted in a 15 to 20% increase in height and distance.<ref name=\"Dececchi_2016\" /> Notably, ''Anchiornis'' seems to have lacked a breastbone ([[sternum]]), which may have been made of cartilage rather than bone, as in more primitive theropods.<ref name=\"sternum\">Zheng, X., O\u2019Connor, J., Wang, X., Wang, M., Zhang, X., & Zhou, Z.

The following passage from ''The Spanish Mandeville'' discusses the mischievous spirits:\n{{quote|Luduvico: I pray you let me somewhat understand your opinion as concerning Robingoodfellowes and Hobgoblins, which are said to be so common, that there is scarcely any man but will tell you one tale or other of them, of which for my own part, I believe none, but do make reckoning that every man forgeth herein, what pleaseth him.\n\nAntonio: Many of them without doubt are forged, and many also true, for these kinds of Spirits are more familiar and domestical than the others, and for some causes to us unknown, abide in one place, more than in another, so that some never almost depart from some particular houses, as though they were their proper mansions, making in them sundry noises, rumours, mockeries, gawdes and jests, without doing any harm at all: and though I am not myself witness thereof, yet I have heard many persons of credit affirm that they have heard them play as it were on Gyterns & Jews Harps, and ring Bells, and that they answer to those that call them, and speak with certain signs, laughters and merry gestures, so that those of the house come at last to be so familiar and well acquainted with them that they fear them not at all. But in truth, as I said before, if they had free power to put in practice their malicious desire, we should find these pranks of theirs, not to be jests, but earnest indeed, tending to the destruction of both our body and soul, but as I told you before, this power of theirs is so restrained and tied, that they can pass no farther than to jests and gawdes: and if they do any harm or hurt at all, it is certain very little, as by experience we daily see.\n}}\n\nAfter [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s successful opera ''Robert le Diable'' (1831), neo-medievalists and occultists began to apply the name ''Robin Goodfellow'' to the Devil, with appropriately extravagant imagery.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Cleanup-section|date=December 2015|reason=currently unencyclopedic}}\n[[File:Joseph Noel Paton - Puck and Fairies, from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Noel Paton]], Puck and [[fairy|Fairies]], detail from<br>''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.]]\n\nIf you had the knack{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}, Puck might do minor housework for you, quick fine needlework or butter-churning, which could be undone in a moment by his knavish tricks if you displeased him.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wall|first=Wendy |url=https://www.academia.edu/3756906/Why_Does_Puck_Sweep_Fairylore_Merry_Wives_and_Social_Struggle|title=Why Does Puck Sweep?: Fairylore, Merry Wives, and Social Struggle|date=Spring 2001|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=52|number=1|pages=67\u2013106 |accessdate=2019-07-16}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He may also do work for you if you leave him small gifts, such as a glass of milk or other such treats, otherwise he may do the opposite by \"make[ing] the drink[beer] to bear no barm\" and other such fiendish acts.

It is unknown how Shakespeare's Puck appeared on the stage; but the figure in ''Grim'' was costumed \"in a suit of leather close to his body; his face and hands coloured russet-coloured, with a flail.\"\n* An early 17th century broadside ballad, \"The Mad Merry Pranks of Robin Goodfellow\" describes Puck/Robin Goodfellow as the emissary of [[Oberon]], the Fairy King of the Night, inspiring night-terrors in old women but also carding their wool while they sleep, leading travellers astray, taking the shape of animals, blowing out the candles to kiss the girls in the darkness, twitching off their bedclothes, or making them fall out of bed on the cold floor, tattling secrets, and changing babes in cradles with elflings. \n* Robin Goodfellow is the main speaker in Jonson's 1612 [[masque]] ''[[Love Restored]].''\n* [[John Milton]], in ''[[L'Allegro]]'' tells \"how the drudging [[Goblin]] swet / To earn his cream-bowle\" by threshing a week's worth of grain in a night, and then, \"Basks at the fire his hairy strength.\" Milton's Puck is not small and sprightly, but nearer to a [[Green Man]] or a hairy [[wild man|woodwose]].

The following passage from ''The Spanish Mandeville'' discusses the mischievous spirits:\n{{quote|Luduvico: I pray you let me somewhat understand your opinion as concerning Robingoodfellowes and Hobgoblins, which are said to be so common, that there is scarcely any man but will tell you one tale or other of them, of which for my own part, I believe none, but do make reckoning that every man forgeth herein, what pleaseth him.\n\nAntonio: Many of them without doubt are forged, and many also true, for these kinds of Spirits are more familiar and domestical than the others, and for some causes to us unknown, abide in one place, more than in another, so that some never almost depart from some particular houses, as though they were their proper mansions, making in them sundry noises, rumours, mockeries, gawdes and jests, without doing any harm at all: and though I am not myself witness thereof, yet I have heard many persons of credit affirm that they have heard them play as it were on Gyterns & Jews Harps, and ring Bells, and that they answer to those that call them, and speak with certain signs, laughters and merry gestures, so that those of the house come at last to be so familiar and well acquainted with them that they fear them not at all. But in truth, as I said before, if they had free power to put in practice their malicious desire, we should find these pranks of theirs, not to be jests, but earnest indeed, tending to the destruction of both our body and soul, but as I told you before, this power of theirs is so restrained and tied, that they can pass no farther than to jests and gawdes: and if they do any harm or hurt at all, it is certain very little, as by experience we daily see.\n}}\n\nAfter [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s successful opera ''Robert le Diable'' (1831), neo-medievalists and occultists began to apply the name ''Robin Goodfellow'' to the Devil, with appropriately extravagant imagery.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Cleanup-section|date=December 2015|reason=currently unencyclopedic}}\n[[File:Joseph Noel Paton - Puck and Fairies, from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Noel Paton]], Puck and [[fairy|Fairies]], detail from<br>''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.]]\n\nIf you had the knack{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}, Puck might do minor housework for you, quick fine needlework or butter-churning, which could be undone in a moment by his knavish tricks if you displeased him.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wall|first=Wendy |url=https://www.academia.edu/3756906/Why_Does_Puck_Sweep_Fairylore_Merry_Wives_and_Social_Struggle|title=Why Does Puck Sweep?: Fairylore, Merry Wives, and Social Struggle|date=Spring 2001|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=52|number=1|pages=67\u2013106 |accessdate=2019-07-16}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He may also do work for you if you leave him small gifts, such as a glass of milk or other such treats, otherwise he may do the opposite by \"make[ing] the drink[beer] to bear no barm\" and other such fiendish acts. Pucks are also known to be inherently lonely creatures, and often share the goal of acquiring friends.  \"Those that Hob-goblin call you, and sweet Puck, / You do their work, and they shall have good luck\" said one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[fairy|fairies]]. Shakespeare's characterization of \"shrewd and knavish\" Puck in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' may have revived flagging interest in Puck.<ref>Shakespeare's sources for Puck were assembled and analysed by Winifried Schleiner (1985). \"Imaginative Sources For Shakespeare's Puck\" ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' '''36'''(1): 65\u201368. {{doi|10.2307/2870083}}. {{JSTOR|2870083}}. </ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1898):\n\n{{quote |\n[Robin Goodfellow is a] \"drudging fiend\", and merry domestic fairy, famous for mischievous pranks and practical jokes. At night-time he will sometimes do little services for the family over which he presides. The [[Scottish people|Scots]] call this domestic spirit a [[Brownie (folklore)|brownie]]; the Germans, [[Kobold]] or [[Companions of Saint Nicholas|Knecht Ruprecht]]. [[Scandinavia]]ns called it [[Tomte|Niss\u00eb God-dreng]]. Puck, the [[jester]] of Fairy-court, is the same.\n}}\n\n==Notable cultural references==\n\n===16th century===\n* Puck, referred to as Robin Goodfellow and Hobgoblin, appears as a vassal of the Fairy King [[Oberon]] in William Shakespeare's play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', and is responsible for the mischief that occurs.\n\n===17th century===\n* As Robin Goodfellow, Puck appears in a roughly contemporaneous play, ''[[Grim the Collier of Croydon]]'' (1600). It is unknown how Shakespeare's Puck appeared on the stage; but the figure in ''Grim'' was costumed \"in a suit of leather close to his body; his face and hands coloured russet-coloured, with a flail.\"\n* An early 17th century broadside ballad, \"The Mad Merry Pranks of Robin Goodfellow\" describes Puck/Robin Goodfellow as the emissary of [[Oberon]], the Fairy King of the Night, inspiring night-terrors in old women but also carding their wool while they sleep, leading travellers astray, taking the shape of animals, blowing out the candles to kiss the girls in the darkness, twitching off their bedclothes, or making them fall out of bed on the cold floor, tattling secrets, and changing babes in cradles with elflings. \n* Robin Goodfellow is the main speaker in Jonson's 1612 [[masque]] ''[[Love Restored]].''\n* [[John Milton]], in ''[[L'Allegro]]'' tells \"how the drudging [[Goblin]] swet / To earn his cream-bowle\" by threshing a week's worth of grain in a night, and then, \"Basks at the fire his hairy strength.\" Milton's Puck is not small and sprightly, but nearer to a [[Green Man]] or a hairy [[wild man|woodwose]]. An illustration of Robin Goodfellow from 1639 represents the influence of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] imagery giving Puck the hindquarters, [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] and horns of a goat.<ref>[http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/ideas/folklore.html Folklore \u2013 Robin Goodfellow (Puck)] University of Victoria/Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n* Robin Goodfellow appears in an 1856 speech by [[Karl Marx]]: \"In the signs that bewilder the middle class, the aristocracy and the poor profits of regression, we recognize our brave friend Robin Goodfellow, the old mole that can work the earth so fast, that worthy pioneer \u2013 the Revolution.\"<ref name=\"Marx\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1856/04/14.htm |title=Speech at anniversary of the People's Paper |last=Karl |first=Marx |year=1856}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n*Puck is one of the main characters in [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling's]] ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' and ''[[Rewards and Fairies]]''.\n*The name ''P\u00fakel-men'', an alternative name of the [[Dr\u00faedain]] peoples in [[J.

Kelley General Store.<ref name=history>http://chs.cullmancats.net/History-CullmanHighSchool.pdf</ref> The building is located in downtown Cullman on the corner of Third Avenue and Third Street and still stands to this day. The following year, in 1909, two Cullman businessmen, George H. Parker and C. H. Stiefelmeyer, donated {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land and donated $10,000 to construct a new school, which was located at 800 Second Avenue, which is the current site of Cullman Middle School.<ref name=history/>\n\nBy 1920, nearly 280 students were enrolled at Cullman County High School and an expansion was needed. A new classroom building and an auditorium were added onto the Second Avenue campus to curb the growth in enrollment.<ref name=history/> The school was nearly closed in 1935 when funding was completely lost due to the Great Depression. Students were warned that the school would close and they would not be able to graduate. Fortunately, the businessmen of the [[Cullman, AL|City of Cullman]] rallied together to raise the funds needed to keep the school open.<ref name=history/>\n\nBy 1940, the school was known statewide as a leader in sports, especially football and baseball. The academic programs were also renowned as being \"ahead of their time.\"<ref name=history/> In 1949, the various schools within [[Cullman, AL|Cullman]] were taken over by the city and the [[Cullman City Schools|Cullman City School System]] was officially formed.

The following year, in 1909, two Cullman businessmen, George H. Parker and C. H.

A new classroom building and an auditorium were added onto the Second Avenue campus to curb the growth in enrollment.<ref name=history/> The school was nearly closed in 1935 when funding was completely lost due to the Great Depression.
