Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas.<ref name=\"goldsmith-commentary\"/> The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece.

Instead Horner adapted the opening fanfare of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme. \"The fanfare draws you in immediately\u2014you know you're going to get a good movie,\" Horner said.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nIn comparison to the flowing main theme, Khan's [[leitmotif]] was designed as a percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity.<ref name=\"anderson-72\"/> The seven-note brass theme was [[echoplex]]ed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until ''Reliant''{{'}}s attack on the ''Enterprise''. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from ''Wolfen'', in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\nTo Horner, the \"stuff underneath\" the main story was what needed to be addressed by the score; in ''The Wrath of Khan'', this was the relationship between Kirk and Spock. The main theme serves as Kirk's theme, with a mellower section following that is the theme for the Starship ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|8}} Horner also wrote a motif for Spock, to emphasize the character's depth: \"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks.\"<ref name=\"anderson-72\">Anderson, 72.</ref> The difference in the short, French horn-based cues for the villain and longer melodies for the heroes helped to differentiate characters and ships during the battle sequences.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nThe soundtrack was Horner's first major film score,<ref name=\"post-music\"/> and was written in four and a half weeks.

Much like the content of the film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film. When writing music for ''The Wrath of Khan'', Horner was aware he would reuse certain cues for an impending sequel; two major themes he reworked were for Genesis and Spock. While the Genesis theme supplants the title music Horner wrote for ''The Wrath of Khan'', the end credits were quoted \"almost verbatim\".<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\">Simak.</ref>\n\nIn hours-long discussions with Bennett and Nimoy, Horner agreed with the director that the \"romantic and more sensitive\" cues were more important than the \"bombastic\" ones.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> Horner had written Spock's theme to give the character more dimension: \"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks,\" he said.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anderson, Kay|year=1982|title='Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan': How the TV series became a hit movie, at last|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=12|issue=5\u20136|pages=72|issn=0145-6032}}</ref> The theme was expanded  in ''The Search for Spock'' to represent the ancient alien mysticism and culture of Spock and Vulcan.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/>\n\nAmong the new cues Horner wrote was a \"percussive and atonal\" theme for the Klingons which is represented heavily in the film.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> [[Jeff Bond]] described the cue as a compromise between music from Horner's earlier film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'', Khan's motif from ''The Wrath of Khan'', and [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s Klingon music from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|113}} Horner also adapted music from [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' for part of the ''Enterprise'' theft sequence and its destruction, while the scoring to Spock's resurrection on Vulcan draws similarities to Horner's ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' ending.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n[[James Horner]], composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock'', declined to return for ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]''. Because of this Nimoy turned to his friend [[Leonard Rosenman]], who had written the music to, among other films, ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and three ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' sequels.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}}<ref name=\"breyer\">Breyer.</ref> Rosenman wrote an arrangement of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme as the title music for ''The Voyage Home'', but Nimoy suggested that he write his own instead. As music critic [[Jeff Bond]] writes, \"The final result was one of the most unusual ''Star Trek'' movie themes,\" consisting of a six note theme and variations set against a repetitious four note brass motif; the theme's bridge is reminiscent of material in Rosenman's \"Frodo March\" for ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}} The melody makes appearances in the beginning of the film at Vulcan as well as when Taylor seeks Kirk's help finding her whales.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe Earth-based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles. Nimoy intended the crew's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of [[George Gershwin]], but Rosenman changed the director's mind<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|131}} and the scene was scored with a contemporary [[jazz fusion]] piece by [[Yellowjackets]]. When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier, Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporated classical Russian compositions, while the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style. More familiar Rosenman compositions included the action music as the Bird of Prey and a whaling ship face off in open water, while the whale's communication with the probe used atmospheric music reminiscent of the composer's work in ''Fantastic Voyage''. After the probe leaves, the music turns into a [[Vivaldi]]esque \"whale fugue\". The first sighting of the ''Enterprise''-A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end title music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\n[[Mark Mangini]] served as ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s sound designer. He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to ''Star Trek'' had already been established\u2014the Bird of Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.\u2014Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those created by the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived close to [[Roger Payne]], a biologist who had many recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest a sort of language and conversation. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had some difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a [[puppet show]] to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after 18 attempts, the [[sound designer]] finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like, and recorded Nimoy's response. Nimoy's voice was distorted with \"just the tiniest bit of dressing\" and used as the final sound.<ref name=\"special features-abovetheline\">Special features, \"Below-the-Line: Sound Design\".</ref>\n\nThe punk music that blares during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the audio to be added to the scene would be \"[[Duran Duran]], or whoever\" and not \"raw\" and authentic punk.<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\">{{cite web|author=Plume, Kenneth|date=2000-02-10|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035854p1.html|title=Interview with Kirk Thatcher (Part 1 of 2)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two [[Audio engineer|sound editors]] (who were in punk bands) to create their own music. They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of \"I hate you\", and wrote a sound to match. Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound, so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the entire band in one take using cheap microphones to create the distorted sound intended.<ref name=\"special features-onlocation\">Special features: \"On Location\".</ref> The song was later used for Paramount's \"[[Back to the Beach]]\".<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\"/>\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\nMusic critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that Shatner made \"at least two wise decisions\" in making ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier|The Final Frontier]]''; he chose [[Laurence Luckinbill]] to play the role of Sybok, and he hired [[Jerry Goldsmith]] to compose the film's score. Goldsmith had written the Academy Award-nominated score for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', and the new ''Trek'' film was an opportunity to craft music with a similar level of ambition while adding action and character\u2014two elements largely missing from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nGoldsmith's main theme begins with the traditional opening notes from [[Alexander Courage]]'s original television series theme; an ascending string and electronic bridge leads to a rendition of the march from ''The Motion Picture''. According to Jeff Bond, Goldsmith's use of ''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s march led to some confusion among ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' fans, as they were unfamiliar with the music's origins and believed that Goldsmith was stealing the theme to ''The Next Generation'', which was itself ''The Motion Picture'' march.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} Another theme from ''The Motion Picture'' that makes a return appearance is the Klingon theme from the 1979 film's opening scene. Here, the theme is treated in what Bond termed a \"Prokofiev-like style as opposed to the avant-garde counterpoint\" as seen in ''The Motion Picture''. Goldsmith also added a crying ram's horn.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nThe breadth of ''The Final Frontier''{{'}}s locations led Goldsmith to eschew the two-themed approach of ''The Motion Picture'' in favor of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring music used for locations and characters. Sybok is introduced with a synthesized motif in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock discuss him en route to Nimbus III it is rendered in a more mysterious fashion. The motif also appears in the action cue as Kirk and company land on Nimbus III and try to free the hostages.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} When Sybok boards the ''Enterprise'', a new four-note motif played by low brass highlights the character's obsession. The Sybok theme from then on is used in either a benevolent sense or a more percussive, dark rendition. Arriving at Sha-ka-ree, the planet's five-note theme bears resemblance to Goldsmith's unicorn theme from ''Legend''; \"...the two melodies represent very similar ideas: lost innocence and the tragic impossibility of recapturing paradise,\" writes Bond. The music features cellos conveying a pious quality, while the appearance of \"God\" begins with string glissandos but turns to a dark rendition of Sybok's theme as its true nature is exposed.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}} As the creature attacks Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more aggressive Sybok theme takes on an attacking rhythm. When Spock appeals to the Klingons for help, the theme takes on a sensitive character before returning to a powerful sequence as the ship destroys the god-creature.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|135}}\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\nDirector Nicholas Meyer's original plan for the score of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|The Undiscovered Country]]'' was to adapt [[Gustav Holst]]'s orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. The plan proved unfeasibly expensive, so Meyer began listening to demo tapes submitted by composers.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |titlelink=|year=1991 |chapter=Director's notes |url= |first=Nicholas |last= Meyer|authorlink= Nicholas Meyer|pages= 2\u20133|type= |publisher=Famous Music Corporation |id= |location= }}</ref> Meyer described most of the demos as generic \"movie music\", but was intrigued by one tape by a young composer named [[Cliff Eidelman]]. Eidelman, then 26, had made a career in composing for ballets, television, and film, but despite work on fourteen features, no film had been the hit needed to propel Eidelman to greater fame.<ref>Schweiger, 8.</ref>\n\nIn conversations with Eidelman, Meyer mentioned that since the marches that accompanied the main titles for other ''Star Trek'' films were so good, he had no desire to compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'' as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\"/> Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of [[Bernard Herrmann]]; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.<ref name=\"special features-stories\">Special Features, \"Six Stories from Star Trek VI\".</ref>\n\nEidelman's previous project had been creating a compilation of music from the past five ''Star Trek'' films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. \"[The compilation] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do [[James Horner]] [composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock''] as well as James Horner,\" he said.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\">Schweiger, 9.</ref> Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, and he was able to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\" />\n\nEidelman stated that he finds science fiction the most interesting and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old ''Star Trek'' themes.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for \"[[to be, or not to be]]\" (\"''taH pagh, taHbe''\") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme was designed to be an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the ''Enterprise'', aimed at capturing \"the emotional gleam in the captain's eye\".<ref name=\"schweiger-10\">Schweiger, 10.</ref> Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: \"It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him.\"<ref name=\"altman-46\">Altman, 46.</ref> For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.<ref name=\"special features-stories\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\n\n====''Star Trek Generations'' (1994)====\n[[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], a composer who had worked on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', was given the task of composing for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. Critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. His opening music was an ethereal choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the ''Enterprise''-B, McCarthy used low brass chords and touches. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a touch verboten during ''The Next Generation''), while the scene ends with a dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the ''Enterprise''. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. The film's only distinct theme, a broad fanfare, first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. The theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s first season, notes from the theme for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', and [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic ''Star Trek'' fanfare.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\n====''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996)====\nFilm composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]] scored ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'', his third ''Star Trek'' feature. Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic [[Theme from Star Trek|''Star Trek'' fanfare]].<ref name=\"norman\"/> Instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore the Borg, Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity's hopeful first contact. The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' score, which is used in ''First Contact'' as a friendship theme and general thematic link.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155\u2013156}} A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous ''Star Trek'' scores, including his theme from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"norman\">Norman.</ref> The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf.<ref name=\"larson\"/>\n\nBecause of delays with Paramount's ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'', the already-short four week production schedule was cut to just three weeks. While Berman was concerned about the move,<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|158}} Goldsmith hired his son, [[Joel Goldsmith|Joel]], to assist.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155}} The young composer provided additional music for the film, writing three cues based on his father's motifs<ref name=\"larson\">Larson.</ref> and a total of 22&nbsp;minutes of music.<ref name=\"norman\"/>  Joel used variations of his father's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand-to-hand<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}} (Joel said that he and his father decided to use the theme for Worf separately).<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|159}} When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them, Joel wrote what critic [[Jeff Bond]] termed \"almost [[Aaron Copland|Coplandesque]]\" material of tuning strings and clarinet, but the cue was unused. While Joel composed many of the film's action cues, his father contributed to the spacewalk and ''Phoenix'' flight sequences. During the fight on the deflector dish, Goldsmith used low-register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent, dissonant strings.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}}\n\nIn a break with ''Star Trek'' film tradition, the soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs: [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Ooby Dooby\" and [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]'s \"Magic Carpet Ride\". [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] president Neil Norman explained that the decision to include the tracks was controversial, but said that \"Frakes did the most amazing job of integrating those songs into the story that we had to use them\".<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\"/>\n\nGNP released the ''First Contact'' soundtrack on December 2, 1996.<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\">{{cite news|author=Sprague, David|date=1996-12-14|title=Nothing like the reel thing; Soundtrack and film score news|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The album contained 51&nbsp;minutes of music, with 35&nbsp;minutes of Jerry Goldsmith's score, 10&nbsp;minutes of additional music by Joel Goldsmith, \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Magic Carpet Ride\".

''Insurrection'' opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, also introducing a six-note motif used in many of the film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme, repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to slow time uses a variation of this music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\nGoldsmith approached starship sequences with quick bursts of brass music. While observers are watching the Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith employed a \"spying theme\". Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, choosing to score the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist (suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related.) The film's climax is scored with the action material, balanced by \"sense of wonder\" music similar to cues from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\n====''Star Trek: Nemesis'' (2002)====\n{{Main|Star Trek: Nemesis (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe music to ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis|Nemesis]]'' was the final ''Star Trek'' score and penultimate film score composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] before his death in 2004 (not including his music for the 2003 film ''[[Timeline (2003 film)|Timeline]]'', which was rejected due to a complicated post-production process).  The score opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, but quickly transitions into a much darker theme to accompany the conflict between the Reman and Romulan empires.  Goldsmith also composed a new 5-note theme to accompany the character [[Shinzon]] and the ''Scimitar'', which is manipulated throughout the score to reflect the multiple dimensions of the character.  Goldsmith also incorporated a number of zipping, swooshing synthesizers into the conventional orchestra to illustrate the suspenseful and horrific elements of the story.  The score is book-ended with Goldsmith's theme from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', following a brief excerpt from the popular 1929 song \"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]\" by [[Irving Berlin]].<ref>Clemmensen, Christian.

Instead Horner adapted the opening fanfare of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme. \"The fanfare draws you in immediately\u2014you know you're going to get a good movie,\" Horner said.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nIn comparison to the flowing main theme, Khan's [[leitmotif]] was designed as a percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity.<ref name=\"anderson-72\"/> The seven-note brass theme was [[echoplex]]ed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until ''Reliant''{{'}}s attack on the ''Enterprise''. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from ''Wolfen'', in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.

Much like the content of the film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film. When writing music for ''The Wrath of Khan'', Horner was aware he would reuse certain cues for an impending sequel; two major themes he reworked were for Genesis and Spock. While the Genesis theme supplants the title music Horner wrote for ''The Wrath of Khan'', the end credits were quoted \"almost verbatim\".<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\">Simak.</ref>\n\nIn hours-long discussions with Bennett and Nimoy, Horner agreed with the director that the \"romantic and more sensitive\" cues were more important than the \"bombastic\" ones.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> Horner had written Spock's theme to give the character more dimension: \"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks,\" he said.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anderson, Kay|year=1982|title='Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan': How the TV series became a hit movie, at last|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=12|issue=5\u20136|pages=72|issn=0145-6032}}</ref> The theme was expanded  in ''The Search for Spock'' to represent the ancient alien mysticism and culture of Spock and Vulcan.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/>\n\nAmong the new cues Horner wrote was a \"percussive and atonal\" theme for the Klingons which is represented heavily in the film.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> [[Jeff Bond]] described the cue as a compromise between music from Horner's earlier film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'', Khan's motif from ''The Wrath of Khan'', and [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s Klingon music from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|113}} Horner also adapted music from [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' for part of the ''Enterprise'' theft sequence and its destruction, while the scoring to Spock's resurrection on Vulcan draws similarities to Horner's ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' ending.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|114}}\n\n====''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986)====\n[[James Horner]], composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock'', declined to return for ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]''. Because of this Nimoy turned to his friend [[Leonard Rosenman]], who had written the music to, among other films, ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and three ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' sequels.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}}<ref name=\"breyer\">Breyer.</ref> Rosenman wrote an arrangement of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme as the title music for ''The Voyage Home'', but Nimoy suggested that he write his own instead. As music critic [[Jeff Bond]] writes, \"The final result was one of the most unusual ''Star Trek'' movie themes,\" consisting of a six note theme and variations set against a repetitious four note brass motif; the theme's bridge is reminiscent of material in Rosenman's \"Frodo March\" for ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|119}} The melody makes appearances in the beginning of the film at Vulcan as well as when Taylor seeks Kirk's help finding her whales.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe Earth-based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles. Nimoy intended the crew's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of [[George Gershwin]], but Rosenman changed the director's mind<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|131}} and the scene was scored with a contemporary [[jazz fusion]] piece by [[Yellowjackets]]. When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier, Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporated classical Russian compositions, while the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style. More familiar Rosenman compositions included the action music as the Bird of Prey and a whaling ship face off in open water, while the whale's communication with the probe used atmospheric music reminiscent of the composer's work in ''Fantastic Voyage''. After the probe leaves, the music turns into a [[Vivaldi]]esque \"whale fugue\". The first sighting of the ''Enterprise''-A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end title music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\n[[Mark Mangini]] served as ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s sound designer. He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to ''Star Trek'' had already been established\u2014the Bird of Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.\u2014Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those created by the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived close to [[Roger Payne]], a biologist who had many recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest a sort of language and conversation. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had some difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a [[puppet show]] to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after 18 attempts, the [[sound designer]] finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like, and recorded Nimoy's response. Nimoy's voice was distorted with \"just the tiniest bit of dressing\" and used as the final sound.<ref name=\"special features-abovetheline\">Special features, \"Below-the-Line: Sound Design\".</ref>\n\nThe punk music that blares during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the audio to be added to the scene would be \"[[Duran Duran]], or whoever\" and not \"raw\" and authentic punk.<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\">{{cite web|author=Plume, Kenneth|date=2000-02-10|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035854p1.html|title=Interview with Kirk Thatcher (Part 1 of 2)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two [[Audio engineer|sound editors]] (who were in punk bands) to create their own music.

Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound, so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the entire band in one take using cheap microphones to create the distorted sound intended.<ref name=\"special features-onlocation\">Special features: \"On Location\".</ref> The song was later used for Paramount's \"[[Back to the Beach]]\".<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\"/>\n\n====''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' (1989)====\nMusic critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that Shatner made \"at least two wise decisions\" in making ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier|The Final Frontier]]''; he chose [[Laurence Luckinbill]] to play the role of Sybok, and he hired [[Jerry Goldsmith]] to compose the film's score. Goldsmith had written the Academy Award-nominated score for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', and the new ''Trek'' film was an opportunity to craft music with a similar level of ambition while adding action and character\u2014two elements largely missing from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nGoldsmith's main theme begins with the traditional opening notes from [[Alexander Courage]]'s original television series theme; an ascending string and electronic bridge leads to a rendition of the march from ''The Motion Picture''. According to Jeff Bond, Goldsmith's use of ''The Motion Picture''{{'}}s march led to some confusion among ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' fans, as they were unfamiliar with the music's origins and believed that Goldsmith was stealing the theme to ''The Next Generation'', which was itself ''The Motion Picture'' march.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} Another theme from ''The Motion Picture'' that makes a return appearance is the Klingon theme from the 1979 film's opening scene. Here, the theme is treated in what Bond termed a \"Prokofiev-like style as opposed to the avant-garde counterpoint\" as seen in ''The Motion Picture''. Goldsmith also added a crying ram's horn.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nThe breadth of ''The Final Frontier''{{'}}s locations led Goldsmith to eschew the two-themed approach of ''The Motion Picture'' in favor of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring music used for locations and characters. Sybok is introduced with a synthesized motif in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock discuss him en route to Nimbus III it is rendered in a more mysterious fashion. The motif also appears in the action cue as Kirk and company land on Nimbus III and try to free the hostages.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|133}} When Sybok boards the ''Enterprise'', a new four-note motif played by low brass highlights the character's obsession. The Sybok theme from then on is used in either a benevolent sense or a more percussive, dark rendition. Arriving at Sha-ka-ree, the planet's five-note theme bears resemblance to Goldsmith's unicorn theme from ''Legend''; \"...the two melodies represent very similar ideas: lost innocence and the tragic impossibility of recapturing paradise,\" writes Bond. The music features cellos conveying a pious quality, while the appearance of \"God\" begins with string glissandos but turns to a dark rendition of Sybok's theme as its true nature is exposed.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|134}} As the creature attacks Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more aggressive Sybok theme takes on an attacking rhythm. When Spock appeals to the Klingons for help, the theme takes on a sensitive character before returning to a powerful sequence as the ship destroys the god-creature.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|135}}\n\n====''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991)====\nDirector Nicholas Meyer's original plan for the score of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|The Undiscovered Country]]'' was to adapt [[Gustav Holst]]'s orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]''. The plan proved unfeasibly expensive, so Meyer began listening to demo tapes submitted by composers.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |titlelink=|year=1991 |chapter=Director's notes |url= |first=Nicholas |last= Meyer|authorlink= Nicholas Meyer|pages= 2\u20133|type= |publisher=Famous Music Corporation |id= |location= }}</ref> Meyer described most of the demos as generic \"movie music\", but was intrigued by one tape by a young composer named [[Cliff Eidelman]]. Eidelman, then 26, had made a career in composing for ballets, television, and film, but despite work on fourteen features, no film had been the hit needed to propel Eidelman to greater fame.<ref>Schweiger, 8.</ref>\n\nIn conversations with Eidelman, Meyer mentioned that since the marches that accompanied the main titles for other ''Star Trek'' films were so good, he had no desire to compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'' as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision.<ref name=\"linernotes-meyer1\"/> Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of [[Bernard Herrmann]]; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.<ref name=\"special features-stories\">Special Features, \"Six Stories from Star Trek VI\".</ref>\n\nEidelman's previous project had been creating a compilation of music from the past five ''Star Trek'' films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. \"[The compilation] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do [[James Horner]] [composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock''] as well as James Horner,\" he said.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\">Schweiger, 9.</ref> Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, and he was able to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.<ref name=\"schweiger-9\" />\n\nEidelman stated that he finds science fiction the most interesting and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old ''Star Trek'' themes.<ref name=\"special features-stories\"/> Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for \"[[to be, or not to be]]\" (\"''taH pagh, taHbe''\") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme was designed to be an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the ''Enterprise'', aimed at capturing \"the emotional gleam in the captain's eye\".<ref name=\"schweiger-10\">Schweiger, 10.</ref> Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: \"It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him.\"<ref name=\"altman-46\">Altman, 46.</ref> For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.<ref name=\"special features-stories\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\n\n====''Star Trek Generations'' (1994)====\n[[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], a composer who had worked on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', was given the task of composing for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. Critic [[Jeff Bond]] wrote that while McCarthy's score was \"tasked with straddling the styles of both series\", it also offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. His opening music was an ethereal choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the ''Enterprise''-B, McCarthy used low brass chords and touches. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a touch verboten during ''The Next Generation''), while the scene ends with a dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the ''Enterprise''. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. The film's only distinct theme, a broad fanfare, first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. The theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s first season, notes from the theme for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', and [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic ''Star Trek'' fanfare.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\n====''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996)====\nFilm composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]] scored ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'', his third ''Star Trek'' feature. Goldsmith wrote a sweeping main title which begins with [[Alexander Courage]]'s classic [[Theme from Star Trek|''Star Trek'' fanfare]].<ref name=\"norman\"/> Instead of composing a menacing theme to underscore the Borg, Goldsmith wrote a pastoral theme linked to humanity's hopeful first contact. The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' score, which is used in ''First Contact'' as a friendship theme and general thematic link.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155\u2013156}} A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous ''Star Trek'' scores, including his theme from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"norman\">Norman.</ref> The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf.<ref name=\"larson\"/>\n\nBecause of delays with Paramount's ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'', the already-short four week production schedule was cut to just three weeks. While Berman was concerned about the move,<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|158}} Goldsmith hired his son, [[Joel Goldsmith|Joel]], to assist.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|155}} The young composer provided additional music for the film, writing three cues based on his father's motifs<ref name=\"larson\">Larson.</ref> and a total of 22&nbsp;minutes of music.<ref name=\"norman\"/>  Joel used variations of his father's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand-to-hand<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}} (Joel said that he and his father decided to use the theme for Worf separately).<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|159}} When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them, Joel wrote what critic [[Jeff Bond]] termed \"almost [[Aaron Copland|Coplandesque]]\" material of tuning strings and clarinet, but the cue was unused. While Joel composed many of the film's action cues, his father contributed to the spacewalk and ''Phoenix'' flight sequences. During the fight on the deflector dish, Goldsmith used low-register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent, dissonant strings.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|156}}\n\nIn a break with ''Star Trek'' film tradition, the soundtrack incorporated two licensed songs: [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Ooby Dooby\" and [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]'s \"Magic Carpet Ride\". [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] president Neil Norman explained that the decision to include the tracks was controversial, but said that \"Frakes did the most amazing job of integrating those songs into the story that we had to use them\".<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\"/>\n\nGNP released the ''First Contact'' soundtrack on December 2, 1996.<ref name=\"billboard-sprague nothing like the reel thing\">{{cite news|author=Sprague, David|date=1996-12-14|title=Nothing like the reel thing; Soundtrack and film score news|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The album contained 51&nbsp;minutes of music, with 35&nbsp;minutes of Jerry Goldsmith's score, 10&nbsp;minutes of additional music by Joel Goldsmith, \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Magic Carpet Ride\".

''Insurrection'' opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, also introducing a six-note motif used in many of the film's action sequences. The Ba'ku are scored with a pastoral theme, repeating harps, string sections and a woodwind solo. The Ba'ku's ability to slow time uses a variation of this music.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\nGoldsmith approached starship sequences with quick bursts of brass music. While observers are watching the Ba'ku unseen, Goldsmith employed a \"spying theme\". Composed of a piano, timpani percussion, and brass, the theme builds until interrupted by the action theme as Data opens fire. Goldsmith did not write a motif for the Son'a, choosing to score the action sequence without designating the Son'a as an antagonist (suggesting the film's revelation that the Son'a and Ba'ku are related.) The film's climax is scored with the action material, balanced by \"sense of wonder\" music similar to cues from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"bond\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\n====''Star Trek: Nemesis'' (2002)====\n{{Main|Star Trek: Nemesis (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe music to ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis|Nemesis]]'' was the final ''Star Trek'' score and penultimate film score composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] before his death in 2004 (not including his music for the 2003 film ''[[Timeline (2003 film)|Timeline]]'', which was rejected due to a complicated post-production process).  The score opens with [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare, but quickly transitions into a much darker theme to accompany the conflict between the Reman and Romulan empires.  Goldsmith also composed a new 5-note theme to accompany the character [[Shinzon]] and the ''Scimitar'', which is manipulated throughout the score to reflect the multiple dimensions of the character.  Goldsmith also incorporated a number of zipping, swooshing synthesizers into the conventional orchestra to illustrate the suspenseful and horrific elements of the story.  The score is book-ended with Goldsmith's theme from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', following a brief excerpt from the popular 1929 song \"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]\" by [[Irving Berlin]].<ref>Clemmensen, Christian.

A third track, \"[[The Cuckoo (song)|The Cuckoo]]\", was one of six songs included on a promotional CD distributed in U.S. retail markets in association with the official release of Dylan's memoir, ''[[Chronicles: Volume One|Chronicles, Volume 1]]'' in 2004.\n\n==Songs==\n''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' captures early performances of three different Dylan compositions: \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall|A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall]]\" (often referred to as \"Hard Rain\"), \"[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]\", and \"John Brown\". Both \"Hard Rain\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" would eventually appear on Dylan's second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]\",'' in May 1963. Around the same time, a studio version of \"John Brown\" was included on the [[Folkways Records]] compilation ''[https://folkways.si.edu/broadside-ballads-vol-1/american-folk-struggle-protest/music/album/smithsonian Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1]'' in February 1963, but it would not be released on any of Dylan's subsequent studio albums (much later the song would re-appear as a live performance on Dylan's 1995 ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' album.)\n\n\"Rocks and Gravel\", also credited as a Bob Dylan composition, is Dylan's own adaptation of [[Brownie McGhee]]'s \"Solid Road\" and [[Leroy Carr]]'s \"Alabama Woman\", an arrangement that fuses both songs into one. It was originally slated to appear on Dylan's second album (and later appeared on test pressings made for a preliminary version of the LP), but when Dylan reconfigured ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'', he omitted \"Rocks And Gravel\" from the final album sequence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=specifics regarding song adaptation, history unsupported}}\n\n\nThe remaining songs on ''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' show off the young Dylan\u2019s broad already-broad knowledge of traditional folk songs. These include, among others, \u201c[[The Cuckoo (song)|The Cuckoo]]\u201d, which was recorded as early as the 1920\u2019s by western North Carolina banjo musician Clarence Ashley; \u201c[[The Moonshiner|Moonshiner]]\u201d, a traditional song that had also been performed by Irish folksters [[The Clancy Brothers]] (playing together with [[Pete Seeger]]) as well as by Appalachian folk singer [[Roscoe Holcomb]]; and \u201c[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]\u201d LINK, described by music historian Dave Marsh as \u201cthe most widespread folk song in the English language.\u201d<ref>Wilentz, S., & Marcus, G., Editors (2005).

After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival.

After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival.

Pitted against Holmes after just ten pro bouts (all victories), Frazier's camp touted his speed and youth as significant advantages over the champion. During the first minute of the fight Frazier dropped his hands to his sides and playfully moved his head back and forth, taunting Holmes: ill-advised behavior against an experienced veteran. Just 2:06 in, Holmes floored Frazier with a long right hand, knocking him down; Marvis took an eight-count and got back up. Dazed by the blow, Frazier was a sitting target and Holmes followed up, appealing for the referee to step in as he pummelled the younger man on the ropes. Finally, the referee stopped the bout with just a few seconds left in the first round, awarding Holmes a [[technical knockout]]. Many in the sports press criticized father/trainer [[Joe Frazier]] for changing his son's style from that of an out-fighter (which brought Marvis success as an amateur) to an in-fighter, which many thought did not suit Marvis.\n\nAfter his loss to Holmes, Frazier continued to fight and won his next six bouts, including victories over future world cruiserweight champion [[Bernard Benton]], heavyweight contenders Jose Ribalta and [[James Tillis|James \"Quick\" Tillis]], and future champion [[James Smith (boxer)|James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith]]. With the exception of a first-round knockout in his first fight after losing to Holmes, all of Frazier's fights went the full ten round distance with him winning unanimous or [[majority decision]]s in each fight.\n\nThis set up the fight with the 24\u20130 Tyson, which was broadcast live from the [[Glens Falls Civic Center]] in [[Glens Falls, New York]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Frazier quickly proved to be no match for the future champion as Tyson came out firing. Fifteen seconds into the fight, Tyson scored with a huge uppercut that knocked Frazier senseless and hit him with a combination as Frazier slumped to the canvas unconscious. Referee [[Joe Cortez]] started to count while looking at Frazier, but immediately waved off the fight once he saw that Frazier was out cold. The bout only lasted thirty seconds, which proved to be Tyson's quickest knockout of his career.\n\nRecalling the fight in later years, Marvis Frazier conceded that he had underestimated the young Mike Tyson, who had not yet won the first of his world titles. \"Tyson was just another guy who was going to be a statistic. Yeah, that's what I thought. I threw a jab and that's all I remember.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/123935-marvis-frazier-never-won-title-but-has-no-regrets|title=Marvis Frazier never won title but has no regrets|newspaper=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]|author=Dettloff, William|date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter Tyson, Frazier did not fight for a title again. After nearly a year away from the ring following the loss to Tyson, Frazier returned to fight twice in two months, winning both of his bouts over journeymen fighters. He won his final fight against Phillipp Brown in 1988, retiring with a career record of 19\u20132.\n\n==Retirement and later life==\nAfter retiring from boxing, he became an ordained minister and

son of former heavyweight champion and Hall of Famer, [[Joe Frazier]]. Marvis was at ringside for all of his father's fights after the second [[Oscar Bonavena]] bout in December 1968, including the great battles with [[Muhammad Ali]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99084418/ Ring links Frazier and son], ''Detroit Free Press'', April 20, 1979, p. 32.</ref> Marvis [[exhibition fight|exhibited]] four rounds with his father in [[Rochester, New York]], on December 3, 1976, and staged another exhibition in 1977.) His sister [[Jackie Frazier-Lyde]] was also a professional boxer, as was his brother Joe Frazier, Jr. (a.k.a. Hector Frazier). Marvis lived with his family in a 16-room stone split-level home in [[Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania|Whitemarsh]].<ref name=\"Ronberg\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/173073150/ Being Joe Frazier's son hasn't turned his head] by Gary Ronberg, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', August 8, 1978, 5-C.</ref>\n\nMarvis was involved in other sports, but finally gave it all up in favor of boxing, \"I played football and basketball and I wrestled, and I love them all, especially football. I was a running back. When I was in ninth grade, Duke and Temple talked to me about going there. But I fell so much in love with boxing. I gave up the other sports. Once I get into a sport. I dedicate myself to it. I don't believe in concentrating on more than one thing,\" Marvis Frazier said on his choice of boxing. He graduated from [[Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School]] in suburban Philadelphia<ref name=\"Pepe\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/483761624/ Second generation] by Phil Pepe, ''Daily News from New York'', April 9, 1979, p. 278.</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nMarvis was a highly touted prospect and among the top-ranked amateur heavyweights. He was the 1979 National Golden Gloves Heavyweight Champion and 1980 National AAU Heavyweight Champion.  He was coached partly by his father, and in part by [[George Benton|Georgie Benton]] and Val Colbert. \"My dad tried not to play too active a role in my career for fear of putting pressure on me,\" Marvis said.<ref name=\"AlbuquerqueJournal\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156245687/ Marvis Frazier Chases Gold] (AP,) ''Albuquerque Journal'', January 28, 1979, E-8.</ref><ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/436752059/ Frazier], ''The Boston Globe'', April 27, 1979, p. 77.</ref> Benton said that Marvis was a model kid. He grew up \"like he was poor\". According to Benton, \"there were no favors. When the grass on the Fraziers' two-and-a-half acre plot needed cutting, Marvis did it. With a hand mower. He goes to choir practice Monday nights, Bible study Wednesday nights and church on Sunday. He doesn't smoke, drink or run around.

Pitted against Holmes after just ten pro bouts (all victories), Frazier's camp touted his speed and youth as significant advantages over the champion. During the first minute of the fight Frazier dropped his hands to his sides and playfully moved his head back and forth, taunting Holmes: ill-advised behavior against an experienced veteran. Just 2:06 in, Holmes floored Frazier with a long right hand, knocking him down; Marvis took an eight-count and got back up. Dazed by the blow, Frazier was a sitting target and Holmes followed up, appealing for the referee to step in as he pummelled the younger man on the ropes. Finally, the referee stopped the bout with just a few seconds left in the first round, awarding Holmes a [[technical knockout]]. Many in the sports press criticized father/trainer [[Joe Frazier]] for changing his son's style from that of an out-fighter (which brought Marvis success as an amateur) to an in-fighter, which many thought did not suit Marvis.\n\nAfter his loss to Holmes, Frazier continued to fight and won his next six bouts, including victories over future world cruiserweight champion [[Bernard Benton]], heavyweight contenders Jose Ribalta and [[James Tillis|James \"Quick\" Tillis]], and future champion [[James Smith (boxer)|James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith]]. With the exception of a first-round knockout in his first fight after losing to Holmes, all of Frazier's fights went the full ten round distance with him winning unanimous or [[majority decision]]s in each fight.\n\nThis set up the fight with the 24\u20130 Tyson, which was broadcast live from the [[Glens Falls Civic Center]] in [[Glens Falls, New York]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Frazier quickly proved to be no match for the future champion as Tyson came out firing. Fifteen seconds into the fight, Tyson scored with a huge uppercut that knocked Frazier senseless and hit him with a combination as Frazier slumped to the canvas unconscious. Referee [[Joe Cortez]] started to count while looking at Frazier, but immediately waved off the fight once he saw that Frazier was out cold. The bout only lasted thirty seconds, which proved to be Tyson's quickest knockout of his career.\n\nRecalling the fight in later years, Marvis Frazier conceded that he had underestimated the young Mike Tyson, who had not yet won the first of his world titles. \"Tyson was just another guy who was going to be a statistic. Yeah, that's what I thought. I threw a jab and that's all I remember.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/123935-marvis-frazier-never-won-title-but-has-no-regrets|title=Marvis Frazier never won title but has no regrets|newspaper=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]|author=Dettloff, William|date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter Tyson, Frazier did not fight for a title again. After nearly a year away from the ring following the loss to Tyson, Frazier returned to fight twice in two months, winning both of his bouts over journeymen fighters. He won his final fight against Phillipp Brown in 1988, retiring with a career record of 19\u20132.\n\n==Retirement and later life==\nAfter retiring from boxing, he became an ordained minister and active participant in [[Prison Fellowship Ministries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.operationstartingline.net/Bio.asp?ID%3D2327 |editor=Jones, Brent |date=April 19, 2007 |title='Smokin' Joe' Frazier dropping suit against daughter |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014055858/http://www.operationstartingline.net/Bio.asp?ID=2327 |archivedate=October 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 Marvis completed his autobiography, ''Meet Marvis Frazier: The Story of the Son of Smokin' Joe'', with co-author Jamie Potter.\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{s-start}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=8|'''19 Wins''' (8 knockouts, 11 decisions), '''2 Losses''' (2 knockouts)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid;

{"title_page": "Stud welding", "text_new": "[[File:Slab base weld nut.png|thumb|Slab base weld nuts]]\n{{More footnotes|date=January 2010}}\n\n'''Stud welding''' is a technique similar to [[flash welding]] where a fastener or specially formed [[nut (hardware)|nut]] is welded onto another metal part, typically a base metal or substrate. The fastener can take different forms, but typically fall under threaded, unthreaded, or tapped. The bolts may be automatically fed into the stud welder. Weld nuts generally have a flange with small nubs that melt to form the weld. ''Weld studs'' are used in stud welding systems. Manufacturers create weld studs for the two main forms of stud welding: capacitor discharge stud welding and drawn arc stud welding\n\n== Drawn Arc Stud Welding ==\nDrawn arc stud welding process joins a stud and another piece of metal together by heating both parts with an arc. The stud is usually joined to a flat plate by using the stud as one of the [[electrodes]]. The [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] used in stud welding depends on the type of metal being used. Welding aluminium, for example, would usually require direct-current electrode positive (DCEP). Welding steel would require direct-current electrode negative (DCEN).<ref>Manufacturing Engineering and Technology 6th Edition by Serope Kalpakjian and Steven R. Schmid Page 912</ref>\n\nStud welding uses a flux tip to aid in welding and a ferrule, a ceramic ring which concentrates the heat generated, prevents oxidation and retains the molten metal in the weld zone. The ferrule is broken off of the fastener after the weld is completed. This lack of marring on the side opposite the fastener is what differentiates stud welding from other fastening processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imageindustries.com/studwelding/|title=Stud Welding 101|last1=Image Industries}}</ref>\n\n=== Drawn Arc Welding Studs ===\nDrawn arc studs range from a #8 to 1{{frac|1|4}}\" diameter.

This method can tolerate welding studs to thinner sheet metals than the drawn arc process, though it doesn't achieve welds that are as strong or penetrative. It also doesn't require the use of ceramic ferrules. Sometimes operators using this process use shrouding gas to reduce spatter.\n\n== Capacitor Discharge Stud Welding ==\nA type of stud welding called capacitor discharge stud welding differs from drawn arc stud welding in that capacitor discharge welding does not require flux. The weld time is shorter, enabling the weld to bond with little [[Redox|oxidation]] and no need for heat concentration. It also allows for small-diameter studs to be welded to thin, lightweight materials.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Image Industries|title=Capacitative Discharge (CD) Welding Process|url=http://www.imageindustries.com/welding-processes/capacitative-discharge-welding-process/}}</ref> This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge stud welding with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn through showing on the opposite side of very thin metals. CD stud welding is often used for smaller diameter studs and pins, as well as on non-standard materials and for accuracy. On the other hand, drawn arc stud welding is primarily for structural purposes and larger diameter weld studs.\n\n=== Capacitor Discharge Weld Studs ===\nCapacitor discharge weld studs range from 14 gauge to 3/8\" diameter. They can come in many different lengths, ranging from 1/4\" to 5\" and larger. They are usually manufactured from mild or stainless steel, brass, aluminium, and aluminium alloy. The tip on the weld end of the stud serves a twofold purpose:\n\n# It acts as a timing device to keep the stud off the base material\n# It disintegrates when the trigger is pulled on the gun.\nWhen the tip disintegrates, it melts and helps solidify the weld to the base material.\n\n== Automated and Robotic Stud Welding ==\nPortable stud welding machines are available. Welders can also be automated, with controls for arcing and applying pressure. [[Numerical control|CNC]] stud welding machines can increase the speed and accuracy of manufacturing and construction work. Stud welding is very versatile; typical applications include automobile bodies, electrical panels, shipbuilding and building construction.

He is also regarded, by [[Formula 1]] and FIA Formula 2 fans alike, to be the slowest and most reckless driver in Formula 2, sometimes being seconds behind pole position, and occasionally even slower than [[FIA Formula 3 Championship]] cars. He was notorious for racking up numerous penalties in the 2019 season.\n\n==Career==\n\nRaghunathan started his racing career in karting in 2011, where he remained active until 2013. He also made his Formula racing debut in 2012, in four races of the [[JK Racing Asia Series]] for the Meco Racing team.\n\nIn 2013, Raghunathan competed in the [[MRF Challenge]] Formula 1600, finishing sixth. He also took part in the final race weekend of the [[2013 Formula Masters China|Formula Masters China]] series at the [[Shanghai International Circuit]] for the [[KC Motorgroup|Cebu Pacific Air by KCMG]] team, finishing the races in 14th, 15th and 12th respectively.\n\nIn 2014 Raghunathan moved to the new [[Italian F4 Championship]], debuting on the second race weekend for the [[Target Racing|F & M]] team. With four sixth places at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] and [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] as best results, he finished twelfth in the championship with 45 points.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, Raghunathan took part in the final race weekend of the [[2014\u201315 MRF Challenge Formula 2000 Championship|MRF Challenge Formula 2000]] series at the [[Madras Motor Race Track]]. He then returned to Europe to take part in the [[2015 FIA Formula 3 European Championship|European Formula 3 Championship]] for the [[Motopark Academy|Motopark]] team. With a 20th place at the [[Norisring]] as his best result, he finished 39th in the standings with zero points. Raghunathan took part in the official [[GP3 Series|GP3]] post season test with the [[Campos Racing|Campos]] and [[Trident Racing|Trident]] teams, in preparation for the [[2016 GP3 Series]]. He also tested with the Coloni Motorsport team in Auto GP.\n\nIn 2016, Raghunathan raced in the [[Auto GP]] championship with Italian team PS Racing, securing nine podium finishes. In the same year, he also raced in the [[BOSS GP]] series in the Formula Class and secured two podiums.\n\nIn 2017, he continued racing in the BOSS GP-Formula Class Championship with Italian team Coloni Racing. He won 13 podiums out of 14 races, scoring three wins, and ending the season as champion. He is the first Indian to win the BOSS GP Championship.\n\nIn 2019, Raghunathan raced in the [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]] for [[MP Motorsport]]. Raghunathan's F2 season was marred by a string of penalties and poor results, whilst being on average over 4.5 seconds off the pole-position time at the first five rounds and even occasionally running slower than [[FIA Formula 3 Championship|Formula 3]] drivers in inferior machinery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wtf1.com/post/f2-driver-raghunathan-was-given-a-penalty-in-bahrain-for-doing-too-many-laps/|title=F2 Driver Raghunathan Was Given A Penalty In Bahrain For Doing Too Many Laps|last=Thorn|first=Dan|date=1 April 2019|website=WTF1|language=en|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> He was subsequently suspended for [[2019 Red Bull Ring FIA Formula 2 round|the Austrian round]] based on the accumulation of penalty points, including picking up 9 points for infringements under all 3 [[Safety_car#Virtual_safety_car_(VSC)|Virtual Safety Car]] procedures in the Feature Race in [[2019 Paul Ricard FIA Formula 2 round|France]] and taking him over the 12 required for a ban, having previously been reprimanded for passing the chequered flag twice at the opening round in [[2019 Bahrain FIA Formula 2 round|Bahrain]] and colliding with [[Jack Aitken]] in [[2019 Monaco FIA Formula 2 round|Monaco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiaformula2.com/News-Room/News/2019/06_June/Round-5-post-Feature-Race-penalties/|title=Round 5 post-Feature Race penalties - Formula 2|website=www.fiaformula2.com|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref>. He couldn't make a u turn and his race engineer later told him \"You have to turn the steering wheel\". He returned to the seat for [[2019 Silverstone FIA Formula 2 round|the Silverstone round]], continuing to run around at the back of the field. Both Raghunathan and his team-mate [[Jordan King]] were reprimanded for failing to slow for yellow flags in qualifying at [[2019 Spa-Francorchamps FIA Formula 2 round|Spa-Francorchamps]]. A reduced field at the following round in [[2019 Monza FIA Formula 2 round|Italy]] led to his only point of the season, but was once again penalised in [[2019 Sochi FIA Formula 2 round|Sochi]] for not following track-limit procedures. Failure to follow practice start procedure at the final round in [[2019 Yas Marina FIA Formula 2 round|United Arab Emirates]] saw him rack up enough penalty points for a second event ban, but competed in the event anyway due to a loophole in the rules.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/29/f2-mahaveer-raghunathan-second-ban-2019/|title=Raghunathan has enough penalty points for second ban of 2019 after \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d error|publisher=racefans.net|date=29 November 2019}}</ref> He finished the season 20th in the standings.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!Season\n!Series\n!Team\n!Races\n!Wins\n!Poles\n!F/Laps\n!Podiums\n!Points\n!Position\n|-\n! 2012\n|align=left| [[2012 JK Racing Asia Series season|JK Racing Asia Series]]\n|align=left| Meco Racing\n| 4\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| NC\u2020\n|-\n!rowspan=2| 2013\n|align=left| [[MRF Challenge|MRF Challenge Formula 1600]]\n|align=left| [[MRF Racing]]\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| 6th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2013 Formula Masters China|Formula Masters China]]\n|align=left| [[KC Motorgroup|Cebu Pacific Air by KCMG]]\n| 3\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 21st\n|-\n! 2014\n|align=left| [[2014 Italian F4 Championship|Italian F4 Championship]]\n|align=left| [[Target Racing|F & M]]\n| 18\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 45\n| 12th\n|-\n! 2014-15\n|align=left| [[2014-15 MRF Challenge Formula 2000 Championship|MRF Challenge Formula 2000]]\n|align=left| [[MRF Racing]]\n| 3\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 5\n| 21st\n|-\n!rowspan=4| 2015\n|align=left| [[2015 FIA Formula 3 European Championship|FIA Formula 3 European Championship]]\n|align=left rowspan=2| [[Motopark]]\n| 26\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 39th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2015 Masters of Formula 3|Masters of Formula 3]]\n| 1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 17th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2015 Euroformula Open Championship|Euroformula Open Championship]]\n|align=left| [[Team West-Tec|Motul Team West-Tec F3]]\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| NC\u2020\n|-\n|align=left| [[2015 Formula Renault 2.0 Alps Series|Formula Renault 2.0 Alps]]\n|align=left| [[Cram Motorsport]]\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| NC\u2020\n|-\n!rowspan=3| 2016\n|align=left| [[2016 Auto GP Formula Open Championship|Auto GP]]\n|align=left rowspan=2| PS Racing\n| 10\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 2\n| 151\n|style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\"| '''2nd'''\n|-\n|align=left| [[2016 BOSS GP Series|BOSS GP Series - Formula Class]]\n| 8\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 2\n| 118\n| 5th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2016 GP3 Series|GP3 Series]]\n|align=left| [[Koiranen GP]]\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 27th\n|-\n! 2017\n|align=left| [[2017 BOSS GP Series|BOSS GP Series - Formula Class]]\n|align=left| PS Racing\n| 14\n| 3\n| 4\n| 1\n| 13\n| 263\n|style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| '''1st'''\n|-\n! 2018\n|align=left| [[2018 Michelin Le Mans Cup|Michelin Le Mans Cup]]\n|align=left| [[United Autosports]]\n| 1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0.5\n| 46th\n|-\n! 2019\n|align=left| [[2019 FIA Formula 2 Championship|FIA Formula 2 Championship]]\n|align=left| [[MP Motorsport]]\n| 20\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 1\n| 20th\n|}\n<sup>\u2020</sup> As Raghunathan was a guest driver, he was ineligible for championship points\n<!--<sup>*</sup> Season still in progress.-->\n\n===Complete FIA Formula 3 European Championship results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position) (Races in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n!

He is also regarded, by [[Formula 1]] and FIA Formula 2 fans alike, to be the slowest and most reckless driver in Formula 2, sometimes being seconds behind pole position, and occasionally even slower than [[FIA Formula 3 Championship]] cars. He was notorious for racking up numerous penalties in the 2019 season.\n\n==Career==\n\nRaghunathan started his racing career in karting in 2011, where he remained active until 2013. He also made his Formula racing debut in 2012, in four races of the [[JK Racing Asia Series]] for the Meco Racing team.\n\nIn 2013, Raghunathan competed in the [[MRF Challenge]] Formula 1600, finishing sixth. He also took part in the final race weekend of the [[2013 Formula Masters China|Formula Masters China]] series at the [[Shanghai International Circuit]] for the [[KC Motorgroup|Cebu Pacific Air by KCMG]] team, finishing the races in 14th, 15th and 12th respectively.\n\nIn 2014 Raghunathan moved to the new [[Italian F4 Championship]], debuting on the second race weekend for the [[Target Racing|F & M]] team. With four sixth places at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] and [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] as best results, he finished twelfth in the championship with 45 points.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, Raghunathan took part in the final race weekend of the [[2014\u201315 MRF Challenge Formula 2000 Championship|MRF Challenge Formula 2000]] series at the [[Madras Motor Race Track]]. He then returned to Europe to take part in the [[2015 FIA Formula 3 European Championship|European Formula 3 Championship]] for the [[Motopark Academy|Motopark]] team. With a 20th place at the [[Norisring]] as his best result, he finished 39th in the standings with zero points. Raghunathan took part in the official [[GP3 Series|GP3]] post season test with the [[Campos Racing|Campos]] and [[Trident Racing|Trident]] teams, in preparation for the [[2016 GP3 Series]]. He also tested with the Coloni Motorsport team in Auto GP.\n\nIn 2016, Raghunathan raced in the [[Auto GP]] championship with Italian team PS Racing, securing nine podium finishes. In the same year, he also raced in the [[BOSS GP]] series in the Formula Class and secured two podiums.\n\nIn 2017, he continued racing in the BOSS GP-Formula Class Championship with Italian team Coloni Racing. He won 13 podiums out of 14 races, scoring three wins, and ending the season as champion. He is the first Indian to win the BOSS GP Championship.\n\nIn 2019, Raghunathan raced in the [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]] for [[MP Motorsport]]. Raghunathan's F2 season was marred by a string of penalties and poor results, whilst being on average over 4.5 seconds off the pole-position time at the first five rounds and even occasionally running slower than [[FIA Formula 3 Championship|Formula 3]] drivers in inferior machinery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wtf1.com/post/f2-driver-raghunathan-was-given-a-penalty-in-bahrain-for-doing-too-many-laps/|title=F2 Driver Raghunathan Was Given A Penalty In Bahrain For Doing Too Many Laps|last=Thorn|first=Dan|date=1 April 2019|website=WTF1|language=en|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> He was subsequently suspended for [[2019 Red Bull Ring FIA Formula 2 round|the Austrian round]] based on the accumulation of penalty points, including picking up 9 points for infringements under all 3 [[Safety_car#Virtual_safety_car_(VSC)|Virtual Safety Car]] procedures in the Feature Race in [[2019 Paul Ricard FIA Formula 2 round|France]] and taking him over the 12 required for a ban, having previously been reprimanded for passing the chequered flag twice at the opening round in [[2019 Bahrain FIA Formula 2 round|Bahrain]] and colliding with [[Jack Aitken]] in [[2019 Monaco FIA Formula 2 round|Monaco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiaformula2.com/News-Room/News/2019/06_June/Round-5-post-Feature-Race-penalties/|title=Round 5 post-Feature Race penalties - Formula 2|website=www.fiaformula2.com|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> He returned to the seat for [[2019 Silverstone FIA Formula 2 round|the Silverstone round]], continuing to run around at the back of the field. Both Raghunathan and his team-mate [[Jordan King]] were reprimanded for failing to slow for yellow flags in qualifying at [[2019 Spa-Francorchamps FIA Formula 2 round|Spa-Francorchamps]]. A reduced field at the following round in [[2019 Monza FIA Formula 2 round|Italy]] led to his only point of the season, but was once again penalised in [[2019 Sochi FIA Formula 2 round|Sochi]] for not following track-limit procedures. Failure to follow practice start procedure at the final round in [[2019 Yas Marina FIA Formula 2 round|United Arab Emirates]] saw him rack up enough penalty points for a second event ban, but competed in the event anyway due to a loophole in the rules.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/29/f2-mahaveer-raghunathan-second-ban-2019/|title=Raghunathan has enough penalty points for second ban of 2019 after \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d error|publisher=racefans.net|date=29 November 2019}}</ref> He finished the season 20th in the standings.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!Season\n!Series\n!Team\n!Races\n!Wins\n!Poles\n!F/Laps\n!Podiums\n!Points\n!Position\n|-\n! 2012\n|align=left| [[2012 JK Racing Asia Series season|JK Racing Asia Series]]\n|align=left| Meco Racing\n| 4\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| NC\u2020\n|-\n!rowspan=2| 2013\n|align=left| [[MRF Challenge|MRF Challenge Formula 1600]]\n|align=left| [[MRF Racing]]\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| ?\n| 6th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2013 Formula Masters China|Formula Masters China]]\n|align=left| [[KC Motorgroup|Cebu Pacific Air by KCMG]]\n| 3\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 21st\n|-\n! 2014\n|align=left| [[2014 Italian F4 Championship|Italian F4 Championship]]\n|align=left| [[Target Racing|F & M]]\n| 18\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 45\n| 12th\n|-\n! 2014-15\n|align=left| [[2014-15 MRF Challenge Formula 2000 Championship|MRF Challenge Formula 2000]]\n|align=left| [[MRF Racing]]\n| 3\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 5\n| 21st\n|-\n!rowspan=4| 2015\n|align=left| [[2015 FIA Formula 3 European Championship|FIA Formula 3 European Championship]]\n|align=left rowspan=2| [[Motopark]]\n| 26\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 39th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2015 Masters of Formula 3|Masters of Formula 3]]\n| 1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 17th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2015 Euroformula Open Championship|Euroformula Open Championship]]\n|align=left| [[Team West-Tec|Motul Team West-Tec F3]]\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| NC\u2020\n|-\n|align=left| [[2015 Formula Renault 2.0 Alps Series|Formula Renault 2.0 Alps]]\n|align=left| [[Cram Motorsport]]\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| NC\u2020\n|-\n!rowspan=3| 2016\n|align=left| [[2016 Auto GP Formula Open Championship|Auto GP]]\n|align=left rowspan=2| PS Racing\n| 10\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 2\n| 151\n|style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\"| '''2nd'''\n|-\n|align=left| [[2016 BOSS GP Series|BOSS GP Series - Formula Class]]\n| 8\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 2\n| 118\n| 5th\n|-\n|align=left| [[2016 GP3 Series|GP3 Series]]\n|align=left| [[Koiranen GP]]\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 27th\n|-\n! 2017\n|align=left| [[2017 BOSS GP Series|BOSS GP Series - Formula Class]]\n|align=left| PS Racing\n| 14\n| 3\n| 4\n| 1\n| 13\n| 263\n|style=\"background:#FFFFBF;\"| '''1st'''\n|-\n! 2018\n|align=left| [[2018 Michelin Le Mans Cup|Michelin Le Mans Cup]]\n|align=left| [[United Autosports]]\n| 1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0.5\n| 46th\n|-\n! 2019\n|align=left| [[2019 FIA Formula 2 Championship|FIA Formula 2 Championship]]\n|align=left| [[MP Motorsport]]\n| 20\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 1\n| 20th\n|}\n<sup>\u2020</sup> As Raghunathan was a guest driver, he was ineligible for championship points\n<!--<sup>*</sup> Season still in progress.-->\n\n===Complete FIA Formula 3 European Championship results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position) (Races in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n!
