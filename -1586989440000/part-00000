Due to the unusually protracted construction of ''Maine'', ''New York'' was actually the first armored cruiser to enter U.S. Navy service. The fourth Navy ship to be named in honor of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], she was later renamed '''''Saratoga''''' and then '''''Rochester'''''. With six 8-inch guns, she was the most heavily armed cruiser in the US Navy when commissioned.<ref name=Conways1>Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 147</ref><ref name=Register1>Bauer and Roberts, p. 133</ref>\n\nShe was laid down on 19 September 1890 by [[William Cramp & Sons]], [[Philadelphia]], launched on 2 December 1891, and sponsored by Miss Helen Clifford Page,<ref name=DANFS/> the daughter of J.

The belt was {{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep, of which {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} was below the [[waterline]]. It was {{convert|186|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, protecting only the machinery spaces.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Friedman1/> The armored deck was {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} thick on its sloped sides and {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the flat middle amidships, but only {{convert|2+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} at the ends.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Friedman1/> The original gun turrets had up to {{convert|5+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of armor, on {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[barbette]]s with {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} protecting the ammunition hoists.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Friedman1/> The open single 8-inch mounts on the sides were much less protected by {{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} partial barbettes, while the secondary gun [[sponson]]s had {{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The [[conning tower]] was {{convert|7+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Friedman1/> During construction, the builder reconfigured ''New York''{{'}}s boiler arrangement for tighter compartmentation.<ref name=Friedman1/>\n\n===Comparison with foreign ships===\n\n''New York'' was a fast armored cruiser with a powerful armament, but the belt armor was thin compared to the first generation of older, slow armored cruisers, which tended to have a thick but narrow-coverage (waterline) belt. The thin side armor was comparable to that of the groundbreaking French armored cruiser {{Ship|French armoured cruiser|Dupuy de L\u00f4me|1890|2}}, but the French ship's armor covered a much greater area of the hull.<ref name=Con1>Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 147, 303</ref><ref name=Jan1>Jane's 1905\u20131906, p.119, p.161</ref> ''New York'' had a greater number of heavy guns than the French cruiser. The hull protection of both ships was superior to their main rival, the British [[Blake class cruiser|''Blake'']] class, which were the largest cruisers at the time but had no side armor.<ref name=Con2>Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 66</ref> The British had switched from building armored cruisers to favor very large, first class [[protected cruiser]]s, and stuck with this policy until after the [[Diadem class cruiser|''Diadem'']] class.\n\n===Engineering===\n\nAlong with having competitive weapons and armor, ''New York'' was intended to be relatively fast at {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}, and achieved {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}} on trials. This was achieved with four [[triple-expansion engine]]s totaling {{convert|16,000|ihp|kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}, two clutched in tandem on each of two shafts.<ref name=Friedman1/> The forward engines could be disconnected to conserve fuel at an economical cruising speed. In the US Navy, only {{USS|Brooklyn|ACR-3|2}} shared this feature, which proved something of a liability in the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] when both ships were operating with the forward engines disconnected and did not have time to reconnect them, thus limiting their speed.<ref name=Brook1>[http://www.spanamwar.com/brooklyn.htm USS ''Brooklyn'' at SpanAmWar.com]</ref> As built, eight coal-fired cylindrical [[boiler]]s supplied {{convert|160|psi|lk=on|abbr=on}} steam to the engines.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Friedman1/>\n\n===Refits===\n\n''New York'' underwent an extensive refit in 1905-1909. Her main guns and turrets were replaced with four [[8\"/45 caliber gun|{{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/45]] caliber Mark 6 guns in new Mark 12 turrets.<ref>[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_8-45_mk6.htm DiGiulian, Tony, 8\"/45 US Navy guns at Navweaps.com]</ref> The new turrets and barbettes had improved [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented armor]], with up to {{convert|6+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the turrets and {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}-{{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the barbettes.<ref name=Conways1/> The side 8-inch guns and torpedo tubes were removed. The secondary armament was replaced as well, with ten [[5\"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/50]] caliber Mark 6 guns and eight [[3\"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/50]] caliber guns. She also received twelve [[Babcock & Wilcox boiler]]s and the funnels were extended to improve [[Natural Draft|natural draft]] through the boilers.<ref name=Conways1/> A further refit during World War I removed two 5-inch and all of the 3-inch single-purpose guns, adding two {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/50 [[anti-aircraft]] guns. In 1927 her boilers were reduced to four with two funnels, leaving only {{convert|7,700|ihp|kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Register1/>\n\n==Service==\nIn July 1893 ''New York'' performed [[sea trials]] using the [[Five Fathom Bank light station]] and the [[North East End light station]] as markers, achieving {{convert|21.0|kn|lk=in}} with {{convert|17,401|ihp|kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} at a displacement of 8,480 tons; at the time she was said to be the fastest armored vessel in the world.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Friedman1>Friedman, pp. 34-39, 465-466</ref><ref name=newyork>{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/829420/uss_new_york_acr2five_fathom_bank/? |title=Cruiser New York |publisher=The Scranton Republican (Scranton, Pennsylvania) |date=27 March 1893 |page=1|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> On 1 August 1893 ''New York'' was commissioned at Philadelphia, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[John Woodward Philip|John Philip]] in command.<ref name=DANFS /> After completion, she was accepted by the Navy and left Cramp shipyards on 6 September for the [[League Island Navy Yard]] to load stores.<ref>{{cite news|title=News of the Navy|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1893-09-07/ed-1/seq-9/|work=The Sun (New York, NY)|date=7 September 1893|page=9}}</ref>\n\n===USS ''New York'' (ACR-2)===\n[[File:USS New York LOC det 4a04864.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''New York'' c. 1899]]\n[[File:Uss new york 1898.jpg|thumb|left|1898 color illustration of the ''New York'']]\nAssigned to the [[South Atlantic Squadron]], ''New York'' departed [[New York Harbor]] on 27 December 1893 for [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. Arriving at Taipu Beach in January 1894, she remained there until heading home on 23 March, via Nicaragua and the [[West Indies]]. Transferred to the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] in August, the cruiser returned to West Indian waters for winter exercises and was commended for her aid during a fire that threatened to destroy [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]].<ref name=DANFS>{{cite DANFS||title=New York (ACR-2)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/new-york-iv.html|{{sfnRef|DANFS New York (ACR-2)}}|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nReturning to New York, ''New York'' joined the [[European Squadron]] in 1895, and steamed to [[Kiel]], where she represented the United States at the opening of the [[Kiel Canal]]. Rejoining the North Atlantic Squadron, she operated off [[Fort Monroe]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and New York through 1897.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''New York'' departed Fort Monroe on 17 January 1898 for [[Key West]]. After the declaration of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in April, she steamed to Cuba and bombarded the defenses at [[Matanzas]] before joining other American ships at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] in May, seeking the Spanish squadron. Not finding them, they bombarded [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] at San Juan (12 May) before withdrawing. ''New York'' then became [[flagship]] of [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William T. Sampson]]'s squadron, as the American commander planned the campaign against [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]]. However, ''New York'' was taking Admiral Sampson to a meeting with Major General [[William Shafter]] when the Spanish fleet made its breakout attempt, some of her engines were disconnected which reduced her speed, and she was only able to participate in the closing phases of the battle.<ref name=Brook1/><ref>[http://www.spanamwar.com/santiago.htm Battle of Santiago de Cuba at SpanAmWar.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.spanamwar.com/newyork.htm USS ''New York'' at SpanAmWar.com]</ref> The [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] on 3 July resulted in complete destruction of the Spanish fleet.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nThe cruiser sailed for New York on 14 August to receive a warrior's welcome. The next year, she cruised with various state [[naval militia]] units to Cuba, [[Bermuda]], Honduras, and Venezuela, and conducted summer tactical operations off [[New England]]. On 17 October 1899, she departed New York for Central and South American trouble areas.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''New York'' was transferred to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] in 1901, sailing via [[Gibraltar]], [[Port Said]], and Singapore to [[Cavite]], where she became flagship of the Asiatic Fleet. She steamed to [[Yokohama]] in July for the unveiling of the memorial to the [[Perry Expedition]]. In October, ''New York'' visited [[Samar (island)|Samar]] and other Philippine islands as part of the [[Philippine\u2013American War|campaign against insurgents]]. On 13 March 1902, she got underway for [[Hong Kong]] and other Chinese ports. In September, she visited [[Vladivostok]], Russia, then stopped at [[Korea]] before returning to San Francisco in November. In 1903, ''New York'' transferred to the [[Pacific Squadron]] and cruised with it to [[Ampala]], Honduras in February to protect American interests during turbulence there. Steaming via [[Magdalena Bay]], Mexico, the cruiser returned to San Francisco, for a reception for President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1904, ''New York'' joined squadron cruises off Panama and Peru, then reported to [[Puget Sound]] in June where she became flagship of the Pacific Squadron. In September, she enforced the President's neutrality order during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. ''New York'' was at [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile from 21 December 1904 \u2013 4 January 1905, then sailed to [[Boston]] and decommissioned on 31 March for modernization.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nRecommissioning on 15 May 1909, ''New York'' departed Boston on 25 June for [[Algiers]] and [[Naples]], where she joined the [[Armored Cruiser Squadron]] on 10 July and sailed with it for home on the 23rd. Operating out of Atlantic and gulf ports for the next year, she went into fleet reserve on 31 December.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn full commission again on 1 April 1910, ''New York'' steamed via Gibraltar, Port Said, and Singapore to join the [[Asiatic Fleet]] at [[Manila]] on 6 August. While stationed in Asiatic waters, she cruised among the Philippine Islands, and ports in China and Japan.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nShe was renamed '''''Saratoga''''' on 16 February 1911, to make the name \"''New York''\" available for the battleship {{USS|New York|BB-34|3}}.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n===USS ''Saratoga'' (ACR-2)===\nThe cruiser spent the next five years in the Far East. Steaming to [[Bremerton, Washington]] on 6 February 1916, ''Saratoga'' went into reduced commission with the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nAs the U.S. drew closer to participation in World War I, ''Saratoga'' commissioned in full on 23 April 1917, and joined the [[Pacific Patrol Force]] on 7 June. In September, ''Saratoga'' steamed to Mexico to counter enemy activity in the troubled country. At [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], ''Saratoga'' intercepted and helped to capture a merchantman transporting 32 German agents and several Americans seeking to avoid the draft law.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn November, she transited the [[Panama Canal]], joining the [[Cruiser Force]], Atlantic Fleet at [[Hampton Roads]]. Here, she was renamed '''''Rochester''''' on 1 December 1917, to free the name \"''Saratoga''\" for the new [[battlecruiser]] {{USS|Saratoga|CC-3|3}} (eventually the [[aircraft carrier]] [[CV-3]]).<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n===USS ''Rochester'' (ACR-2/CA-2)===\nAfter escorting a [[convoy]] to France, ''Rochester'' commenced target and defense instruction of armed guard crews, in [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In March 1918, she resumed escorting convoys and continued the duty through the end of the war, with [[Alfred Walton Hinds]] in command. On her third trip, with convoy [[HM-58]], a [[U-boat]] torpedoed the British steamer ''Atlantian'' on 9 June. ''Rochester'' sped to her aid, but ''Atlantian'' sank within five minutes. Other ships closed in, but the submarine was not seen again.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nAfter the Armistice, ''Rochester'' served as a transport bringing troops home. In May 1919, she served as flagship of the destroyer squadron guarding the transatlantic flight of the Navy's [[Curtiss NC]] [[seaplane]]s. On 17 July 1920 she was redesignated with the [[hull classification symbol|hull number]] '''CA-2''' (heavy cruiser) as part of a fleetwide redesignation plan.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/04/acr2/acr2.htm USS New York/Saratoga/Rochester at NavSource Naval History]</ref> In the early 1920s, she operated along the east coast.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nEarly in 1923, ''Rochester'' got underway for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] to begin another period of service off the coasts of Central and South America.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn the summer of 1925, ''Rochester'' carried [[General (United States)|General]] [[John J. Pershing]] and other members of his commission to [[Arica]], Chile to arbitrate the [[Tacna]]-Arica dispute and remained there for the rest of the year. In September 1926, she helped bring peace to turbulent Nicaragua and from time to time returned there in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nAfter a quiet 1927, ''Rochester'' relieved the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Tulsa|PG-22|2}} at [[Corinto (Nicaragua)|Corinto]] in 1928 as Expeditionary Forces directed efforts against bandits in the area. Disturbances boiled over in Haiti in 1929, and opposition to the government was strong; inasmuch as American lives were endangered, ''Rochester'' transported the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade|1st Marine Brigade]] to [[Port-au-Prince]] and [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]. In 1930, ''Rochester'' transported the five-man commission sent to investigate the situation. In March, she returned to the area to embark marines and transported them to the U.S. She aided [[Continental Oil]] tanker ''H. W. Bruce'', damaged in a collision on 24 May.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn 1931, an [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|earthquake]] rocked Nicaragua. ''Rochester'' was the first relief ship to arrive on the scene and ferried refugees from the area. Bandits took advantage of the chaotic conditions and ''Rochester'' steamed to the area to counter their activities.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Rochester'' departed [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] on 25 February 1932 for service in the Pacific Fleet. She arrived [[Shanghai]] on 27 April, to join the fleet in the [[Yangtze River]] in June and remained there until steaming to Cavite, to decommission on 29 April 1933. She would remain moored at the [[Olongapo Shipyard]] at [[Subic Bay]] for the next eight years. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 28 October 1938, and she was [[Scuttling|scuttle]]d on 24 December 1941 to prevent her capture by the Japanese.<ref name=\"DANFS\" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/ships/usn/rochester.html | title=USS Rochester CA-2 (USS New York, USS Saratoga, ACR-2) | publisher=Pacific Wrecks.com | date=7 August 2015 | accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n*[[Sampson Medal]]\n*[[Spanish Campaign Medal]]\n*[[Philippine Campaign Medal]]\n*[[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|Victory Medal]] with \"ARMED GUARD\" and \"ESCORT\" clasps\n*[[Second Nicaraguan Campaign Medal]]\n*[[Yangtze Service Medal]]\n\n==Dive site ''Rochester''==\nSince being scuttled, ''Rochester'' has been transformed into an [[artificial reef]] and is popular with divers given its somewhat shallow depth of {{convert|59|-|88|ft|m|abbr=on}}, ease of access, and proximity to other wrecks.

Due to the unusually protracted construction of ''Maine'', ''New York'' was actually the first armored cruiser to enter U.S. Navy service. The fourth Navy ship to be named in honor of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], she was later renamed '''''Saratoga''''' and then '''''Rochester'''''.

The belt was {{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep, of which {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} was below the [[waterline]].

The thin side armor was comparable to that of the groundbreaking French armored cruiser {{Ship|French armoured cruiser|Dupuy de L\u00f4me|1890|2}}, but the French ship's armor covered a much greater area of the hull.<ref name=Con1>Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 147, 303</ref><ref name=Jan1>Jane's 1905\u20131906, p.119, p.161</ref> ''New York'' had a greater number of heavy guns than the French cruiser. The hull protection of both ships was superior to their main rival, the British [[Blake class cruiser|''Blake'']] class, which were the largest cruisers at the time but had no side armor.<ref name=Con2>Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 66</ref> The British had switched from building armored cruisers to favor very large, first class [[protected cruiser]]s, and stuck with this policy until after the [[Diadem class cruiser|''Diadem'']] class.\n\n===Engineering===\n\nAlong with having competitive weapons and armor, ''New York'' was intended to be relatively fast at {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}, and achieved {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}} on trials. This was achieved with four [[triple-expansion engine]]s totaling {{convert|16,000|ihp|kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}, two clutched in tandem on each of two shafts.<ref name=Friedman1/> The forward engines could be disconnected to conserve fuel at an economical cruising speed. In the US Navy, only {{USS|Brooklyn|ACR-3|2}} shared this feature, which proved something of a liability in the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] when both ships were operating with the forward engines disconnected and did not have time to reconnect them, thus limiting their speed.<ref name=Brook1>[http://www.spanamwar.com/brooklyn.htm USS ''Brooklyn'' at SpanAmWar.com]</ref> As built, eight coal-fired cylindrical [[boiler]]s supplied {{convert|160|psi|lk=on|abbr=on}} steam to the engines.<ref name=Conways1/><ref name=Friedman1/>\n\n===Refits===\n\n''New York'' underwent an extensive refit in 1905-1909. Her main guns and turrets were replaced with four [[8\"/45 caliber gun|{{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/45]] caliber Mark 6 guns in new Mark 12 turrets.<ref>[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_8-45_mk6.htm DiGiulian, Tony, 8\"/45 US Navy guns at Navweaps.com]</ref> The new turrets and barbettes had improved [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented armor]], with up to {{convert|6+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the turrets and {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}-{{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the barbettes.<ref name=Conways1/> The side 8-inch guns and torpedo tubes were removed. The secondary armament was replaced as well, with ten [[5\"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/50]] caliber Mark 6 guns and eight [[3\"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/50]] caliber guns. She also received twelve [[Babcock & Wilcox boiler]]s and the funnels were extended to improve [[Natural Draft|natural draft]] through the boilers.<ref name=Conways1/> A further refit during World War I removed two 5-inch and all of the 3-inch single-purpose guns, adding two {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}/50 [[anti-aircraft]] guns.

Arriving at Taipu Beach in January 1894, she remained there until heading home on 23 March, via Nicaragua and the [[West Indies]]. Transferred to the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] in August, the cruiser returned to West Indian waters for winter exercises and was commended for her aid during a fire that threatened to destroy [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]].<ref name=DANFS>{{cite DANFS||title=New York (ACR-2)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/new-york-iv.html|{{sfnRef|DANFS New York (ACR-2)}}|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nReturning to New York, ''New York'' joined the [[European Squadron]] in 1895, and steamed to [[Kiel]], where she represented the United States at the opening of the [[Kiel Canal]]. Rejoining the North Atlantic Squadron, she operated off [[Fort Monroe]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and New York through 1897.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''New York'' departed Fort Monroe on 17 January 1898 for [[Key West]]. After the declaration of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in April, she steamed to Cuba and bombarded the defenses at [[Matanzas]] before joining other American ships at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] in May, seeking the Spanish squadron. Not finding them, they bombarded [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] at San Juan (12 May) before withdrawing. ''New York'' then became [[flagship]] of [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William T. Sampson]]'s squadron, as the American commander planned the campaign against [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]]. However, ''New York'' was taking Admiral Sampson to a meeting with Major General [[William Shafter]] when the Spanish fleet made its breakout attempt, some of her engines were disconnected which reduced her speed, and she was only able to participate in the closing phases of the battle.<ref name=Brook1/><ref>[http://www.spanamwar.com/santiago.htm Battle of Santiago de Cuba at SpanAmWar.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.spanamwar.com/newyork.htm USS ''New York'' at SpanAmWar.com]</ref> The [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] on 3 July resulted in complete destruction of the Spanish fleet.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nThe cruiser sailed for New York on 14 August to receive a warrior's welcome. The next year, she cruised with various state [[naval militia]] units to Cuba, [[Bermuda]], Honduras, and Venezuela, and conducted summer tactical operations off [[New England]]. On 17 October 1899, she departed New York for Central and South American trouble areas.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''New York'' was transferred to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] in 1901, sailing via [[Gibraltar]], [[Port Said]], and Singapore to [[Cavite]], where she became flagship of the Asiatic Fleet. She steamed to [[Yokohama]] in July for the unveiling of the memorial to the [[Perry Expedition]]. In October, ''New York'' visited [[Samar (island)|Samar]] and other Philippine islands as part of the [[Philippine\u2013American War|campaign against insurgents]]. On 13 March 1902, she got underway for [[Hong Kong]] and other Chinese ports. In September, she visited [[Vladivostok]], Russia, then stopped at [[Korea]] before returning to San Francisco in November. In 1903, ''New York'' transferred to the [[Pacific Squadron]] and cruised with it to [[Ampala]], Honduras in February to protect American interests during turbulence there. Steaming via [[Magdalena Bay]], Mexico, the cruiser returned to San Francisco, for a reception for President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1904, ''New York'' joined squadron cruises off Panama and Peru, then reported to [[Puget Sound]] in June where she became flagship of the Pacific Squadron. In September, she enforced the President's neutrality order during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. ''New York'' was at [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile from 21 December 1904 \u2013 4 January 1905, then sailed to [[Boston]] and decommissioned on 31 March for modernization.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nRecommissioning on 15 May 1909, ''New York'' departed Boston on 25 June for [[Algiers]] and [[Naples]], where she joined the [[Armored Cruiser Squadron]] on 10 July and sailed with it for home on the 23rd. Operating out of Atlantic and gulf ports for the next year, she went into fleet reserve on 31 December.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn full commission again on 1 April 1910, ''New York'' steamed via Gibraltar, Port Said, and Singapore to join the [[Asiatic Fleet]] at [[Manila]] on 6 August. While stationed in Asiatic waters, she cruised among the Philippine Islands, and ports in China and Japan.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nShe was renamed '''''Saratoga''''' on 16 February 1911, to make the name \"''New York''\" available for the battleship {{USS|New York|BB-34|3}}.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n===USS ''Saratoga'' (ACR-2)===\nThe cruiser spent the next five years in the Far East. Steaming to [[Bremerton, Washington]] on 6 February 1916, ''Saratoga'' went into reduced commission with the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nAs the U.S. drew closer to participation in World War I, ''Saratoga'' commissioned in full on 23 April 1917, and joined the [[Pacific Patrol Force]] on 7 June. In September, ''Saratoga'' steamed to Mexico to counter enemy activity in the troubled country. At [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], ''Saratoga'' intercepted and helped to capture a merchantman transporting 32 German agents and several Americans seeking to avoid the draft law.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn November, she transited the [[Panama Canal]], joining the [[Cruiser Force]], Atlantic Fleet at [[Hampton Roads]]. Here, she was renamed '''''Rochester''''' on 1 December 1917, to free the name \"''Saratoga''\" for the new [[battlecruiser]] {{USS|Saratoga|CC-3|3}} (eventually the [[aircraft carrier]] [[CV-3]]).<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n===USS ''Rochester'' (ACR-2/CA-2)===\nAfter escorting a [[convoy]] to France, ''Rochester'' commenced target and defense instruction of armed guard crews, in [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In March 1918, she resumed escorting convoys and continued the duty through the end of the war, with [[Alfred Walton Hinds]] in command. On her third trip, with convoy [[HM-58]], a [[U-boat]] torpedoed the British steamer ''Atlantian'' on 9 June. ''Rochester'' sped to her aid, but ''Atlantian'' sank within five minutes. Other ships closed in, but the submarine was not seen again.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nAfter the Armistice, ''Rochester'' served as a transport bringing troops home. In May 1919, she served as flagship of the destroyer squadron guarding the transatlantic flight of the Navy's [[Curtiss NC]] [[seaplane]]s. On 17 July 1920 she was redesignated with the [[hull classification symbol|hull number]] '''CA-2''' (heavy cruiser) as part of a fleetwide redesignation plan.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/04/acr2/acr2.htm USS New York/Saratoga/Rochester at NavSource Naval History]</ref> In the early 1920s, she operated along the east coast.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nEarly in 1923, ''Rochester'' got underway for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] to begin another period of service off the coasts of Central and South America.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn the summer of 1925, ''Rochester'' carried [[General (United States)|General]] [[John J.

In September 1926, she helped bring peace to turbulent Nicaragua and from time to time returned there in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nAfter a quiet 1927, ''Rochester'' relieved the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Tulsa|PG-22|2}} at [[Corinto (Nicaragua)|Corinto]] in 1928 as Expeditionary Forces directed efforts against bandits in the area. Disturbances boiled over in Haiti in 1929, and opposition to the government was strong; inasmuch as American lives were endangered, ''Rochester'' transported the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade|1st Marine Brigade]] to [[Port-au-Prince]] and [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]. In 1930, ''Rochester'' transported the five-man commission sent to investigate the situation. In March, she returned to the area to embark marines and transported them to the U.S. She aided [[Continental Oil]] tanker ''H. W. Bruce'', damaged in a collision on 24 May.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nIn 1931, an [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|earthquake]] rocked Nicaragua. ''Rochester'' was the first relief ship to arrive on the scene and ferried refugees from the area. Bandits took advantage of the chaotic conditions and ''Rochester'' steamed to the area to counter their activities.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Rochester'' departed [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] on 25 February 1932 for service in the Pacific Fleet. She arrived [[Shanghai]] on 27 April, to join the fleet in the [[Yangtze River]] in June and remained there until steaming to Cavite, to decommission on 29 April 1933. She would remain moored at the [[Olongapo Shipyard]] at [[Subic Bay]] for the next eight years.

This lowered the wreck; enabling deep draft tankers to approach and moor to the POL buoy planned for Subic Bay (at the same time, Navy divers helped to clear more than 650 wrecks from Manila bay).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, two divers, a Hong Kong national and his American instructor, died while exploring the wreck.<ref name=accident>{{cite news|date=19 July 2011 |title=American diver found dead after exploring the USS New York shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2016494/US-diver-Steve-Brittain-dead-exploring-USS-NY-shipwreck-Pacific-Ocean.html#ixzz41ad1Zr7d |newspaper=DailyMail |location=London |access-date=29 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/n/new-york-iv.html}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Alden, John D.

It was first released [[direct-to-DVD]] on September 4, 2007 and premiered on television on October 6, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Naked Brothers Band and another band, the L.A. Surfers compete in a \u201cBattle of the Bands\u201d charity event benefiting Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free instruments and lessons to kids in low-income cities.\n\nRosalina starts to fall for the L.A. Surfers lead singer, Bobby Love ([[Keli Price]]). Nat and Alex learned his false intentions while in the bathroom as Nat is trying to wash out the orange hair dye that he put on as part of his latte-drinking bad boy image that he attempts to pull off to impress Rosalina. Nat did this after seeing a picture of Bobby Love and worrying whether she prefers bad boys. Nat then says he will try to get along with Bobby, but as he enters Nat and Alex hide in a stall. It turns out that Bobby is just hitting on Rosalina to get to the Naked Brothers Band, and is lying about everything (his faux British accent, his actual signature (he uses a stamp), not writing his own songs, and his [[birth name]], Robert).\n\nBobby even tells Matt Pinfield that Nat does not write his own songs, but he says that he did not. Nat wants Bobby to confess about his lies and he won't. At the concert for Little Kid's Rock, Nat asks Bobby to confess once again, and he does not. Instead, Bobby continues to hit on Rosalina and call Nat \"Nate\" which angers him, and Alex stands up to Bobby and steps on his foot, causing a huge fight. During that fight, Nat declares that the benefit concert is now a battle of the bands, and whoever loses has to give all of their profits from their next CD to the charity.\n\nCooper and the band apologize for their bad behavior, and Cooper apologizes on his own behalf because he had a dentist appointment to get head gear, and couldn't have stopped the fight before it started. Cooper asks the representative of Little Kids Rock, Patty Scoggins (Emily Richardson), if a \u201chuge band in Old Europe\u201d called \u201cThe Honey Bunnies\u201d (who are actually Mr. Wolff and Betty), could be the opening act for the event. She says that she could see what she could do. They actually perform, and a European producer actually gets impressed by what they did.\n\nBobby and his band later try to come up with new songs for the concert. Since Bobby doesn't write his own songs, this is very challenging. He comes up with mediocre songs called \u201cMy Feet Are So Nice\u201d and \u201cI Love My Hair\u201d. His bandmate's girlfriend, Rita, tells him how silly the songs are, and he just continues to tell her that she is not the boss of the feet or the hair song and that she is not in the band.\n\nLater Nat fails to get Rosalina to believe the truth about Bobby, and while practicing their song for the battle, he and the band make fun of Bobby twice, and she quits, telling Nat that she \"expects more from him\". She tells Bobby that the band thinks that he is a liar and he does not care about the charity. Bobby tries to use words of encouragement like \"Have you ever noticed that the word \"lousy\" is in the word \"jealousy\"? That's because jealousy... makes you feel lousy\"; Rosalina tells him that he said that to her the day before. Rosalina asks if he was the one who told Matt Pinfield that Nat does not write his own songs. She also asked him what part of England he is from.\n\nBobby is stuck, because he is not from Britain. In a moment of confusion, he said \u201cHogwarts,\u201d which is in Harry Potter. Bobby quickly dismisses the problem by asking Rosalina if what she is holding is the music from the Naked Brothers Band. She said that she \"won't be needing it since she quit the band,\" and Bobby throws it away in the garbage. He then attempts to kiss Rosalina, but she refused, stating that she is \"confused\" and runs away. After Rosalina leaves, Bobby takes her sheet music out of the garbage and pilfers it.\n\nAt the concert, Bobby talks to Nat, saying he is sorry that Rosalina left the band but she \"was a good kisser,\" and Nat lost control of himself and attacks Bobby. Nat is losing but fortunately, Alex scared Bobby away with a mere balloon that a little girl gave to him. She gave it to Alex after Bobby refused the gift and said \"I hope your band kicks Bobby's band's butts!\"\n\nSoon after, Bobby's band plays Nat's new song, \"L.A.\", which he stole from Rosalina and she realizes Bobby is a liar, and runs over to the band and says that Bobby stole it from her. She then hugs Nat and apologizes while crying. Nat forgives her. There is a net of balloons above the stage, and Rosalina wishes that \"all of the balloons were made of cement\" and they would fall on Bobby Love's big, fat, phony head. Then, Alex reminds Nat that he is afraid of balloons.\n\nRosalina pulls the rope, releasing the balloons. Balloons fall all over of Bobby's band, which causes him to panic and constantly yell in fear (in a non-British accent) for his mom and jumping on his bandmate, Pork, screaming: \"I'm not playing games! They're touching my face!\" Bobby Love and his band are booed off of the stage and gather at the dressing room. He expresses his anger because the band will have to dedicate all of the money from the next CD to the charity. Rita says that after this performance there won't be a next CD. Bobby Love hides his face in his hands in defeat and depression.\n\nCooper and Patty show the Naked Brothers Band music video \u201cL.A.\u201d that Nat originally wrote on the screen of a projector. Seeing this, Matt Pinfield, who previously supported the L.A. Surfers, gives an explanation of what just happened: The L.A. surfers stole the song from the Naked Brothers and Bobby Love is really \"balloon fearing surfer dude Robert Love from California. I repeat, Bobby Love is afraid of balloons, and is from San Diego\".\n\nMeanwhile backstage, Nat instructed Rosalina on how to play his new song, \"Girl Of My Dreams\". Nat and the band come out on to the stage, and tell the audience to give a round of applause for the Honey Bunnies and the LA Surfers; nobody cheers at all. Then, Nat introduces the song, which is dedicated to a \u201cvery special person\u201d (Rosalina) and notes that he wrote this when he was in pain and now that he's happy, he can actually enjoy it. The band performs the song, \"Girl Of My Dreams \" and win the battle of the bands.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! Actor !! Character !!
