After being referenced multiple times in the [[DC Extended Universe]], Darkseid will make his live-action debut in the film ''[[New Gods (film)|New Gods]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[Jack Kirby]] returned to DC Comics with ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #133 and immediately began establishing characters that would lay the foundation for his newly conceived [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] epic. The chief antagonist would be the villain Darkseid who had a cameo in ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #134 (November 1970) with a full first appearance in ''[[Forever People]]'' #1 (February 1971) . The character was originally designed to be the chief antagonist of the titles ''Forever People'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' and ''New Gods'', but after the cancellation of these titles, he continued to appear as a major villain in many DC Universe comic books, fighting both Superman and Batman. According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby modelled Darkseid's face on actor [[Jack Palance]], while the villain's personality was inspired by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2006/11/10/the-palance-darkseid-connection/ | title=The Palance-Darkseid Connection | last=Evanier | first= Mark | work=News From Me | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>[https://screenrant.com/best-comic-book-villains-real-life-inspiration/]\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe son of King Yuga Khan and Queen [[Heggra]], Prince Uxas, second in line to the throne of [[Apokolips]], plotted to seize power over the planet.

Darkseid had briefly been forced by his mother to marry [[Tigra (DC Comics)|Tigra]], with whom he also had a son.

Darkseid's second born son was surrendered to Highfather, while Darkseid received Scott Free. This eventually turned out to be a setback for Darkseid, with his biological son growing up to value and defend the ideals of New Genesis as a powerful champion in opposition to his father. The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of his son in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips. Likewise, Darkseid and his training minion, [[Granny Goodness]], were unable to break Scott Free's spirit after years of torturous upbringing and the New God was able to escape Apokolips, taking with him the mightiest of the [[Female Furies]], [[Big Barda]], as his wife and came to Earth to become the master escape artist and superhero foe of Darkseid, [[Mister Miracle]]. Regardless, Darkseid anticipated that Scott would make such a move and used its occurrence as a pretext to declare the treaty with New Genesis abrogated and resume armed conflict.\n\nSeeing other deities as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in order to discover the secret location of the Olympian deities, planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power.

To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious [[Anti-Life Equation]], which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion [[Glorious Godfrey]], who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation.\n\nDarkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many [[superhero]]es of the DC Universe, most notably the Kryptonian [[Superman]]. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through [[Intergang]], a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of evil.\n\n===The Great Darkness Saga===\n{{Main|The Great Darkness Saga}}\n[[File:Darkseidgeogreperez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Darkseid in ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' #1 (1994).

He returns and comes into conflict with that era's champions, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and [[Daxam]]\u2014which places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants Kryptonian-like superpowers equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe.

However, the tale has been restored to continuity in recent years. In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 6, #4 (October 2010), explicit reference is made to the events of \"The Great Darkness Saga\", mentioning (among other things) Darkseid's victory over [[Mordru]] on the planet Avalon. Similarly in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 7, #3 (January 2012), a Daxamite official remarked that the people of his world \"still mourn how Darkseid used us for violence\".</ref>\n\n===The Seven Soldiers and \"Boss Dark Side\"===\nIn [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2005 ''Mister Miracle'' limited series, it was revealed that Darkseid had finally discovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], which he then used to destroy the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] altogether. The [[New Gods]] fled to Earth, where they hid. Highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] used a wheelchair, the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] was an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad|DeSaad]] was an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] was a pimp (or \"madam\") for the [[Female Furies]] and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as \"Boss Dark Side\".

During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, which created a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having \"won\" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as \"Boss Dark Side\", aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].\n\n[[File:Fc-04 darkseid.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Final Crisis'' #4 (November 2008). Art by J.G. Jones.]]\nOnce again bound to the form of a human, \"Boss Dark Side\" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to ''[[Final Crisis]]''. In ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the \"spoken form\" of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], to kidnap the [[Tornado Twins]]. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by [[Bernadeth]]. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #59, it was revealed that he had employed the [[Terror Titans]] to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.\n\nIn ''Final Crisis'', Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and [[antichrist]]-like figure who soon converts much of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to his cause with the aid of the [[Crime Bible]] and the [[Holy Lance]]. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as [[Mary Marvel]].\n\nDarkseid also arranges for detective [[Dan Turpin]] to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's \"final host\", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest \"rebirth\", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], the \"Embodiment of Freedom\" is shot by [[S.H.A.D.E.]] operatives, thus signalling the \"Victory of Evil\". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his \"fall\" having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth.\n\nAfter escaping from captivity, [[Batman]] shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Beam, sending back in time and then \"infecting\" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into [[prehistoric]] times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death).\n\nBefore Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]] lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and making contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid's control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid's minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid's spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the [[Miracle Machine]] Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan fails when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman ([[Dick Grayson]]), Red Robin ([[Tim Drake]]), Robin ([[Damian Wayne]]), and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time-stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with [[Mister Miracle]], to escape the Omega Sanction.\n\n[[Doctor Impossible]] later manipulates the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] itself. The resurrection backfires, and instead creates a new being known as the Omega Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Mark Bagley|Begley, Mark]]|inker=Hunter, Rob|coinkers=[[Norm Rapmund|Rapmund, Norm]]|story=Omega, Part 1: Worlds Collide|title=[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]|volume=2|issue=50|date=December 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n[[File:Justice League New 52 23.1 Darkseid.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Justice League'' vol 2 #23.1 Darkseid (November 2013).

So as Darkseid invades Prime Earth in ''Justice League'', he sends his lieutenant [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] to do the same, with greater success, on [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]], resulting in the deaths of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and stranding Helena Wayne and Kara Zor-L on Prime Earth. Five years later, Darkseid once again invades Earth 2, which never fully recovered from his armies' earlier assault, and it is revealed that he and [[Highfather (comics)|Highfather]] of New Genesis struck a deal allowing him the unchallenged right to invade Earth 2.\n\nIn ''Darkseid'' #1, his background story was revealed. Formerly a farmer named Uxas, he hated the deities of his world. So he traveled up to their mountain while they slept and tricked them all into fighting each other. As they were all weakened from the war, he killed them one by one with his scythe (similar to [[Cronus|Kronos]] of [[Greek mythology]]) and stole their power, before destroying his world and creating Apokolips.\n\nIn ''Justice League: The Darkseid War'' (after the retirement of the \"New 52\" imprint), Darkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor. Darkseid's daughter Grail leads the [[Anti-Monitor]], who is revealed to be a scientist named Mobius, to Darkseid for the former to kill the latter. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] with Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Later, Lex Luthor would be merged with the Omega Sanction, becoming the new ruler of Apokolips.\n\nAfter killing the Anti-Monitor using an Anti-Life Equation-powered [[Steve Trevor]], Grail would later resurrect Darkseid through the [[Alexander Luthor Jr.|newborn child]] of [[Superwoman]]. The child has the same powers as his father Mazahs, with the ability to steal the powers of others. Stealing the new \"God\" abilities of the Justice League, Grail fuses them with the child and brings Darkseid back to life. However, he is under her complete control. Grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing Darkseid with the Anti-Life Equation. However, it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nDarkseid (as a baby) appears in ''DC Universe: Rebirth'' #1 where Grail tells him of Wonder Woman's long lost brother, Jason.\n\nBaby Darkseid reappears in ''Dark Nights: Metal'' where it is shown that Batman stole him from Grail and intends to use the Omega Beams to send himself back in time.

After killing A.R.G.U.S. agents that were hunting them down, Darkseid and Grail began hunting down and taking the life force of Zeus' demi-god children, killing several including Perseus and Hercules, and growing into the size of a child. After recruiting Jason and luring Wonder Woman to him, Darkseid ages once again into a young man. He fights Wonder Woman himself and as he starts to drain her life force, he is betrayed by Jason. When Zeus appears and transforms into his true form, Darkseid fights the Olympian God, destroying their surroundings in their brawl. When they take a Boom Tube to [[Manila]], Philippines, Zeus grabs onto Darkseid and unleashes bolts of lightning on him. However, Darkseid reveals that he planned for this and that his true target was Zeus himself, and he begins to drain and kill him, restoring Darkseid back to his original self. When the rest of the Justice League arrive, Darkseid decides it's best not to fight them as he doesn't want to risk revealing his greater plans, and promptly leaves through a Boom Tube with Grail.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker=Parsons, Sean|coinkers=Paz, Jason, Hanna, Scott|story=Children of the Gods, Part 1|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=31|date=November 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Davila, Sergio|inker=Hanna, Scott|coinkers=Morales, Mark|story=Children of the Gods, Part 2|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=32|date=December 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Lupacchino, Emanuela|inker=McCarthy, Ray|story=Times Past: Grail|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=33|date=December 2017|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Davila, Sergio|inker=Hanna, Scott|coinkers=Gray, Mick, Ferreira, Eber|story=Children of the Gods, Part 3|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=34|date=January 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=Luppacchino, Emanuela|inker=McCarthy, Ray|story=Times Past: Jason|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=35|date=January 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker=Paz, Jason|coinkers=Parsons, Sean|story=Children of the Gods, Part 4|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=36|date=February 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref><ref name=\"Wonder Woman Vol 5 37\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|copencillers=Segovia, Stephen|inker=Paz, Jason|coinkers=[[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]], Fern\u00e1ndez, Ra\u00fal|story=Children of the Gods, Conclusion|title=Wonder Woman|volume=5|issue=37|date=February 2018|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:TheomegaeffectNG11.jpg|right|thumb|Darkseid vaporizes [[Desaad]] with his Omega Beams in ''[[New Gods]]'' (vol. 1) #11 (November 1972).

His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that he fires from his eyes or hands as either a concussive force or a disintegrating energy which is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Some super-beings, such as [[Superman]] and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], have proven to be resistant to the beams, although in the case of Superman, with a great deal of pain. Also, Orion and Diana were able to deflect them, Firestorm once used his powers to redirect them and in a crossover story, [[Galactus]] was unaffected by them. These beams stem from a cosmic energy source called the \"Omega Effect\". The Omega Beams can also resurrect fallen beings previously killed by them, depending on the Dark Lord's will. He will sometimes use this as punishment upon those who fail him but are too valuable to kill outright. Darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy, and his unerring aim allows the beam to travel in straight lines, bend, or curve around corners and even pass through matter or other forms of energy. He can also teleport himself or others through time and space.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Ostrander|Ostrander, John]]|penciller=[[Eduardo Barreto|Barreto, Eduardo]]|inker=Kryssing, Ray|story=In My Life (Part Two)|title=Martian Manhunter|volume=2|issue=34|date=September 2001|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref> His Omega Sanction traps organisms in a series of alternate realities, each one worse than the previous.

He is seen overseeing the torture of an unseen figure as his son [[Kalibak]] approaches him. Kalibak informs his father of [[Superman]]'s worldwide ceasefire on Earth. Darkseid muses if Superman has begun to soften before Kalibak asks to take a war party to personally investigate. When Kalibak sees just who it is Darkseid is torturing, the lord of Apokolips confirms the man's identity before saying, \"He made a mistake.\" When Kalibak asks if he can be killed, Darkseid chides his son, \"Of course not. Who would come for him?\" He then allows Kalibak to go, bidding him to kill the Kryptonian and take the Earth. Darkseid grins to himself as he asks to be left alone with his prisoner: [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]], death himself, as Darkseid resumes his torture. In the Injustice Annual, Darkseid hires the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to go to Earth and kill Superman in retaliation for the death of Kalibak at the Man of Steel's hands. However, Lobo returns some time later after a 'therapy' session with [[Harley Quinn]], and brazenly challenges the Dread Lord to a battle. Later, under Darkseid's command, [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] manipulates the Justice League into battle with the Greek Gods. The attempt, while initially successful, is defused by Batman and [[Highfather]]'s intervention.

Once it is solved, Darkseid reveals his true form, explains that previous attacks by Granny Goodness and her minions were his attempts to conquer Earth, and uses the Anti-Life Equation to slowly convert Earth's population into duplicates of himself.

For aeons, Apokolips and its sister planet, [[New Genesis]], have been at war with each other. They eventually formed a peace treaty by trading Darkseid's son (Orion) with Highfather's (Mister Miracle), whom Darkseid has shown great resent towards. During his first invasion of Earth (in the two-part episode \"Apokolips...Now!\"), Darkseid is confronted by the citizens of New Genesis, who deem Earth under their protection; if Darkseid ever attacked again, it would be a violation of their truce. To bypass his promise, Darkseid develops various schemes to destroy Earth indirectly, such as through the manipulation of Metropolis' criminal syndicate, [[Intergang]]. In the concluding two-part finale \"Legacy\", Darkseid attempts one final invasion of Earth which involves brainwashing [[Superman]] into thinking he is his adopted son. After causing much devastation on Earth, Superman manages to break free from Darkseid's control and confronts him on Apokolips. During their final battle, Darkseid beats and pummels Superman. But just as Darkseid attempts to use his Omega Beams to deliver the final blow, Superman covers the tyrant's eyes, causing a massive explosion which results in Darkseid's defeat. To Superman's shock, however, Darkseid's slaves willingly come to his aid after the battle by carrying his injured body away to recover. As he leaves, Darkseid explains to Superman that \"''I am many things, Kal-El, but here, I am God.''\"\n* Darkseid returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, where he is given a stylistic revamp, now featuring a more streamlined build. In the two-part episode \"Twilight\", Darkseid seeks the [[Justice League]]'s help in stopping [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] from downloading all of Apokolips' information before destroying it. Superman opposes helping his nemesis, but the rest of the League agrees in order to take down Brainiac once and for all. But after defeating Brainiac's forces and following the android back to his base, the League discover that Darkseid and Brainiac have been working together all along. As part of their arrangement, Darkseid would bring Superman to Brainiac, and in exchange, the supercomputer would spare Apokolips. However, Darkseid later betrays Brainiac by hacking his circuitry, rendering all of Brainiac's machinery under his control to find the Anti-Life Equation. But Superman is freed with [[Batman]]'s help while Orion battles Darkseid. After Darkseid defeats his son, his exit blocked by Superman, intent to finish Darkseid once and for all. This time, the angered Man of Steel actually manages to defeat Darkseid, but is prevented from killing him as the base begins to collapse, forcing Batman to bring Superman and Orion to safety via a [[boom tube]]. Buried under the rubble, Darkseid looks on and nonchalantly says \"Loser\" before being killed in the explosion of the base.\n* Darkseid makes his final and last appearance in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. When the [[Legion of Doom]] travel into deep space to the location of Brainiac's destroyed base from \"Twilight\", [[Lex Luthor]] sacrifices both the ship's power and [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] to fuel a device that will mystically draw Brainiac's essence from the debris in an attempt to resurrect the android. However, Darkseid was resurrected instead, now more powerful than ever due to merging with Brainiac's technology. After destroying the Legion's ship, Darkseid returns to Apokolips and reunifies his warring minions to claim revenge against Superman, and launches an assault on Earth. This forces the Justice League and the Legion to work together to stop the Parademons' invasion. Most notably, Batman becomes the first-ever being to avoid getting struck by Darkseid's Omega Beam. Superman then confronts Darkseid once again and is ultimately defeated when Darkseid paralyzes him with the agony matrix. But before Darkseid can kill his nemesis, Luthor, having visited the Source Wall and found the Anti-Life Equation, steps in and sacrifices himself to stop Darkseid. Both Darkseid and Luthor then touch the Equation and disappear in a flash of light. Though several heroes speculate that they may not have seen the last of them, series writer Dwayne McDuffie confirmed that Darkseid and Luthor now form part of the Source Wall, as do all who solve the Anti-Life Equation.\n\n===Film===\n* In 2014, film director [[Bryan Singer]] revealed that during the early development of the scrapped ''Superman Returns'' sequel, Darkseid was considered to be the main antagonist.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vieira |first=Anthony |url=http://screenrant.com/bryan-singer-superman-returns-criticism-darseid-sequel/ |title=Bryan Singer Responds to \u2018Superman Returns\u2019 Criticism; Wanted Darkseid for Sequel |website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=February 1, 2014 |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:DarkseidCrain.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Superman/Batman: Apocalypse'' (2010).

After using a horde of Doomsday clones to distract Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, Darkseid's forces manage to capture Kara and bring her to Apokolips, where Darkseid brainwashes her into becoming the captain of the furies. When Superman arrives, Darkseid unleashes the corrupted Kara in hopes of using her to kill the Man of Steel. However, Batman activates all of the Hell Spores and threatens to destroy Apokolips, issuing Darkseid an ultimatum: free Kara and promise to leave her alone in exchange for deactivating the Spores. Darkseid then relents, releasing Kara from his control. However, Darkseid later ambushes them at the Kent Farm (he had promised to leave Kara alone, but not Superman or Earth). After using his Omega Beams to blast Superman into orbit, Darkseid overpowers Kara and is pummeled mercilessly by a furious Superman until he manages to restrain him. He unleashes the power of his Omega Beams on Superman, blackening his face until Kara then uses Darkseid's Mother Box to activate a Boom Tube, allowing Superman to blast him into it and transport him to an unknown part of space where he ends up frozen.\n* Darkseid appears in the [[DC Animated Movie Universe]] based on his [[New 52]] portrayal, where he conquers world after world after each one has run out of resources, and he has the natives turned into Parademons for his army.\n** He first appears in the film ''[[Justice League: War]]'', voiced by [[Steve Blum]], as his forces attempt to invade and terraform Earth. Per Green Lantern's idea, Flash and Wonder Woman gouge Darkseid's eyes out to prevent him from using his Omega Beams. Cyborg and Shazam get the [[boom tube]]s open to send all of the Parademons back with Darkseid. After receiving a massive beating from Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, and Wonder Woman, Darkseid is finally thrown back into the portal and returned to Apokolips.\n** Darkseid appears in ''[[Reign of the Supermen (film)|Reign of the Supermen]]'', voiced by [[Tony Todd]]. In the movie's storyline, Darkseid is revealed to had caused the events of the previous film ''[[The Death of Superman (film)|The Death of Superman]]'', unleashing and created [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] on Earth as a living biological weapon to soften up the planet's defences, also converting [[Hank Henshaw]] into his agent - Henshaw having been a casualty of Doomsday's entry to Earth when the meteor carrying Doomsday destroyed Henshaw's shuttle - with Henshaw's manipulations allowing him to apparently destroy and banish the Justice League and orchestrate a second invasion.\n** Darkseid will appear in the film ''[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]'' as the main antagonist.<ref name=\"Trailer\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/justice-league-dark-apokolips-war-trailer/|title=\u2018Justice League Dark: Apokolips War\u2019 Trailer Reveals an R-rated DC Comics Epic|last=Mancuso|first=Vinnie|website=Collider|date=March 4, 2020}}</ref>\n* Darkseid appears as in the animated film ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League]]'', voiced again by Tony Todd. He takes advantage of Bizarro's new [[Bizarro League]].\n* An alternate universe version of Darkseid appeared in a flashback scene of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Bruce Thomas]]. [[Bekka]] was supposed to be wed to his son, Orion as part of a truce between New Genesis and Apokolips only for Highfather and his army to kill him and his followers. Unlike the comics and any incarnations, this version of Darkseid is shown to be a good parent to Orion and possibly Kalibak, as seen by Orion when he saw his father killed by Highfather and Orion is shocked to see his father dead in front of him.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom]]'', with Tony Todd reprising the role. After Lex Luthor and the [[Legion of Doom]] fail, Darkseid decides to take matters into his own hands by allying himself with [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]].\n* In the [[DC Extended Universe]] Darkseid was mentioned in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' while events in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' hint at his existence; there were plans for Darkseid to make an explicit appearance in ''Justice League'', but his scene was cut. In [[Zack Snyder]] and [[Chris Terrio]]\u2019s original script for ''Justice League'', completed before the release of ''Batman v Superman'', the film was going to explore a distant future where Darkseid had taken over the Earth. After murdering [[Lois Lane]], he brings [[Superman]] under control of the [[Anti-Life Equation]] which leads to the Knightmare sequence in ''Batman v Superman''. But after the negative critical and financial reception to the theatrical cut of ''Batman v Superman'', [[Warner Bros.]] executives became nervous and asked them to rewrite parts of this script, which led them to remove these plot points to save for a later film. This effectively cut Darkseid's role down to a cameo while his lieutenant [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] took over the role of central villain. With Snyder's departure and [[Joss Whedon]]\u2019s extensive reshoots, any reference to the Knightmare sequence and distant future, as well as Darkseid's cameo, were discarded for a more streamlined, self-contained approach. Actor Ray Porter was even cast as Darkseid. Snyder released an image of Darkseid in the history lesson on his social media site Vero. Darkseid and his invading forces even originally appeared at the end of the final battle from a boom tube after Steppenwolf is killed by [[Wonder Woman]], in which both sides have an exchange before the team destroy the Motherboxes and close the boom tube on Darkseid.\n*[[Ava DuVernay]] revealed that Darkseid will appear in ''[[New Gods (film)|New Gods]]''.

He is encountered in Lex Luthor's virtual Metropolis and is sighted in a level where he is merely standing around in a parking garage. The player (uncharacteristically) easily takes him out with one punch and then has to deliver him to the police.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. He is in collaboration with Lex Luthor to enhance Intergang with Interbots.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'', voiced by [[David Sobolov]]. In this continuity, he has at some point been trapped in another dimension, and thus remains behind the scenes for most of the story as he manipulates [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with promises of unleashing great power and knowledge in exchange for acquiring a [[Mother Box]] from the Justice League Watchtower. Using the power of the Mother Box and the sensory field matrix that served as his prison, Darkseid is able to escape \u2013 saying that he has fulfilled his bargain to help Brainiac unleash great power, with the great knowledge being that one should never trust Darkseid \u2013 and remake Earth into a new Apokolips. He subsequently attempted to destroy the League with his Omega Beams, but Mother Box was able to save the League by altering the Omega Effect to send them to another dimension filled with a strange ambient energy that renders the Omega Beams useless. Now protected from Darkseid, the League return to Earth and defeat him, Wonder Woman subsequently using her Lasso of Truth to learn that only the hypercube that imprisoned Darkseid originally can imprison him again. The league activates the cube and Superman defeats Darkseid, imprisoning him once again. With Darkseid defeated, Mother Box restores Earth to normal, with Green Lantern promising to take Darkseid's hypercube somewhere where it can never be discovered so Darkseid may not be released again.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', voiced by Perry Brown. He appears in the opening of the DC side of the Story Mode having been defeated by Superman. Attempting to flee via a [[boom tube]], Darkseid is struck by Superman's heat vision. Unknown to both of them at the same time, [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] is blasting [[Dark Kahn|Shao Kahn]] with lighting as the villain attempted to flee in a portal. These two events link together, merging both villains into an entity known as Dark Kahn. This results in both realities beginning to merge. The creature spreads its will through both realities, increasing the Rage of every fighter to the point that they become delusional and mistake friends with enemies. Confronted by both Raiden and Superman, Dark Kahn explodes and both realities separate. Darkseid ends up in the Mortal Kombat universe by accident, being imprisoned in Nether Realm. In Darkseid's ending the sorcerer Shang Tsung attempt to take Darkseid's soul to gain strength, but the villain had the process reversed on him, empowering Darkseid instead.\n* Darkseid was used as a DLC skin for [[Geras (Mortal Kombat)|Geras]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]''.

The character was originally designed to be the chief antagonist of the titles ''Forever People'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'' and ''New Gods'', but after the cancellation of these titles, he continued to appear as a major villain in many DC Universe comic books, fighting both Superman and Batman. According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], Kirby modelled Darkseid's face on actor [[Jack Palance]], while the villain's personality was inspired by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2006/11/10/the-palance-darkseid-connection/ | title=The Palance-Darkseid Connection | last=Evanier | first= Mark | work=News From Me | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>[https://screenrant.com/best-comic-book-villains-real-life-inspiration/]\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe son of King Yuga Khan and Queen [[Heggra]], Prince Uxas, second in line to the throne of [[Apokolips]], plotted to seize power over the planet.

The prophecy foretold that Darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of his son in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery Armaghetto of Apokolips. Likewise, Darkseid and his training minion, [[Granny Goodness]], were unable to break Scott Free's spirit after years of torturous upbringing and the New God was able to escape Apokolips, taking with him the mightiest of the [[Female Furies]], [[Big Barda]], as his wife and came to Earth to become the master escape artist and superhero foe of Darkseid, [[Mister Miracle]]. Regardless, Darkseid anticipated that Scott would make such a move and used its occurrence as a pretext to declare the treaty with New Genesis abrogated and resume armed conflict.\n\nSeeing other deities as a threat, Darkseid invaded the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in order to discover the secret location of the Olympian deities, planning to overthrow the Olympians and steal their power.

Darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods, most notably through his minion [[Glorious Godfrey]], who could control people's minds with his voice. He had a special interest in [[Earth]], as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most, if not all, fragments of the Anti-Life Equation.\n\nDarkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many [[superhero]]es of the DC Universe, most notably the Kryptonian [[Superman]]. Darkseid worked behind the scenes, using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through [[Intergang]], a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of evil.\n\n===The Great Darkness Saga===\n{{Main|The Great Darkness Saga}}\n[[File:Darkseidgeogreperez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Darkseid in ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' #1 (1994).

He returns and comes into conflict with that era's champions, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. After using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power, Darkseid transposes the planets Apokolips and [[Daxam]]\u2014which places Daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants Kryptonian-like superpowers equal to those of Superman. Placing the Daxamites under his mental thrall, he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe.

However, the tale has been restored to continuity in recent years. In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 6, #4 (October 2010), explicit reference is made to the events of \"The Great Darkness Saga\", mentioning (among other things) Darkseid's victory over [[Mordru]] on the planet Avalon.

[[Metron (comics)|Metron]] used a wheelchair, the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] was an old white man in a wheelchair, [[Desaad|DeSaad]] was an evil [[psychiatrist]], [[Granny Goodness]] was a pimp (or \"madam\") for the [[Female Furies]] and Darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as \"Boss Dark Side\".

During the massive fight, Orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out, which created a firepit of Apokolips from Darkseid's chest cavity (in reference to the prophecy of their final battle). As Darkseid dies, a battered, wounded Orion walks away from the battlefield having \"won\" the battle against his father once and for all. However, Darkseid's life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time, where he was reborn as \"Boss Dark Side\", aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]].\n\n[[File:Fc-04 darkseid.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Final Crisis'' #4 (November 2008). Art by J.G. Jones.]]\nOnce again bound to the form of a human, \"Boss Dark Side\" began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to ''[[Final Crisis]]''. In ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #240, he led an army of fanatics, their will broken by the \"spoken form\" of the [[Anti-Life Equation]], to kidnap the [[Tornado Twins]]. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #118, he runs his Dark Side Club where superhumans fight to the death, brainwashed by drugs produced by [[Bernadeth]]. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #59, it was revealed that he had employed the [[Terror Titans]] to capture the Teen Titans and use them in his club fights.\n\nIn ''Final Crisis'', Darkseid has begun to take over Earth and corrupt the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] with the aid of his herald Libra, a reborn supervillain and [[antichrist]]-like figure who soon converts much of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to his cause with the aid of the [[Crime Bible]] and the [[Holy Lance]]. Darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil New Gods, who, like Darkseid, now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings, such as [[Mary Marvel]].\n\nDarkseid also arranges for detective [[Dan Turpin]] to be lured into the Dark Side Club, where Turpin is turned into Darkseid's \"final host\", as his Boss Dark Side body has begun to mummify due to Darkseid's foul astral presence. With his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest \"rebirth\", Darkseid successfully conquers the Earth with the unleashing of the Anti-Life Equation onto mankind. However, the rebirthing process is still far from complete as Dan Turpin's mind and soul, while corrupted by Darkseid's essence, still remains in firm control over his body. However, at the same moment [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], the \"Embodiment of Freedom\" is shot by [[S.H.A.D.E.]] operatives, thus signalling the \"Victory of Evil\". Darkseid wins control over Turpin's body, now twisted in a close copy of his Apokoliptan former appearance, and wearing an updated version of his battle armor. Darkseid then gains the fullest of his power, his \"fall\" having the effect of compressing and crumpling space-time around Earth.\n\nAfter escaping from captivity, [[Batman]] shoots Darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed Orion, while Darkseid simultaneously hits Batman with the Omega Beam, sending back in time and then \"infecting\" Batman with Omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time, with disastrous results when he reaches the present. Darkseid is mortally wounded, but not before his Omega Sanction teleports Batman into [[prehistoric]] times. Remains believed to be Batman's (later revealed to be the last of the many Batman clones that Darkseid created) are found by Superman, who confronts Darkseid. As Darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend Earth, it emerges that in Darkseid's fall through the multiverse, he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence. When Superman attempts to physically assault him, Darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the Anti-Life Equation and that killing Darkseid will kill humanity. Darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him, to kill Orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time (a move Superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions: the bullet used to kill Orion is ultimately fired at him by Batman and is now poisoning him to death).\n\nBefore Darkseid can use the Omega Effect to kill Superman, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]] lead the Black Racer to Darkseid and making contact with him frees Turpin from Darkseid's control. Wonder Woman (having been freed from possession by one of Darkseid's minions) then uses her lasso of truth to bind Darkseid's spirit form, effectively freeing humanity from the Anti-Life Equation and being controlled by Darkseid. In his final effort, Darkseid's disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the [[Miracle Machine]] Superman has created; however, Superman uses counter-vibrations to destroy him. Furthermore, the last piece of Darkseid's plan fails when Batman, thanks to the actions of the new Batman ([[Dick Grayson]]), Red Robin ([[Tim Drake]]), Robin ([[Damian Wayne]]), and the Justice League, is able to return safely to the present, consuming the Omega Energy in his body without damaging the time-stream further, thus becoming the second individual, along with [[Mister Miracle]], to escape the Omega Sanction.\n\n[[Doctor Impossible]] later manipulates the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] into helping him resurrect Darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] itself. The resurrection backfires, and instead creates a new being known as the Omega Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller=[[Mark Bagley|Begley, Mark]]|inker=Hunter, Rob|coinkers=[[Norm Rapmund|Rapmund, Norm]]|story=Omega, Part 1: Worlds Collide|title=[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]|volume=2|issue=50|date=December 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York, NY}}</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n[[File:Justice League New 52 23.1 Darkseid.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Justice League'' vol 2 #23.1 Darkseid (November 2013).

So as Darkseid invades Prime Earth in ''Justice League'', he sends his lieutenant [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] to do the same, with greater success, on [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]], resulting in the deaths of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, and stranding Helena Wayne and Kara Zor-L on Prime Earth. Five years later, Darkseid once again invades Earth 2, which never fully recovered from his armies' earlier assault, and it is revealed that he and [[Highfather (comics)|Highfather]] of New Genesis struck a deal allowing him the unchallenged right to invade Earth 2.\n\nIn ''Darkseid'' #1, his background story was revealed. Formerly a farmer named Uxas, he hated the deities of his world. So he traveled up to their mountain while they slept and tricked them all into fighting each other. As they were all weakened from the war, he killed them one by one with his scythe (similar to [[Cronus|Kronos]] of [[Greek mythology]]) and stole their power, before destroying his world and creating Apokolips.\n\nIn ''Justice League: The Darkseid War'' (after the retirement of the \"New 52\" imprint), Darkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor. Darkseid's daughter Grail leads the [[Anti-Monitor]], who is revealed to be a scientist named Mobius, to Darkseid for the former to kill the latter. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] with Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Later, Lex Luthor would be merged with the Omega Sanction, becoming the new ruler of Apokolips.\n\nAfter killing the Anti-Monitor using an Anti-Life Equation-powered [[Steve Trevor]], Grail would later resurrect Darkseid through the [[Alexander Luthor Jr.|newborn child]] of [[Superwoman]]. The child has the same powers as his father Mazahs, with the ability to steal the powers of others. Stealing the new \"God\" abilities of the Justice League, Grail fuses them with the child and brings Darkseid back to life. However, he is under her complete control. Grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing Darkseid with the Anti-Life Equation. However, it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nDarkseid (as a baby) appears in ''DC Universe: Rebirth'' #1 where Grail tells him of Wonder Woman's long lost brother, Jason.\n\nBaby Darkseid reappears in ''Dark Nights: Metal'' where it is shown that Batman stole him from Grail and intends to use the Omega Beams to send himself back in time.

After killing A.R.G.U.S. agents that were hunting them down, Darkseid and Grail began hunting down and taking the life force of Zeus' demi-god children, killing several including Perseus and Hercules, and growing into the size of a child. After recruiting Jason and luring Wonder Woman to him, Darkseid ages once again into a young man. He fights Wonder Woman himself and as he starts to drain her life force, he is betrayed by Jason. When Zeus appears and transforms into his true form, Darkseid fights the Olympian God, destroying their surroundings in their brawl. When they take a Boom Tube to [[Manila]], Philippines, Zeus grabs onto Darkseid and unleashes bolts of lightning on him. However, Darkseid reveals that he planned for this and that his true target was Zeus himself, and he begins to drain and kill him, restoring Darkseid back to his original self.

His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that he fires from his eyes or hands as either a concussive force or a disintegrating energy which is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Some super-beings, such as [[Superman]] and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], have proven to be resistant to the beams, although in the case of Superman, with a great deal of pain. Also, Orion and Diana were able to deflect them, Firestorm once used his powers to redirect them and in a crossover story, [[Galactus]] was unaffected by them. These beams stem from a cosmic energy source called the \"Omega Effect\". The Omega Beams can also resurrect fallen beings previously killed by them, depending on the Dark Lord's will. He will sometimes use this as punishment upon those who fail him but are too valuable to kill outright. Darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy, and his unerring aim allows the beam to travel in straight lines, bend, or curve around corners and even pass through matter or other forms of energy.

When Kalibak sees just who it is Darkseid is torturing, the lord of Apokolips confirms the man's identity before saying, \"He made a mistake.\" When Kalibak asks if he can be killed, Darkseid chides his son, \"Of course not. Who would come for him?\" He then allows Kalibak to go, bidding him to kill the Kryptonian and take the Earth. Darkseid grins to himself as he asks to be left alone with his prisoner: [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]], death himself, as Darkseid resumes his torture. In the Injustice Annual, Darkseid hires the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to go to Earth and kill Superman in retaliation for the death of Kalibak at the Man of Steel's hands.

Though Darkseid subsequently wins this fight, he and his army are sent back to Apokolips by the [[Question (comics)|Question]] having infiltrated Darkseid's cadre of minions and reversed the Boom Tubes that had brought them to Earth.

He came into conflict with Vandal Savage and his sons, who were some of the first meta-humans. Impressed, as well as thinking meta-humans might be integral in the Anti-Life Equation, Darkseid formed a partnership with Savage. The two have helped each other in their various battles for conquest of the galaxy over the years. Ultimately, when Earth and Apokolips are the only two words left in the galaxy, the two will have a final battle to determine the strongest figure in the universe. In the present, when an unknown alien force (later revealed to be an alien race taken over by [[Starro]]) attacks Earth, Darkseid sends Kalibak to destroy half of the invading force (using a kidnapped meta-human as a bomb), with Savage's daughter Cassandra destroying the other half using [[Warworld]]. In the episode \"Unknown Factors\", it's post-credits scene has Granny Goodness contacting Darkseid stating that she found the Anti-Life Equation which she believes to be inside of Halo. In \"Into the Breach\", when Granny's plot to acquire the equation and enslave the heroes fails, she reports that Vandal Savage was the one responsible.

For his first appearances in the web show, Darkseid masqueraded as the math teacher '''\"Dr. Seid\"'''. In \"My So Called Anti-Life\", Dr. Seid tricks the Super Hero Girls into solving the Anti-Life Equation for him by putting it on a test. Once it is solved, Darkseid reveals his true form, explains that previous attacks by Granny Goodness and her minions were his attempts to conquer Earth, and uses the Anti-Life Equation to slowly convert Earth's population into duplicates of himself. Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Bumblebee, and Raven, who managed to dodge the Equation's effects, manage to change the people back to normal by reminding them of their true selves, which they refer to as \"adding new variables to the equation to change the answer\". After a brief fight with the restored heroes, Darkseid retreats, vowing revenge.\n\n====DC animated universe====\nDarkseid appears in various animated shows set in the [[DC animated universe]], voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]:\n\n* Darkseid first appears in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', where he is depicted as the absolute ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]] who will stop at nothing to find the elusive Anti-Life Equation, which he plans to use to reshape the universe in his image. For aeons, Apokolips and its sister planet, [[New Genesis]], have been at war with each other. They eventually formed a peace treaty by trading Darkseid's son (Orion) with Highfather's (Mister Miracle), whom Darkseid has shown great resent towards. During his first invasion of Earth (in the two-part episode \"Apokolips...Now!\"), Darkseid is confronted by the citizens of New Genesis, who deem Earth under their protection; if Darkseid ever attacked again, it would be a violation of their truce. To bypass his promise, Darkseid develops various schemes to destroy Earth indirectly, such as through the manipulation of Metropolis' criminal syndicate, [[Intergang]]. In the concluding two-part finale \"Legacy\", Darkseid attempts one final invasion of Earth which involves brainwashing [[Superman]] into thinking he is his adopted son. After causing much devastation on Earth, Superman manages to break free from Darkseid's control and confronts him on Apokolips. During their final battle, Darkseid beats and pummels Superman. But just as Darkseid attempts to use his Omega Beams to deliver the final blow, Superman covers the tyrant's eyes, causing a massive explosion which results in Darkseid's defeat. To Superman's shock, however, Darkseid's slaves willingly come to his aid after the battle by carrying his injured body away to recover. As he leaves, Darkseid explains to Superman that \"''I am many things, Kal-El, but here, I am God.''\"\n* Darkseid returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, where he is given a stylistic revamp, now featuring a more streamlined build. In the two-part episode \"Twilight\", Darkseid seeks the [[Justice League]]'s help in stopping [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] from downloading all of Apokolips' information before destroying it. Superman opposes helping his nemesis, but the rest of the League agrees in order to take down Brainiac once and for all. But after defeating Brainiac's forces and following the android back to his base, the League discover that Darkseid and Brainiac have been working together all along. As part of their arrangement, Darkseid would bring Superman to Brainiac, and in exchange, the supercomputer would spare Apokolips. However, Darkseid later betrays Brainiac by hacking his circuitry, rendering all of Brainiac's machinery under his control to find the Anti-Life Equation. But Superman is freed with [[Batman]]'s help while Orion battles Darkseid. After Darkseid defeats his son, his exit blocked by Superman, intent to finish Darkseid once and for all. This time, the angered Man of Steel actually manages to defeat Darkseid, but is prevented from killing him as the base begins to collapse, forcing Batman to bring Superman and Orion to safety via a [[boom tube]]. Buried under the rubble, Darkseid looks on and nonchalantly says \"Loser\" before being killed in the explosion of the base.\n* Darkseid makes his final and last appearance in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. When the [[Legion of Doom]] travel into deep space to the location of Brainiac's destroyed base from \"Twilight\", [[Lex Luthor]] sacrifices both the ship's power and [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] to fuel a device that will mystically draw Brainiac's essence from the debris in an attempt to resurrect the android. However, Darkseid was resurrected instead, now more powerful than ever due to merging with Brainiac's technology. After destroying the Legion's ship, Darkseid returns to Apokolips and reunifies his warring minions to claim revenge against Superman, and launches an assault on Earth. This forces the Justice League and the Legion to work together to stop the Parademons' invasion. Most notably, Batman becomes the first-ever being to avoid getting struck by Darkseid's Omega Beam. Superman then confronts Darkseid once again and is ultimately defeated when Darkseid paralyzes him with the agony matrix. But before Darkseid can kill his nemesis, Luthor, having visited the Source Wall and found the Anti-Life Equation, steps in and sacrifices himself to stop Darkseid. Both Darkseid and Luthor then touch the Equation and disappear in a flash of light. Though several heroes speculate that they may not have seen the last of them, series writer Dwayne McDuffie confirmed that Darkseid and Luthor now form part of the Source Wall, as do all who solve the Anti-Life Equation.\n\n===Film===\n* In 2014, film director [[Bryan Singer]] revealed that during the early development of the scrapped ''Superman Returns'' sequel, Darkseid was considered to be the main antagonist.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vieira |first=Anthony |url=http://screenrant.com/bryan-singer-superman-returns-criticism-darseid-sequel/ |title=Bryan Singer Responds to \u2018Superman Returns\u2019 Criticism; Wanted Darkseid for Sequel |website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=February 1, 2014 |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:DarkseidCrain.jpg|thumb|Darkseid on the cover of ''Superman/Batman: Apocalypse'' (2010).

After using a horde of Doomsday clones to distract Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, Darkseid's forces manage to capture Kara and bring her to Apokolips, where Darkseid brainwashes her into becoming the captain of the furies. When Superman arrives, Darkseid unleashes the corrupted Kara in hopes of using her to kill the Man of Steel. However, Batman activates all of the Hell Spores and threatens to destroy Apokolips, issuing Darkseid an ultimatum: free Kara and promise to leave her alone in exchange for deactivating the Spores. Darkseid then relents, releasing Kara from his control. However, Darkseid later ambushes them at the Kent Farm (he had promised to leave Kara alone, but not Superman or Earth). After using his Omega Beams to blast Superman into orbit, Darkseid overpowers Kara and is pummeled mercilessly by a furious Superman until he manages to restrain him. He unleashes the power of his Omega Beams on Superman, blackening his face until Kara then uses Darkseid's Mother Box to activate a Boom Tube, allowing Superman to blast him into it and transport him to an unknown part of space where he ends up frozen.\n* Darkseid appears in the [[DC Animated Movie Universe]] based on his [[New 52]] portrayal, where he conquers world after world after each one has run out of resources, and he has the natives turned into Parademons for his army.\n** He first appears in the film ''[[Justice League: War]]'', voiced by [[Steve Blum]], as his forces attempt to invade and terraform Earth. Per Green Lantern's idea, Flash and Wonder Woman gouge Darkseid's eyes out to prevent him from using his Omega Beams. Cyborg and Shazam get the [[boom tube]]s open to send all of the Parademons back with Darkseid. After receiving a massive beating from Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, and Wonder Woman, Darkseid is finally thrown back into the portal and returned to Apokolips.\n** Darkseid appears in ''[[Reign of the Supermen (film)|Reign of the Supermen]]'', voiced by [[Tony Todd]]. In the movie's storyline, Darkseid is revealed to had caused the events of the previous film ''[[The Death of Superman (film)|The Death of Superman]]'', unleashing and created [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] on Earth as a living biological weapon to soften up the planet's defences, also converting [[Hank Henshaw]] into his agent - Henshaw having been a casualty of Doomsday's entry to Earth when the meteor carrying Doomsday destroyed Henshaw's shuttle - with Henshaw's manipulations allowing him to apparently destroy and banish the Justice League and orchestrate a second invasion.\n** Darkseid will appear in the film ''[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]'' as the main antagonist.<ref name=\"Trailer\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/justice-league-dark-apokolips-war-trailer/|title=\u2018Justice League Dark: Apokolips War\u2019 Trailer Reveals an R-rated DC Comics Epic|last=Mancuso|first=Vinnie|website=Collider|date=March 4, 2020}}</ref>\n* Darkseid appears as in the animated film ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League]]'', voiced again by Tony Todd. He takes advantage of Bizarro's new [[Bizarro League]].\n* An alternate universe version of Darkseid appeared in a flashback scene of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Bruce Thomas]]. [[Bekka]] was supposed to be wed to his son, Orion as part of a truce between New Genesis and Apokolips only for Highfather and his army to kill him and his followers. Unlike the comics and any incarnations, this version of Darkseid is shown to be a good parent to Orion and possibly Kalibak, as seen by Orion when he saw his father killed by Highfather and Orion is shocked to see his father dead in front of him.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom]]'', with Tony Todd reprising the role. After Lex Luthor and the [[Legion of Doom]] fail, Darkseid decides to take matters into his own hands by allying himself with [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]].\n* In the [[DC Extended Universe]] Darkseid was mentioned in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' while events in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' hint at his existence; there were plans for Darkseid to make an explicit appearance in ''Justice League'', but his scene was cut. In [[Zack Snyder]] and [[Chris Terrio]]\u2019s original script for ''Justice League'', completed before the release of ''Batman v Superman'', the film was going to explore a distant future where Darkseid had taken over the Earth. After murdering [[Lois Lane]], he brings [[Superman]] under control of the [[Anti-Life Equation]] which leads to the Knightmare sequence in ''Batman v Superman''. But after the negative critical and financial reception to the theatrical cut of ''Batman v Superman'', [[Warner Bros.]] executives became nervous and asked them to rewrite parts of this script, which led them to remove these plot points to save for a later film. This effectively cut Darkseid's role down to a cameo while his lieutenant [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] took over the role of central villain. With Snyder's departure and [[Joss Whedon]]\u2019s extensive reshoots, any reference to the Knightmare sequence and distant future, as well as Darkseid's cameo, were discarded for a more streamlined, self-contained approach. Actor Ray Porter was even cast as Darkseid. Snyder released an image of Darkseid in the history lesson on his social media site Vero. Darkseid and his invading forces even originally appeared at the end of the final battle from a boom tube after Steppenwolf is killed by [[Wonder Woman]], in which both sides have an exchange before the team destroy the Motherboxes and close the boom tube on Darkseid.\n*[[Ava DuVernay]] revealed that Darkseid will appear in ''[[New Gods (film)|New Gods]]''.

He is encountered in Lex Luthor's virtual Metropolis and is sighted in a level where he is merely standing around in a parking garage. The player (uncharacteristically) easily takes him out with one punch and then has to deliver him to the police.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. He is in collaboration with Lex Luthor to enhance Intergang with Interbots.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'', voiced by [[David Sobolov]]. In this continuity, he has at some point been trapped in another dimension, and thus remains behind the scenes for most of the story as he manipulates [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with promises of unleashing great power and knowledge in exchange for acquiring a [[Mother Box]] from the Justice League Watchtower. Using the power of the Mother Box and the sensory field matrix that served as his prison, Darkseid is able to escape \u2013 saying that he has fulfilled his bargain to help Brainiac unleash great power, with the great knowledge being that one should never trust Darkseid \u2013 and remake Earth into a new Apokolips. He subsequently attempted to destroy the League with his Omega Beams, but Mother Box was able to save the League by altering the Omega Effect to send them to another dimension filled with a strange ambient energy that renders the Omega Beams useless. Now protected from Darkseid, the League return to Earth and defeat him, Wonder Woman subsequently using her Lasso of Truth to learn that only the hypercube that imprisoned Darkseid originally can imprison him again. The league activates the cube and Superman defeats Darkseid, imprisoning him once again. With Darkseid defeated, Mother Box restores Earth to normal, with Green Lantern promising to take Darkseid's hypercube somewhere where it can never be discovered and Darkseid released again.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', voiced by Perry Brown. He appears in the opening of the DC side of the Story Mode having been defeated by Superman. Attempting to flee via a [[boom tube]], Darkseid is struck by Superman's heat vision. Unknown to both of them at the same time, [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] is blasting [[Dark Kahn|Shao Kahn]] with lighting as the villain attempted to flee in a portal. These two events link together, merging both villains into an entity known as Dark Kahn. This results in both realities beginning to merge. The creature spreads its will through both realities, increasing the Rage of every fighter to the point that they become delusional and mistake friends with enemies. Confronted by both Raiden and Superman, Dark Kahn explodes and both realities separate. Darkseid ends up in the Mortal Kombat universe by accident, being imprisoned in Nether Realm. In Darkseid's ending the sorcerer Shang Tsung attempt to take Darkseid's soul to gain strength, but the villain had the process reversed on him, empowering Darkseid instead.\n* Darkseid was used as a DLC skin for [[Geras (Mortal Kombat)|Geras]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''.\n* Darkseid appears in ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]''.

It was written by [[Julian of Norwich]], about whom almost nothing is known. The book is remarkable for being the earliest surviving example of a book in the [[English language]] known to have been written by a woman.\n\nJulian, who lived all her life in the English city of [[Norwich]], wrote about the sixteen mystical visions or \"shewings\" she received in 1373, when she was in her thirties. Whilst seriously ill, and believing to be on her deathbed, the visions appeared to her over a period of several hours in one night, with a final revelation occurring the following night. After making a full recovery, she wrote an account of each vision, producing a [[manuscript]] now referred to as the ''Short Text''. She developed her ideas over a period of decades, whilst living as an [[Anchorite|anchoress]] in a cell attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich]], and wrote a far more extended version of her writings, now known as the ''Long Text''. She wrote straightforwardly in [[Middle English]].\n\nJulian's work was preserved by others. Various manuscripts of both the ''Long Text'' and the ''Short Text'', in addition to extracts, have survived, which have been used to produce many editions of her book, mainly in English, but also in other languages. The first publication of the book was a translation of the ''Long Text'' in 1670 by the English [[Benedictines|Benedictine monk]] [[Serenus de Cressy]].\n\n==Julian of Norwich==\n{{Main|Julian of Norwich}}\n[[File:Statue of Dame Julian.JPG|thumb|David Holgate's modern statue of [[Julian of Norwich]], depicted holding a copy of ''Revelations of Divine Love''.

It is the first book in [[English language|English]] known to have been written by a woman.{{sfn|Julian of Norwich|1998}} Throughout her life Julian lived in the city of [[Norwich]], an important commercial and religious centre in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Rawcliffe|Wilson|2004|p=158}} The [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] of 1348\u201350, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and the suppression of the [[Lollardy|Lollards]], all occurred during her lifetime.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|pp=25-6}} \n\nIn 1373, seriously ill and convinced she was close to death, the 30-year-old Julian received a series of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] or 'shewings' of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]],{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=ix}} after which she recovered from her illness. Julian then lived the rest of her life as an anchoress, in a [[Monastic cell|cell]] attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich|St Julian's Church]].{{sfn|Baker|1993|p=148}}  Julian's true name and details of her life remain unknown, but she is known with certainty to have existed, as she was the recipient of a number of wills,{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=xiv}} and she is mentioned in an account by the celebrated mystic [[Margery Kempe]], who met her at her cell in Norwich.{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=viii}}\n\nJulian referred to herself in her writings as \"a simple creature unlettered\", a phrase perhaps used to avoid antagonising or offending her readers, especially in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  The term ''unlettered'' in the [[Middle Ages]] might have meant that she did not receive a formal education, rarely available to laywomen.<ref name = \"Jantzen\">{{citation | last = Jantzen | first = G | title = Julian of Norwich: Mystic and Theologian | publisher = Paulist Press | year = 1988}}</ref>{{rp |15\u20136}} The city contained many [[Convent|convents]] whose orders recognized the importance of education.

It is possible that Julian had an educated brother and she became literate through him.<ref name = \"Jantzen\" />{{rp |15\u20137}}\n\n==Julian's writings==\n''Revelations of Divine Love'' is unique, as no other work written by an English anchoress seems to have survived. In the 14th century, women in England were generally barred from high-status clerical positions or other authoritative roles such as teaching, and their knowledge of Latin, the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the day, would have been limited. It is more likely that they read and wrote in [[Middle English]], their [[vernacular]] language, as Julian did.{{sfn|Leyser|2002|p=212}} Her life was contemporaneous with four other English [[Mysticism|mystics]]\u2014[[Walter Hilton]], [[Richard Rolle]], [[Margery Kempe]], and the unknown author of the work known as ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing|The Cloude of Unknowyng]]''\u2014all of whom wrote in the vernacular.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=7}} The historian [[Janina Ramirez]] has suggested that their use of Middle English was a sensible choice, considering the inexplicable nature of what they were attempting to describe.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=7}}\n\nJulian's writings were not mentioned in medieval [[bequest]]s, as often happened for male authors.{{sfn|Rolf|2013|p=8}} Some Middle English spiritual texts were written for a specific readership, such as ''The Cloude of Unknowyng'', which was intended by the author to be read by a young [[hermit]], but Julian wrote as if for a general readership. There is no evidence that her writings influenced other medieval authors, or were read by more than a very few people until 1670, when her book was first published by [[Serenus de Cressy]] under the title ''XVI Revelations of Divine Love, Shewed to a Devout Servant of Our Lord, called Mother Juliana, an Anchorete of Norwich: Who lived in the Dayes of King Edward the Third''.<ref name=\"ADD\">{{cite web |url= https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/the-shewings-of-julian-of-norwich-introduction|title= The Shewings of Julian of Norwich: Introduction |last= Crampton|first= Georgia Ronan|date= 1994|series= Middle English Text Series|publisher= [[University of Rochester]]|location= New York|access-date= 15 February 2019}}</ref> Since then the book been published under a variety of different titles,{{sfn|Newman|2011|p=427}}{{refn|1=The usual title of Julian of Norwich's work, ''Revelations of Divine Love'', originated from the title provided by Cressy in 1670.

Complete versions of the ''Long Text'' survive in the form of three separate manuscripts, all dating from the sixteenth century. Another manuscript, known as [[Westminster Cathedral]] Treasury MS4, written between 1450 and 1500, includes extracts from the ''Long Text'' and the mystic Walter Hilton. It was discovered in 1955, and is now kept in [[Westminster Cathedral]]. \n\nA single manuscript of the earlier ''Short Text'', dating from the mid-fifteenth century, has survived. Now kept in the British Library, it is contained within \"Add MS 37790\",  also known as the Amherst Manuscript, an anthology of spiritual works written in Middle English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?index=0&ref=Add_MS_37790 |title=A Carthusian anthology of theological works in English (the ''Amherst Manuscript'') |id=Add MS 37790 |series=Digitised Manuscripts |website= [[British Library]]}} On the [[folio]] pages 97r-115r, the text contains the rubric, \"''Here es a vision schewed be the goodenes of god to a devoute woman and hir name es Julyan that is recluse atte Norwyche and zitt ys on lyfe anno domini millesimo ccccxiii''\"</ref>\n\nA lost manuscript, \"Upholland MS\", was copied in the 1670s or 1680s by the exiled English Benedictine nun Barbara Constable in the French town of [[Cambrai]].

It was written by [[Julian of Norwich]], about whom almost nothing is known. The book is remarkable for being the earliest surviving example of a book in the [[English language]] known to have been written by a woman.\n\nJulian, who lived all her life in the English city of [[Norwich]], wrote about the sixteen mystical visions or \"shewings\" she received in 1373, when she was in her thirties. Whilst seriously ill, and believing to be on her deathbed, the visions appeared to her over a period of several hours in one night, with a final revelation occurring the following night. After making a full recovery, she wrote an account of each vision, producing a [[manuscript]] now referred to as the ''Short Text''. She developed her ideas over a period of decades, whilst living as an [[Anchorite|anchoress]] in a cell attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich]], and wrote a far more extended version of her writings, now known as the ''Long Text''. She wrote straightforwardly in [[Middle English]].\n\nJulian's work was preserved by others. Various manuscripts of both the ''Long Text'' and the ''Short Text'', in addition to extracts, have survived, which have been used to produce many editions of her book, mainly in English, but also in other languages. The first publication of the book was a translation of the ''Long Text'' in 1670 by the English [[Benedictines|Benedictine monk]] [[Serenus de Cressy]].\n\n==Julian of Norwich==\n{{Main|Julian of Norwich}}\n[[File:Statue of Dame Julian.JPG|thumb|David Holgate's modern statue of [[Julian of Norwich]], depicted holding a copy of ''Revelations of Divine Love''.

It is the first book in [[English language|English]] known to have been written by a woman.{{sfn|Julian of Norwich|1998}} Throughout her life Julian lived in the city of [[Norwich]], an important commercial and religious centre in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Rawcliffe|Wilson|2004|p=158}} The [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] of 1348\u201350, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and the suppression of the [[Lollardy|Lollards]], all occurred during her lifetime.{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Ramirez|2016|pp=25-6}} \n\nIn 1373, seriously ill and convinced she was close to death, the 30-year-old Julian received a series of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] or 'shewings' of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]],{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=ix}} after which she recovered from her illness. Julian then lived the rest of her life as an anchoress, in a [[Monastic cell|cell]] attached to [[St Julian's Church, Norwich|St Julian's Church]].{{sfn|Baker|1993|p=148}}  Julian's true name and details of her life remain unknown, but she is known with certainty to have existed, as she was the recipient of a number of wills,{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=xiv}} and she is mentioned in an account by the celebrated mystic [[Margery Kempe]], who met her at her cell in Norwich.{{sfn|Windeatt|2015|p=viii}}\n\nJulian referred to herself in her writings as \"a simple creature unlettered\", a phrase perhaps used to avoid antagonising or offending her readers, especially in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.  The term ''unlettered'' in the [[Middle Ages]] might have meant that she did not receive a formal education, rarely available to laywomen.<ref name = \"Jantzen\">{{citation | last = Jantzen | first = G | title = Julian of Norwich: Mystic and Theologian | publisher = Paulist Press | year = 1988}}</ref>{{rp |15\u20136}} The city contained many [[Convent|convents]] whose orders recognized the importance of education. Many had boarding schools for girls, where they were taught to read and write.<ref name = \"Jantzen\" />{{rp |16}} Scholars are not sure whether Julian attended such a school. It is possible that Julian had an educated brother and she became literate through him.<ref name = \"Jantzen\" />{{rp |15\u20137}}\n\n==Julian's writings==\n''Revelations of Divine Love'' is unique, as no other work written by an English anchoress seems to have survived. In the 14th century, women in England were generally barred from high-status clerical positions or other authoritative roles such as teaching, and their knowledge of Latin, the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the day, would have been limited.

''Atlantis'' was commanded by ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' [[Bernhard Rogge]], who received the [[Iron Cross|Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. She was sunk on 22 November 1941 by the British [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}.\n\nCommerce raiders do not seek to engage warships, but rather attack enemy merchant shipping; the measures of success are tonnage destroyed (or captured) and time spent at large. ''Atlantis'' was second only to {{Ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Pinguin||2}} in tonnage destroyed, and had the longest raiding career of any German commerce raider in either world war. She captured highly secret documents from {{SS|Automedon}}. A version of the story of ''Atlantis'' is told in the film ''[[Under Ten Flags]]'' with [[Van Heflin]] appearing as Captain Rogge.\n\n==Early history==\nBuilt by [[Bremer Vulkan]] in 1937,<ref name=mohr/> she began her career as the [[cargo ship]] ''Goldenfels'', owned and operated by [[DDG Hansa]], [[Bremen]]. ''Goldenfels'' was powered by two Six-cylinder Single Cycle Double Action [[diesel engine]]s, built by Bremer Vulkan. She was allocated the [[Code Letters]] DOTP.<ref name=Goldenfels38>{{cite web |url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=38b0354.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, STEAMERS AND MOTORSHIPS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> In late 1939 she was requisitioned by the ''Kriegsmarine'' and converted into a warship by [[DeSchiMAG]], Bremen.

She had a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] amidships. She had a crew of 349 (21 officers and 328 enlisted sailors) and a [[Scottish terrier]], Ferry, as mascot. The cruiser carried a dummy funnel and variable-height masts, and was well supplied with paint, canvas, and materials for further altering her appearance, including costumes for the crew and flags. ''Atlantis'' was capable of being modified to twenty-six different silhouettes.\n\n===Weapons and aircraft===\nThe ship was equipped with six {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, one {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun on the bow, two twin-37&nbsp;mm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and four [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm automatic cannon]]s; all of these were hidden, mostly behind pivotable false deck or side structures. A phony crane and [[deckhouse]] on the aft section hid two of the {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns; the other four guns were concealed via flaps in the side<ref>Muggenthaler, August Karl ''German Raiders of World War II'' Prentice-Hall, 1977, {{ISBN|0-13-354027-8}}, p16</ref><ref name=rogge>Rogge, Bernhard ''The German Raider Atlantis'', Ballantine, 1956</ref>{{rp|46}} that were raised when action was imminent. ''Atlantis'' also had four waterline [[torpedo tube]]s, and a 92-[[Naval mine|mine]] compartment. This gave her the fire power, and more importantly the fire control, of a light cruiser. The ship also carried two [[Heinkel He 114|Heinkel He-114C]] [[seaplane]]s in one of its holds, one of these was fully assembled and the other one was packed away in crates.<ref name=Duffy>{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=James P.|title=Hitler's secret pirate fleet : the deadliest ships of World War II|year=2001|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

By this time, ''Atlantis'' was pretending to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vessel named ''Kim'' by flying the Soviet naval ensign, displaying a hammer and sickle on the bridge, and having Russian and English warnings on the stern, \"Keep clear of propellers\". The Soviet Union was neutral at the time.\n\nAfter crossing the equator, on 24\u201325 April, she took the guise of the Japanese vessel ''Kasii Maru''. The ship now displayed a large K upon a red-topped funnel, identification of the [[K Line]] transportation company. She also had rising sun symbols on the gun flaps and Japanese characters (copied from a magazine) on the aft hull.\n\n===''City of Exeter''===\nOn 2 May, she met the British passenger liner {{SS|City of Exeter}}.

Once the ships had parted, ''Exeter''{{'}}s Master radioed his suspicions about the \"Japanese\" ship to the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=bismarckclass>[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/hilfskreuzer/atlantis.html Hilfskreuzer (Auxiliary Cruiser / Raider) Atlantis \u2013 The History]</ref>\n\n===''Scientist''===\nOn 3 May, ''Atlantis'' met a British [[cargo ship]], ''Scientist'', which was carrying [[ore]] and [[jute]]. The Germans raised their [[battle ensign]] and displayed signal pennants stating, \"Stop or I fire! Don't use your radio!\" The {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun fired a warning shot. The British immediately began transmitting their alarm signal, \"QQQQ...QQQQ...Unidentified merchantman has ordered me to stop\", and the Germans began transmitting so as to jam the signals.\n\n''Scientist'' turned to flee, but on the second salvo from ''Atlantis'' flames exploded from the ship, followed by a cloud of dust and then white steam from the boilers. A British sailor was killed and the remaining 77 were taken as prisoners of war. After failing to sink the ship with demolition charges, ''Atlantis'' used guns and a torpedo to finish off ''Scientist''.\n\n===Cape Agulhas===\nContinuing to sail south, ''Atlantis'' passed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching [[Cape Agulhas]] on 10 May. Here she set up a minefield with 92 horned contact [[naval mine]]s, in a way which suggested that a U-boat had laid them. The minefield was successful, but the deception was foiled and the ship's presence revealed by a German [[propaganda]] [[broadcast]] boasting that \"a minefield, sown by a German raider\" had sunk no fewer than eight merchant ships, three more were overdue, three minesweepers were involved, and the Royal Navy was not capable of finding \"a solitary raider\" operating in \"its own back yard\". Furthermore, a British signal was sent from Ceylon on 20 May and intercepted by Germany, based on the report from ''City of Exeter'', warning shipping of a German raider disguised as a Japanese ship.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\n''Atlantis'' headed into the [[Indian Ocean]] disguised as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] vessel MV ''Abbekerk''. She received a broadcast\u2014which happened to be incorrect\u2014reporting that ''Abbekerk'' had been sunk, but retained that identity rather than repainting, as there were several similar Dutch vessels.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\n===''Tirranna'', ''City of Baghdad'', and the ''Kemmendine''===\n[[File:Tirranna (ship).tif|thumb|''Tirranna''<ref>[https://viewer.slv.vic.gov.au/?entity=IE916003&mode=browse ''Tirranna''], State Library of Victoria.

Filled with supplies for Australian troops in the Middle East, ''Tirranna'' was captured and sent to France.\n\nOn 11 July, the liner ''City of Baghdad'' was fired upon at a range of {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}. A boarding party discovered a copy of ''[[Broadcasting for Allied Merchant Ships]]'', which contained communications codes. ''City of Baghdad'', like ''Atlantis'', was a former [[DDG Hansa]] ship, having been captured by the British in World War I. A copy of the report sent by ''City of Exeter'' was found, describing ''Atlantis'' in minute detail and including a photograph of the similar ''Freienfels'', confirming that the \"Japanese\" identity had not been believed. Rogge had his ship's profile altered, adding two new masts.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\nAt 10:09 on 13 July, ''Atlantis'' encountered a passenger liner, ''Kemmendine'', which was heading for Burma. The crew on the ''Kemmendine'' opened fire on ''Atlantis ''with a 3-inch gun mounted on ''Kemmendine'''s stern. ''Atlantis ''returned fire, and ''Kemmendine'' was quickly ablaze. All the passengers and crew were taken off ''Kemmendine'', and ''Kemmendine ''was then sunk.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|16}}\n\n===''Talleyrand'' and ''King City''===\nIn August, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Talleyrand'', the sister ship of ''Tirranna''. Then she encountered ''[[King City (naval vessel)|King City]]'', carrying coal, which was mistaken for a British [[Q-Ship]] due to its erratic maneuvering caused by mechanical difficulties. Three shells from ''Atlantis'' destroyed ''King City'''s bridge, killing four merchant cadets and a cabin boy. Another wounded sailor later died on the operating table aboard ''Atlantis''.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|18}}\n\n===''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', ''Commissaire Ramel'', ''Durmitor'', ''Teddy'', and ''Ole Jacob''===\nIn September, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', and {{SS|Commissaire Ramel||2}}. All of these were sunk only after supplies, documents, and POWs were taken. In October, the Germans took the [[Yugoslavia]]n steamboat ''Durmitor'', loaded with a cargo of salt. Yugoslavia was neutral at the time, but Captain Rogge was desperate for an opportunity for ''Atlantis'' to get rid of the POWs that had accumulated on board, so the ship was captured because it had been carrying coal from [[Cardiff]] to [[Oran]] before its current voyage.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|19}}  Captured documents and 260 POWs were transferred to ''Durmitor'', which, with a prize crew of 14 Germans commanded by Lt. Dehnel, was dispatched to Italian-controlled [[Mogadishu]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=126}}</ref> Lacking sufficient fuel, the ''Durmitor'' resorted to sails and, after a \"hellish\" voyage, made landfall in [[Warsheikh]], north of Mogadishu, on 22 November, five weeks after departure.<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=130}}.

Dehnel's prize crew on ''Durmitor'' sailed to [[Kismayo|Kisimayu]]. -->\n\nIn the second week of November, two Norwegian tankers: ''Teddy'' and ''Ole Jacob'' were seized by ''Atlantis''. On both occasions, ''Atlantis'' presented itself as [[SS Antenor (1924)|HMS ''Antenor'']].<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|pp=134\u2013137}}.</ref>\n\n===''Automedon'' and her secret cargo===\n{{Main|SS Automedon}}\nAt about 07:00 on 11 November 1940, ''Atlantis'' encountered the [[Blue Funnel Line]] cargo ship ''Automedon'' about {{convert|250|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Sumatra]]. At 08:20, ''Atlantis'' fired a warning shot across ''Automedon'''s bow, and her radio operator at once began transmitting a distress call of \"RRRR \u2013 Automedon \u2013 0416N\" (\"RRRR\" meant \"under attack by armed raider<ref name=\"Turner22\"/>\").\n\nAt a range of around {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, ''Atlantis'' shelled ''Automedon'', ceasing fire after three minutes in which she had destroyed her bridge, accommodation, and lifeboats. Six crew members were killed and twelve injured.\n\nThe Germans boarded the stricken ship and broke into the strong room, where they found fifteen bags of [[Top Secret]] mail for the [[British Far East Command]], including a large quantity of decoding tables, fleet orders, gunnery instructions, and naval intelligence reports. After wasting an hour breaking open the ship's safe only to discover \"a few shillings in cash\", a search of the ''Automedon'''s chart room found a small weighted green bag marked \"Highly Confidential\" containing the Chief of Staff's report to the Commander in Chief Far East, [[Robert Brooke Popham]]. The bag was supposed to be thrown overboard if there was risk of loss, but the personnel responsible for this had been killed or incapacitated. The report contained the latest assessment of the Japanese Empire's military strength in the Far East, along with details of [[Royal Air Force]] units, naval strength, and notes on [[Singapore]]'s defences. It painted a gloomy picture of British land and naval capabilities in the Far East, and declared that Britain was too weak to risk war with Japan.<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|117}}\n\n''Automedon'' was sunk at 15:07. Rogge soon realised the importance of the intelligence material he had captured and quickly transferred the documents to the recently acquired prize vessel ''Ole Jacob'', ordering Lieutenant Commander Paul Kamenz and six of his crew to take charge of the vessel. After an uneventful voyage they arrived in [[Kobe]], Japan, on 4 December 1940.\n\nThe mail reached the German Embassy in Tokyo on 5 December. The German Naval attach\u00e9 [[Paul Wenneker]] had the summary of the British plan wired to Berlin, while the original was hand-carried by Kamenz to Berlin via the [[Trans-Siberian railway]]. A copy was given to the Japanese, to whom it provided valuable intelligence prior to their [[Pacific War#Japan attacks the Western Powers|commencing hostilities against the Western Powers]]. Rogge was rewarded for this with an ornate [[katana]]; the only other Germans so honoured were [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]].{{citation required|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter reading the captured Chief of Staff report, on 7 January 1941 Japanese [[Admiral Yamamoto]] wrote to the Naval Minister asking whether, if Japan knocked out America, the remaining British and Dutch forces would be suitably weakened for the Japanese to deliver a death blow; the ''Automedon'' intelligence on the weakness of the [[British Empire]] is thus credibly linked with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the attack leading to the [[fall of Singapore]].<ref>Seki, Eiji.

There the crewmen did maintenance and replenished their water supplies. The ship's complement suffered its first fatality when a sailor, named Bernhard Herrmann, fell while painting the funnel. He was buried in what is sometimes referred to as \"the southernmost of all German war graves\".<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|134}}\n\nIn late January 1941, off the eastern coast of Africa, ''Atlantis'' sank the British ship ''Mandasor'' and captured ''[[Doggerbank (ship)|Speybank]]''. Then, on 2 February, the Norwegian tanker ''Ketty Br\u00f8vig'' was relieved of her fuel. The fuel was used not only for the German raider, but also to refuel the [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|German cruiser ''Admiral Scheer'']] and, on 29 March the Italian submarine ''[[Italian submarine Perla|Perla]]''. ''Perla'' was making its way from the port of [[Massawa]] in [[Italian East Africa]], around the Cape of Good Hope, to [[Bordeaux]] in France. Rogge wrote in his memoirs that, after seeing the small coastal submarine and its emaciated crew, he told the commander, Lt. Bruno Napp, his perplexity about his mission and suggested him to reach either Brazil or Argentina to be interned; by his account, Napp politely rejected the advice, telling that he would do his utmost to obey his orders, much to Rogge's admiration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giorgerini|first1=Giorgio|title=Uomini sul fondo : storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi|date=2002|publisher=Mondadori|location=Milano|isbn=8804505370|pages=413\u20134}}</ref>\n\n===''Zamzam''===\nBy April, ''Atlantis'' had returned to the Atlantic where, on April 17, Rogge, mistaking the [[Egypt]]ian liner ''[[Zamzam_(ship)|Zamzam]] '' for a British liner being used as a troop carrier or Q-ship\u2014as she was in fact the former [[Bibby Line]]r ''Leicestershire''\u2014opened fire at a range of {{convert|8.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Without the knowledge of French authorities, the Germans landed on [[Vanavana]] Island and traded with the inhabitants. They then hunted Allied shipping in the area between [[Pitcairn]] and uninhabited [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson]] islands, making a landing on Henderson Island. The seaplane from ''Atlantis'' made several fruitless reconnaissance flights.

''Atlantis'' was commanded by ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' [[Bernhard Rogge]], who received the [[Iron Cross|Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. She was sunk on 22 November 1941 by the British [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}.\n\nCommerce raiders do not seek to engage warships, but rather attack enemy merchant shipping; the measures of success are tonnage destroyed (or captured) and time spent at large. ''Atlantis'' was second only to {{Ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Pinguin||2}} in tonnage destroyed, and had the longest raiding career of any German commerce raider in either world war. She captured highly secret documents from {{SS|Automedon}}. A version of the story of ''Atlantis'' is told in the film ''[[Under Ten Flags]]'' with [[Van Heflin]] appearing as Captain Rogge.\n\n==Early history==\nBuilt by [[Bremer Vulkan]] in 1937,<ref name=mohr/> she began her career as the [[cargo ship]] ''Goldenfels'', owned and operated by [[DDG Hansa]], [[Bremen]].

She had a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] amidships. She had a crew of 349 (21 officers and 328 enlisted sailors) and a [[Scottish terrier]], Ferry, as mascot. The cruiser carried a dummy funnel and variable-height masts, and was well supplied with paint, canvas, and materials for further altering her appearance, including costumes for the crew and flags. ''Atlantis'' was capable of being modified to twenty-six different silhouettes.\n\n===Weapons and aircraft===\nThe ship was equipped with six {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, one {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun on the bow, two twin-37&nbsp;mm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s and four [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm automatic cannon]]s; all of these were hidden, mostly behind pivotable false deck or side structures.

''Atlantis'' also had four waterline [[torpedo tube]]s, and a 92-[[Naval mine|mine]] compartment. This gave her the fire power, and more importantly the fire control, of a light cruiser. The ship also carried two [[Heinkel He 114|Heinkel He-114C]] [[seaplane]]s in one of its holds, one of these was fully assembled and the other one was packed away in crates.<ref name=Duffy>{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=James P.|title=Hitler's secret pirate fleet : the deadliest ships of World War II|year=2001|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

Commissioned in mid-December, she was the first of nine or ten merchant ships armed by the [[Third Reich]] for the purposes of seeking out and engaging enemy cargo vessels. ''Atlantis'' was delayed by ice until 31 March 1940,<ref name=\"Turner22\">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=L.C.F.|title=War in the Southern Oceans: 1939\u201345|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=22}}</ref> when the former [[battleship]] {{ship|SMS|Hessen||2}} was sent to act as an [[icebreaker]], clearing the way for ''Atlantis'', ''Orion'', and ''Widder''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

By this time, ''Atlantis'' was pretending to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vessel named ''Kim'' by flying the Soviet naval ensign, displaying a hammer and sickle on the bridge, and having Russian and English warnings on the stern, \"Keep clear of propellers\". The Soviet Union was neutral at the time.\n\nAfter crossing the equator, on 24\u201325 April, she took the guise of the Japanese vessel ''Kasii Maru''. The ship now displayed a large K upon a red-topped funnel, identification of the [[K Line]] transportation company. She also had rising sun symbols on the gun flaps and Japanese characters (copied from a magazine) on the aft hull.\n\n===''City of Exeter''===\nOn 2 May, she met the British passenger liner {{SS|City of Exeter}}. Rogge, unwilling to cause non-combatant casualties, declined to attack. Once the ships had parted, ''Exeter''{{'}}s Master radioed his suspicions about the \"Japanese\" ship to the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=bismarckclass>[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/hilfskreuzer/atlantis.html Hilfskreuzer (Auxiliary Cruiser / Raider) Atlantis \u2013 The History]</ref>\n\n===''Scientist''===\nOn 3 May, ''Atlantis'' met a British [[cargo ship]], ''Scientist'', which was carrying [[ore]] and [[jute]]. The Germans raised their [[battle ensign]] and displayed signal pennants stating, \"Stop or I fire! Don't use your radio!\" The {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun fired a warning shot. The British immediately began transmitting their alarm signal, \"QQQQ...QQQQ...Unidentified merchantman has ordered me to stop\", and the Germans began transmitting so as to jam the signals.\n\n''Scientist'' turned to flee, but on the second salvo from ''Atlantis'' flames exploded from the ship, followed by a cloud of dust and then white steam from the boilers. A British sailor was killed and the remaining 77 were taken as prisoners of war. After failing to sink the ship with demolition charges, ''Atlantis'' used guns and a torpedo to finish off ''Scientist''.\n\n===Cape Agulhas===\nContinuing to sail south, ''Atlantis'' passed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching [[Cape Agulhas]] on 10 May. Here she set up a minefield with 92 horned contact [[naval mine]]s, in a way which suggested that a U-boat had laid them. The minefield was successful, but the deception was foiled and the ship's presence revealed by a German [[propaganda]] [[broadcast]] boasting that \"a minefield, sown by a German raider\" had sunk no fewer than eight merchant ships, three more were overdue, three minesweepers were involved, and the Royal Navy was not capable of finding \"a solitary raider\" operating in \"its own back yard\". Furthermore, a British signal was sent from Ceylon on 20 May and intercepted by Germany, based on the report from ''City of Exeter'', warning shipping of a German raider disguised as a Japanese ship.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\n''Atlantis'' headed into the [[Indian Ocean]] disguised as the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] vessel MV ''Abbekerk''. She received a broadcast\u2014which happened to be incorrect\u2014reporting that ''Abbekerk'' had been sunk, but retained that identity rather than repainting, as there were several similar Dutch vessels.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\n===''Tirranna'', ''City of Baghdad'', and the ''Kemmendine''===\n[[File:Tirranna (ship).tif|thumb|''Tirranna''<ref>[https://viewer.slv.vic.gov.au/?entity=IE916003&mode=browse ''Tirranna''], State Library of Victoria.

Filled with supplies for Australian troops in the Middle East, ''Tirranna'' was captured and sent to France.\n\nOn 11 July, the liner ''City of Baghdad'' was fired upon at a range of {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}. A boarding party discovered a copy of ''[[Broadcasting for Allied Merchant Ships]]'', which contained communications codes. ''City of Baghdad'', like ''Atlantis'', was a former [[DDG Hansa]] ship, having been captured by the British in World War I. A copy of the report sent by ''City of Exeter'' was found, describing ''Atlantis'' in minute detail and including a photograph of the similar ''Freienfels'', confirming that the \"Japanese\" identity had not been believed. Rogge had his ship's profile altered, adding two new masts.<ref name=bismarckclass/>\n\nAt 10:09 on 13 July, ''Atlantis'' encountered a passenger liner, ''Kemmendine'', which was heading for Burma. The crew on the ''Kemmendine'' opened fire on ''Atlantis ''with a 3-inch gun mounted on ''Kemmendine'''s stern. ''Atlantis ''returned fire, and ''Kemmendine'' was quickly ablaze. All the passengers and crew were taken off ''Kemmendine'', and ''Kemmendine ''was then sunk.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|16}}\n\n===''Talleyrand'' and ''King City''===\nIn August, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Talleyrand'', the sister ship of ''Tirranna''. Then she encountered ''[[King City (naval vessel)|King City]]'', carrying coal, which was mistaken for a British [[Q-Ship]] due to its erratic maneuvering caused by mechanical difficulties. Three shells from ''Atlantis'' destroyed ''King City'''s bridge, killing four merchant cadets and a cabin boy. Another wounded sailor later died on the operating table aboard ''Atlantis''.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|18}}\n\n===''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', ''Commissaire Ramel'', ''Durmitor'', ''Teddy'', and ''Ole Jacob''===\nIn September, ''Atlantis'' sank ''Athelking'', ''Benarty'', and {{SS|Commissaire Ramel||2}}. All of these were sunk only after supplies, documents, and POWs were taken. In October, the Germans took the [[Yugoslavia]]n steamboat ''Durmitor'', loaded with a cargo of salt. Yugoslavia was neutral at the time, but Captain Rogge was desperate for an opportunity for ''Atlantis'' to get rid of the POWs that had accumulated on board, so the ship was captured because it had been carrying coal from [[Cardiff]] to [[Oran]] before its current voyage.<ref name=\"Duffy\" />{{Rp|19}}  Captured documents and 260 POWs were transferred to ''Durmitor'', which, with a prize crew of 14 Germans commanded by Lt. Dehnel, was dispatched to Italian-controlled [[Mogadishu]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=126}}</ref> Lacking sufficient fuel, the ''Durmitor'' resorted to sails and, after a \"hellish\" voyage, made landfall in [[Warsheikh]], north of Mogadishu, on 22 November, five weeks after departure.<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=130}}.

Dehnel's prize crew on ''Durmitor'' sailed to [[Kismayo|Kisimayu]]. -->\n\nIn the second week of November, two Norwegian tankers: ''Teddy'' and ''Ole Jacob'' were seized by ''Atlantis''. On both occasions, ''Atlantis'' presented itself as [[SS Antenor (1924)|HMS ''Antenor'']].<ref>{{harvnb|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|pp=134\u2013137}}.</ref>\n\n===''Automedon'' and her secret cargo===\n{{Main|SS Automedon}}\nAt about 07:00 on 11 November 1940, ''Atlantis'' encountered the [[Blue Funnel Line]] cargo ship ''Automedon'' about {{convert|250|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Sumatra]]. At 08:20, ''Atlantis'' fired a warning shot across ''Automedon'''s bow, and her radio operator at once began transmitting a distress call of \"RRRR \u2013 Automedon \u2013 0416N\" (\"RRRR\" meant \"under attack by armed raider<ref name=\"Turner22\"/>\").\n\nAt a range of around {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, ''Atlantis'' shelled ''Automedon'', ceasing fire after three minutes in which she had destroyed her bridge, accommodation, and lifeboats. Six crew members were killed and twelve injured.\n\nThe Germans boarded the stricken ship and broke into the strong room, where they found fifteen bags of [[Top Secret]] mail for the [[British Far East Command]], including a large quantity of decoding tables, fleet orders, gunnery instructions, and naval intelligence reports. After wasting an hour breaking open the ship's safe only to discover \"a few shillings in cash\", a search of the ''Automedon'''s chart room found a small weighted green bag marked \"Highly Confidential\" containing the Chief of Staff's report to the Commander in Chief Far East, [[Robert Brooke Popham]]. The bag was supposed to be thrown overboard if there was risk of loss, but the personnel responsible for this had been killed or incapacitated. The report contained the latest assessment of the Japanese Empire's military strength in the Far East, along with details of [[Royal Air Force]] units, naval strength, and notes on [[Singapore]]'s defences. It painted a gloomy picture of British land and naval capabilities in the Far East, and declared that Britain was too weak to risk war with Japan.<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|117}}\n\n''Automedon'' was sunk at 15:07. Rogge soon realised the importance of the intelligence material he had captured and quickly transferred the documents to the recently acquired prize vessel ''Ole Jacob'', ordering Lieutenant Commander Paul Kamenz and six of his crew to take charge of the vessel. After an uneventful voyage they arrived in [[Kobe]], Japan, on 4 December 1940.\n\nThe mail reached the German Embassy in Tokyo on 5 December. The German Naval attach\u00e9 [[Paul Wenneker]] had the summary of the British plan wired to Berlin, while the original was hand-carried by Kamenz to Berlin via the [[Trans-Siberian railway]]. A copy was given to the Japanese, to whom it provided valuable intelligence prior to their [[Pacific War#Japan attacks the Western Powers|commencing hostilities against the Western Powers]]. Rogge was rewarded for this with an ornate [[katana]]; the only other Germans so honoured were [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]].{{citation required|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter reading the captured Chief of Staff report, on 7 January 1941 Japanese [[Admiral Yamamoto]] wrote to the Naval Minister asking whether, if Japan knocked out America, the remaining British and Dutch forces would be suitably weakened for the Japanese to deliver a death blow; the ''Automedon'' intelligence on the weakness of the [[British Empire]] is thus credibly linked with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the attack leading to the [[fall of Singapore]].<ref>Seki, Eiji.

He was buried in what is sometimes referred to as \"the southernmost of all German war graves\".<ref name=rogge/>{{rp|134}}\n\nIn late January 1941, off the eastern coast of Africa, ''Atlantis'' sank the British ship ''Mandasor'' and captured ''[[Doggerbank (ship)|Speybank]]''. Then, on 2 February, the Norwegian tanker ''Ketty Br\u00f8vig'' was relieved of her fuel. The fuel was used not only for the German raider, but also to refuel the [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|German cruiser ''Admiral Scheer'']] and, on 29 March the Italian submarine ''[[Italian submarine Perla|Perla]]''. ''Perla'' was making its way from the port of [[Massawa]] in [[Italian East Africa]], around the Cape of Good Hope, to [[Bordeaux]] in France. Rogge wrote in his memoirs that, after seeing the small coastal submarine and its emaciated crew, he told the commander, Lt. Bruno Napp, his perplexity about his mission and suggested him to reach either Brazil or Argentina to be interned; by his account, Napp politely rejected the advice, telling that he would do his utmost to obey his orders, much to Rogge's admiration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giorgerini|first1=Giorgio|title=Uomini sul fondo : storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi|date=2002|publisher=Mondadori|location=Milano|isbn=8804505370|pages=413\u20134}}</ref>\n\n===''Zamzam''===\nBy April, ''Atlantis'' had returned to the Atlantic where, on April 17, Rogge, mistaking the [[Egypt]]ian liner ''[[Zamzam_(ship)|Zamzam]] '' for a British liner being used as a troop carrier or Q-ship\u2014as she was in fact the former [[Bibby Line]]r ''Leicestershire''\u2014opened fire at a range of {{convert|8.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Without the knowledge of French authorities, the Germans landed on [[Vanavana]] Island and traded with the inhabitants.

Martin Litton studied music at Colchester Institute, graduating with a BA (Honours) degree in 1978. There he met future colleagues Martin Wheatley and Paul Lacy with whom he formed the band The Faculty of Jazz. During his final year he took time out to play in London with one of the oldest established traditional jazz bands, Steve Lane's Southern Stompers.\n\n== Career ==\n===Early career===\nHis playing style is influenced by the likes of Jelly Roll Morton, Willie 'The Lion' Smith and Teddy Wilson to name just a few. An early career breakthrough came through playing with Kenny Ball from 1983 - 1985 on his British and Russian tours and for recording sessions with George Chisholm. By 1987 James Asman was writing of Litton in the Jazz Rag magazine<ref>{{cite news|title=Playing for Kicks - Kenny Davern and Martin Litton|first=Asman|last=James|work=Review|location=Jazz Rag magazine.|date= 1987}}</ref> that he possessed an 'ability to play jazz piano in a way that sparkles and swings in sympathy with the clarinettist \u2026. setting him amongst the very best his country has to offer'.

He toured Britain and Europe with Keith Smith's Hefty Jazz and was pianist with Bob Hunt's Duke Ellington orchestra. It was during this period that he formed his own eight-piece band, Martin Litton's Red Hot Peppers, playing the music of Jelly Roll Morton.  He was a regular recording and performing artist with the Swedish Jazz Kings touring Scandinavia, Japan and Australia. His first solo CD 'Martin Litton Jazz Piano' <ref>{{cite news|title=Martin Litton's First Piano Album|first=Cook|last=Eddie|work=Review|location=Jazz Journal Volume 46 Number 11.|date= 1993}}</ref> was short listed in Jazz Journal's 1994 critics poll.

Similarly when with an Alyn Shipton quintet in Jazz Ascona Switzerland he showcased a 'fine tribute to Fats Waller'. He continued to tour the UK in between overseas visits and achieved notable success in Bing and Bob, A Tribute to the Crosby Brothers at the Purcell Room London. The late jazz critic Jack Masserik writing of Litton's performance in the Evening Standard noted 'how Martin's knowledge of the styles and development of jazz including Dixieland had been showcased in the octet and that behind the four-man front line, rhythm guitarist Neville Skrimshire trlpped a feathery four-to-the bar and pianist Martin Litton strode like a latter-day Joe Sullivan. It was during this time that Litton became noted for his entertaining piano talks, explaining the development of jazz and piano styles before demonstrating by his playing of certain pieces. During this period Litton was approached by the Royal Schools of Music. The introduction of jazz into the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music meant that a new type of jazz book was needed and Charles Beale's guides <ref>{{cite news|title=Jazz Piano from Scratch|first=Beale|last=Charles|work=Publication|location=AB RSM 1 86096 015 4.|date= 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Biography of Martin Litton|work=Publication|location=AB RSM.|date= 2006}}</ref> were published by the Associated Board itself to which Litton and others in the jazz field contributed by writing test pieces for the student examination board. This aspect of his skill gained wider recognition in programmes for BBC Radio 3 with presenter Alyn Shipton including transmissions of Jazz Library. These latter broadcasts were devoted to the recordings of Morton, Waller and Hines whose piano styles were dissected and commented upon. During <ref>{{cite news|title=''Cool personified by jazz five''|first=The Citizen|last=Gloucestershire|work=Review|location=Stoke UK.|date=August 1, 2008|page=10.19}}</ref> and after this period Litton continued working with Pete Long's Bebop Repertory Quintet playing the music of Dizzy Gillespie as well as being the pianist and musical director for a series of CDs featuring Clare Teal. The first of these CDs 'That's The Way It Is' was highly acclaimed and given regular airplay on Michael Parkinson's BBC Radio 2 programme.\n\n=== 2010\u2013present: current projects ===\nThis current decade sees Litton consistently playing at full stretch. On the album White Heat,<ref>{{cite news|title=Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra - White Heat|work=Review|location=CD Review.|date= 2012}}</ref> the Tuxedo Dance Orchestra featuring Litton 'complete with Debussy-inspired introduction and the seldom heard verse\u2026 the last track a perfect example of all the qualities that had gone into making this CD such a pleasure to listen to: top quality songs, fresh, imaginative arrangements, and virtuoso musicianship, engaging vocals and above all the feeling that you are listening to a group of musicians who believe in and love the music they are presenting. Litton performs regularly with the Harry Strutters Hot Rhythm Orchestra and The Jiving Lindy Hoppers Dance Troupe as part of the Swinging at the Cotton Club show... as well as joining smaller gigs and club appearances. These appearances range <ref>{{cite news|title=Launch of Bridgnorth Jazz Club|first=Lord|last=Tim|work=Review by Music Tour Consultant and lifelong jazz enthusiast|location=Shropshire.|date= 2015}}</ref> from accompanist such as to vocalist Janice Day in keeping the wonderful sounds of the 30s and 40s alive, to a double piano act at the Customs House,<ref>{{cite news|title=Martin Litton and Nick Gill|first=Alex|last=Ann|work=Review|location=Customs House Review.|date= 2013}}</ref> South Shields. This latter event, reviewed by Ann Alex said it was as, 'if we were at a Harlem rent party or a New Orleans bordello, the tunes and anecdotes tumbled out from these two gentlemen, dressed for the occasion in smart trousers and grey waistcoat (Martin), and (Nick) in black and red striped blazer, equally stylish trousers \u2026..marvellous, lively up and at 'em rags and stride..bit frustrated I wanted to dance'. Litton's musicianship also extends to jazz history especially ragtime. At one such society lecture <ref>{{cite news|title=Classical Music Society Talk|first=Kelly|last=Elinor|work=Talk Review|location=Ross.|date= 2006}}</ref> Litton talked about the history of ragtime, playing pieces from the many important figures in its development including Scott Joplin, Tom Turpin, Joseph Lamb, James Scott and Luckey Roberts. Following the lecture / demonstration the chairperson praised the new insights gained by the society into ragtime that evening leaving the audience 'asking for more'. A reminiscence to hold and take Litton forward from the middle of this current decade is a review of his playing with the Buck Clayton Legacy Band <ref>{{cite news|title=Clayton Legacy Band at Pizza Express - gig|first=Vacher|last=Peter|work=Review|location=Jazz UK.|date= 2011}}</ref> when..\u2026'both sets were punctuated by his extraordinarily virtuosic solo piano spot. He condensed the Ellington Orchestra's 20s Washington Wabble into explosive, complex stride, playing all the parts of the orchestra simultaneously.<ref>{{cite news|title=Swinging At The Cotton Club|first=Dennis|last=Maurice|work=Review|location=Jazz magazine.|date= 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Essentially Ellington - Queen Elizabeth Hall, London|first=Quinn|last=Peter|work=Review|location=The Arts Desk.|date= 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Buck Clayton Legacy Band - Phyllis Court Club, Henley|first=Vacher|last=Peter|work=Review|location=Jazz Journal Online.|date= 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Buck Clayton Legacy Band|first=SJE|last=Arts|work=Review|location=London Jazz News.|date= 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ISBN=978-1857431612|publisher=Europa Publications Ltd|title=International Who's Who in Popular Music|date= 2002}}{{|date=February 2017|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Equipment ==\nLitton's playing preference is for an acoustic piano although when necessary he uses his own Nord electric keyboard.\n\n== Personal life ==\nFrom his early years at home in Bovingdon, followed by formal piano studies in Colchester, Litton entered the London jazz scene with Steve Lane, before joining Harry Gold's Pieces of Eight band followed by becoming a member in 1983 of Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen. During the 1990s Litton continued expanding his work with leading British musicians including recordings with Humphrey Lyttelton, Wally Fawkes and Digby Fairweather. During the 1991 Hay-on-Wye jazz festival he met and subsequently married Rebekah Morley-Jones.  The couple were married in 1992, and the marriage lasted eleven years.  They had no children.  In 2017 Litton married his partner, the singer / entertainer Janice Day (n\u00e9e David) with whom he continues to perform in cabaret and at jazz festivals.  Their theatre shows include the 'Dance Band Divas' and 'Fats Waller in Love'.  Martin Litton currently spends his time between his cottage in Hay-on-Wye and his base in south London.  His recreation activities include painting, drawing and reading.

On the album White Heat,<ref>{{cite news|title=Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra - White Heat|work=Review|location=CD Review.|date= 2012}}</ref> the Tuxedo Dance Orchestra featuring Litton 'complete with Debussy-inspired introduction and the seldom heard verse\u2026 the last track a perfect example of all the qualities that had gone into making this CD such a pleasure to listen to: top quality songs, fresh, imaginative arrangements, and virtuoso musicianship, engaging vocals and above all the feeling that you are listening to a group of musicians who believe in and love the music they are presenting. Litton performs regularly with the Harry Strutters Hot Rhythm Orchestra and The Jiving Lindy Hoppers Dance Troupe as part of the Swinging at the Cotton Club show... as well as joining smaller gigs and club appearances. These appearances range <ref>{{cite news|title=Launch of Bridgnorth Jazz Club|first=Lord|last=Tim|work=Review by Music Tour Consultant and lifelong jazz enthusiast|location=Shropshire.|date= 2015}}</ref> from accompanist such as to vocalist Janice Day in keeping the wonderful sounds of the 30s and 40s alive, to a double piano act at the Customs House,<ref>{{cite news|title=Martin Litton and Nick Gill|first=Alex|last=Ann|work=Review|location=Customs House Review.|date= 2013}}</ref> South Shields. This latter event, reviewed by Ann Alex said it was as, 'if we were at a Harlem rent party or a New Orleans bordello, the tunes and anecdotes tumbled out from these two gentlemen, dressed for the occasion in smart trousers and grey waistcoat (Martin), and (Nick) in black and red striped blazer, equally stylish trousers \u2026..marvellous, lively up and at 'em rags and stride..bit frustrated I wanted to dance'. Litton's musicianship also extends to jazz history especially ragtime. At one such society lecture <ref>{{cite news|title=Classical Music Society Talk|first=Kelly|last=Elinor|work=Talk Review|location=Ross.|date= 2006}}</ref> Litton talked about the history of ragtime, playing pieces from the many important figures in its development including Scott Joplin, Tom Turpin, Joseph Lamb, James Scott and Luckey Roberts. Following the lecture / demonstration the chairperson praised the new insights gained by the society into ragtime that evening leaving the audience 'asking for more'. A reminiscence to hold and take Litton forward from the middle of this current decade is a review of his playing with the Buck Clayton Legacy Band <ref>{{cite news|title=Clayton Legacy Band at Pizza Express - gig|first=Vacher|last=Peter|work=Review|location=Jazz UK.|date= 2011}}</ref> when..\u2026'both sets were punctuated by his extraordinarily virtuosic solo piano spot. He condensed the Ellington Orchestra's 20s Washington Wabble into explosive, complex stride, playing all the parts of the orchestra simultaneously.<ref>{{cite news|title=Swinging At The Cotton Club|first=Dennis|last=Maurice|work=Review|location=Jazz magazine.|date= 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Essentially Ellington - Queen Elizabeth Hall, London|first=Quinn|last=Peter|work=Review|location=The Arts Desk.|date= 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Buck Clayton Legacy Band - Phyllis Court Club, Henley|first=Vacher|last=Peter|work=Review|location=Jazz Journal Online.|date= 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Buck Clayton Legacy Band|first=SJE|last=Arts|work=Review|location=London Jazz News.|date= 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ISBN=978-1857431612|publisher=Europa Publications Ltd|title=International Who's Who in Popular Music|date= 2002}}{{|date=February 2017|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Equipment ==\nLitton's playing preference is for an acoustic piano although when necessary he uses his own Nord electric keyboard.\n\n== Personal life ==\nFrom his early years at home in Bovingdon, followed by formal piano studies in Colchester, Litton entered the London jazz scene with Steve Lane, before joining Harry Gold's Pieces of Eight band followed by becoming a member in 1983 of Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen. During the 1990s Litton continued expanding his work with leading British musicians including recordings with Humphrey Lyttelton, Wally Fawkes and Digby Fairweather. During the 1991 Hay-on-Wye jazz festival he met and subsequently married Rebekah Morley-Jones.  The couple were married in 1992, and the marriage lasted eleven years.  They had no children.  In 2017 Litton married his partner, the singer / entertainer Janice Day (n\u00e9e David) with whom he continues to perform in cabaret and at jazz festivals.  Their theatre shows include the 'Dance Band Divas' and 'Fats Waller in Love'.  Martin Litton currently spends his time between his cottage in Hay-on-Wye and his base in south London.  His recreation activities include painting, drawing and reading.

The 'big' three of the 1960s where Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany and Switzerland was the emerging ETF Nation. The four UK Home Nations England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Irland and Eire, as well as from southern Europe Malta and Gibraltar travelled to London. The Americas where represented through the US and Asia through Israel, which reached against all odds the Semi-Final stage. Stuart Goldman(\u2020) was UK citizen from England and represented Israel. The 24 players were drawn in the 6 groups of 4 players and the 2 top players of each group proceeded to the 2nd group stage, with 4 groups of 3 players. The top 2 players again emerged then to the Quarter-Finales. All results are in the FISTF archive. We can see that Subbuteo was innovative with the tournament modus in 1970. The FIFA World Cup 1982 was played with this modus, without the Q/F stage.\n\n'''The World Cup 1970 Quarter- and Semi-Finals'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Player !! Nation !! Result !!

The nation winning the most individual matches, won the team match. A draw was also possible, if each team won an individual match and the third match would be a draw itself. The result would be a 1\u20131; as an example. Starting with 1984, the European Championship was played with the same structure as the FISA World Cup, containing one Senior and one Junior category. In 1996 another FISA Subbuteo European Championship event was organized, although FISTF had already been established in 1992. Several nations (Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Cyprus, Norway) were not invited or did not participate, and the reason is unclear. After 1993, with all nations joining FISTF, the ETF (ESTF 1992\u201393) became defunct in October 1993. Hasbro (took over Waddington Sports Games Ltd. with Subbuteo brand name in 1995\u20131996), tried to carry on by itself to organize a FISA event, with a limited number of players participating. The 1996 competition was therefore the very last organized by FISA (Hasbro). All matches played were 2x15min, with extra time of 2x5min in necessary, and 5x shots in the knock out phase.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ FISA Subbuteo European Championship \u2013 Team 1x Senior and 2x Junior (U-16)\n|-\n!

Which was then an indicator for the upcoming FISTF as the new world federation.\n\nThe ETF founded in 1963, defunct after the 30th Edition of the Europa Cup in 1993. It was a strong and stable association and the base for the merger of ETF Nations (associations) and FISA Nations (associations), to form and built FISTF. Some countries had two (2) table football/soccer/Subbuteo associations each affiliated to ETF or FISA. That took time to meld together. The main problems where the playing rules and equipment manufactured. FISTF made a new start to melt all players into one democratic global federation, with sport rules and material with several manufacturers offering sports equipment. The development of FISTF is ongoing and more Nations around the Globe are joining. All ETF matches played 2x20min., a.e.t.=after extra time with 2x10min, if necessary 1x10min. golden goal decision or 5x shots (similar to penalties in football but taken from different positions just inside the shooting area).\nCorrections: Willi Hogeweg was German, and not Dutch. Kurt Erb won the 1980 Europa Cup in Uddingston (SCO), and not his brother Peter Erb. Both mistakes corrected, which were previously mentioned. Tonio Montesin (Malta) was the finalist in the 1993 ESTF Cup final, and not John Barrons (NIL)!

The three ETF Members Belgium, Netherlands and Germany participated. England, the fourth ETF Member did not participate. In the 1960s 2 points were given for win and 1 point for a draw, that's why a high score of 8\u20130 was possible, which meant a 4\u20130 win in today's result system. Starting with the 1983 ETF Nations Cup, the one (1) point system was introduced for an individual win and for a draw non-points were given to both teams. A team consisted of four (4) Players. All ETF Matches were played 2x20min. In knock-out Stages, an 'after extra time' (a.e.t.) with 2x10min was applied if the match had a draw result. In case there was no winner, the 'golden goal' had to be scored in a 1x10min period. If no winner came up, the 5 shot system was used. The 5 shot system is practically the penalty shooting in real football/soccer. The Editions 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371 were cancelled due to the fact that the Netherlands were not interested to participate at the ETF Nations Cup.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ E.T.F.

In the honor of the fine Paul Outmanns (Belgium) who was a great player and organizer, the ''Coupe par equipe d'Europe'' was named 'Trophy Paul Outmanns'. The Europa Cup in Spa is considered as the first ever Europa Cup for Club teams. At the 1st edition in Spa (BEL), Clubs participated from Belgium (ETF), France (FISA), Germany (ETF) and the Netherlands (ETF). Italian clubs (FISA) participated at the 2nd edition. The 2nd edition in Aubervilliers (FRA) was played on the weekend 9\u201310 January 1988 (Season 87\u201388) with 4 countries, France (7), Belgium (5), Italy (2) and Germany (1) with a total of 15 clubs.\nThe 3rd edition in Oldham (ENG) on 4\u20135 August 1990 (Season 89\u201390) with 7 countries, France, Belgium, Italy, Wales, England and Netherlands. The 7th nation (Germany, Scotland or other) is not yet confirmed from research work.\nThe Quarter-Finals 1989\u201390:\nCardiff TSL 2\u20130 SC Elbeuf, SC Goldfingers Cornesse 3\u20130 Charlton SC, Birmingham TSL 2\u20130 Leicster Cheetah SC, RSMV Rotterdam 2\u20131 Florence SC. The editions in 1985\u201386 and 1987\u201388 were an initiative by the clubs and players (FISA and ETF), as well as the FBFTS {{BEL}} and FFFT {{FRA}}. The edition in 1989\u201390 was organized by FISA personal. The Europa Cup for ((Club Teams)) of Sport Table Football was finally born. The club Teams consisted of three players each. The club winning the most of the three matches wins. The playing time was 2x20 minutes (ETF) with three (3) players (FISA) per team. The single win per player counted 1 point, the draw 0 points for each team and the loss 0 points, and therefore it was often important, to have a good goal difference scored from the three individual matches.\nClubs participated from FISA and ETF countries, and the Europa Cup for Club Teams began too emerge steadily.\nIt was the beginning, when the flicking nations from FISA and ETF, came step by step together. Talks and meetings, ideas and projects came up to get the table football community merged.

The British Championship with {{ENG}}, {{SCO}}, {{WAL}} and {{NIR}} were also played irregular within ETF and FISA. Possibly that {{ESP}}, {{POR}}, and {{GIB}} played such a 3 country tournament as well. It is common that Nations play international friendly games when possible and within ETF it was a main sports event with the A-Team, B-Team and Juniors. Today, International tournaments are used, to play 'internationals' between Nations. Mainly the Open and Veteran category are played. FISTF has a registration form to agree on an international match. 2017 saw in \u00c9lancourt {{FRA}} the first 4-Country tournament with 3 Continents, America, Africa and Europe, involved.

FISTF. British Home Championship==\nUpdate: The British Home Nation Tournament from 1973 was added, found in a private archive. The edition counting will be revised. The 13th (14th) edition was played in 1986. The informations are mentioned in the Table Soccer Review of the ETSA. Mainly England, Scotland and Wales participated, with Northern Irland and Republic of Irland (EIRE, ROI) participating in several editions.\nIn 1976, England won their 5th Home Championship, therefore the Edition numbers need corrections. Research goes on through old copies of \"The blue\" magazine.\nEngland won the first seven (eight!) editions. Wales humbled England in 1981. 1982\u20131986 England won again five editions in a row. The 14th (15th) edition has not been found yet. Research work ongoing.\nThe first ever International match (National Teams) was played in Bruxelles (BEL) 7 February 1960, between Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium won! The foundation of an international federation was in line.\n\nAll started with an International match in England, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. This 2nd International match between two Nations was played in Tunbridge Wells, Oct./Nov. 1960, England against Belgium, on behalf of an invitation for three players from Mr. Peter Adolph. Earlier in February 1960 the 1st International Match was played between Belgium and the Netherlands. After that, more International matches between sports table football associations have been played.\nIt is not known to date, if in 1960 England played the Netherlands.\n\n'''2nd International Match between Nations 1960'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The top 2 players again emerged then to the Quarter-Finales. All results are in the FISTF archive. We can see that Subbuteo was innovative with the tournament modus in 1970.

The nation winning the most individual matches, won the team match. A draw was also possible, if each team won an individual match and the third match would be a draw itself. The result would be a 1\u20131; as an example. Starting with 1984, the European Championship was played with the same structure as the FISA World Cup, containing one Senior and one Junior category. In 1996 another FISA Subbuteo European Championship event was organized, although FISTF had already been established in 1992. Several nations (Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Cyprus, Norway) were not invited or did not participate, and the reason is unclear. After 1993, with all nations joining FISTF, the ETF (ESTF 1992\u201393) became defunct in October 1993. Hasbro (took over Waddington Sports Games Ltd. with Subbuteo brand name in 1995\u20131996), tried to carry on by itself to organize a FISA event, with a limited number of players participating. The 1996 competition was therefore the very last organized by FISA (Hasbro). All matches played were 2x15min, with extra time of 2x5min in necessary, and 5x shots in the knock out phase.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ FISA Subbuteo European Championship \u2013 Team 1x Senior and 2x Junior (U-16)\n|-\n!

Which was then an indicator for the upcoming FISTF as the new world federation.\n\nThe ETF founded in 1963, defunct after the 30th Edition of the Europa Cup in 1993. It was a strong and stable association and the base for the merger of ETF Nations (associations) and FISA Nations (associations), to form and built FISTF. Some countries had two (2) table football/soccer/Subbuteo associations each affiliated to ETF or FISA. That took time to meld together. The main problems where the playing rules and equipment manufactured. FISTF made a new start to melt all players into one democratic global federation, with sport rules and material with several manufacturers offering sports equipment. The development of FISTF is ongoing and more Nations around the Globe are joining. All ETF matches played 2x20min., a.e.t.=after extra time with 2x10min, if necessary 1x10min. golden goal decision or 5x shots (similar to penalties in football but taken from different positions just inside the shooting area).\nCorrections: Willi Hogeweg was German, and not Dutch. Kurt Erb won the 1980 Europa Cup in Uddingston (SCO), and not his brother Peter Erb. Both mistakes corrected, which were previously mentioned. Tonio Montesin (Malta) was the finalist in the 1993 ESTF Cup final, and not John Barrons (NIL)! Important to mention is that Mike Dent is Scottish, while playing for England in 1976.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ E.T.F. Europa Cup (Individual)\n|-\n! Year\n! Host City\n! Winner\n!

The three ETF Members Belgium, Netherlands and Germany participated. England, the fourth ETF Member did not participate. In the 1960s 2 points were given for win and 1 point for a draw, that's why a high score of 8\u20130 was possible, which meant a 4\u20130 win in today's result system. Starting with the 1983 ETF Nations Cup, the one (1) point system was introduced for an individual win and for a draw non-points were given to both teams. A team consisted of four (4) Players. All ETF Matches were played 2x20min. In knock-out Stages, an 'after extra time' (a.e.t.) with 2x10min was applied if the match had a draw result. In case there was no winner, the 'golden goal' had to be scored in a 1x10min period. If no winner came up, the 5 shot system was used. The 5 shot system is practically the penalty shooting in real football/soccer. The Editions 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371 were cancelled due to the fact that the Netherlands were not interested to participate at the ETF Nations Cup.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ E.T.F.

In the honor of the fine Paul Outmanns (Belgium) who was a great player and organizer, the ''Coupe par equipe d'Europe'' was named 'Trophy Paul Outmanns'. The Europa Cup in Spa is considered as the first ever Europa Cup for Club teams. At the 1st edition in Spa (BEL), Clubs participated from Belgium (ETF), France (FISA), Germany (ETF) and the Netherlands (ETF). Italian clubs (FISA) participated at the 2nd edition. The 2nd edition in Aubervilliers (FRA) was played on the weekend 9\u201310 January 1988 (Season 87\u201388) with 4 countries, France (7), Belgium (5), Italy (2) and Germany (1) with a total of 15 clubs.\nThe 3rd edition in Oldham (ENG) on 4\u20135 August 1990 (Season 89\u201390) with 7 countries, France, Belgium, Italy, Wales, England and Netherlands. The 7th nation (Germany, Scotland or other) is not yet confirmed from research work.\nThe Quarter-Finals 1989\u201390:\nCardiff TSL 2\u20130 SC Elbeuf, SC Goldfingers Cornesse 3\u20130 Charlton SC, Birmingham TSL 2\u20130 Leicster Cheetah SC, RSMV Rotterdam 2\u20131 Florence SC. The editions in 1985\u201386 and 1987\u201388 were an initiative by the clubs and players (FISA and ETF), as well as the FBFTS {{BEL}} and FFFT {{FRA}}. The edition in 1989\u201390 was organized by FISA personal. The Europa Cup for ((Club Teams)) of Sport Table Football was finally born. The club Teams consisted of three players each. The club winning the most of the three matches wins. The playing time was 2x20 minutes (ETF) with three (3) players (FISA) per team. The single win per player counted 1 point, the draw 0 points for each team and the loss 0 points, and therefore it was often important, to have a good goal difference scored from the three individual matches.\nClubs participated from FISA and ETF countries, and the Europa Cup for Club Teams began too emerge steadily.\nIt was the beginning, when the flicking nations from FISA and ETF, came step by step together. Talks and meetings, ideas and projects came up to get the table football community merged.

The British Championship with {{ENG}}, {{SCO}}, {{WAL}} and {{NIR}} were also played irregular within ETF and FISA. Possibly that {{ESP}}, {{POR}}, and {{GIB}} played such a 3 country tournament as well. It is common that Nations play international friendly games when possible and within ETF it was a main sports event with the A-Team, B-Team and Juniors. Today, International tournaments are used, to play 'internationals' between Nations. Mainly the Open and Veteran category are played. FISTF has a registration form to agree on an international match. 2017 saw in \u00c9lancourt {{FRA}} the first 4-Country tournament with 3 Continents, America, Africa and Europe, involved.

FISTF. British Home Championship==\nUpdate: The British Home Nation Tournament from 1973 was added, found in a private archive. The edition counting will be revised. The 13th (14th) edition was played in 1986. The informations are mentioned in the Table Soccer Review of the ETSA. Mainly England, Scotland and Wales participated, with Northern Irland and Republic of Irland (EIRE, ROI) participating in several editions.\nIn 1976, England won their 5th Home Championship, therefore the Edition numbers need corrections. Research goes on through old copies of \"The blue\" magazine.\nEngland won the first seven (eight!) editions. Wales humbled England in 1981. 1982\u20131986 England won again five editions in a row. The 14th (15th) edition has not been found yet. Research work ongoing.\nThe first ever International match (National Teams) was played in Bruxelles (BEL) 7 February 1960, between Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium won! The foundation of an international federation was in line.\n\nAll started with an International match in England, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. This 2nd International match between two Nations was played in Tunbridge Wells, Oct./Nov. 1960, England against Belgium, on behalf of an invitation for three players from Mr. Peter Adolph. Earlier in February 1960 the 1st International Match was played between Belgium and the Netherlands. After that, more International matches between sports table football associations have been played.\nIt is not known to date, if in 1960 England played the Netherlands.\n\n'''2nd International Match between Nations 1960'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
