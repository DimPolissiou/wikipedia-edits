Xander met with his uncle Victor Kiriakis where it was revealed that he has been doing criminal operations for him in [[Cyprus]] and [[Cuba]] in addition to money laundering for the Kiriakis family. As a cover for his criminal activities, Xander owns a European pharmaceutical company that supplies various charities around the world.\n\nHe met [[Nicole Walker]] and fell for her right away, she pretended to show interest in him and used Xander to make her ex-boyfriend [[Daniel Jonas]] jealous then started dating Daniel again and wanted nothing to do with Xander.

Xander continued pursuing Nicole even after warned by Victor not to.\n\nAt Titan, Xander tracked down Nicole for betraying him, locking her up to die in the furnace room along with her lover Eric who came to save her. He and his female accomplice destroyed all the evidence before leaving. As Xander was preparing to abscond, he was kidnapped by Victor's henchmen on Victor's order for not following the orders and putting their business in jeopardy by bringing their criminal activities to attention. Xander explained his devotion, and was let go, but only to be stripped of his privileges and wealthy lifestyle. He worked as a gardener at the Kiriakis mansion briefly as part of the punishment where he was seduced by [[Theresa Donovan]] who falsely accused him of rape when Brady walked in on them. Xander was arrested by the police on charges of attempted rape and assault.\n\nIn September 2016, Xander was seen serving his time in prison with [[Clyde Weston]] and Orpheus. Xander wanted revenge on Theresa and Nicole. As the trio are being transported with other prisoners, The three escape and  Xander heads straight for Theresa's to confront her about her false accusations. Theresa apologized, but blamed Victor. He started to strangle Theresa, but  escaped when Brady showed up. Xander, Clyde, and Orpheus regrouped at a shack on the pier. The trio went to Johnson's house and held [[Kayla Brady]] and [[Joey Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Joey Johnson]] hostage. [[Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Steve Johnson]] comes home, and gets shot. The three criminals parted ways, Xander found Nicole at Daniel's grave, and held her at gunpoint.\n\nIn April 2017, Xander followed Nicole and Brady to Canada, ultimately shooting Brady and kidnapping both Nicole and Holly. By 2018, Xander was in Mexico selling blood diamonds to drug lord Mateo, who was holding his ex-girlfriend Theresa hostage. Xander assisted Theresa to escape and return to Salem under the condition that she help him return to the good graces of Victor. Xander's return to Salem was short-lived, when he ultimately leaves town. Months later, in October, Xander blackmailed Nicole into marrying him using a recording of her confession to killing Deimos. Nicole and Xander live with her daughter Holly in Chicago at [[Sarah Horton]] ([[Linsey Godfrey]])'s apartment. A fire breaks out at the secret facility in Nashville where Xander is working with [[Kristen DiMera]] and Dr. Rolf on experiments that bring the dead back to life. Xander is presumed dead.\n\nHe returned to Salem in January 2019, working with [[Eve Donovan]] to bring [[Jack Deveraux]] back in Salem in return for the thumb drive. Xander shows his uncle Victor the flash drive containing secret internal documents that could ruin DiMera Enterprises, Titan's largest business rival, in return for him being the new CEO of Titan. Victor offers him money, which he turns down demanding power and respect instead. Xander finds [[Sarah Horton]] in the Kiriakis mansion conversing with [[Sonny Kiriakis]] and interrupts them by eating Sarah's muffin and flirts with her, she turns down his hard pass and goes to meet her friend. Eric attacks Xander after learning that he's alive. [[Eli Grant]] shows up and arrests Xander for shooting [[Marlena Evans]] but is released after the security footage is revealed to have been deleted by himself who had impersonated [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]]. He finds [[Sarah Horton]] drinking heavily heartbroken over her previous relationship with [[Rex Brady]] and being rejected by Eric. Xander and Sarah have sex. Afterwards he blackmails Eve Donovan after stealing Dr Wolf's diary from her. He returns again in April, after abducting Nicole's daughter Holly, per the instruction of Ted Laurent ([[Gilles Marini]]). He accepts an executive position job at Titan Industries which Brady offers him in return that he hands over the recording and divorces Nicole. It is later revealed that he and Nicole are secretly working together and that Nicole is actually Kristen, wearing Nicole's mask. He bonds well with [[Maggie Horton]] after he catches her drinking and opens up to her about the pain he went through as a kid when losing his parents, he stays with her until they both fall asleep on the sofa. He hands over Dr. Rolf's diary to Maggie in Sarah's presence to save Will's life.
