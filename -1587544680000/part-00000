In the 1930s economic research started investigating time preferences. The findings led to the model of [[exponential discounting]], thus time consistent discounting. However, later research led to the conclusion that time preferences were indeed not consistent, but inconsistent. In other words, people were found to prefer immediate advantages to future advantages in that their discount over a short period of time falls rapidly, while falling less the more the rewards are in the future. Therefore, people are biased towards the present. As a result, Phelps and Pollak introduced the quasi-hyperbolic model in 1968.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balakrishnan|first=Uttara|last2=Haushofer|first2=Johannes|last3=Jakiela|first3=Pamela| name-list-format = vanc |date=2017|title=How Soon Is Now?

It is responsive to both the likelihood of getting an anticipated reward as well as its size. It also plays a role in evaluating after a choice has been made.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Medial prefrontal cortex ===\nThe medial prefrontal cortex is responsible for self-related [[attention]] and [[judgement]], for example comparing the self to someone else.

The children were offered an immediate reward and were told that if they manage to not eat the reward right away, but instead waited for a certain period of time (approximately 15 minutes), they would get another treat. Age correlated positively with the capability of [[delayed gratification]]. There has also been a correlation found between ability to delay gratification as a child and the child's success in follow-up studies several years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment|title=Stanford Marshmallow Experiment }}</ref>\n\n=== Political elections ===\nPresent bias is also reflected in the choice of whether an individual participates in [[Politics|political]] [[election]]s. Political elections are usually characterized by an immediate effort, for example making a political decision and casting the vote on election day, whereas the benefits of voting, such as favored political changes, often only occur later in the future.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=James H.|last2=Kam|first2=Cindy D.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|title=Patience as a Political Virtue: Delayed Gratification and Turnout|journal=Political Behavior | volume=28|issue=2|pages=113\u2013128|doi=10.1007/s11109-006-9004-7|issn=0190-9320}}</ref> Patience is therefore a relevant factor that influences peoples\u2019 decision whether to take part in elections.<ref name=\":8\" /> Individuals who exhibit more patience with future political changes, also show a greater willingness to take part in political elections. Whereas others, who focus more on the efforts to be paid, are less likely to take part in elections.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Brain areas ===\nThe ability to perform delayed gratification increases as the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]] and the medial prefrontal cortex mature. Particularly the left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] shows increased activity during delayed gratification.<ref name=\":7\" /> The thickness of these cortical areas as well as the volume of the left [[caudate nucleus]] is also linked to a better ability in delayed gratification and suppressing impulsivity. The [[Frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] involvement in self-regulation and self-control also play an important role.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Procrastination  ==\nPresent-biased preferences often result in procrastination.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nProcrastination mostly occurs when actions are followed by immediate costs. However, when actions are instead followed by immediate rewards, people tend to perform their tasks faster in order to get the reward.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=O'Donoghue|first=Ted|last2=Rabin|first2=Matthew| name-list-format = vanc |date=1999|title=Doing It Now or Later|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=103\u2013124 |jstor=116981|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.103}}</ref>\n\nThe findings of a study in which students had to set deadlines for completing certain tasks for themselves, suggested that an interaction of present-bias as well as personal characteristics, e.g. overconfidence, may appear to be \"procrastination\".<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web | first1 = Alberto | last1 = Bisin | first2 = Kyle | last2 = Hyndman | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/bisina/BH-Main-Text-2018-Apr.pdf|title=Present-Bias, Procrastination and Deadlines in a Field Experiment }}</ref> However, internal [[self-control]] and sophistication regarding the tasks may reduce present bias, whereas it has the opposite effect for na\u00efve people.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Brain areas ===\n\nAnother study further investigates the common hypothesis that self-regulatory failure results in procrastination.\nFurthermore, there appears to be a decrease in functional correspondence between the following brain areas: Between [[Ventromedial prefrontal cortex|VMPC]] and [[DLPFC]], [[dACC]] and [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] and in the right [[VLPFC]].<ref name = \"Wu_2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu Y, Li L, Yuan B, Tian X | title = Individual differences in resting-state functional connectivity predict procrastination. | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | date = June 2016 | volume = 95 | pages = 62\u20137 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2016.02.016 }}</ref> Despite there not yet being neural evidence for this theory they assumed that self-regulatory failure is indeed associated to procrastination.<ref name = \"Wu_2016\" />\n\n== Health ==\nPresent bias has an impact on people's individual health care [[decision-making]]. It affects a range of health-related behaviors, for example precaution with potential illnesses, such as [[breast cancer]], living an unhealthy life style, like [[smoking]], drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[drug]] use and showing risky behavior, such as [[drunk driving]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPresent bias often occurs when the negative consequences of a certain behavior are believed to be in distant future. It is characterized by short-term impatience.<ref name=\":2\" /> This impatience with the future benefits to occur minimizes the [[motivation]] for people to take unpleasant actions for their health, like maintaining a diet, refraining from a [[cigarette]] or regularly visiting a professional for check-ups.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPresent biased decision-making often underlies the notion that a certain health care behavior induces costs first, while benefits occur only quite some time later.<ref name=\":2\" /> People are often more focused on the short-term benefits than on long-term consequences. For example, drunk-drivers exhibit less long-term concern than non-drunk drivers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe lacking adherence to health care can also be explained by the na\u00efve thinking about one's own present bias.<ref name=\":2\" /> People overestimate that they will take care of their behaviour's consequences in the future, which is often not the case. They tend to underestimate their own self-control and the effects of their present behavior on their future well-being and therefore postpone taking action before it is urgent.<ref name=\":2\" /> Many people procrastinate because they underestimate how their future selves are being affected by the present bias.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPresent bias can explain failure to adhere effective health care guidelines, such as [[mammography]]. People tend to forget that precaution with their own health can maximize their lifetime and minimize their life time medical spending.<ref name=\":2\" /> A lot of people who are already diagnosed with an illness underestimate the importance of following health care guidelines, even though they are beneficial for their own health. Mostly, increasing age and nearing death eventually leads individuals to focus more on their own health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOvercoming the present bias could lead to earlier detection of illnesses, such as breast cancer, to start treatment in time. These individual decisions not to take care early negatively affects the health care systems, whose costs could be minimized by a more precaution of their clients.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Sloan FA |title=Present bias and health|journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume = 57|issue = 2|pages = 177\u2013198 |date= October 2018|doi = 10.1007/s11166-018-9289-z|pmid=31244508|pmc = 6594564}}</ref>\n\n=== Visceral states ===\nThe educator and economist [[George Loewenstein]] described how strongly [[Organ (anatomy)|visceral]] states (e.g. hunger, thirst, strong emotions, sexual desire, mood or physical pain) can influence decision-making in ways that are not in one's long-term interest. According to Loewenstein, visceral factors have a direct [[Hedonism|hedonic]] impact and they influence how much one desires different rewards and actions.<ref name = \"Loewenstein_1996\">{{Cite journal|last=Loewenstein|first=George | name-list-format = vanc |date=March 1996|title=Out of Control: Visceral Influences on Behavior|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0046cc34a35784e572e8b6c069d9537e195a022|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=272\u2013292 | doi = 10.1006/obhd.1996.0028 }}</ref> When visceral factors influence one highly, it can lead to self-destructive behavior such as [[overeating]]. Visceral factors lead one to focus on the present more than on some time in the future when making decisions that are associated with the visceral factor. In Loewenstein's opinion, visceral states have the most enormous impact on the following behaviors: [[Addiction|drug addiction]], sexual behavior, motivation and effort, and self-control.<ref name = \"Loewenstein_1996\" />\n\nThose factors are known as \"hot states\", because temporary emotions can have an influential effect on our behavior. Therefore, there are \"cooling off\" periods for many important purchases. Other factors such as age, gender, cultural background, education and self-control also play a role in making discounting decisions \u2013 but those can be dealt with more easily than with visceral states.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Wealth distribution ==\nEconomical models use present bias, also referred to as [[dynamic inconsistency]], to explain distribution of wealth. If everybody would be present-biased [[Distribution of wealth|wealth distribution]] would be unaffected. As this is only possible in an ideal economy, wealth inequality spurts from time-consistent individuals benefiting from the irrational monetary decisions present-biased economic rivals make.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tristannighswander.com/new-page|title=Research|website=Tristan J. Nighswander|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Indeed, present bias in economics is often linked to lack of self-control when making monetary decisions. It is associated with high desires to spend money and failure to commit to a saving plan.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=Liam|last2=Lades|first2=Leonhard K. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017|title=Present Bias and Everyday Self-Control Failures: A Day Reconstruction Study: Present Bias and Everyday Self-Control Failures|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making | volume=30|issue=5|pages=1157\u20131167|doi=10.1002/bdm.2031}}</ref>\n\nA present-biased society is represented by individuals reaching an earlier peak in their mean wealth and trend to lose accumulated wealth as they reach [[retirement]]. Loss of wealth can be attributed to tendency to bend under the temptation to over-consume and under-save. Such irrational behavioral biases lead to lower average wealth and shortened planning horizons.<ref name=\":1\" /> Present-biased people fail to complete a consumption saving plan are more likely consistently re-optimize factors influencing their wealth accumulation. An association between deciding to obtain less education, lower lifetime earnings, and lower retirement consumption was observed in present-biased individuals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Tourism  ==\nPresent bias plays a role in tourism concerning travel costs and [[impulsivity]] of tourist's decision-making. Impulsivity is reasoned to be triggered by the escape of daily routines and a feeling of the moment. Hence present bias would specially apply while traveling. Although reference prices frame expenses, present bias which is influenced by the [[prospect theory]], that grades the value of gains, and the attachment effect, tourists tend to overspend. Individual differences such as risk aversiveness play into overspending caused by the effect of present bias. [[Group decision-making|Group decisions]] and a prior commitment to not overspend can reduce the bias and inhibit impulsivity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen Q | title = Linking loss aversion and present bias with overspending behavior of tourists: Insights from a lab-in-the-field experiment. | journal = Tourism Management | date = June 2016 | volume = 54 | issue = 152\u20139 | pages = 152\u2013159 | doi = 10.1016/j.tourman.2015.09.019 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cognitive bias]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n* [[Behavioral economics]] \n* [[Hyperbolic discounting]]\n* [[Procrastination]]\n*[[Delayed gratification]]\n*[[Stanford marshmallow experiment]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Biases}}\n\n[[Category:Behavioral economics]]\n[[Category:Neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Psychology experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''Present bias''' is the tendency to rather settle for a smaller present reward than to wait for a larger future reward, in a trade-off situation.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.isid.ac.in/~epu/acegd2016/papers/AnujitChakraborty.pdf |title=Present Bias|last=Chakraborty|first=Anujit | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /> It describes the trend of overvaluing immediate rewards, while putting less worth in long-term consequences.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ezonomics.com/whatis/present_bias/|title=What is present bias?|last=Egan|first=Mark | name-list-format = vanc | work = ING eZonomics }}</ref> The present bias can be used as a measure for [[self-control]], which is a trait related to the prediction of secure life outcomes.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn the field of [[behavioral economics]], present bias is related to [[hyperbolic discounting]], which differ in time consistency.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== History  ==\nEven though the term of present [[bias]] was not introduced until the 1950s, the core idea of immediate [[gratification]] was already addressed in [[Ancient Greece]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last=O'Donoghue |first=Ted |last2=Rabin |first2=Matthew | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |title=Present Bias: Lessons Learned and To Be Learned |journal=American Economic Review |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=273\u2013279 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20151085 }}</ref> A historical record of a display of concern regarding [[procrastination]] is known from the Greek poet [[Hesiod]], who wrote:\n\n\"Do not put your work off till to-morrow and the day after; for a sluggish worker does not fill his barn, nor one who puts off his work: industry makes work go well, but a man who puts off work is always at hand-grips with ruin.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/63887/procrastination-through-ages-brief-history-wasting-time|title=Procrastination Through the Ages: A Brief History of Wasting Time|date=2015-05-11|website=mentalfloss.com | access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Present bias and economics ===\nThe term of present bias was coined in the second half of the 20th century.

There has also been a correlation found between ability to delay gratification as a child and the child's success in follow-up studies several years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment|title=Stanford Marshmallow Experiment }}</ref>\n\n=== Political elections ===\nPresent bias is also reflected in the choice of whether an individual participates in [[Politics|political]] [[election]]s. Political elections are usually characterized by an immediate effort, for example making a political decision and casting the vote on election day, whereas the benefits of voting, such as favored political changes, often only occur later in the future.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=James H.|last2=Kam|first2=Cindy D.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|title=Patience as a Political Virtue: Delayed Gratification and Turnout|journal=Political Behavior | volume=28|issue=2|pages=113\u2013128|doi=10.1007/s11109-006-9004-7|issn=0190-9320}}</ref> Patience is therefore a relevant factor that influences peoples\u2019 decision whether to take part in elections.<ref name=\":8\" /> Individuals who exhibit more patience with future political changes, also show a greater willingness to take part in political elections. Whereas others, who focus more on the efforts to be paid, are less likely to take part in elections.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Brain areas ===\nThe ability to perform delayed gratification increases as the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]] and the medial prefrontal cortex mature. Particularly the left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] shows increased activity during delayed gratification.<ref name=\":7\" /> The thickness of these cortical areas as well as the volume of the left [[caudate nucleus]] is also linked to a better ability in delayed gratification and suppressing impulsivity. The [[Frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] involvement in self-regulation and self-control also play an important role.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Procrastination  ==\nPresent-biased preferences often result in procrastination.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nProcrastination mostly occurs when actions are followed by immediate costs. However, when actions are instead followed by immediate rewards, people tend to perform their tasks faster in order to get the reward.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=O'Donoghue|first=Ted|last2=Rabin|first2=Matthew| name-list-format = vanc |date=1999|title=Doing It Now or Later|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=103\u2013124 |jstor=116981|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.103}}</ref>\n\nThe findings of a study in which students had to set deadlines for completing certain tasks for themselves, suggested that an interaction of present-bias as well as personal characteristics, e.g. overconfidence, may appear to be \"procrastination\".<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web | first1 = Alberto | last1 = Bisin | first2 = Kyle | last2 = Hyndman | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/bisina/BH-Main-Text-2018-Apr.pdf|title=Present-Bias, Procrastination and Deadlines in a Field Experiment }}</ref> However, internal [[self-control]] and sophistication regarding the tasks may reduce present bias, whereas it has the opposite effect for na\u00efve people.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Brain areas ===\n\nAnother study further investigates the common hypothesis that self-regulatory failure results in procrastination.\nFurthermore, there appears to be a decrease in functional correspondence between the following brain areas: Between [[Ventromedial prefrontal cortex|VMPC]] and [[DLPFC]], [[dACC]] and [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] and in the right [[VLPFC]].<ref name = \"Wu_2016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu Y, Li L, Yuan B, Tian X | title = Individual differences in resting-state functional connectivity predict procrastination. | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | date = June 2016 | volume = 95 | pages = 62\u20137 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2016.02.016 }}</ref> Despite there not yet being neural evidence for this theory they assumed that self-regulatory failure is indeed associated to procrastination.<ref name = \"Wu_2016\" />\n\n== Health ==\nPresent bias has an impact on people's individual health care [[decision-making]]. It affects a range of health-related behaviors, for example precaution with potential illnesses, such as [[breast cancer]], living an unhealthy life style, like [[smoking]], drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[drug]] use and showing risky behavior, such as [[drunk driving]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPresent bias often occurs, when the negative consequences of a certain behavior are believed to be in distant future. It is characterized by short-term impatience.<ref name=\":2\" /> This impatience with the benefits to occur, minimizes the [[motivation]] for people to take unpleasant actions upon their health, like maintaining a diet, refraining from a [[cigarette]] or regularly visiting a professional for check-ups.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPresent biased decision-making often underlies the notion that a certain health care behavior induce costs first, while benefits occur only later.<ref name=\":2\" /> People are often more focused on the short-term benefits, than on long-term consequences. For example, drunk-drivers exhibit less long-term concern than non-drunk drivers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe lacking adherence to health care can also be explained by the na\u00efve thinking about one's own present bias.<ref name=\":2\" /> People overestimate that they will take care of the consequences in the future, which is often not the case. They tend to underestimate their own self-control and the effects of their present behavior on their future well-being and therefore postpone taking action before it is urgent.<ref name=\":2\" /> Many people procrastinate, because they underestimate their future selves being affected by the present bias.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPresent bias can explain failure to adhere effective health care guidelines, such as [[mammography]]. People tend to forget that precaution with their own health can minimize their life time medical spending.<ref name=\":2\" /> A lot of people who are already diagnosed with an illness underestimate the importance of following health care guidelines, even though they are beneficial for their own health. Mostly, increasing age eventually leads individual to focus more on their own health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOvercoming the present bias could lead to earlier detection of illnesses, such as breast cancer, to start treatment in time. These individual decisions not to take care previously also negatively affects the health care systems, whose costs could be minimized by a little more precaution of their clients.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Sloan FA |title=Present bias and health|journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume = 57|issue = 2|pages = 177\u2013198 |date= October 2018|doi = 10.1007/s11166-018-9289-z|pmid=31244508|pmc = 6594564}}</ref>\n\n=== Visceral states ===\nThe educator and economist [[George Loewenstein]] described how strongly [[Organ (anatomy)|visceral]] states (e.g. hunger, thirst, strong emotions, sexual desire, mood or physical pain) can influence decision-making in ways that are not in one's long-term interest. According to Loewenstein, visceral factors have a direct [[Hedonism|hedonic]] impact and they influence how much one desires different rewards and actions.<ref name = \"Loewenstein_1996\">{{Cite journal|last=Loewenstein|first=George | name-list-format = vanc |date=March 1996|title=Out of Control: Visceral Influences on Behavior|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d0046cc34a35784e572e8b6c069d9537e195a022|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=272\u2013292 | doi = 10.1006/obhd.1996.0028 }}</ref> When visceral factors influence one highly, it can lead to self-destructive behavior such as [[overeating]]. Visceral factors lead one to focus on the present more than on some time in the future when making decisions that are associated with the visceral factor. In Loewenstein's opinion, visceral states have the most enormous impact on the following behaviors: [[Addiction|drug addiction]], sexual behavior, motivation and effort, and self-control.<ref name = \"Loewenstein_1996\" />\n\nThose factors are known as \"hot states\", because temporary emotions can have an influential effect on our behavior. Therefore, there are \"cooling off\" periods for many important purchases. Other factors such as age, gender, cultural background, education and self-control also play a role in making discounting decisions \u2013 but those can be dealt with more easily than with visceral states.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Wealth distribution ==\nEconomical models use present bias, also referred to as [[dynamic inconsistency]], to explain distribution of wealth. If everybody would be present-biased [[Distribution of wealth|wealth distribution]] would be unaffected. As this is only possible in an ideal economy, wealth inequality spurts from time-consistent individuals benefiting from the irrational monetary decisions present-biased economic rivals make.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tristannighswander.com/new-page|title=Research|website=Tristan J. Nighswander|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Indeed, present bias in economics is often linked to lack of self-control when making monetary decisions. It is associated with high desires to spend money and failure to commit to a saving plan.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=Liam|last2=Lades|first2=Leonhard K. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017|title=Present Bias and Everyday Self-Control Failures: A Day Reconstruction Study: Present Bias and Everyday Self-Control Failures|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making | volume=30|issue=5|pages=1157\u20131167|doi=10.1002/bdm.2031}}</ref>\n\nA present-biased society is represented by individuals reaching an earlier peak in their mean wealth and trend to lose accumulated wealth as they reach [[retirement]]. Loss of wealth can be attributed to tendency to bend under the temptation to over-consume and under-save. Such irrational behavioral biases lead to lower average wealth and shortened planning horizons.<ref name=\":1\" /> Present-biased people fail to complete a consumption saving plan are more likely consistently re-optimize factors influencing their wealth accumulation. An association between deciding to obtain less education, lower lifetime earnings, and lower retirement consumption was observed in present-biased individuals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Tourism  ==\nPresent bias plays a role in tourism concerning travel costs and [[impulsivity]] of tourist's decision-making. Impulsivity is reasoned to be triggered by the escape of daily routines and a feeling of the moment. Hence present bias would specially apply while traveling. Although reference prices frame expenses, present bias which is influenced by the [[prospect theory]], that grades the value of gains, and the attachment effect, tourists tend to overspend. Individual differences such as risk aversiveness play into overspending caused by the effect of present bias. [[Group decision-making|Group decisions]] and a prior commitment to not overspend can reduce the bias and inhibit impulsivity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen Q | title = Linking loss aversion and present bias with overspending behavior of tourists: Insights from a lab-in-the-field experiment. | journal = Tourism Management | date = June 2016 | volume = 54 | issue = 152\u20139 | pages = 152\u2013159 | doi = 10.1016/j.tourman.2015.09.019 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cognitive bias]]\n* [[List of cognitive biases]]\n* [[Behavioral economics]] \n* [[Hyperbolic discounting]]\n* [[Procrastination]]\n*[[Delayed gratification]]\n*[[Stanford marshmallow experiment]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Biases}}\n\n[[Category:Behavioral economics]]\n[[Category:Neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Psychology experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Tmueller78", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHealth:edited for readability and consistency", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_bias"}

Generally [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], the party places a strong emphasis on [[participatory democracy]], [[radical democracy]], [[feminism]], [[minority rights]], [[youth rights]] and [[egalitarianism]].

The HDP is in an alliance with the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Democratic Regions Party]] (DBP), often described as the HDP's [[fraternal party]]. From 2013 to 2015, the HDP participated in [[Solution process|peace negotiations]] between the Turkish government and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK). The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] accuses the HDP of having direct links with the PKK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ahvalnews.com/pkk/pro-kurdish-hdp-equivalent-outlawed-terrorist-pkk-says-erdogan|title=Pro-Kurdish HDP equivalent to outlawed terrorist PKK, says Erdo\u011fan|website=Ahval|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe party operates a co-presidential system of leadership, with one chairman and one chairwoman. In the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|2014 presidential election]], the party put forward its chairman, Selahattin Demirta\u015f, who won 9.77% of the vote. Despite concerns that it could fall short of the 10% [[election threshold]],  the party put forward party-lists instead of running independent candidates in the subsequent [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]]. Exceeding expectations, it polled at 13.12%, becoming the third largest [[Grand National Assembly|parliamentary]] group. The party briefly participated in the [[2015 interim election government of Turkey|interim election government]] formed by AKP Prime Minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] on 28 August 2015, with HDP MPs [[Ali Haydar Konca]] and [[M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Do\u011fan]] becoming the [[Minister of European Union Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of European Union Affairs]] and the [[Ministry of Development (Turkey)|Minister of Development]] respectively.\n\nWitnessing the [[2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|2016 Turkish coup attempt]] and pointing out previous repression of democratic forces by martial powers, the HDP strongly opposed the coup. The HDP was first ignored and put aside of the post-coup national truce while the [[2016\u201317 purges in Turkey|Turkish purges]] targeted alleged members of the [[G\u00fclen movement]]. From September 2016 and forward, the Judiciary of Turkey started to submit HDP elected officials to anti-terrorism accusations. As of March 2018, the MP status of seven HDP representatives had been revoked and six more representatives, including the ex-chairman Demirta\u015f, remained under arrest,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.yenisafak.com/gundem/10-ili-etkiledi-mecliste-bir-ilk-3099807 |title = Meclis vekil say\u0131s\u0131!

The HDP instead aims to collectively represent people of all ethnic or religious backgrounds and to safeguard their [[Human rights in Turkey|civil liberties]] by bringing about [[direct democracy]] and an end to capitalist exploitation.

The HDP carried victories in 14 out of 85 electoral districts in Turkey: [[Ardahan]], [[Kars]], [[I\u011fd\u0131r]], [[A\u011fr\u0131 Province]], [[Mu\u015f]], [[Bitlis]], [[Van, Turkey]], [[Hakk\u00e2ri]], [[\u015e\u0131rnak]], [[Siirt]], [[Batman Province|Batman]], [[Mardin]], [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] and [[Tunceli]]. These electoral districts are mostly Kurdish-majority provinces. In this election, however, the HDP departed from its traditional Kurdish issues-focused role and embraced other minority ethnic and religious groups in Turkey, women's issues, LGBT and left-wing activists and political groups under its wing, promoting its appeal to a national level and drawing a wider pool of support from all over Turkey. This resulted the HDP to be not only the 4th largest political party in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey but also a formidable force in gaining the Turkish overseas votes, ranking 2nd after the AKP with 20.41% and carrying Japan, Ukraine, Greece, Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Canada and the U.K. The HDP also derailed the AKP from being the majority party, forming a single-party government and reaching 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the necessary number to enact a referendum necessary to change the constitution so that Turkey would abandon its traditional parliamentary government and instead adopt an American-style executive presidency government. This is hailed by Turkey's opposition parties and their supporters as the biggest contribution the HDP made to the Republic of Turkey.\n\n==Parliamentary politicians==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n# [[Meral Dan\u0131\u015f Be\u015fta\u015f]]\n# [[Beh\u00e7et Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m]] \n# [[Berdan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk]]\n# [[Dersim Da\u011f]]\n# [[Saliha Aydeniz]]\n# [[Dirayet Ta\u015fdemir]]\n# [[Leyla Zana]]\n# [[S\u0131rr\u0131 S\u00fcreyya \u00d6nder]]\n# [[Ay\u015fe Acar Ba\u015faran]]\n# [[Mehmet Ali Aslan]]\n# Saadet Becerekli\n# {{ill|Hi\u015fyar \u00d6zsoy|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# {{ill|Mahmut Celadet Gaydal\u0131|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Mizgin Irgat\n# [[Nursel Aydo\u011fan]]\n# [[\u0130dris Baluken]]\n# {{ill|\u00c7a\u011flar Demirel|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Nimettullah Erdo\u011fmu\u015f\n# [[Ziya Pir]]\n# {{ill|Altan Tan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# {{ill|\u0130mam Ta\u015f\u00e7\u0131er|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Feleknas Uca]]\n# {{ill|Sibel Yi\u011fitalp|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Mahmut To\u011frul\n# {{ill|Nihat Akdo\u011fan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Selma Irmak]]\n# {{ill|Abdullah Zeydan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Mehmet Emin Ad\u0131yaman\n# Erdal Ata\u015f\n# [[Pervin Buldan]]\n# [[Selahattin Demirta\u015f]] (jailed 2016/11/04-present)\n# {{ill|Celal Do\u011fan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[H\u00fcda Kaya]]\n# [[Filiz Kerestecio\u011flu]]\n# [[Garo Paylan]]\n# [[M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Do\u011fan]]\n# [[Ertu\u011frul K\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fc]]\n# {{ill|Ayhan Bilgen|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Ali Atalan]]\n# [[Erol Dora]]\n# [[Mithat Sancar]]\n# {{ill|G\u00fclser Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Dengir Mir Mehmet F\u0131rat]]\n# [[Burcu \u00c7elik \u00d6zkan]]\n# [[Besime Konca]]\n# {{ill|Kadri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[\u0130brahim Ayhan]](forcefully dismissed on 2018.02.27<ref name=\"figaro20180228\">Turquie: deux d\u00e9put\u00e9s du parti prokurde d\u00e9chus de leur mandat  http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2018/02/27/97001-20180227FILWWW00215-turquie-deux-deputes-du-parti-prokurde-dechus-de-leur-mandat.php</ref>)\n# [[Osman Baydemir]]\n# [[Dilek \u00d6calan]] (jailed 2018/03/01-present)\n# {{ill|Leyla Birlik|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Ferhat Enc\u00fc]]\n# Aycan \u0130rmez\n# [[Faysal Sar\u0131y\u0131ld\u0131z]] (exiled, wanted 2017/06/05)\n# {{ill|Alican \u00d6nl\u00fc|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Lezgin Botan\n# Adem Geveri\n# [[Tu\u011fba Hezer \u00d6zt\u00fcrk]] (exiled, wanted 2017/06/05)\n# Bedia \u00d6zg\u00f6k\u00e7e Ertan\n# Nadir Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m\n# [[Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f]] (jailed 2016/11/04-present)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mothers of Diyarbak\u0131r]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Celep |year=2014 |ref=harv\n|first=\u00d6d\u00fcl |title=HDP'li iki belediyeye kayyum atand\u0131 |journal=[[Vanhavadis.com]] |volume=16 |number=3 |url=https://www.vanhavadis.com/haber/hdpli-iki-belediyeye-kayyum-atandi-h30339.html |pages=165\u2013180}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website}} {{in lang|tr|en}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n{{Political parties of Turkey}}\n{{Kurdish parties in Turkey}}\n{{Party of European Socialists}}\n\n[[Category:Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)| ]]\n[[Category:Kurds in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Political parties in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Political parties of minorities]]\n[[Category:Turkish democracy movements]]\n[[Category:Socialist feminist organizations]]\n[[Category:Social democratic parties in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Democratic socialist parties in Asia]]\n[[Category:Social democratic parties in Asia]]\n[[Category:Feminist parties in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pluralist leftist Turkish political party}}\n{{redirect|Democratic Party of the Peoples|other uses|People's Democratic Party (disambiguation)|and|Democratic People's Party (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox political party\n| name = Peoples' Democratic Party\n| native_name = Halklar\u0131n Demokratik Partisi\n| native_name_lang = Turkish\n| logo = Logo of the Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey).svg\n| colorcode = {{Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)/meta/color}}\n| abbreviation = HDP<ref name=\"Tuzuk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.yargitaycb.gov.tr/icerik/1144|title=Parti t\u00fcz\u00fc\u011f\u00fc |publisher=T.C.

The HDP is in an alliance with the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Democratic Regions Party]] (DBP), often described as the HDP's [[fraternal party]].

Despite concerns that it could fall short of the 10% [[election threshold]],  the party put forward party-lists instead of running independent candidates in the subsequent [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]]. Exceeding expectations, it polled at 13.12%, becoming the third largest [[Grand National Assembly|parliamentary]] group. The party briefly participated in the [[2015 interim election government of Turkey|interim election government]] formed by AKP Prime Minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] on 28 August 2015, with HDP MPs [[Ali Haydar Konca]] and [[M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Do\u011fan]] becoming the [[Minister of European Union Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of European Union Affairs]] and the [[Ministry of Development (Turkey)|Minister of Development]] respectively.\n\nWitnessing the [[2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|2016 Turkish coup attempt]] and pointing out previous repression of democratic forces by martial powers, the HDP strongly opposed the coup.

From September 2016 and forward, the Judiciary of Turkey started to submit HDP elected officials to anti-terrorism accusations.

While the HDP is also affiliated with the Peace and Democracy Party and the Democratic Regions Party, it aims to establish a new perspective that overcomes the traditional Turkish versus Kurdish divide. The HDP instead aims to collectively represent people of all ethnic or religious backgrounds and to safeguard their [[Human rights in Turkey|civil liberties]] by bringing about [[direct democracy]] and an end to capitalist exploitation. The party has long advocated the establishment of local 'people's parliaments' to increase democratic representation and decentralisation of power.

The HDP carried victories in 14 out of 85 electoral districts in Turkey: [[Ardahan]], [[Kars]], [[I\u011fd\u0131r]], [[A\u011fr\u0131 Province]], [[Mu\u015f]], [[Bitlis]], [[Van, Turkey]], [[Hakk\u00e2ri]], [[\u015e\u0131rnak]], [[Siirt]], [[Batman Province|Batman]], [[Mardin]], [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] and [[Tunceli]]. These electoral districts are mostly Kurdish-majority provinces. In this election, however, the HDP departed from its traditional Kurdish issues-focused role and embraced other minority ethnic and religious groups in Turkey, women's issues, LGBT and left-wing activists and political groups under its wing, promoting its appeal to a national level and drawing a wider pool of support from all over Turkey. This resulted the HDP to be not only the 4th largest political party in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey but also a formidable force in gaining the Turkish overseas votes, ranking 2nd after the AKP with 20.41% and carrying Japan, Ukraine, Greece, Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Canada and the U.K. The HDP also derailed the AKP from being the majority party, forming a single-party government and reaching 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the necessary number to enact a referendum necessary to change the constitution so that Turkey would abandon its traditional parliamentary government and instead adopt an American-style executive presidency government. This is hailed by Turkey's opposition parties and their supporters as the biggest contribution the HDP made to the Republic of Turkey.\n\n==Parliamentary politicians==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n# [[Meral Dan\u0131\u015f Be\u015fta\u015f]]\n# [[Beh\u00e7et Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m]] \n# [[Berdan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk]]\n# [[Dersim Da\u011f]]\n# [[Saliha Aydeniz]]\n# [[Dirayet Ta\u015fdemir]]\n# [[Leyla Zana]]\n# [[S\u0131rr\u0131 S\u00fcreyya \u00d6nder]]\n# [[Ay\u015fe Acar Ba\u015faran]]\n# [[Mehmet Ali Aslan]]\n# Saadet Becerekli\n# {{ill|Hi\u015fyar \u00d6zsoy|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# {{ill|Mahmut Celadet Gaydal\u0131|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Mizgin Irgat\n# [[Nursel Aydo\u011fan]]\n# [[\u0130dris Baluken]]\n# {{ill|\u00c7a\u011flar Demirel|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Nimettullah Erdo\u011fmu\u015f\n# [[Ziya Pir]]\n# {{ill|Altan Tan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# {{ill|\u0130mam Ta\u015f\u00e7\u0131er|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Feleknas Uca]]\n# {{ill|Sibel Yi\u011fitalp|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Mahmut To\u011frul\n# {{ill|Nihat Akdo\u011fan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Selma Irmak]]\n# {{ill|Abdullah Zeydan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Mehmet Emin Ad\u0131yaman\n# Erdal Ata\u015f\n# [[Pervin Buldan]]\n# [[Selahattin Demirta\u015f]] (jailed 2016/11/04-present)\n# {{ill|Celal Do\u011fan|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[H\u00fcda Kaya]]\n# [[Filiz Kerestecio\u011flu]]\n# [[Garo Paylan]]\n# [[M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Do\u011fan]]\n# [[Ertu\u011frul K\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fc]]\n# {{ill|Ayhan Bilgen|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Ali Atalan]]\n# [[Erol Dora]]\n# [[Mithat Sancar]]\n# {{ill|G\u00fclser Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Dengir Mir Mehmet F\u0131rat]]\n# [[Burcu \u00c7elik \u00d6zkan]]\n# [[Besime Konca]]\n# {{ill|Kadri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[\u0130brahim Ayhan]](forcefully dismissed on 2018.02.27<ref name=\"figaro20180228\">Turquie: deux d\u00e9put\u00e9s du parti prokurde d\u00e9chus de leur mandat  http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2018/02/27/97001-20180227FILWWW00215-turquie-deux-deputes-du-parti-prokurde-dechus-de-leur-mandat.php</ref>)\n# [[Osman Baydemir]]\n# [[Dilek \u00d6calan]] (jailed 2018/03/01-present)\n# {{ill|Leyla Birlik|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# [[Ferhat Enc\u00fc]]\n# Aycan \u0130rmez\n# [[Faysal Sar\u0131y\u0131ld\u0131z]] (exiled, wanted 2017/06/05)\n# {{ill|Alican \u00d6nl\u00fc|tr||lt=|WD=}}\n# Lezgin Botan\n# Adem Geveri\n# [[Tu\u011fba Hezer \u00d6zt\u00fcrk]] (exiled, wanted 2017/06/05)\n# Bedia \u00d6zg\u00f6k\u00e7e Ertan\n# Nadir Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m\n# [[Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f]] (jailed 2016/11/04-present)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mothers of Diyarbak\u0131r]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Celep |year=2014 |ref=harv\n|first=\u00d6d\u00fcl |title=Can the Kurdish Left contribute to Turkey's democratization? |journal=[[Insight Turkey]] |volume=16 |number=3 |url=http://file.insightturkey.com/Files/Pdf/can-the-kurdish.pdf |pages=165\u2013180}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website}} {{in lang|tr|en}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n{{Political parties of Turkey}}\n{{Kurdish parties in Turkey}}\n{{Party of European Socialists}}\n\n[[Category:Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)| ]]\n[[Category:Kurds in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Political parties in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Political parties of minorities]]\n[[Category:Turkish democracy movements]]\n[[Category:Socialist feminist organizations]]\n[[Category:Social democratic parties in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Democratic socialist parties in Asia]]\n[[Category:Social democratic parties in Asia]]\n[[Category:Feminist parties in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "78.186.41.251", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences:Yaz\u0131m hatas\u0131 giderildi, i\u00e7erik eklendi)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples%27_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)"}

It is located on the [[Tuo River]] and is a transportation and food-processing center.\nThe population of the entire prefecture was 3,702,847 at the 2010 census, and the population of the built-up (metro) area was 1,251,095 in the 2 urban districts of [[Shizhong District, Neijiang|Shizhong]] and [[Dongxing District|Dongxing]].\n\n==History==\nIn medieval times the locality was an important salt-producing area, but in recent times its name has been associated with the cultivation of sugarcane; it is commonly referred to as the sugar capital of Sichuan. During the economic boom of China in the 1990s and early 21st century, Neijiang has been transformed and its industries now range from engineering, electronics, chemicals, construction materials, to consumer goods. It is also the home of Neijiang Normal College and many other educational institutions. Its geographic location puts it in the center of the southern Sichuan transport network. Neijiang is also the hometown of [[Zhang Daqian]], one of the best-known and most prodigious Chinese artists of the twentieth century.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=center\n!colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | Map\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | <div style=\"position: relative\" class=\"center\">\n{{Image label begin|image=Administrative Division Neijiang.png|width=612|link=}} \n{{Image label|x=1140|y=0940|scale=612/2040|text=[[Shizhong District, Neijiang|'''Shizhong''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1570|y=0780|scale=612/2040|text=[[Dongxing District|'''Dongxing''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=0570|y=0900|scale=612/2040|text=[[Weiyuan County, Sichuan|'''Weiyuan<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=0900|y=0540|scale=612/2040|text=[[Zizhong County|'''Zizhong<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1640|y=1340|scale=612/2040|text=[[Longchang|'''Longchang<br>{{small|(city)}}''']]}}\n</div>\n|-\n! #\n!

It is located on the [[Tuo River]] and is a transportation and food-processing center.\nThe population of the entire prefecture was 3,702,847 at the 2010 census, and the population of the built-up (metro) area was 1,251,095 in the 2 urban districts of [[Shizhong District, Neijiang|Shizhong]] and [[Dongxing District|Dongxing]].\n\n==History==\nIn medieval times the locality was an important salt-producing area, but in recent times its name has been associated with the cultivation of sugarcane; it is commonly referred to as the sugar capital of Sichuan. During the economic boom of China in the 1990s and early 21st century, Neijiang has been transformed and its industries now range from engineering, electronics, chemicals, construction materials, to consumer goods. It is also the home of Neijiang Normal College and many other educational institutions. Its geographic location puts it in the center of the southern Sichuan  transport network . Neijiang is also the hometown of [[Zhang Daqian]], one of the best-known and most prodigious Chinese artists of the twentieth century.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=center\n!colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | Map\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | <div style=\"position: relative\" class=\"center\">\n{{Image label begin|image=Administrative Division Neijiang.png|width=612|link=}} \n{{Image label|x=1140|y=0940|scale=612/2040|text=[[Shizhong District, Neijiang|'''Shizhong''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1570|y=0780|scale=612/2040|text=[[Dongxing District|'''Dongxing''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=0570|y=0900|scale=612/2040|text=[[Weiyuan County, Sichuan|'''Weiyuan<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=0900|y=0540|scale=612/2040|text=[[Zizhong County|'''Zizhong<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=1640|y=1340|scale=612/2040|text=[[Longchang|'''Longchang<br>{{small|(city)}}''']]}}\n</div>\n|-\n! #\n!

The De La Salle men's varsity team is known as the [[De La Salle Green Archers]], women's varsity team as the [[DLSU Lady Spikers|DLSU Lady Archers/Spikers]], and high school team as the [[DLSZ Junior Archers]].\n\n==History==\nDe La Salle and Ateneo were both co-founders of the pre-war NCAA but actively compete in the UAAP. The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society. Several Ambassadors of the United States of America would gamely attend and watch a De La Salle vs Ateneo basketball game year after year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://humblebola.com/the-rewind-the-past-present-and-future-of-ateneo-la-salle/|title=THE REWIND: THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF ATENEO-LA SALLE|work=Humblebola|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/a-brief-history-of-the-ateneo-la-salle-rivalry-a1993-20170911-lfrm2|title=A Brief History of the Ateneo vs De La Salle rivalry|work=Esquire|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> The rivalry started out with the men's basketball games and has since expanded to other sports, particularly in women's volleyball where both teams fought head-to-head in the UAAP Finals for six consecutive times from 2012 to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.ph/volleyball/uaap-volleyball/1057045/defining-the-2010s-lady-spikers-dynastic-rule-in-the-uaap/|title=Defining the 2010s: Lady Spikers\u2019 dynastic rule in the UAAP|work=Fox Sports|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> Both universities have also extended their rivalry beyond sports and have gone into their various fields of academic achievements, accomplishments, expertise and contributions to the upliftment of the Philippines.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, basketball games between Ateneo and De La Salle were played at an open basketball court at the Padre Faura, Ermita campus of UP and in 1926 at the Nozaleda Park (now called Agrifina Circle which is part of Luneta Park). The venue later moved to the covered courts of the US Army's 31st Infantry Gym and UST Gym.<ref>Suva GT: NCAA 25th Anniversary Souvenir Program, San Juan, Rizal: JCP Publishing, 1949</ref> The games then moved to the pre-war Rizal Memorial Coliseum to accommodate bigger crowds, and at one point, the venues included the Ateneo Loyola Center, the Cuneta Astrodome, the PhilSports Arena. Currently, the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the SM Mall of Asia Arena are the present main venues for their sold out games.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4\u2013peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

In Game 3, La Salle player [[Mike Cortez]] missed 11 of 13 shots, which caused La Salle students and alumni to accuse him of [[match fixing|throwing the game]], as Ateneo eventually won the title to deny La Salle a fifth-consecutive championship.<ref name=\"NY\"/>\n\n'''2003\u20132005: Semifinals Meetings'''\n\nAteneo and La Salle would play second fiddle to [[FEU Tamaraws|Far Eastern University]] (FEU) from [[UAAP Season 66|2003]] to [[UAAP Season 68|2005]], with the Tamaraws defeating Ateneo in 2003, losing to La Salle in [[UAAP Season 67|2004]] and defeating La Salle in 2005.\n\nAlong the way, the two teams met in the semifinals, where the higher seed gets the ''twice-to-beat advantage''. In 2003, La Salle forced No. 1 seed Ateneo into a rubber match after a 76\u201372 overtime win, with the game being halted after a brawl erupted between the two teams. With Ateneo's [[LA Tenorio]] and La Salle's [[Ryan Ara\u00f1a]] suspended for the deciding game, Ateneo eliminated La Salle from Finals contention in the deciding game with a 74\u201368 triumph.\n\nIn [[UAAP Season 67|2004]], La Salle and Ateneo finished the elimination round tied for second place, so a playoff game was played to determine which team gets the twice-to-beat advantage. La Salle won the game, and ended Ateneo's season in the semifinals, to face FEU in the Finals. La Salle would win in three games to deny FEU which had defeated Ateneo a season before, a back-to-back championship run.\n\nIn 2005, three teams, La Salle, Ateneo and UE, were all tied for second place. La Salle won the tiebreaker with a superior point differential on games played by the three teams, causing Ateneo and UE to play for the right to face La Salle with the twice-to-win ''disadvantage'' in which the Eagles won. However, La Salle defeated Ateneo in the semifinals to clinch another Finals appearance against FEU.\n\n'''2006: La Salle Suspension'''\n\nAfter FEU swept La Salle in the 2005 championship series, La Salle admitted it fielded two ineligible players from 2003 to 2005, albeit it claimed not to be aware of their ineligibility which caused them to return the 2005 runner-up trophy and the 2004 championship trophy they won against FEU (The league would later award FEU the trophy). The league suspended La Salle in [[UAAP Season 69|2006]] for a year due to negligence, with all of their games during that period also forfeited. Ateneo faced UST in the 2006 Finals, a series UST won in three games.\n\n'''2007: \"Two is Greater than Three\"'''\n\nUpon their return in [[UAAP Season 70|2007]], UE swept the elimination round 14\u20130, with their last game against La Salle going into overtime with the Warriors still prevailing. With Ateneo also losing their last game, the two teams were again tied for second place, and La Salle won the playoff game to clinch the twice-to-beat advantage. Prior to this, Ateneo won the two elimination round games against La Salle.\n\nUnlike earlier match-ups where the team with the advantage won the first game, Ateneo won the first game, with [[Chris Tiu]] playing pivotal roles in crunch time where he scored the winning lay-up with 7.3 seconds remaining to force a deciding game.<ref name=\"GMANews.tv\">{{cite news|title=UAAP: Eagles upset Archers, 65\u201364, to force 1 more game |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62225/UAAP-Eagles-upset-Archers-65-64-to-force-1-more-game |publisher=GMANews.tv |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2009-06-05 }}</ref> In their fifth meeting of the season, [[Pocholo Villanueva]] scored a three-pointer to add La Salle's lead to nine with less than three minutes in the game left.

After Ford Arao later cut the lead to five, La Salle's OJ Cua missed two free-throws with 23.9 seconds remaining.

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three. [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] of La Salle was named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while then-graduating La Salle team captain [[Cha Cruz|Charleen Cruz]] was named as Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second consecutive season.<ref>https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/02/29/12/la-salle-blasts-ateneo-retain-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/249851/la-salle-crushes-ateneo-to-repeat-as-uaap-women-s-volleyball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 75 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nAteneo and La Salle faced each other once again during the [[UAAP Season 75 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals]] after the De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the [[NU Bulldogs|NU Lady Bulldogs]] and the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the [[Adamson Falcons|Adamson Lady Falcons]] during the Final Four matches that were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] on February 23, 2013.\n\nThe UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals was the league's first volleyball finals series to be played at the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the Mall of Asia Arena. Game One of the Ateneo-La Salle finals was played before a crowd of 17,342 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on March 2, 2013. The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans.

La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nHead-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2.

Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society.

The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four. In the championship match, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] prevailed over the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], 71\u201362.\n\nIn the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.\n\nIn the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.\n\nIn the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of Visayas Green Lancers, 95\u201371 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4\u2013peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

The Green Archers finished the elimination round as the top seed with a 13\u20131 record with Ateneo coming in second with a 10\u20134 win-loss record. The only loss of the Green Archers came at the hands of their archivals, the Ateneo Blue Eagles during the second to the last game of the elimination round.

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship. Ateneo High School and [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School]] (DLSZ) met twice in the UAAP juniors' basketball finals; in [[UAAP Season 70|2007]] in which DLSZ won in two games dethroning the Eaglets in the process, and in [[UAAP Season 72|2009]] in which the Blue Eaglets won the best-of-three series, 2\u20131.

The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three.

The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their matchups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21\u201325, 29\u201327, 25\u201322 and 25\u201320. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201314, 18\u201325, 25\u201318 and 15\u201310, to finish the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP Women's Volleyball Finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nHead-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2.

The only loss De La Salle Zobel encountered was a loss to Xavier high school during the RIFA 2 championship in 2004.\n\n===Badminton===\n\nAteneo has 11 titles whereas La Salle has 6 in terms of total seniors' badminton collegiate championships. The last men's badminton crown for La Salle came in 2007 and for Ateneo in 2013. Ateneo also won championship titles in 1995, 1996, 2001, 2003, and 2011.

In 2006, Ateneo handed La Salle its first humiliating 10-run loss, 17\u20137, on Jonathan Sibal's 2-RBI single off pitcher Jeff Ardio which ended the game prematurely at the 8th inning (mercy rule). La Salle actually led 7\u20134 in the 4th inning before Ateneo exploded for 9 runs and put the game out of reach. In 2009, Ateneo and La Salle combined for what may be the highest scoring game in UAAP Baseball history when Ateneo defeated La Salle, 27\u201314. In [[UAAP Season 78]], La Salle dethroned Ateneo who were the 3-peat defending champions. Both teams would meet again in the [[UAAP Season 81]] Finals, where La Salle won their fifth championship title after defeating Ateneo in Game 3, 11\u20139. In the juniors' division, Ateneo has 2 NCAA titles and 3 UAAP titles for a total of 5 championship titles. La Salle won all 4 of its championship titles in the UAAP.\n\n==Trivia==\nDue to the numerous socialites watching the games live, La Salle head coach [[Franz Pumaren]] said that \"The janitors in the Araneta Coliseum would often say, 'If there's an Ateneo\u2013La Salle game, once everybody's out of the coliseum, it still smells good because of all the socialites watching.\" In the late 1990s, former first daughter and actress [[Kris Aquino]] would call Ateneo head coach [[Joe Lipa]] to check on the team's progress, according to Ricky Dandan, Lipa's former assistant and brother of former [[NU Bulldogs]] coach Manny. [[Joel Banal]], Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to [[UAAP Season 66|2003]], used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded [[Full-court press|press]], and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills. Moreover, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the [[2000 NBA All-Star Game]] to the [[Moro Lorenzo Sports Center]], while [[ICTSI]] shipping magnate Billionaire [[Enrique K. Razon|Enrique Razon, Jr.]] donated US$1 million to refurbish La Salle's sporting facilities at the [[Enrique M.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100&nbsp;million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

This was the first year that Earth Day used the [[Internet]] as its principal organizing tool, and it proved invaluable nationally and internationally. Kelly Evans, a professional political organizer, served as executive director of the 2000 campaign. The event ultimately enlisted more than 5,000 environmental groups outside the United States, reaching hundreds of millions of people in a record 183 countries.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{Cite news |last=Gerth |first=Jeff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/23/us/peaceful-easy-feeling-imbues-30th-earth-day.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Peaceful, Easy Feeling Imbues 30th Earth Day |date=April 23, 2000 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref> [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was the official host for the event,<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" /> and about 400,000 participants stood in the cold rain during the course of the day.\n\nTo turn Earth Day into a sustainable annual event rather than one that occurred every 10 years, Nelson and Bruce Anderson, New Hampshire's lead organizers in 1990, formed Earth Day USA.

Following the 25th Anniversary in 1995, the coordination baton was handed to Earth Day Network.\n\nEarth Day 2007 was one of the largest Earth Days to date, with many people participating in the activities in thousands of places including [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]; [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]; [[Tuvalu]]; [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]; [[Togo]]; [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]; [[London]]; and [[New York City|New York]].\n\nFor Earth Day 2017, the Earth Day Network created four toolkits to aid organizations wanting to hold teach-ins to celebrate the theme \"Environmental and Climate Literacy.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/earth-day-network-releases-teach-in-toolkits-for-earth-day-2017/ |title=Earth Day Network releases teach-in toolkits for Earth Day 2017 |date=April 20, 2017 |work=Davis Enterprise |access-date=April 21, 2017}}</ref> The four toolkits are:\n* Earth Day Action Toolkit: Educating and Activating Communities for Change\n* Environmental Teach-in Toolkit\n* Global Day of Conversation Toolkit for Local Governments\n* MobilizeU: Campus Teach-in Toolkit\n2017 also saw the Earth Day Network co-organize the [[March for Science]] rally and teach-in at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn 2019, Earth Day Network partnered with [[Keep America Beautiful]] and [[National Cleanup Day]] for the inaugural nationwide Earth Day CleanUp.

Amid the recent outbreak, we encourage people to rise up but to do so safely and responsibly \u2014 in many cases, that means using our voices to drive action online rather than in person,\u201d said Kathleen Rogers, President of Earth Day Network.<ref>https://www.earthday.org/press-release/update-on-the-great-global-cleanup-in-response-to-covid-19/</ref><ref>[https://www.earthday.org/press-release/update-on-the-great-global-cleanup-in-response-to-covid-19/]</ref>\n\nEarth Day will educate and mobilize more than one billion people to grow and support the next generation of environmental activists. It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100&nbsp;million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8&nbsp;billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.   Combined, these volunteer activities will be the largest volunteer event in history.<ref name=\"Great Global CleanUp\" /><ref name=\"Earth Day 50th Anniversary\" /><ref>[https://real-leaders.com/earth-day-take-part-in-the-biggest-volunteer-event-in-history/ Earth Day: Take Part in the Biggest Volunteer Event in History]</ref>\n* Education: Earth Day is building environmental and climate literacy worldwide. EDN will continue to work with teachers, students, innovators and thought leaders to educate and activate a new generation of environmental leaders around the world. \n* Events: Earth Day is now recognized worldwide as the planet's most significant civic engagement event each year. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked by tens of thousands of rallies and community events in every country in the world, and large-scale signature events to take place in Washington, D.C., and other global capitals.\n* Artists for the Earth: As Earth Day reaches its milestone 50th Anniversary in April 2020, nature and the environment are faced with enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |access-date=April 22, 2010}}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration. On March 20, 2008, in addition to the ceremony at the United Nations, ceremonies were held in New Zealand, and bells were sounded in California, Vienna, Paris, Lithuania, Tokyo, and many other locations.
