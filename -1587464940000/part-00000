During the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]], the main forms of taxation were land taxes, although [[custom duty|custom duties]] and fees to mint coins were also imposed. The most important tax of the late Anglo-Saxon period was the [[danegeld|geld]], a land tax first regularly collected in 1012 to pay for mercenaries. After the [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066, the geld continued to be collected until 1162, but it was eventually replaced with taxes on personal property and income.\n\n==Background==\n[[Britannia]], the southern and central part of the island of Great Britain, was a province of the [[Roman Empire]] until the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in around 400 AD. The Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] told the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] in 410 that they were responsible for their own defence,<ref name=Making13>Kirby ''Making of Early England'' pp. 13\u201314</ref> and from then until the landing of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in the [[Kingdom of Kent]] in 597 as part of the [[Gregorian mission]], little is known about Britain's governmental structures or financial systems.<ref name=Intro2>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 2</ref>\n\n==Anglo-Saxon England (597\u20131066)==\nThe first unequivocal mention of taxation in [[Anglo-Saxon England]] comes from the [[Law of \u00c6thelberht]], the law code of King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]], which specifies that fines from judicial cases were to be paid to the king. No other forms of taxes are mentioned in \u00c6thelberht's law code, but other forms of taxation are implied by the grant of an exemption from taxation given by another king, [[Wihtred of Kent]], to a church. Other mentions of taxes are contained in the law code of King [[Ine of Wessex]]. Although other early Anglo-Saxon kings are not mentioned as collecting taxes, the medieval writer [[Bede]] does mention that land in Anglesey and the Isle of Man were divided up in [[Hide (unit)|hide]]s, defined in Ine's law as a unit of land that could be used for collecting food and other goods from the king's subjects. A document from the 7th or 8th century, the [[Tribal Hidage]], shows that much of the Anglo-Saxon lands had been divided into hides by that time. Charters from the time of King [[Offa of Mercia]] show that tolls were collected on trade, and it was during Offa's reign that coinage in silver pennies was first introduced into Anglo-Saxon England. Coinage became a royal right, and was probably introduced to make payment of taxes easier.<ref name=BASE>Lawson \"Taxation\" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref>\n\nIn early Anglo-Saxon England the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of [[food rent]] (known as ''feorm'') due from an area. Initially the size of the hide varied according to value and resources of the land itself.<ref name=lapidge238>Faith \"Hide\" ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 238-239</ref> Over time the hide became the unit on what all public obligation was assessed. Tenants had a threefold obligation, based on their landholding, they had to provide manpower for the so-called \"common burdens\" of ''military service, fortress work, and bridge repair''.<ref name=lapidge238 /><ref name=hollister59>Hollister ''Anglo-Saxon Military Institutions'' pp. 59-60</ref> With increasing problems from raiding Vikings, the Anglo-Saxon leaders raised taxes, also based on the landholding(or hidage) of their tenants. The tax was known as [[Danegeld]] and was used to pay the raiders off rather than fight.  In the 9th century [[Alfred the Great]] confronted the Viking problem. After his victory over them at the [[Battle of Edington]] (878) he set about building a system of fortified towns or forts, known as ''burhs''. He also updated the traditional [[fyrd]] to provide a standing army and navy. To fund all of these changes Alfred required a new system of tax and conscription that is contained in a document, now known as the [[Burghal Hidage]]. The Burghal Hidage contains a list of over thirty fortified places and the taxes, recorded as numbers of hides, assigned for their maintenance.<ref name=lapidge76>Lapidge ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 76</ref> After Alfred's death his son [[Edgar the Peaceable|Edgar]] developed the tax system further by periodically recalling and reminting all the coinage, with the [[moneyer]]s being forced to pay for new [[die (manufacturing)|die]]s. All profits from these actions went to the king, and were a royal right.<ref name=BASE/> Despite all these changes, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records payment of \u00a3132,000 in tribute to the Scandinavian attackers from 991 to 1012.<ref name=loyn121>Loyn ''Governance of Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 121</ref>\n\nThe year 1012 saw the introduction of the geld or heregeld (literally \"army tax\"), an annual tax first assessed by King [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] to pay for [[housecarl|mercenaries]] in the army and navy. The reinforced military was needed, in the face of an invasion of England, by King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] of Denmark. Later, after the conquest of England by Sweyn's son [[Cnut the Great]], the geld was continued. This tax used similar machinery for collection as Danegeld and was again based on the amount of hides a tenant had. The amount due from each hide was variable. In 1051 [[Edward the Confessor]] abolished heregeld and saved money by selling off his navy, giving the responsibility of naval defence to the [[Cinque ports]] in return for various privileges. However, heregeld was possibly reinstated in 1052.<ref name=loyn121/><ref name=BASEGeld>Keynes \"Heregeld\" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref>\n\n==Norman and Angevin England (1066\u20131216)==\n\nThere was no formal division between the household of the king and the government in the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman period]], although gradually the household itself began to separate from the government. Thus, income from taxation merged with other income to fund the king and the government without any distinctions such as in the modern world.<ref name=SaulGov>Saul \"Government\" ''A Companion to Medieval England'' pp. 115\u2013118</ref> Under the Norman and [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin kings]], the government had four main sources of income: (1) income from lands owned directly by the king, or his [[demesne]] lands, (2) income that derived from his rights as a feudal overlord, the [[Feudalism|feudal right]]s such as [[feudal aid]] or [[scutage]] (3) taxation, and (4) income from the fines and other profits of justice. By the time of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], most revenues were paid into the [[Exchequer]], the English Treasury, and the first records of the Exchequer date from 1130, in the form of the first surviving [[Pipe Roll]] for that year.<ref name=Bartlett159/> From the reign of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], Pipe Rolls form a mostly continuous record of royal revenues and taxation.<ref name=Dict219>Coredon ''Dictionary'' p. 219</ref> However, not all revenue went into the Exchequer, and some occasional taxes and levies were never recorded in the Pipe Rolls.<ref name=Bartlett159>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 159</ref>\n\nTaxation itself took a number of forms in this period. The main tax was the geld, still based on the land, and unique in Europe at the time as being the only land tax that was universal on all the king's subjects, not just his immediate feudal tenants and peasants. It was still assessed on the hide, and the usual rate was 2 shillings per hide. In certain circumstances, however, taxation was assessed in terms of services rendered to the crown, such as [[Avera and Inward]].<ref>Darby and Campbell ''Domesday Geography of South-East England'' p. 72</ref>\n\nBecause the geld was assessed on landowners, it only applied to free men who owned land, and thus serfs and slaves were exempt. Other exemptions were granted to favoured subjects or were a right that went with certain governmental offices.<ref name=Bartlett165>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 165\u2013168</ref> The geld was unpopular, and because of the increasing number of exemptions, yielded smaller amounts. During the reign of King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], it is unclear if the geld was collected at all, as no financial records survive. However, when King Henry II came to the throne, the geld was collected once more.<ref name=Ruling98>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 98\u201399</ref> After 1162, however the geld was no longer collected.<ref name=Bartlett165/>\n\nInstead, a new type of tax was imposed starting in 1166, although it was not an annual tax. This was the tax on moveable property and income, and it could be imposed at varying rates. Likewise, the [[Saladin tithe]], imposed in 1188 to raise funds for a proposed crusade by King Henry II, was levied at the rate of 10% of all goods and revenues, with some exceptions for a knight's horse and armour and clerical vestments. Also excluded were those who had pledged to go on crusade with the king.<ref name=Bartlett165/>\n\nIn 1194, in part from need to raise the huge sums required for the ransom of King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] who was captive in Germany, a new land tax was instituted. This was the [[carucage]], and like the geld it was based on the land. The carucage was imposed six times in all, but it produced smaller sums than other means of raising revenue and was last collected in 1224.<ref name=Bartlett165/> In 1194, as part of the attempts to raise Richard's ransom, a 25% levy on all personal property and income was imposed.<ref name=Bartlett165/> In other years, other rates were set, such as the thirteenth imposed in 1207.\n\nBesides taxes on land and taxes on personal property, this period saw the introduction of taxes on trade. In 1202, King [[John of England|John]] imposed a [[custom duty]] of a fifteenth of the value of all goods imported or exported. It appears, however, that these duties were discontinued in 1206.<ref name=SaulTax/>\n\n==Plantagenet England (1216\u20131360)==\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], the king and government sought consent from the nobles of England for taxes the government wished to impose. This led in 1254 to the start of the [[Parliament of England]], when the nobles advised the king to summon knights from each [[shire]] to help advise and consent to a new tax. In the 1260s, men from the towns were included with the knights, forming the beginnings of the [[House of Commons of England]].<ref name=SaulTax>Saul \"Taxation\" ''Companion to Medieval England'' pp. 281\u2013283</ref>\n\nBy the middle of the 13th century, the tax on moveable property had become fixed by convention at a fifteenth for those in the country, and a tenth for those living in towns. An innovation in 1334 was the replacement of the individual assessments by a lump sum assessment for each community.<ref name=SaulTax/>\n\nIn 1275, King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] reestablished a customs duty, by setting a rate of a [[mark (money)|mark]] on each sack of wool (weighing {{convert|364|lb|kg}}) or 300 wool-fells, and a mark on a last of hides. Edward then added another tax, the [[maltolt]], in 1294, on sacks of wool, which was in addition to the previous customs duty. These taxes were removed in 1296, but in 1303 they were reimposed but only on non-English merchants. Over the next 40 years, the maltolt was the subject of dispute between the king and Parliament, with the final result being that the tax was kept at a lower rate but that Parliament's consent was required to impose it.<ref name=SaulTax/>\n\n==Late medieval England (1360\u20131485)==\n\nThe revenues from the traditional sources of taxation declined in later medieval England, and a series of experiments in [[Tax per head|poll taxes]] began:<ref name=SaulTax/> in 1377 a flat rate tax, in 1379 a graduated tax.<ref name=Speight>Speight ''Craven and North-West Yorkshire Highlands'' pp. 29\u201360</ref> By 1381, the unpopularity of these taxes had contributed to the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. Later experiments in income taxes during the 15th century did not manage to raise the sums needed by the government, and other taxes, such as taxes on parishes, were attempted.<ref name=SaulTax/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bartlett, Robert|authorlink=Robert Bartlett (historian)|title=England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075\u20131225 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford, UK |year=2000 |isbn=0-19-822741-8 }}\n* {{cite book |author1=Blair, Peter Hunter |author2=Blair, Peter D. |authorlink= Peter Hunter Blair |title=An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England|edition=Third |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2003  |isbn=0-521-53777-0 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Coredon, Christopher |title= A Dictionary of Medieval Terms & Phrases |year= 2007 |edition= Reprint |publisher=D.

The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests, while on the coasts of [[Asia]], resident ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. The types of diversity in Asia are cultural, religious, economic and historical.\n\n[[File:Pamir ethnological map-fr.svg|thumb|Ethnological map of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]]]]\n\nSome groups are primarily [[hunter-gatherer]]s, whereas others practice [[transhumance]] (nomadic lifestyle), have been [[Agriculture|agrarian]] for millennia, or have adopted an industrial or urban lifestyle. Some groups or countries in Asia are completely urban (e.g., [[Qatar]] and [[Singapore]]); the largest countries in Asia with regard to population are the [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Japan]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], [[Iran]],  [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], and [[South Korea]]. [[Western imperialism in Asia|Colonisation]] of Asian ethnic groups and states by [[European peoples]] began in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (except in the former [[Soviet Union]], which was dissolved in 1991).\n\n==Central Asia==\n{{main article|Ethnic groups in Central Asia}}\n\n[[Central Asia]], in its most common definition, is deemed to consist of five former [[Soviet Socialist Republics]]: [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]].  In a wider view, [[Xinjiang]] of western [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Afghanistan]], and northern [[Pakistan]] are included. [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]], and [[Mongol]]ic peoples comprise its general ethnicities.\n\nThe main religions of Central Asia are [[Islam]] (Turkic/Indo-Iranian peoples) and [[Buddhism]] (Mongolia). Central Asia has a long, rich history mainly based on its geographical location along the ancient [[Silk Road]]. It has been conquered by [[Mongols]], [[Tibetans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Tatars]], [[Russians]], [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] and [[Sarmatians]], and thus has a very distinct, vibrant culture. The culture is influenced by [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[India]]n, Persian, Afghan, [[Arabian]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Sarmatian]] and [[Mongols|Mongolian]] cultures.\n\nThe [[Central Asian music|music of Central Asia]] is rich and varied and is appreciated worldwide. Meanwhile, [[List of Asian cuisines#Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian cuisine]] is one of the most prominent cuisines of [[Asia]], with cuisines from [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Azerbaijan]] showing significant influence from the foods of Central Asia. One of the most famous Central Asian foods is [[kebab]].\n\nThe literature of Central Asia is linked with [[Persian literature]] as historically it has been part of the [[Greater Iran|Persian Empire]] for a lot of its history. Furthermore, sitting at the junction of the Silk Road, it has numerous [[China|Chinese]], [[India]]n and [[Arabian]] literary works.\n\n==East Asia==\n{{Main|East Asians}}\n[[File:East Asia map of

The main ethnic groups of the region speak languages of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language families, along with [[East Slavs]] and various \"[[Paleosiberian languages|Paleo-Siberian]]\" peoples, with most of these ethnic groups being composed of nomads or people with a nomadic history.\n\nThe geographic region of [[Siberia]] was the historical land of the Turkic people, the [[Tatars]], in the [[Siberia Khanate]]{{Dubious|date=October 2009}}. [[Russia]], under [[Russian expansion|expansion of its territory]] however, took control of the region now known as Siberia, and thus today it is [[Russian conquest of Siberia|under Russian rule]]. There are roughly 33 million people in North Asia.\n\n==South Asia==\n{{main|Ethnic groups of South Asia}}\n[[Image:South Asian Language Families.jpg|thumb|Language families in South Asia]]\n[[Image:Jaipurgarments.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[Rajasthan]]i garments from [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]]]]\n[[South Asia]], in general definition, consists of the countries of [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The five [[South India|Southern Indian]] states and north-eastern Sri Lanka share a [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] culture, due to the prominence of [[Dravidian languages]] there. The [[Brahui people|Brahuis]] of [[Pakistan]]\nalso belong to [[Dravidian people]] group. [[Sri Lanka]] has two main languages, Sinhalese which has Indo-Aryan roots and Tamil which has Dravidian roots. [[Bangladesh]] and the [[India]]n province [[West Bengal]] share a common [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Bengali language|language]] and culture. The provinces of [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] of [[Pakistan]] share a common [[Dard people|Dardic]] and Tibetic heritage with the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. Similarly the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of Pakistan and [[India]]n state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] share a common Punjabi [[Punjabis|ethnicity]], [[Punjabi language|language]] and culture. In Pakistan, the two western regions of [[Baluchistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] share a greater [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] heritage and while the provinces of [[Sindh]] share a more [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] culture. [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] is most prevalent in [[Afghanistan]], with significant [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speakers.\n\nRegions of [[Nepal]] and parts of the Indian states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]] ([[Ladakh]]), [[Sikkim]] and [[Uttarakhand]] have cultural similarity to [[Tibet]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]] being the dominant religion there. Finally the [[Northeast India]]n states of [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and tribal groups of [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]] have cultural affinities with [[South East Asia]].\n\nBhutanese are often referred to in their literature as \"Bhote\" (people of Bhutia/Bhotia or Tibet). They follow Tibetan Buddhism to and it is a dominant political and cultural element in modern [[Bhutan]]. Their language, [[Dzongkha]], is the national language and is descended from Old [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]].\n\n[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], religions founded in the region that is today's India, are spread throughout the [[subcontinent]]. [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] also have significant region-specific histories. While India and Nepal have a majority of people following Hinduism, [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Bhutan]] have a majority of Buddhists alongside Hinduism. [[Islam]] is the second largest religion after Hinduism with Muslim countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n[[Indo-Aryan languages]] are spoken in most of [[North India|North]], [[East India|East]], [[West India|West]] and [[Central India|Central]] [[India]]; [[Nepal]]; [[Bangladesh]]; [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Dravidian languages]] are spoken in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Maldives]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] are spoken in the hills of [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Baltistan|North Pakistan]], [[North India|North]] and [[North East India]]. [[Austroasiatic languages]] are spoken in certain northern and eastern areas of [[Bangladesh]], parts of [[Nepal]] and scattered across different zones of [[India]] mostly concentrated around [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] and the state of [[Meghalaya]]. [[Iranian languages]] are most prevalent in [[Afghanistan]] and western [[Pakistan]]. [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speakers are significant in [[Afghanistan]] and parts of [[Pakistan]] as well.\n\n==Southeast Asia==\n{{main|Ethnic groups of Southeast Asia}}\n[[Southeast Asia]] is often split into two parts: [[Mainland Southeast Asia]], comprising [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]; and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], which includes [[Brunei]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]], [[East Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]]. [[China]] has historically influenced the region more than [[India]], most notably through the large [[Overseas_Chinese|Chinese populations]] in many of the countries of the region. \n \nDemographically, Southeast Asia has had little Western immigration, although [[Western cultural|Western]] influence still exists due to the lasting legacy of [[colonialism]]. One example is the Philippines, which has been heavily influenced by [[Spain]] and the [[United States of America]] over the course of almost four centuries of colonisation. \n\nA common feature found around the region is [[stilt house]]s, while another is [[rice paddy]] agriculture, which originated in the region thousands of years ago. Dance is also a very important feature of the culture, utilizing movements of the hands and feet perfected over thousands of years. Furthermore, the [[arts]] and [[literature]] of [[Southeast Asia]] is very distinctive as some have been influenced by [[demographics of India|Indian]], [[Hindu]], [[Chinese literature|Chinese]], [[Islamic literature|Islamic]] and [[Buddhist]] literature.\n\n==West Asia==\n{{main|Ethnic groups in West Asia}}\n[[File:Yemenite_Elder_Blowing_Shofat,_February_1,_1949.jpg|thumb|A Jewish man blows a [[shofar]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus 19th cent costumes.png|thumb|Traditional costumes of (from right to left) a Christian resident of [[Famagusta]], a Christian woman of Famagusta, and an Orthodox monk of the Monastery of Tchiko, near [[Lefka]].

has its origins in the two primary prehistoric settlement centres - greater [[Southwest Asia]] and from the [[Mongolian plateau]] towards [[Northern China]].\n\nMigrations of distinct [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups have probably occurred as early as 10,000 years ago. However, about 2.000 BCE early [[Iranian peoples|Iranian speaking people]] and [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] have arrived in Iran and northern [[Indian subcontinent]]. Pressed by the [[Mongols]], [[Turkic peoples]] oftenly migrated to the western and northern regions of the [[Central Asian]] plains. Prehistoric migrants from [[South China]] and [[Southeast Asia]] seem to have populated [[East Asia]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] in several waves, where they gradually replaced indigenous people, such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], who are of uncertain origin.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Asia/Ethnic-groups | title= Ethnic groups Prehistoric centres and ancient migrations  |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Britannica | accessdate=23 September 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/jhg200786.pdf?origin=ppub | title= Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis  |author=Takehiro Sato, Tetsuya Amano, Hiroko Ono, Hajime Ishida, Haruto Kodera, Hirofumi Matsumura, Minoru Yoneda, Ryuichi Masuda |journal= Nature | accessdate=23 September 2018 }}</ref> [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] people establish in Southeast Asia between 5.000 and 2.000 BCE, partly merging with, but eventually  displacing the indigenous [[Australoid race|Australo-Melanesians]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sidwell |first1=Paul |last2=Blench |first2=Roger |chapterurl=http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf |chapter=The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis |editor-last=Enfield |editor-first=N.J. |title=Dynamics of Human Diversity |pages=317\u2013345 |place=Canberra |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |date=2011 |isbn=9780858836389 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/uol-nrf052308.php |title=New research forces U-turn in population migration theory |newspaper=eurekalert |date=  |author= |accessdate=23 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/Blench%20Springer%20Handbook%20chapter%20final%20Dec%202014.pdf |title=Origins of Ethnolinguistic Identity in Southeast Asia  |publisher=Roger Blench |date=  |author= |accessdate=23 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://khmerstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4.-Ethnic-Minorities-and-Indigenous-Peoples-in-Southeast-Clarke.pdf?lbisphpreq=1  |title=From ethnocide to ethnodevelopment?

The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests, while on the coasts of [[Asia]], resident ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. The types of diversity in Asia are cultural, religious, economic and historical.\n\n[[File:Pamir ethnological map-fr.svg|thumb|Ethnological map of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]]]]\n\nSome groups are primarily [[hunter-gatherer]]s, whereas others practice [[transhumance]] (nomadic lifestyle), have been [[Agriculture|agrarian]] for millennia, or have adopted an industrial or urban lifestyle. Some groups or countries in Asia are completely urban (e.g., [[Qatar]] and [[Singapore]]); the largest countries in Asia with regard to population are the [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Japan]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], [[Iran]],  [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], and [[South Korea]]. [[Western imperialism in Asia|Colonisation]] of Asian ethnic groups and states by [[European peoples]] began in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (except in the former [[Soviet Union]], which was dissolved in 1991).\n\n==Central Asia==\n{{main article|Ethnic groups in Central Asia}}\n\n[[Central Asia]], in its most common definition, is deemed to consist of five former [[Soviet Socialist Republics]]: [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]].  In a wider view, [[Xinjiang]] of western [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Afghanistan]], and northern [[Pakistan]] are included. [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]], and [[Mongol]]ic peoples comprise its general ethnicities.\n\nThe main religions of Central Asia are [[Islam]] (Turkic/Indo-Iranian peoples) and [[Buddhism]] (Mongolia). Central Asia has a long, rich history mainly based on its geographical location along the ancient [[Silk Road]]. It has been conquered by [[Mongols]], [[Tibetans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Tatars]], [[Russians]], [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] and [[Sarmatians]], and thus has a very distinct, vibrant culture. The culture is influenced by [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[India]]n, Persian, Afghan, [[Arabian]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Sarmatian]] and [[Mongols|Mongolian]] cultures.\n\nThe [[Central Asian music|music of Central Asia]] is rich and varied and is appreciated worldwide. Meanwhile, [[List of Asian cuisines#Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian cuisine]] is one of the most prominent cuisines of [[Asia]], with cuisines from [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Azerbaijan]] showing significant influence from the foods of Central Asia. One of the most famous Central Asian foods is [[kebab]].\n\nThe literature of Central Asia is linked with [[Persian literature]] as historically it has been part of the [[Greater Iran|Persian Empire]] for a lot of its history. Furthermore, sitting at the junction of the Silk Road, it has numerous [[China|Chinese]], [[India]]n and [[Arabian]] literary works.\n\n==East Asia==\n{{Main|East Asians}}\n[[File:East Asia map of

North Asia is geographically the northern extremity of [[East Asia]] and the physical characteristics of its native inhabitants generally resemble that of East Asians, however, this is principally divided along political lines under separate national identities, particularly that of China, Mongolia and Russia. The main ethnic groups of the region speak languages of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language families, along with [[East Slavs]] and various \"[[Paleosiberian languages|Paleo-Siberian]]\" peoples, with most of these ethnic groups being composed of nomads or people with a nomadic history.\n\nThe geographic region of [[Siberia]] was the historical land of the Turkic people, the [[Tatars]], in the [[Siberia Khanate]]{{Dubious|date=October 2009}}. [[Russia]], under [[Russian expansion|expansion of its territory]] however, took control of the region now known as Siberia, and thus today it is [[Russian conquest of Siberia|under Russian rule]]. There are roughly 33 million people in North Asia.\n\n==South Asia==\n{{main|Ethnic groups of South Asia}}\n[[Image:South Asian Language Families.jpg|thumb|Language families in South Asia]]\n[[Image:Jaipurgarments.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[Rajasthan]]i garments from [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]]]]\n[[South Asia]], in general definition, consists of the countries of [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The five [[South India|Southern Indian]] states and north-eastern Sri Lanka share a [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] culture, due to the prominence of [[Dravidian languages]] there. The [[Brahui people|Brahuis]] of [[Pakistan]]\nalso belong to [[Dravidian people]] group. [[Sri Lanka]] has two main languages, Sinhalese which has Indo-Aryan roots and Tamil which has Dravidian roots. [[Bangladesh]] and the [[India]]n province [[West Bengal]] share a common [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Bengali language|language]] and culture. The provinces of [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] of [[Pakistan]] share a common [[Dard people|Dardic]] and Tibetic heritage with the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. Similarly the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of Pakistan and [[India]]n state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] share a common Punjabi [[Punjabis|ethnicity]], [[Punjabi language|language]] and culture. In Pakistan, the two western regions of [[Baluchistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] share a greater [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] heritage and while the provinces of [[Sindh]] share a more [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] culture. [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] is most prevalent in [[Afghanistan]], with significant [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speakers.\n\nRegions of [[Nepal]] and parts of the Indian states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]] ([[Ladakh]]), [[Sikkim]] and [[Uttarakhand]] have cultural similarity to [[Tibet]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]] being the dominant religion there. Finally the [[Northeast India]]n states of [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and tribal groups of [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]] have cultural affinities with [[South East Asia]].\n\nBhutanese are often referred to in their literature as \"Bhote\" (people of Bhutia/Bhotia or Tibet). They follow Tibetan Buddhism to and it is a dominant political and cultural element in modern [[Bhutan]]. Their language, [[Dzongkha]], is the national language and is descended from Old [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]].\n\n[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], religions founded in the region that is today's India, are spread throughout the [[subcontinent]]. [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] also have significant region-specific histories. While India and Nepal have a majority of people following Hinduism, [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Bhutan]] have a majority of Buddhists alongside Hinduism. [[Islam]] is the second largest religion after Hinduism with Muslim countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n[[Indo-Aryan languages]] are spoken in most of [[North India|North]], [[East India|East]], [[West India|West]] and [[Central India|Central]] [[India]]; [[Nepal]]; [[Bangladesh]]; [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Dravidian languages]] are spoken in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Maldives]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] are spoken in the hills of [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Baltistan|North Pakistan]], [[North India|North]] and [[North East India]]. [[Austroasiatic languages]] are spoken in certain northern and eastern areas of [[Bangladesh]], parts of [[Nepal]] and scattered across different zones of [[India]] mostly concentrated around [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] and the state of [[Meghalaya]]. [[Iranian languages]] are most prevalent in [[Afghanistan]] and western [[Pakistan]]. [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speakers are significant in [[Afghanistan]] and parts of [[Pakistan]] as well.\n\n==Southeast Asia==\n{{main|Ethnic groups of Southeast Asia}}\n[[Southeast Asia]] is often split into two parts: [[Mainland Southeast Asia]], comprising [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]; and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], which includes [[Brunei]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]], [[East Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]]. [[China]] has historically influenced the region more than [[India]], most notably through the large [[Overseas_Chinese|Chinese populations]] in many of the countries of the region. \n \nDemographically, Southeast Asia has had little Western immigration, although [[Western cultural|Western]] influence still exists due to the lasting legacy of [[colonialism]]. One example is the Philippines, which has been heavily influenced by [[Spain]] and the [[United States of America]] over the course of almost four centuries of colonisation. \n\nA common feature found around the region is [[stilt house]]s, while another is [[rice paddy]] agriculture, which originated in the region thousands of years ago. Dance is also a very important feature of the culture, utilizing movements of the hands and feet perfected over thousands of years. Furthermore, the [[arts]] and [[literature]] of [[Southeast Asia]] is very distinctive as some have been influenced by [[demographics of India|Indian]], [[Hindu]], [[Chinese literature|Chinese]], [[Islamic literature|Islamic]] and [[Buddhist]] literature.\n\n==West Asia==\n{{main|Ethnic groups in West Asia}}\n[[File:Yemenite_Elder_Blowing_Shofat,_February_1,_1949.jpg|thumb|A Jewish man blows a [[shofar]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus 19th cent costumes.png|thumb|Traditional costumes of (from right to left) a Christian resident of [[Famagusta]], a Christian woman of Famagusta, and an Orthodox monk of the Monastery of Tchiko, near [[Lefka]].

West Asia consists of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Cyprus]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], most of [[Turkey]] and [[Egypt]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemen]].\n\nCulturally, the region's dominant ethnic groups are [[Arab]] (about 150 million), Turkic (about 60 million), [[Persian people|Persian]] (about 50 million) and [[Kurds]] (about 35 million). Other indigenous minorities include [[Greek people|Greeks]] (600 thousand), [[Jews]] (6.2 million), [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (about 400,000), [[Armenians]] (about 4.5 million), [[Azerbaijanis|Azeris]] (about 20 million), [[Mandaeans]], [[Yazidis]], [[Circassians]], and others. Many of the [[West Asian]] countries contain expansive [[desert]]s, and thus many nomadic groups exist today, most notably the [[Bedouin]] Arabs.\n\n==Non-indigenous minorities==\n{{unreliable sources|date=February 2020}}\n{{original research|date=February 2020}}\n===Europeans, Russians, North Americans and South Americans===\nAt least 21 million of European, Russian, North American and South American heritage live in Asia, representing 0.45% of the total population of Asia.

Similarly to ''[[Ex Tempore]]'', the literary magazine of the [[United Nations Society of Writers]], the ''UN Special'' magazine functions on a [[Volunteering|voluntary]] basis, representing the joint efforts of staff of the United Nations, the World Health Organisations, and other [[List of international organizations based in Geneva|international organizations and agencies based in Geneva]]international organizations and agencies based in Geneva (Switzerland), who collaborate in the magazine in their free time, beyond their formal duties. It is a non-profit, non-commercial magazine. Although the magazine is not a professional media and is not accredited in the Swiss Club de la Presse, it closely cooperated with the [[Club suisse de la presse]] (Swiss Press Club)<ref>[http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/archives_manifs_2009_csp.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001913/http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/archives_manifs_2009_csp.html |date=July 7, 2011 }}</ref> and was recognized by the official media as an outstanding collective voluntary example of non-professional journalism.<ref>''Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve'',octobre 2009</ref><ref name=\"unog.ch\">https://www.unog.ch/80256EE600583A0B/(httpPages)/ECE0B4E8A7D6F853C12576400049E475?OpenDocument&year=2009</ref> On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the United Nations, ''UN Special'' magazine was nominated for a UN Secretary-General Awards,<ref>The UN Secretary-General Awards honour individual staff members or teams who promote innovation, efficiency and excellence in the way the Organization delivers its programmes and services.</ref> and selected as finalist in the category: Staff Volunteerism.<ref>The caterogy Staff Volunteerism includes individual staff members or teams who promoted Organizational values through the commitment of personal time and/or expertise to a deserving cause outside one's job description.</ref>\n\nIts first issue appeared in October 1949. Since then, for almost 66 years it has published 11 issues per year, on average 50 pages, and embodied both the United Nations\u2019 cooperation between people of all backgrounds and its capacity to adjust to changing circumstances. The magazine has not lost sight of its overall objective: being for and about the United Nations and its international civil servants.\n\nA key contribution of a magazine such as ''UN Special'' is that it opens windows to [[international organization]]s, diplomatic missions, academia and various other entities in order to promote mutual understanding and foster synergy in the work covered by their respective mandates. Thus, ''UN Special'' offers dialogue and reflection to renew a spirit of cooperation and [[humanitarianism]], not only for international Geneva, but also worldwide.\n\n== History==\n[[File:CoverN124Oct1949.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Cover of the first issue of the ''UN Special'', 1949.]]\nThe first issue of ''UN Special'' was published on 24 October 1949. It was handwritten and the cover was signed by the members of the Editorial Committee at that time. Among the articles, essays and UN announcements in this very first issue under the Chief Editor R.J Spencer, we find a welcoming address by Wladimir Moderow, the representative of the Secretary-General, the Director-General of the European Office of the United Nations (this was the name of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]], UNOG in 1949) and by [[Gunnar Myrdal]], Executive Secretary of the United Nations [[Economic Commission for Europe]], [[UNECE]]. Another interesting contribution was dedicated to the celebration of the [[United Nations Day]], announcing public reading of the Preamble of the [[UN Charter]]. This first issue contained 22 black and white pages without defined columns and without photos.\n\nOver the years, the ''UN Special'' has developed to become a professional 50 page-magazine with an average of 32 articles, mainly in English and French (the six [[official UN languages]] are English, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese). \nEarlier, the content of the magazine tended to focus on UN staff issues, however, with its development and increase in outreach,  the magazine covers a broad range of topics related to the work of international organizations and governance, such as [[peace-keeping]], [[poverty reduction]], [[human rights]], [[climate change mitigation]], [[environmental protection]], natural disaster management and the status of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). The recent global discussions on greening the economy and enhancing [[sustainable development]] are reflected in the magazine due to the engagement within these topics of those contributing to the ''UN Special''. Cultural and environmental [[world heritage sites]] (listed by [[UNESCO]]), find their coverage in the magazine as well.\n\nIn October 2009, the exhibition \u201cUN Special magazine: History over 60 years\u201d was inaugurated in the [[Palais des Nations]] in Geneva. The exhibition traced the development of ''UN Special'' from the very first magazine in 1949, highlights key moments in the history of the United Nations, as experienced and told by staff.

The Memorial was inaugurated at the grounds of the Palais des Nations, in the Ariana Park, in 2003.  \nToday, this [[Memorial in Ariana Park]] symbolizes all [[UN peacekeepers]] and a celebration of the [[International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers]] takes place at the grounds of this Memorial to remember those who served in the UN [[peacekeeping operations]] and to honor the memory of those who died in the name of peace. Each year, at the end of May,  UN staff and the Soldier for Peace International Association come to this Memorial to pay tribute to the women and men who serve, or have served, in United Nations peace missions across the globe, to salute their courage and commitment, their dedication and determination to serve fellow human beings in dangerous and difficult circumstances. \nSpecial ceremony is conducted near this Memorial in Ariana Park to honour more than 2,500 civilian and military personnel who have died in the line of duty since 1948. Near this Memorial UN colleagues vow to remember them, and pledge to carry on their efforts, to honour their memory and to ensure that their sacrifice will serve the cause of peace and stability in the world.\n\n=== \"Rice is life\" ===\n\"Rice is life\" was selected as the slogan for the [[International Year of Rice]] 2004. The slogan illustrated the significance of rice across the globe, and its importance to nutrition, livelihood, culture, and the natural environment. On the occasion of the International Year of Rice decided by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the ''UN Special'' magazine together with the United Nations family, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) prepared an international cookbook, ''Rice Around the World''. From Santiago to Bangkok, from Beijing to The Cape, from Tashkent to Cairo, rice nourishes more than 3 billion people throughout the world. In each of these cities, in each of these countries, from the richest to the poorest, each one has its own way of accommodating rice, or rices as there are so many types. The book was prepared by the international civil servants as well as goodwill people from all over the world. The so-called \"Rice Team\" from the ''UN Special'' Editorial Board collected, compiled and put such a book together offering to its readers to go around the world with 300 recipes from over 100 countries.  The benefits were donated to the [[UNICEF]] to help fighting against hunger.\n\n== Featured interviews==\n* [[Ban Ki-moon]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721044058/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS705/t21.html>\n* [[Kofi Annan]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042932/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS600/UNS_600_T07.html>\n* [[Navi Pillay]], [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN High Commissionner for Human Rights]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110228081731/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS679/t23.html>\n* [[Sergei Ordzhonikidze]], Director-General of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110504002244/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS683/t21.html>\n* [[Jimmy Wales]], The founder of [[Wikimedia Foundation]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043102/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS694/t21.html>\n* [[Jacques Rogge]], President of the [[International Olympic Committee]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20100831024525/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS696/t21.html>\n* [[Sashi Tharoor]], former Deputy General-Secretary of the United Nations <https://web.archive.org/web/20110228080724/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS667/t3A.html>\n* Dr. [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110308014403/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS684/t21.html>\n* Gordon Martin, OBE, Honorable member of the Swiss Press Club ([[Club suisse de la presse]]) <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043444/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS666/t21.html>\n* [[Abdou Diouf]], [[La Francophonie]] International Organisation Secretary-General <https://web.archive.org/web/20110228080540/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS667/t21.html>\n* [[Anders B.

Similarly to ''[[Ex Tempore]]'', the literary magazine of the [[United Nations Society of Writers]], the ''UN Special'' magazine functions on a [[Volunteering|voluntary]] basis, representing the joint efforts of staff of the United Nations, the World Health Organisations, and other [[List of international organizations based in Geneva|international organizations and agencies based in Geneva]]international organizations and agencies based in Geneva (Switzerland), who collaborate in the magazine in their free time, beyond their formal duties. It is a non-profit, non-commercial magazine. Although the magazine is not a professional media and is not accredited in the Swiss Club de la Presse, it closely cooperated with the [[Club suisse de la presse]] (Swiss Press Club)<ref>[http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/archives_manifs_2009_csp.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001913/http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/archives_manifs_2009_csp.html |date=July 7, 2011 }}</ref> and was recognized by the official media as an outstanding collective voluntary example of non-professional journalism.<ref>''Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve'',octobre 2009</ref><ref name=\"unog.ch\">https://www.unog.ch/80256EE600583A0B/(httpPages)/ECE0B4E8A7D6F853C12576400049E475?OpenDocument&year=2009</ref> On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the United Nations, ''UN Special'' magazine was nominated for a UN Secretary-General Awards,<ref>The UN Secretary-General Awards honour individual staff members or teams who promote innovation, efficiency and excellence in the way the Organization delivers its programmes and services.</ref> and selected as finalist in the category: Staff Volunteerism.<ref>The caterogy Staff Volunteerism includes individual staff members or teams who promoted Organizational values through the commitment of personal time and/or expertise to a deserving cause outside one's job description.</ref>\n\nIts first issue appeared in October 1949. Since then, for almost 66 years it has published 11 issues per year, on average 50 pages, and embodied both the United Nations\u2019 cooperation between people of all backgrounds and its capacity to adjust to changing circumstances. The magazine has not lost sight of its overall objective: being for and about the United Nations and its international civil servants.\n\nA key contribution of a magazine such as ''UN Special'' is that it opens windows to [[international organization]]s, diplomatic missions, academia and various other entities in order to promote mutual understanding and foster synergy in the work covered by their respective mandates. Thus, ''UN Special'' offers dialogue and reflection to renew a spirit of cooperation and [[humanitarianism]], not only for international Geneva, but also worldwide.\n\n== History==\n[[File:CoverN124Oct1949.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Cover of the first issue of the ''UN Special'', 1949.]]\nThe first issue of ''UN Special'' was published on 24 October 1949. It was handwritten and the cover was signed by the members of the Editorial Committee at that time. Among the articles, essays and UN announcements in this very first issue under the Chief Editor R.J Spencer, we find a welcoming address by Wladimir Moderow, the representative of the Secretary-General, the Director-General of the European Office of the United Nations (this was the name of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]], UNOG in 1949) and by [[Gunnar Myrdal]], Executive Secretary of the United Nations [[Economic Commission for Europe]], [[UNECE]]. Another interesting contribution was dedicated to the celebration of the [[United Nations Day]], announcing public reading of the Preamble of the [[UN Charter]]. This first issue contained 22 black and white pages without defined columns and without photos.\n\nOver the years, the ''UN Special'' has developed to become a professional 50 page-magazine with an average of 32 articles, mainly in English and French (the six [[official UN languages]] are English, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese). \nEarlier, the content of the magazine tended to focus on UN staff issues, however, with its development and increase in outreach,  the magazine covers a broad range of topics related to the work of international organizations and governance, such as [[peace-keeping]], [[poverty reduction]], [[human rights]], [[climate change mitigation]], [[environmental protection]], natural disaster management and the status of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). The recent global discussions on greening the economy and enhancing [[sustainable development]] are reflected in the magazine due to the engagement within these topics of those contributing to the ''UN Special''. Cultural and environmental [[world heritage sites]] (listed by [[UNESCO]]), find their coverage in the magazine as well.\n\nIn October 2009, the exhibition \u201cUN Special magazine: History over 60 years\u201d was inaugurated in the [[Palais des Nations]] in Geneva. The exhibition traced the development of ''UN Special'' from the very first magazine in 1949, highlights key moments in the history of the United Nations, as experienced and told by staff.  The exhibition was visited by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unspecial.org/60thAnniversary/gallerySG.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043805/http://www.unspecial.org/60thAnniversary/gallerySG.html |archive-date=2011-07-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Director-General of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] [[Sergei Ordzhonikidze]] in his opening remarks to mark the 60th anniversary of the ''UN Special'' magazine noted: \"I believe that UN Special embodies both the United Nations\u2019 unique ability to facilitate cooperation between people of all backgrounds and its capacity to adjust to ever-changing circumstances \u2013 without losing sight of the overall objectives\".<ref>http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/dg.nsf/(httpSpeechesByYear_en)/ECE0B4E8A7D6F853C12576400049E475?OpenDocument&year=2009&navunid=DA1302D9298CEF1E80256EF700760B0B</ref>\n\nIn summer of 2015, the ''UN Special'' Staff Magazine submitted the nomination for the United Nations Secretary-General Awards (UNSG Awards) that honour individual staff members or teams who promote innovation, efficiency and excellence in the way the Organization delivers its programmes and services.

Each year, at the end of May,  UN staff and the Soldier for Peace International Association come to this Memorial to pay tribute to the women and men who serve, or have served, in United Nations peace missions across the globe, to salute their courage and commitment, their dedication and determination to serve fellow human beings in dangerous and difficult circumstances. \nSpecial ceremony is conducted near this Memorial in Ariana Park to honour more than 2,500 civilian and military personnel who have died in the line of duty since 1948. Near this Memorial UN colleagues vow to remember them, and pledge to carry on their efforts, to honour their memory and to ensure that their sacrifice will serve the cause of peace and stability in the world.\n\n=== \"Rice is life\" ===\n\"Rice is life\" was selected as the slogan for the [[International Year of Rice]] 2004. The slogan illustrated the significance of rice across the globe, and its importance to nutrition, livelihood, culture, and the natural environment. On the occasion of the International Year of Rice decided by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the ''UN Special'' magazine together with the United Nations family, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) prepared an international cookbook, ''Rice Around the World''. From Santiago to Bangkok, from Beijing to The Cape, from Tashkent to Cairo, rice nourishes more than 3 billion people throughout the world. In each of these cities, in each of these countries, from the richest to the poorest, each one has its own way of accommodating rice, or rices as there are so many types. The book was prepared by the international civil servants as well as goodwill people from all over the world. The so-called \"Rice Team\" from the ''UN Special'' Editorial Board collected, compiled and put such a book together offering to its readers to go around the world with 300 recipes from over 100 countries.  The benefits were donated to the [[UNICEF]] to help fighting against hunger.\n\n== Featured interviews==\n* [[Ban Ki-moon]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721044058/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS705/t21.html>\n* [[Kofi Annan]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042932/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS600/UNS_600_T07.html>\n* [[Navi Pillay]], [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN High Commissionner for Human Rights]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110228081731/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS679/t23.html>\n* [[Sergei Ordzhonikidze]], Director-General of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110504002244/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS683/t21.html>\n* [[Jimmy Wales]], The founder of [[Wikimedia Foundation]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043102/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS694/t21.html>\n* [[Jacques Rogge]], President of the [[International Olympic Committee]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20100831024525/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS696/t21.html>\n* [[Sashi Tharoor]], former Deputy General-Secretary of the United Nations <https://web.archive.org/web/20110228080724/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS667/t3A.html>\n* Dr. [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]] <https://web.archive.org/web/20110308014403/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS684/t21.html>\n* Gordon Martin, OBE, Honorable member of the Swiss Press Club ([[Club suisse de la presse]]) <https://web.archive.org/web/20110721043444/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS666/t21.html>\n* [[Abdou Diouf]], [[La Francophonie]] International Organisation Secretary-General <https://web.archive.org/web/20110228080540/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS667/t21.html>\n* [[Anders B.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from Sibiu. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics.  von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in Bucharest, representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of Adolf Hitler. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first Gauleiter of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiuthe \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the Wehrmacht had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to Karl Schworm on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat. Together they had two children, Karlheinz and Erich\n\n==Involvement in Nazism==\nAt the beginning of 1931, he returned to public life, becoming the chief editor of the German-language Jimbolia newspaper, [[\"Hatzfelder Zeitung\"]], and president of the local ethnic community. M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M\u00f6ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \"Gauleiter\" for the Banat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">= Aspects</ref>\n\nAfter Karl von M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in Timi\u0219oara. It was an imitation of the publication [[Der St\u00fcrmer]] published in Germany by the German Nazi [[Julius Streicher]] who, after World War II, was sentenced to death in the first of the [[Nuremberg trials]], found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]] and executed by [[hanging]] in 1946.<ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, Divers, 2003 [http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034205/http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, in: Cultural Observatory, Nr. 197 \u2013 December 2, 2003, [http://www.observatorcultural.com/Germanii-din-Romania-intre-nazism-si-stalinism*articleID_9752-articles_details.html] and Errata.

At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat. Together they had two children, Karlheinz and Erich\n\n==Involvement in Nazism==\nAt the beginning of 1931, he returned to public life, becoming the chief editor of the German-language Jimbolia newspaper, [[\"Hatzfelder Zeitung\"]], and president of the local ethnic community. M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M\u00f6ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \"Gauleiter\" for the Banat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">= Aspects</ref>\n\nAfter Karl von M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in Timi\u0219oara.

In contrast to the presumption by officials that religious organizations benefit humanity without evidence (for instance [[Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption]]), he points to a letter he received from the British Charity Commission requesting evidence for the claim that the advancement of science is connected to the public good.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=2009 |publisher=[[Bantam Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-593-06173-2 |oclc= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nTheist author Marion Ledwig suggests that the foundation may have been set up as an atheist counterpart to the [[John Templeton Foundation]],<ref>{{cite book |title=God's Rational Warriors |year=2008 |first=Marion |last=Ledwig |publisher=Ontos-Verlag |isbn=978-3-938793-87-9 |page=76}}</ref> an organization which Dawkins has publicly criticized, especially in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', for corrupting science.

In contrast to the presumption by officials that religious organizations benefit humanity without evidence (for instance [[Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption]]), he points to a letter he received from the British Charity Commission requesting evidence for the claim that the advancement of science is connected to the public good.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=2009 |publisher=[[Bantam Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-593-06173-2 |oclc= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nTheist author Marion Ledwig suggests that the foundation may have been set up as an atheist counterpart to the [[John Templeton Foundation]],<ref>{{cite book |title=God's Rational Warriors |year=2008 |first=Marion |last=Ledwig |publisher=Ontos-Verlag |isbn=978-3-938793-87-9 |page=76}}</ref> an organization which Dawkins has publicly criticized, especially in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', for corrupting science.

My foundation promotes respect for people who hold critical thinking as a cherished personal value and use it in day-to-day life.

Lack of saliva compromises the composition and beneficial properties necessary for maintaining the health of the oral cavity and reduces antibacterial actions, which leads to disruption of the oral pH; consequently allowing cariogenic microorganisms to grow and colonize the oral cavity.<ref name=\"nehme\">Nehme, M., Malpass, K., Butler, A., Mason, S., Kleber, C., Milleman, K., et al. \u201cA Randomized, Crossover Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Two Mouthrinses on Plaque Regrowth in the Absence of Brushing\u201d.

Various commercially available mouthrinses have been tested on their inhibitory effects on biofilm formation over a 24h period.<ref name=\"taiji2017\"/> By slowing the formation of biofilm formation, individuals who use Biot\u00e8ne may reduce the risk of dental caries and other oral diseases that may occur from xerostomia and bacterial accumulation, thus aiding in improving oral and overall health for the long term. However, not all studies support the claim that Biot\u00e8ne makes. For instance, Peridex mouthrinse, an antimicrobial chlorhexidine-based formulation, demonstrated significantly greater prevention of plaque regrowth when compared with water and the enzyme-based Biot\u00e8ne mouthrinse.<ref name=\"nehme\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Warde, P., Kroll, B., O'Sullivan, B. et al. \"A phase II study of Biot\u00e8ne in the treatment of postradiation xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer\u201d.
