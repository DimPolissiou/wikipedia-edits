(football)|Galatasaray]]. On the more positive side, Leeds attained their highest finish since the 1992 title triumph, and achieved [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] qualification in manager [[David O'Leary]]'s second season at the helm. Promising young players like [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1980)|Alan Smith]], [[Jonathan Woodgate]] and [[Michael Bridges]] gave Leeds fans hope that their side would be among [[2000-01 in English football|next season's]] contenders for the Premiership, as well as making another strong challenge on the continent.

Sequential closure commutes with union:\n\n:<math>[A\\cup B]_{\\text{seq}} = \n[A]_{\\text{seq}} \\cup [B]_{\\text{seq}}</math>\n\nfor all <math>A, B \\subseteq X</math>.  However, unlike ordinary closure, the sequential closure operator is not in general [[idempotent]]; that is, one may have that\n\n:<math>[A]_{\\text{seq}} \\subsetneq \\Big[[A]_{\\text{seq}}\\Big]_{\\text{seq}},</math>\n\nand consequently <math>[A]_{\\text{seq}} \\neq \\overline{A}</math>, even when <math>A</math> is a subset of a sequential space <math>X</math>.\n\nThe '''transfinite sequential closure''' is defined as follows: define <math>A_0</math> to be <math>A</math>, define <math>A_{\\alpha + 1}</math> to be <math>[A_{\\alpha}]_{\\text{seq}}</math>, and for a [[limit ordinal]] <math>\\alpha</math>, define <math>A_{\\alpha}</math> to be <math>\\bigcup_{\\beta < \\alpha} A_{\\beta}</math>. Then there is a smallest [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] <math>\\alpha</math> such that <math>A_{\\alpha} = A_{\\alpha + 1}</math>, and for this <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>A_{\\alpha}</math> is called the transfinite sequential closure of <math>A</math>.

P. Franklin (aka [[Stan Franklin]]) in 1965, who was investigating the question of \"what are the classes of topological spaces that can be specified completely by the knowledge of their convergent sequences?\" Franklin arrived at the definition above by noting that every [[first-countable space]] can be specified completely by the knowledge of its convergent sequences, and then he abstracted properties of first countable spaces that allowed this to be true.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nEvery [[first-countable space]] is sequential, hence each [[second-countable space]], [[metric space]], and [[discrete space]] is sequential. Further examples are furnished by applying the [[Category theory|categorical]] properties listed below. For example, every [[CW-complex]] is sequential, as it can be considered as a quotient of a metric space.\n\nThere are sequential spaces that are not first countable. (One example is to take the real line '''R''' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identify]] the set '''Z''' of integers to a point.)\n\nAn example of a space that is ''not'' sequential is the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set. Every convergent sequence in such a space is eventually constant, hence every set is sequentially open. But the cocountable topology is not [[discrete space|discrete]]. In fact, one could say that the cocountable topology on an uncountable set is \"sequentially discrete\".\n\n== Equivalent conditions ==\n\nMany conditions have been shown{{cn|date=June 2015}} to be equivalent to X being sequential. Here are a few:\n\n*''X'' is the quotient of a first countable space.\n*''X'' is the quotient of a metric space.\n*For every topological space ''Y'' and every map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'', we have that ''f'' is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] if and only if for every sequence of points (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' converging to ''x'', we have (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converging to ''f''(''x'').\n\nThe final equivalent condition shows that the class of sequential spaces consists precisely of those spaces whose topological structure is determined by convergent sequences in the space.\n\n== Categorical properties ==\n\nThe [[full subcategory]] '''Seq''' of all sequential spaces is closed under the following operations in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] '''Top''' of topological spaces:\n\n* Quotients\n* Continuous closed or open [[Image (mathematics)|images]]\n* Sums\n* [[Limit (category theory)|Inductive limits]]\n* Open and closed [[Subspace topology|subspaces]]\n\nThe category '''Seq''' is ''not'' closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Continuous images\n* Subspaces\n* Finite [[Product (category theory)|products]]\n\nSince they are closed under topological sums and quotients, the sequential spaces form a [[coreflective subcategory]] of the [[category of topological spaces]]. In fact, they are the coreflective hull of [[metrizable space]]s (i.e., the smallest class of topological spaces closed under sums and quotients and containing the metrizable spaces).\n\nThe subcategory '''Seq''' is a [[Cartesian closed category]] with respect to its own product (not that of '''Top'''). The [[exponential object]]s are equipped with the (convergent sequence)-open topology. P.I. Booth and A. Tillotson have shown that '''Seq''' is the smallest Cartesian closed subcategory of '''Top''' containing the underlying topological spaces of all [[metric space]]s, [[CW-complex]]es, and [[differentiable manifold]]s and that is closed under colimits, quotients, and other \"certain reasonable identities\" that [[Norman Steenrod]] described as \"convenient\".\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Axioms of countability]]\n*[[First-countable space]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Arkhangel'skii, A.V. and Pontryagin, L.S., ''General Topology I'', Springer-Verlag, New York (1990) {{isbn|3-540-18178-4}}.\n*Booth, P.I. and Tillotson, A., ''[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102779712 Monoidal closed, cartesian closed and convenient categories of topological spaces]'' Pacific J.

P. Franklin (aka [[Stan Franklin]]) in 1965, who was investigating the question of \"what are the classes of topological spaces that can be specified completely by the knowledge of their convergent sequences?\" Franklin arrived at the definition above by noting that every [[first-countable space]] can be specified completely by the knowledge of its convergent sequences, and then he abstracted properties of first countable spaces that allowed this to be true.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nEvery [[first-countable space]] is sequential, hence each [[second-countable space]], [[metric space]], and [[discrete space]] is sequential. Further examples are furnished by applying the categorical properties listed below. For example, every [[CW-complex]] is sequential, as it can be considered as a quotient of a metric space.\n\nThere are sequential spaces that are not first countable. (One example is to take the real line '''R''' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identify]] the set '''Z''' of integers to a point.)\n\nAn example of a space that is ''not'' sequential is the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set. Every convergent sequence in such a space is eventually constant, hence every set is sequentially open. But the cocountable topology is not [[discrete space|discrete]]. In fact, one could say that the cocountable topology on an uncountable set is \"sequentially discrete\".\n\n== Equivalent conditions ==\n\nMany conditions have been shown{{cn|date=June 2015}} to be equivalent to X being sequential. Here are a few:\n\n*''X'' is the quotient of a first countable space.\n*''X'' is the quotient of a metric space.\n*For every topological space ''Y'' and every map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'', we have that ''f'' is [[continuous (topology)|continuous]] if and only if for every sequence of points (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''X'' converging to ''x'', we have (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converging to ''f''(''x'').\n\nThe final equivalent condition shows that the class of sequential spaces consists precisely of those spaces whose topological structure is determined by convergent sequences in the space.\n\n== Categorical properties ==\n\nThe [[full subcategory]] '''Seq''' of all sequential spaces is closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Quotients\n* Continuous closed or open images\n* Sums\n* Inductive limits\n* Open and closed subspaces\n\nThe category '''Seq''' is ''not'' closed under the following operations in '''Top''':\n\n* Continuous images\n* Subspaces\n* Finite products\n\nSince they are closed under topological sums and quotients, the sequential spaces form a [[coreflective subcategory]] of the [[category of topological spaces]]. In fact, they are the coreflective hull of [[metrizable space]]s (i.e., the smallest class of topological spaces closed under sums and quotients and containing the metrizable spaces).\n\nThe subcategory '''Seq''' is a [[Cartesian closed category]] with respect to its own product (not that of '''Top'''). The [[exponential object]]s are equipped with the (convergent sequence)-open topology. P.I. Booth and A. Tillotson have shown that '''Seq''' is the smallest Cartesian closed subcategory of '''Top''' containing the underlying topological spaces of all [[metric space]]s, [[CW-complex]]es, and [[differentiable manifold]]s and that is closed under colimits, quotients, and other \"certain reasonable identities\" that [[Norman Steenrod]] described as \"convenient\".\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Axioms of countability]]\n*[[First-countable space]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Arkhangel'skii, A.V. and Pontryagin, L.S., ''General Topology I'', Springer-Verlag, New York (1990) {{isbn|3-540-18178-4}}.\n*Booth, P.I. and Tillotson, A., ''[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102779712 Monoidal closed, cartesian closed and convenient categories of topological spaces]'' Pacific J.

It pitted the [[Continental Army]], commanded by General [[George Washington]], against the [[British Army]] in North America, commanded by General Sir [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]]. It was the last battle of the [[Philadelphia campaign]], begun the previous year, during which the British had inflicted two major defeats on Washington and occupied Philadelphia. Washington had spent the winter at [[Valley Forge]] rebuilding his army and defending his position against political enemies who favored his replacement as commander-in-chief. In February 1778, the [[Franco-American alliance]] tilted the strategic balance in favor of the Americans, forcing the British to abandon hopes of a military victory and adopt a defensive strategy. Clinton was ordered to evacuate Philadelphia and consolidate his army. The Continental Army shadowed the British as they marched across New Jersey to Sandy Hook, from where the Royal Navy would ferry them to New York. Washington's senior officers urged varying degrees of caution, but it was politically important for him not to allow the British to withdraw unscathed. Washington detached around a third of his army and sent it ahead under the command of [[Major general|Major General]] [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], hoping to land a heavy blow on the British without becoming embroiled in a major engagement. The battle began badly for the Americans when Lee botched an attack on the British rearguard at Monmouth Court House. A counter-attack by the main British column forced Lee to retreat until Washington arrived with the main body. Clinton disengaged when he found Washington in an unassailable defensive position and resumed the march to Sandy Hook.\n\nClinton had divided his army into two divisions for the march from Philadelphia; most of the combat troops were concentrated in the first division, while the second comprised most of the heavy transport of a 1,500-wagon baggage train. The British were harassed by increasingly strong American forces as they traversed New Jersey, and by June 27, Lee's [[vanguard]] was within striking distance. When the British left Monmouth Court House the next day, Lee attempted to isolate and defeat their rearguard. The attack was poorly coordinated, and the Americans were quickly outnumbered when the British first division returned. Some of Lee's units began to withdraw, leading to a breakdown in command and control and forcing Lee to order a general retreat. A fiercely fought rearguard action by the vanguard gave Washington enough time to deploy the main body in a strong defensive position, against which British efforts to press the vanguard foundered. The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel, during which Clinton began to disengage. The duel ended when a Continental brigade established artillery on a hill overlooking the British lines, forcing Clinton to withdraw his guns. Washington launched two small-unit attacks on Clinton's infantry as they withdrew, inflicting heavy casualties on the British during the second. An attempt by Washington to probe the British flanks was halted by sunset, and the two armies settled down within {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} of each other. The British slipped away unnoticed during the night to link up with the baggage train. The rest of the march to Sandy Hook was completed without further incident, and Clinton's army was ferried to New York in early July.\n\nThe battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side landed the blow they hoped to on the other, Washington's army remained an effective force in the field and the British redeployed successfully to New York. The Continental Army inflicted more casualties than it suffered, and it was one of the rare occasions on which it retained possession of a battlefield. It had proven itself to be much improved after the training it underwent over the winter, and the professional conduct of the American troops during the battle was widely noted by the British. Washington was able to present the battle as a triumph, and he was voted a formal thanks by [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] to honor \"the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.\" His position as commander-in-chief became unassailable. He was lauded for the first time as the Father of his Country, and his detractors were silenced. Lee was vilified for his failure to press home the attack on the British rearguard. Because of his tactless efforts to argue his case in the days after the battle, Washington had him arrested and court-martialed on charges of disobeying orders, conducting an \"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat\" and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. Lee made the fatal mistake of turning the proceedings into a contest between himself and Washington. He was found guilty on all counts, although his culpability on the first two charges was debatable.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Philadelphia campaign|Franco-American Alliance}}\n[[File:Washington peale.jpg|thumb|General George Washington|alt=Contemporary painting]]\nIn 1777, some two years into the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British commander-in-chief General Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] launched the [[Philadelphia campaign]] to capture the rebels' capital and persuade them to sue for peace. In the fall of that year, Howe inflicted two significant defeats on General [[George Washington]] and his [[Continental Army]], at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], and occupied Philadelphia, forcing the [[Second Continental Congress]] to hurriedly decamp to [[York, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 130\u2013135, 140</ref><ref>Martin 1993 p. 12</ref> Washington avoided battle for the rest of the year, and in December he withdrew to winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]], despite the desire of Congress that he continue campaigning.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 147\u2013148, 151\u2013152</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 109</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 24</ref> In comparison, his subordinate General [[Horatio Gates]] had won major victories in September and October at the [[Battles of Saratoga]].<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 126\u2013128, 137</ref> Washington was criticized in some quarters within the army and Congress for relying on a [[Fabian strategy]] to wear the British down in a long war of attrition instead of defeating it decisively in a pitched battle.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 141, 148</ref>\n\nIn November, Washington was hearing rumors of a \"Strong Faction\" within Congress that favored replacing him with Gates as commander-in-chief.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 139</ref> The congressional appointments of the known critic General [[Thomas Conway]] as [[History of the Office of The Inspector General of the United States Army|Inspector General of the Army]] and of Gates to the [[Board of War|Board of War and Ordnance]] in December convinced Washington there was a [[Conway Cabal|conspiracy]] to take command of the army from him.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 152\u2013153</ref>{{efn|Despite Washington's fears, his detractors were never part of an organized conspiracy to oust him, and those in Congress who favored his removal as commander-in-chief were in the minority.

Following the [[Franco-American alliance]] of February 1778, French forces were sent to North America to support the revolutionaries. This led to the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)]], which [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Spain]] would join on the French side in 1779. With the rest of Europe moving towards a [[First League of Armed Neutrality|hostile neutrality]], Great Britain would come under further pressure in 1780 when the Dutch allied with France, leading to the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]. Faced with military escalation, increasing diplomatic isolation and limited resources, the British were forced to prioritize the defense of the homeland and more valuable colonial possessions in the Caribbean and India above their North American colonies. They abandoned their efforts to win a decisive military victory, repealed the [[Intolerable Acts]] which had precipitated the rebellion and, in April 1778, sent the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]] in an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement. In Philadelphia, the newly installed commander-in-chief General Sir [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]] was ordered to redeploy 8,000 troops, a third of his army, to the West Indies and Florida, consolidate the rest of his army in New York and adopt a defensive posture.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 12\u201315</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 442</ref><ref name=Ferling175>Ferling 2009 p. 175</ref>\n\n===Continental Army===\n[[File:Sirhenryclinton2.jpg|thumb|left|General Henry Clinton|alt=Contemporary painting]]\nWashington's preference for a professional standing army rather than a militia had been another source of criticism.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 28</ref> He had seen his army dissolve in the fall of 1775 as short-term enlistments expired, and blamed his defeat in the [[Battle of Long Island]] in August 1776 in part on a poorly performing militia.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 118</ref> At his urging, Congress passed legislation between September and December 1776 to create an army in which troops would enlist for the duration. Recruitment failed to raise sufficient numbers, and the harsh discipline implemented by Washington, the long periods away from home and the defeats of 1777 further weakened the army through desertions and frequent officer resignations. Although the army that went into Valley Forge contained the kernel of regimental organization and a core of experienced officers and men, no-one was under any illusion that it was a match for the tactical skill of the British Army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 60\u201364, 66</ref> The situation improved measurably with the arrival in March 1778 of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], to whom Washington gave the responsibility for training the army. With the commander-in-chief's enthusiastic support, Steuben implemented a uniform standard of drill where none had previously existed and worked the army hard, transforming it into a more professional force that might compete on equal terms with the British Army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 65\u201366, 68</ref><ref name=\"Ellis116\u2013117\">Ellis 2004 pp. 116\u2013117</ref>{{efn|Friedrich Wilhelm August Heinrich Ferdinand had turned up as a volunteer at Valley Forge claiming the title of Baron von Steuben, an intimacy with the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king [[Frederick the Great]] and the rank of general in the [[Prussian Army]], none of which was true.

Lee was a former British Army officer who had retired to Virginia before the revolution and had been touted as a potential commander of the army alongside Washington when war broke out. He had been captured in December 1776 following Washington's defeat at [[New York and New Jersey campaign|New York]], and had been released in April in a prisoner exchange. He had been critical of Washington's indecisiveness at New York and insubordinate during the retreat from the city. But Washington had regarded him as his most trusted adviser and the best officer in the Continental Army, and he eagerly welcomed Lee back as his second-in-command.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 84, 105, 175</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 443</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 110, 112, 117</ref> Sixteen months in captivity had not mellowed Lee.

Of the twelve responses, all agreed it was vital that, whatever course was chosen, the army had to perform well if public support for the revolution was to be maintained after the disappointments of the previous year. Most generals supported one or other of the offensive options, but Washington sided with the minority, among them Steuben, who argued the Continental Army still needed improvement at Valley Forge before it was ready to take on the British. After news of the Franco-American alliance arrived and as British activity in and around Philadelphia increased, Washington met with ten of his generals on May 8 to further discuss plans. This time they unanimously favored the defensive option and waiting until the British intentions became clearer.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 76\u201382</ref>\n\nIn May, it became evident that the British were preparing to evacuate Philadelphia, but Washington still had no detailed knowledge of Clinton's intentions and was concerned that the British would slip away overland through New Jersey. The [[2nd New Jersey Regiment]], which had been conducting operations against British foragers and sympathizers in New Jersey since March, was a valuable source of intelligence, and by the end of the month a British evacuation by land looked increasingly likely. Washington reinforced the regiment with the rest of the New Jersey Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General [[William Maxwell (Continental Army general)|William Maxwell]], with orders to obstruct and harry British activities.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 85\u201386, 88\u201390</ref> The Continentals were to co-operate with the experienced [[New Jersey militia]], commanded by Major General [[Philemon Dickinson]], one of the most capable militia commanders of the war and Washington's single best source of intelligence on British activities.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 92\u201394</ref> On May 18, Washington sent the inexperienced, 20-year-old Major General [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] with 2,200 men to establish an observation post at Barren Hill, {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Philadelphia. The Frenchman's first significant independent command almost ended in disaster for him two days later in the [[Battle of Barren Hill]], and only the discipline of his men prevented his entrapment by the British.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 91</ref>\n\n==March from Philadelphia==\n[[File:Monmouth1 plainsvg.svg|thumb|upright=2|Routes taken by the Continental Army from Valley Forge (dark blue) and the British Army from Philadelphia (red) to the Battle of Monmouth. Where the roads allowed, the British first division took the western route while the second division followed a parallel route farther east. The dashed blue line shows Lafayette's attempt to catch the British when he was commander of the vanguard.|alt=map]]\nOn June 15, the British began to withdraw from Philadelphia, crossing the River Delaware into New Jersey. The last troops crossed three days later, and the army consolidated around [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]]. Clinton, who had not yet decided on the exact route to New York approximately {{convert|90|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away, divided his army into two divisions and set out for [[Allentown, New Jersey|Allentown]], some {{convert|40|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} to the northeast. He accompanied the first division, which comprised some 10,000 troops under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Lord Cornwallis]]. The second division, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Wilhelm von Knyphausen]], comprised just over 9,000 personnel, of which over 7,500 were combatants. This division contained the bulk of the slow-moving heavy transport of the 1,500-wagon baggage train.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 97\u201398, 123\u2013124, 126\u2013127</ref>\n\nThe march was conducted in short segments during a heat wave in which temperatures frequently exceeded {{convert|90|F|C|0}}, which further slowed progress and caused casualties from heat exhaustion. The slow progress did not concern Clinton. He was confident his troops were more than a match for Washington's forces and felt that a major battle would compensate for the humiliation of having to abandon Philadelphia and might even deal a serious blow to the rebellion.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 141\u2013143</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 122</ref> Wherever possible, the two divisions followed parallel routes which allowed them to be mutually supporting. Light troops and [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] screened the route ahead of the main force and cleared obstacles, combat units were embedded with the baggage train and [[battalion]]-sized units provided flank guards.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 127, 131\u2013132</ref> The frequent sniping and skirmishing of Maxwell's Continentals and Dickinson's militia, and their attempts to obstruct and hinder the British by blocking roads, destroying bridges and spoiling wells, did not materially impede progress.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 127\u2013141</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 121</ref>\n\nOn June 24, the first division arrived at Allentown while the second reached [[Imlaystown, New Jersey|Imlaystown]], {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} to the east.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 140</ref> Clinton decided to head for [[Sandy Hook]], from where the [[Royal Navy]] could ferry his army to New York. When the march resumed at 04:00 the next day, the road network made it impossible for the two divisions to follow separate routes and still remain within supporting distance of each other. Knyphausen's second division led the {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|sp=us|0}} column on the road towards Monmouth Court House (modern-day [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]]). Cornwallis followed, [[Foot guards|Guards]] and [[Grenadier]]s at the rear, putting his combat-heavy division between the baggage train and the likely direction of attack. At the end of the day, Knyphausen camped at [[Freehold Township, New Jersey|Freehold Township]], some {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Monmouth Court House, while Clinton established his headquarters at Robin's Rising Sun Tavern, {{convert|12|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Knyphausen.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 150\u2013154</ref><ref>Martin 1993 p. 204</ref>\n\nThe next day, June 26, the British suffered almost forty casualties in near-constant skirmishing in which one unit came close to being overrun. Knyphausen reached Monmouth Court House early that morning, and by 10:00 the entire column had concentrated there. It was clear to Clinton that Washington's forces were gathering in numbers, and the British were exhausted after their {{convert|67|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|sp=us|0}} march from Philadelphia. Monmouth Court House offered a good defensive position, and it is possible that Clinton saw an opportunity for the battle he desired. He deployed his army to cover all approaches and decided to rest his troops for the next two nights. The bulk of his force, the first division, was deployed on the Allentown road, covering the second division in the village.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 156\u2013158</ref>\n\nThe revolution had precipitated a vicious civil war in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]] that did credit to neither side and which would continue after the armies had departed.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 47\u201348</ref> It was fought between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]], who sided with the rebellion, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], who remained loyal to Great Britain and even formed units, such as the [[Queen's Rangers|Queen's American Rangers]], which fought alongside the British Army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xviii, 212</ref> The two sides also fought each other in the civil arena, and it is estimated that fifty per cent of Monmouth County families suffered significant harm to person or property during the war.<ref>Adelberg 2010 pp. 32\u201333</ref> By spring 1778, the formerly loyalist Monmouth Court House had come under patriot control.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 211, 213</ref> When the British arrived, they found themselves in an enemy settlement that had been largely deserted by its inhabitants. Clinton's orders against pillaging were ignored by the rank and file and went unenforced by the officers. British and Hessian soldiers acting out of frustration and anger, and Loyalists acting out of rage and vengeance, committed numerous acts of vandalism, looting and arson. By the time Clinton resumed the march on June 28, thirteen of the village's near two dozen buildings had been destroyed, all of them Patriot owned.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 201, 214\u2013216</ref>\n\n===Pursuit===\nWashington learned the British were evacuating Philadelphia on June 17. He immediately convened a war council, at which all but two of seventeen generals believed the Continental Army still could not win a pitched battle against the British, Lee arguing it would be criminal to attempt one. Unsure of Clinton's exact intentions and with his officers urging caution, Washington determined to pursue the British and move to within striking distance. Lee's brigades led the Continental Army out of Valley Forge on the afternoon of June 18, and four days later the last troops crossed the Delaware into New Jersey at Coryell's Ferry.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 175\u2013176</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 99\u2013104, 173</ref> Washington divided his army into two wings commanded by Lee and Major General [[William Alexander, Lord Stirling|Lord Stirling]] and a reserve commanded by Lafayette. Traveling light, Washington reached [[Hopewell, New Jersey|Hopewell]] on June 23, less than {{convert|25|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} north of the British at Allentown. While the army set up camp, [[Colonel]] [[Daniel Morgan]] was ordered south with 600 light infantry to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 161\u2013167</ref>\n\nOn June 24, Dickinson informed Washington the efforts he and Maxwell were making to slow Clinton were having little impact, and that he believed Clinton was deliberately lingering in New Jersey to provoke a battle.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 172</ref> Washington convened another war council in which the twelve officers who attended all recommended varying degrees of caution. Lee argued that a victory would be of little benefit while a defeat would do irrevocable damage to the revolutionary cause. He preferred not to risk the Continental Army against a professional, well-trained enemy until French intervention swayed the odds in the Americans' favor and proposed that Clinton should be allowed to proceed to New York unmolested. Four other generals agreed. Even the most aggressive of the remainder wanted to avoid a major engagement; Brigadier General [[Anthony Wayne]] suggested the dispatch of 2,500\u20133,000 additional troops to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson that would enable them, with a third of the army, to make \"an Impression in force.\" In the end, a compromise was agreed in which 1,500 picked men{{efn|It was Washington's habit to pull the best troops out of their regiments and form them into elite, ad hoc light infantry battalions of picked men.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 26, 128</ref>}} would reinforce the [[vanguard]] to \"act as occasion may serve.\" To [[Lieutenant colonel|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], who attended as an aide, the council \"would have done honor to the most honorab[le] society of midwives, and to them only.\" A disappointed Washington sent the token force under the command of Brigadier General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\nSoon after the council adjourned, Wayne&nbsp;\u2013 who had refused to put his name to the compromise&nbsp;\u2013 Lafayette and Major General [[Nathanael Greene]] contacted Washington individually with the same plea for a stronger vanguard action supported by the main body, while still avoiding a major battle. Lafayette assured Washington that Steuben and Brigadier General [[Louis Leb\u00e8gue Duportail|Louis Duportail]] agreed, and told Washington it \"would be disgraceful for the leaders and humiliating for the troops to allow the enemy to cross the Jerseys with impunity.\" Greene emphasized the political aspect, advising Washington the public expected him to attack and that even if a limited attack did lead to a major battle, he thought their chances of success were good. It was all Washington, keen to erase the defeats of the previous year and prove his critics wrong, needed to hear. By the early hours of June 25 he had ordered Wayne to follow Scott with another 1,000 picked men. He wanted to do more than simply harass Clinton and, while still avoiding the risk of a major battle, hoped to inflict a heavy blow on the British, one that would surpass his success at the [[Battle of Trenton]] in 1776.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 175\u2013177</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 176\u2013177</ref>\n\n===Reining in Lafayette===\n[[File:Gilbert du Motier Marquis de Lafayette.PNG|thumb|left|Major General Lafayette|alt=Contemporary painting]]\nWashington offered Lee command of the vanguard, but Lee declined, stating the force was too small for a man of his rank and position.{{efn|According to Lender & Stone, the exact timing of Washington's offer to Lee to take command of the vanguard is not clear and may have come after the decision to send the additional troops under Wayne.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 178</ref> The historian [[John E. Ferling]] states it came before the decision.<ref name=Ferling177 />}} Washington appointed Lafayette instead, with orders to attack \"with the whole force of your command\" if the opportunity presented itself. Lafayette failed to establish full control of the disparate forces under his command, and in his haste to catch the British, he pushed his troops to breaking point and outran his supplies. Washington grew increasingly concerned, and on the morning of June 26 he warned Lafayette not to \"distress your men by an over hasty march.\" By that afternoon, Lafayette was at Robin's Tavern, where Clinton had stayed the previous night. He was within three miles of the British, too far away from the main army for it to support him, and his men were exhausted and hungry. He remained eager to fight and discussed with his officers a night march with the intention of striking Clinton the next morning.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 177\u2013180</ref>\n\nThat evening, Washington ordered Lafayette to leave Morgan and the militia behind as a screen and move to [[Englishtown, New Jersey|Englishtown]], where he would be back in range of both supplies and the main army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 181\u2013182</ref>{{efn|As an indication of Lafayette's tenuous control over his command, Scott did not receive the orders to move to Englishtown. He continued on the assumption that the morning attack on Clinton was to proceed, and got to within a mile of what would have been a disastrous confrontation with the British before he finally learned that he was to withdraw.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 182</ref>}} By this time Lee, having realized Lafayette's force was more significant than he first thought, had changed his mind and requested command of it. Washington ordered Lee to take Scott's former brigade and the brigade of Brigadier General [[James Mitchell Varnum|James Varnum]], link up with Lafayette in Englishtown and take command of all advance forces. Greene took over command of Lee's wing of the main body.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 186\u2013189</ref>{{efn|The two brigades Lee took with him to Englishtown were severely under strength and together numbered only some 650 men.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 189</ref>}} By June 27, Lafayette was safely back in the fold with what was now Lee's vanguard of some 4,500 troops{{efn|Sources disagree on the exact size of Lee's vanguard.

Lee believed he had full discretion on whether and how to attack and called his own war council after Washington left. He intended to advance as soon as he knew Clinton was on the move, in the hope of catching the British rearguard when it was most vulnerable. In the absence of any intelligence about Clinton's intentions or the terrain, Lee believed it would be useless to form a precise plan of his own; he told his commanders only to be ready for action at short notice and follow his orders.<ref name=Ferling177 /><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 191\u2013193</ref> In response to a written order received from Washington in the early hours of June 28, Lee ordered Colonel [[William Grayson]] to take 700 men forward. They were to watch for any British move and, if one did occur, try and slow them to give the vanguard time to close the distance.<ref name=\"Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194\">Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194</ref>\n\nGrayson did not depart Englishtown until 06:00, an hour after news arrived that Clinton was on the move.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 198</ref> Both vanguard and main body broke camp immediately, and both were slow to move; the vanguard was delayed when brigades formed up in the wrong march order and the main body was slowed by its artillery train.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 236\u2013237</ref> At 07:00, Lee rode ahead to scout the situation for himself. Following some confusion when a militia rider erroneously reported the British were not withdrawing but preparing to attack, Lee learned that the British had begun moving at 02:00 and only a small party of infantry and cavalry remained in the area.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 238\u2013240</ref>\n\nClinton's first move had been to deploy the Queen's Rangers northwest of Monmouth Court House to cover the departure of the second division, scheduled for an hour later but delayed until 04:00. By 05:00, the first division had begun moving, and the last British troops left Monmouth Court House by 09:15, heading northeast on the road to [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown]]. Trailing the column was the rearguard, comprising a battalion of light infantry and a regiment of [[dragoon]]s which, with the Rangers, totaled 1,550\u20132,000 troops.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 249, 468</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 190</ref>\n\n===Advance to contact===\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - American vanguard attack.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Lee's attack on the British rearguard|alt=map]]\nThe first shots were exchanged around 08:00 in an entirely American skirmish between a small detachment of Rangers and Dickinson's militia. Grayson arrived just in time to deploy his troops in support of the militia near a bridge over a ravine and watch the Rangers withdraw.<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 240\u2013248</ref>{{efn|The Ranger detachment was operating well forward of the regiment's assigned position, having been ordered to chase down and capture a small party of rebels believed to have included Lafayette that had been spotted on a hill overlooking Monmouth Court House. It was in fact not Lafayette but Steuben, who, apparently oblivious to commotion he had caused, escaped with all but his hat, which ended up as a souvenir for the British.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 241\u2013245, 248</ref>}} The bridge was on the Englishtown\u2013Monmouth Court House road and spanned the Spotswood Middle Brook, one of three ravines bordered by marshy wetlands or 'morasses' that cut through what would soon become a battlefield. Other than by bridge, the ravines were negotiable with difficulty by infantry and not at all by artillery; any unit cut off on the wrong side or pinned up against them would find itself in grave danger. When Lee caught up with Grayson shortly after the skirmish, Dickinson, who still believed the British occupied Monmouth Court House in force, strongly urged him not to venture across the brook. With intelligence about British activity still contradictory, Lee lost an hour at the bridge. He did not advance until Lafayette arrived with the rest of the vanguard.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 250\u2013253</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 188\u2013189</ref>\n\nOnce the vanguard was concentrated at the bridge, Lee replaced Grayson with Wayne to command the approximately 550-man lead element, which comprised detachments led by Colonel [[Richard Butler (general)|Richard Butler]], Colonel [[Henry Jackson (general)|Henry Jackson]] and Grayson (returned to the command of his original composite battalion of Virginians), supported by four artillery.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 186, 195</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 253</ref> The vanguard advanced along the Englishtown road towards Monmouth Court House until it reached the junction with the road north to Foreman's Mill at around 09:30. Lee went forward with Wayne to reconnoiter Monmouth Court House, where they discovered the British rearguard. Estimating the British strength at some 2,000 men, Lee decided on a plan to hook round to their rear. He left Wayne with orders to fix the rearguard in place and returned to the rest of the vanguard to lead it on a left flanking maneuver. Lee's confidence crept into reports back to Washington that implied \"the certainty of success.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 253\u2013255, 261</ref>\n\nAfter Lee departed, Butler's detachment exchanged fire with mounted troops screening the rearguard, prompting the British to begin withdrawing to the northeast, towards the main column. In the subsequent pursuit, Wayne repulsed a charge by British dragoons and launched a feint against the British infantry, prompting the rearguard to halt and form up on a hill at the junction of the Middletown and [[Shrewsbury, New Jersey|Shrewsbury]] roads.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 255, 256, 258\u2013260</ref> Meanwhile, because Lee was leading the rest of the vanguard himself, he neglected to provide Scott and Maxwell with a detailed plan.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 256</ref> After a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|sp=us|0}} march, he emerged from some woods at around 10:30, in time to witness Wayne's troops in action to his left.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 261\u2013263</ref>\n\nWhen it became evident the British were present in considerably larger numbers than he had anticipated, Lee operated with Lafayette to secure what he considered to be a vulnerable right flank. On the left flank, the appearance of another British force 2,000\u20133,000 strong prompted Jackson to pull his regiment back from its isolated position on the banks of Spotswood North Brook.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 262\u2013264</ref> In the vanguard center, Scott and Maxwell, who was to Scott's left, were not in communication with Lee and not privy to his plan. They felt increasingly isolated watching Lee push out the right flank, and with British troops marching towards Monmouth Court House to their south, they became apprehensive about being cut off. They agreed between themselves to adjust their positions; Scott fell back a short distance southwest across the Spotswood Middle Brook to a more defensible position while Maxwell pulled back with the intention of circling round and coming up on Scott's right flank.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp.265\u2013266</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 199</ref>\n\nLee was dumbfounded when the two staff officers he had sent with orders for Scott returned with the news that he was nowhere to be found and disconcerted by their reports of the British returning in force. When he observed part of Lafayette's force retreating after a failed attempt to silence some British artillery, it appeared to Lee that the right flank too was pulling back without orders. It had become clear that he was losing control of the vanguard, and with his immediate command now only 2,500 strong, he realized his plan to envelop the British rearguard was finished. His priority now was the safety of his command in the face of superior numbers.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 266\u2013269</ref>\n\n===Counter-attack and retreat===\n[[File:Monmouth-map.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Contemporary map drawn by Lafayette's aide|alt=map]]\nAs soon as he received news that his rearguard was being probed, Clinton ordered Cornwallis to march the first division back towards Monmouth Court House. He believed Washington's main body was not close enough to come up in support and that the terrain would make it difficult for Lee to maneuver. He intended to do more than simply defend his baggage train; he thought the vanguard was vulnerable, and saw an opportunity to turn its right flank, just as Lee had feared, and destroy it.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 264\u2013265, 273</ref> After pausing at Monmouth Court House, Clinton began to push westwards. He formed his best troops into two columns, Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left and the guns of the [[Royal Artillery]] between them, while a regiment of dragoons ranged about them. The infantry of the 3rd and 4th Brigades followed in line, while the 5th Brigade remained in reserve at Monmouth Court House. The Queen's Rangers and the infantry of the rearguard operated on the British right flank. To the rear, a brigade of Hessian grenadiers remained in a defensive line to which Clinton could fall back if things went badly.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 273\u2013274, 275</ref> In total, his force comprised some 10,000 troops.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 265</ref>\n\nLee ordered a general retreat to a line about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} to the west of Monmouth Court House that ran from Craig's House, north of Spotswood Middle Brook, to Ker's House, south of the brook. He had significant difficulties communicating with his subordinates and exhausted his aides attempting to do so. Although he arrived in the vicinity of Ker's house with a sizeable force by noon, he was unable to exercise command and control of it as a unified organization. As disorganized as the retreat was for Lee, at unit level it was generally conducted with a discipline that did credit to Steuben's training. The Americans suffered only some one dozen casualties as they fell back, an indication of how little major fighting there was; there were no organized volleys by infantry [[musket]]s, and only the artillery engaged in any significant action.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 268\u2013272</ref> Lee believed he had conducted a model \"retrograde manoeuver in the face and under fire of an enemy\" and claimed his troops moved with \"order and precision.\"{{efn|There were some reports of disorder and poor discipline among the retreating troops, but at no stage was there any panic, and no unit broke. The artillery units were credited with exemplary spirit, and they in turn credited the infantry for protecting them at every stage.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 269, 271\u2013272</ref>}} He had remained calm during the retreat but began to unravel at Ker's house. When two of Washington's aides informed Lee that the main body was still some {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away and asked him what to report back, Lee replied \"that he really did not know what to say.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 270\u2013271</ref> Crucially, he failed to keep Washington informed of the retreat.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 178</ref>\n\nLee realized that a knoll in front of his lines would give the British, now deployed from column into line formation, command of the ground and render his position untenable. With no knowledge of the main body's whereabouts and believing he had little choice, Lee decided to fall back farther, across the Spotswood Middle Brook bridge. He believed he would be able to hold the British there from Perrine's Hill until the main body came up in support. With his aides out of action, Lee pressed whomever he could find into service as messengers to organize the withdrawal. It was during this period that he sent the army auditor, [[Major]] [[John Clark (spy)|John Clark]], to Washington with news of the retreat. But Washington was by now aware, having learned from Lee's troops who had already crossed the ravine.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 278\u2013281, 284</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 203</ref>\n\n===Washington's arrival===\nThe main body had reached Englishtown at 10:00, and by noon it was still some {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Monmouth Court House. Without any recent news from Lee, Washington had no reason to be concerned. At Tennent's Meeting House, some {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} east of Englishtown, he ordered Greene to take Brigadier General [[William Woodford]]'s brigade of some 550 men and 4 artillery pieces south then east to cover the right flank. The rest of the main body continued east along the Englishtown\u2013Monmouth Court House road. In the space of some ten minutes, Washington's confidence gave way to alarm as he encountered a straggler bearing the first news of Lee's retreat and then whole units in retreat. None of the officers Washington met could tell him where they were supposed to be going or what they were supposed to be doing. As the commander-in-chief rode on ahead, over the bridge and towards the front line, he saw the vanguard in full retreat but no sign of the British. At around 12:45, Washington found Lee marshalling the last of his command across the middle morass, marshy ground southeast of the bridge.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 281\u2013286</ref>\n\nExpecting praise for a retreat he believed had been generally conducted in good order, Lee was uncharacteristically lost for words when Washington asked without pleasantries, \"I desire to know, sir, what is the reason&nbsp;\u2013 whence arises this disorder and confusion?\"<ref name=Lender&Stone289>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 289</ref> When he regained his composure, Lee attempted to explain his actions. He blamed faulty intelligence and his officers, especially Scott, for pulling back without orders, leaving him no choice but to retreat in the face of a superior force, and reminded Washington that he had opposed the attack in the first place.<ref name=Lender&Stone289 /><ref name=Chernow448>Chernow 2010 p. 448</ref> Washington was not convinced; \"All this may be very true, sir,\" he replied, \"but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.\"<ref name=Lender&Stone289 /> Washington made it clear he was disappointed with Lee and rode off to organize the battle he felt his subordinate should have given. Lee followed at a distance, bewildered and believing he had been relieved of command.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 289\u2013290</ref>{{efn|According to Lender & Stone, the encounter between Washington and Lee \"became part of the folklore of the Revolution, with various witnesses (or would-be witnesses) taking increasing dramatic license with their stories over the years.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 290</ref> Ferling writes of eyewitness testimony in which a furious Washington, swearing \"till the leaves shook on the trees\" according to Scott, called Lee a \"damned poltroon\" and relieved him of command.<ref name=Ferling179 /> Chernow reports the same quote from Scott, quotes Lafayette to assert that a \"terribly excited\" Washington swore and writes that Washington \"banished [Lee] to the rear.\"<ref name=Chernow448 /> Bilby & Jenkins attribute the poltroon quote to Lafayette, then write that neither Scott nor Lafayette were present.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 205</ref> Lender & Stone are also skeptical, and assert that such stories are apocryphal nonsense which first appeared almost a half century or more after the event, that Scott was too far away to have heard what was said, and that Lee himself never accused Washington of profanity. According to Lender & Stone, \"careful scholarship has conclusively demonstrated that Washington was angry but not profane at Monmouth, and he never ordered Lee off the field.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 290\u2013291</ref>}}\n\nWith the main body still arriving and the British no more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away, Washington began to rally the vanguard to set up the very defenses Lee had been attempting to organize. The commander-in-chief directed Wayne to take three battalions and form a rearguard in the Point of Woods, south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, that could delay the British. He issued orders for the 2nd New Jersey Regiment and two smaller Pennsylvanian regiments to deploy on the slopes of Perrine's Hill, north of the brook overlooking the bridge; they would be the rallying point for the rest of the vanguard and the position on which the main body would form. Washington offered Lee a choice: remain and command the rearguard, or fall back to and organize the main body. Lee opted for the former and, as Washington departed to take care of the latter, promised he would \"be the last one to leave the field.\"<ref name=Ferling179>Ferling 2009 p. 179</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 291\u2013295</ref>\n\n===American rearguard action===\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - American rearguard.png|thumb|left|upright=2|American rearguard action|alt=map]]\nLee positioned himself with four guns supported by two infantry battalions on the crest of a hill to the right of Wayne. As the British advanced&nbsp;\u2013 Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left&nbsp;\u2013 they passed the Point of Woods, oblivious to the Continentals concealed in them. Wayne's troops inflicted up to forty casualties before the Guards, reacting as they were trained and with the support of the dragoons and some of the Grenadiers, crashed into the Americans at the charge. Within ten minutes, Wayne's three battalions were being chased back to the bridge. The rest of the Grenadiers, meanwhile, continued to advance on Lee's position, pushing the Continental artillery back to a hedgerow to which the two infantry battalions had already withdrawn. Another short, sharp fight ensued until Lee, seeing both flanks being turned, ordered his men to follow Wayne back across the bridge.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 298\u2013310</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 208\u2013209</ref>\n\nAs Lee and Wayne fought south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, Washington was deploying the main body on Perrine's Hill, northwest of the bridge across the brook. Stirling's wing had just taken up positions on the American left flank when its artillery started to engage troops of the British 3rd Brigade. Clinton had earlier ordered the brigade to move right, cross the brook and cut the vanguard's line of retreat at the bridge. After the infantry of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot]] crossed the brook, they ran into three battalions of Scott's detachment retreating westwards. Under pressure from the Highlanders, the Continentals continued through an orchard to the safety of Stirling's line while Stirling's artillery forced the Highlanders back to the orchard. A second battalion of Highlanders and the [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th Regiment of Foot]] that had swung right and crossed the Spotswood North Brook were also persuaded by the artillery to retreat. Even farther to the right, an attempt to outflank Stirling's position by the Queen's Rangers and the light infantry of the rearguard lacked the strength to carry it through, and they too fell back to join the 3rd Brigade.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 274\u2013276, 318</ref>\n\nAt 13:30, Lee was one of the last American officers to withdraw across Spotswood Middle Brook. The rearguard action had lasted no more than thirty minutes, enough time for Washington to complete the deployment of the main body. When a battalion of Grenadiers led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Henry Monckton]] chased Lee's troops over the bridge, the British found themselves facing Wayne's detachment reforming some {{convert|350|yd|m|sp=us|0}} away. As the Grenadiers advanced to engage Wayne they came under heavy fire from Stirling's artillery, another {{convert|350|yd|m|sp=us|0}} behind Wayne. Monckton became the highest-ranking British casualty of the day, and in the face of an unexpectedly strong enemy, the Grenadiers retreated back across the bridge to the hedgerow from which they had expelled Lee earlier.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 310\u2013314</ref>\n\nWashington had acted decisively to form a strong defensive position anchored on the right above the bridge on the Englishtown road and extending in a gentle curve {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} up the slope of Perrine's Hill. When Lee joined it, Washington sent him with two battalions of Maxwell's New Jersey Brigade, around half of Scott's detachment and some other units of the former vanguard to form a reserve at Englishtown. The rest of the vanguard, which included the other half of Scott's detachment and most of Wayne's, remained with Washington.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 296\u2013297, 315\u2013316</ref>{{efn|Shortly after Lee reached Englishtown, four brigades totaling some 2,200 fresh troops arrived, sent back by Washington from the main body, bringing the reserve's strength to over 3,000 men. Another arrival was Steuben, sent back by Washington to relieve Lee.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 316\u2013317, 348</ref>}} The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel across the {{convert|1,200|yd|m|sp=us|0}} of no-man's land either side of the brook, in which both sides suffered more casualties due to heat exhaustion than they did from enemy cannon.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 318, 320, 322\u2013324</ref>\n\n===British withdrawal===\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - endgame.png|thumb|upright=2|British withdrawal and American attacks. The 1st Grenadier Battalion was left behind in the general withdrawal, and it was caught by Wayne's Pennsylvania Brigade as it moved south to link up with the 4th Brigade (not shown). The 33rd Regiment of the 4th Brigade came up in support, and together they forced the Pennsylvanians to retreat until Greene's artillery on Combs Hill forced the British to retreat in turn.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 344\u2013347</ref>|alt=map]]\nClinton had lost the initiative. He saw no prospect of success assaulting a strong enemy position in the brutal heat, and decided to break off the engagement.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 315, 331\u2013332</ref> His first task was to bring in his isolated right flank&nbsp;\u2013 the 3rd Brigade, Rangers and light infantry still sheltering in the orchard north of Spotswood Middle Brook. While the Highlanders of the 42nd Regiment remained in place to cover the withdrawal, the remainder fell back across the brook to join the Grenadiers at the hedgerow. Around 15:45, while the withdrawal was in progress, Greene arrived with Woodford's brigade at Combs Hill overlooking the British left flank and opened fire with his artillery. Clinton was forced to withdraw his own artillery, bringing the cannonade with Washington's guns on Perrine's Hill to an end, and move the Grenadiers to sheltered ground at the north end of the hedgerow.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 333\u2013335</ref>\n\nAt 16:30, Washington learned of 3rd Brigade's withdrawal and launched the first American offensive action in six hours. He ordered two battalions of picked men \"to go and see what [you] could do with the enemy's right wing.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 336\u2013337</ref> Only one battalion some 350 strong led by Colonel [[Joseph Cilley (state senator)|Joseph Cilley]] actually made it into action. Cilley made good use of cover along the Spotswood North Brook to close with and engage the 275\u2013325 troops of the 42nd Regiment in the orchard. The Highlanders found themselves in a disadvantageous position and, with the rest of British right flank already departed, they had no reason to stay. They conducted a fighting retreat in good order with minimal casualties. To the British, the rebels were \"unsuccessful in endeavouring to annoy.\" To the Americans, it was a significant psychological victory over one of the British Army's most feared regiments.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 335\u2013340</ref>\n\nAs his right flank pulled back, Clinton issued orders for what he intended to be a phased general withdrawal back towards Monmouth Court House.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 340</ref> His subordinates misunderstood. Instead of waiting until the 3rd Brigade had rejoined before pulling back, all but the 1st Grenadier Battalion withdrew immediately, leaving it and the 3rd Brigade dangerously exposed. Washington was buoyed by what he saw of Cilley's attack, and although he lacked specific intelligence about what the British were doing, the fact that their artillery had gone quiet suggested they might be vulnerable. He ordered Wayne to conduct an opportunistic advance with a detachment of Pennsylvanians.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 340\u2013341</ref>\n\nWayne's request for three brigades, some 1,300 men, was denied, and at 16:45 he crossed the bridge over Spotswood Middle Brook with just 400 troops of the Third Pennsylvania Brigade.{{efn|Wayne never forgave Major General [[Arthur St. Clair]], serving as an aide to Washington, for allowing only one brigade. Lender & Stone argue that St. Clair was acting on the authority of Washington, and that the modest size of the force is indicative of Washington's desire to avoid risking a substantial part of his army in a major action.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 341\u2013342</ref>}} The Pennsylvanians caught the 650\u2013700 men of the lone Grenadier battalion in the process of withdrawing, giving the British scant time to form up and receive the attack. The Grenadiers were \"losing men very fast\", Clinton wrote later, before the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment of Foot]] arrived with 300\u2013350 men to support them. The British pushed back, and the Pennsylvanian Brigade began to disintegrate as it retreated to Parsonage farm. The longest infantry battle of the day ended when the Continental artillery on Combs Hill stopped the British counter-attack in its tracks and forced the Grenadiers and infantry to withdraw.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 341\u2013347</ref>{{efn|According to [[Edward G. Lengel]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Aaron Burr]] led the Pennsylvanian Brigade attack, not Wayne.<ref>Lengel 2005 p. 303</ref> Lengel also writes that around the same time, a column of Guards and Grenadiers led by Cornwallis made an unsuccessful attack on Greene's position at Combs Hill, a claim also made in William Stryker's account of the battle, but Lender and Stone assert that such an attack was never ordered.<ref>Lengel 2005 pp. 303\u2013304</ref><ref>Stryker 1927 pp. 211\u2013213, cited in Lender & Stone 2016 p. 531</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 531</ref>}}\n\nWashington planned to resume the battle the next day, and at 18:00 he ordered four brigades he had previously sent back to the reserve at Englishtown to return. When they arrived, they took over Stirling's positions on Perrine's Hill, allowing Stirling to advance across the Spotswood Middle Brook and take up new positions near the hedgerow. An hour later, Washington ordered a reinforced brigade commanded by Brigadier General [[Enoch Poor]] to probe Clinton's right flank while Woodford's brigade was to drop down from Combs Hill and probe Clinton's left flank. Their cautious advance was halted by sunset before making contact with the British, and the two armies settled down for the night within {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} of each other, the closest British troops at Ker's House.<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 347\u2013349</ref>\n\nWhile the battle was raging, Knyphausen had led the baggage train to safety. His second division endured only light harassment from militia along the way, and eventually set up camp some {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Middletown. With the baggage train secure, Clinton had no intention of resuming the battle. At 23:00, he began withdrawing his troops. The first division slipped away unnoticed by Washington's forward troops and, after an overnight march, linked back up with Knyphausen's second division between 08:00 and 09:00 the next morning.<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 349\u2013352</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth (NYPL b13075520-422191) cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle of Monmouth|alt=Scan of engraving]]\nOn June 29, Washington withdrew his army to Englishtown, where they rested the next day. The British were in a strong position near Middletown, and their route to Sandy Hook was secure. They completed the march largely untroubled by a militia that considered the threat to have passed and had melted away to tend to crops. The last British troops embarked on naval transports on July 6, and the Royal Navy carried Clinton's army to New York. The timing was fortuitous for the British; on July 11, a superior French fleet commanded by Vice Admiral [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing]] anchored off Sandy Hook.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 354\u2013355, 372\u2013373, 378\u2013379</ref>\n\nThe battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side dealt a heavy blow to the other, and the Continental Army remained in the field while the British Army redeployed to New York, just as both would have if the battle had never been fought.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xiii, 382</ref>{{efn|Bilby and Jenkins write that the two armies \"fought to a standstill\" at Monmouth and characterize a British defeat in terms of the wider strategic situation.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 233\u2013234</ref> [[Willard Sterne Randall]] considers the fact that the British left the battlefield to Washington to be \"technically the sign of a victory\".<ref>Randall 1997 p. 359</ref> Chernow bases his conclusion that the battle ended in \"something close to a draw\" on conservative estimates of casualties.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 451</ref> David G.

Washington counted some 250 British dead, a figure later revised to a little over 300. Using a typical 18th-century wounded-to-killed ratio of no more than four to one and assuming no more than 160 British dead caused by enemy fire, Lender and Stone calculate the number of wounded could have been up to 640. A [[Monmouth County Historical Association]] study estimates total British casualties at 1,134&nbsp;\u2013 comprising 304 dead, 770 wounded and 60 prisoners. Washington reported his own casualties to be 370&nbsp;\u2013 comprising 69 dead, 161 wounded and 140 missing. Using the same wounded-to-killed ratio and assuming a proportion of the missing were fatalities, Lender and Stone estimate Washington's casualties could have exceeded 500.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 366\u2013369</ref><ref>Martin 1993 pp. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\n===Claims of victory===\nIn his post-battle report to Lord [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|George Germain]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], Clinton claimed he had conducted a successful operation to redeploy his army in the face of a superior force. The counter-attack was, he reported, a diversion intended to protect the baggage train and was ended on his own terms, though in private correspondence he conceded that he had also hoped to inflict a decisive defeat on Washington.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 232</ref> Having marched his army through the heart of enemy territory without the loss of a single wagon, he congratulated his officers on the \"long and difficult retreat in the face of a greatly superior army without being tarnished by the smallest affront.\" While some of his officers showed a grudging respect for the Continental Army, their doubts were rooted not in the battlefield but in the realisation that the entry of France into the conflict had swung the strategic balance against Great Britain.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xii, 375\u2013378</ref>\n\nFor Washington, the battle was fought at a time of serious misgivings about his effectiveness as commander-in-chief, and it was politically important for him to present it as a victory.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xiii\u2013xiv, 382\u2013383</ref> On July 1, in his first significant communication to Congress from the front since the disappointments of the previous year, he wrote a full report of the battle. The contents were measured but unambiguous in claiming a significant win, a rare occasion on which the British had left the battlefield and their wounded to the Americans. Congress received it enthusiastically and voted a formal thanks to Washington and the army to honor \"the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.\"<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 349, 353, 383\u2013384</ref>\n\nIn their accounts of the battle, Washington's officers invariably wrote of a major victory, and some took the opportunity to finally put an end to criticism of Washington; Hamilton and Lieutenant Colonel [[John Laurens]], another of Washington's aides, wrote to influential friends&nbsp;\u2013 in the case of Laurens, his father [[Henry Laurens|Henry]], [[President of the Continental Congress]]&nbsp;\u2013 praising Washington's leadership. The American press portrayed the battle as a triumph with Washington at its center. Governor [[William Livingston]] of New Jersey, who never came any nearer to Monmouth Court House during the campaign than [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], almost {{convert|25|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away, published an anonymous 'eyewitness' account in the ''New Jersey Gazette'' only days after the battle, in which he credited the victory to Washington. Articles were still being published in a similar vein in August.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 309, 384\u2013389</ref>\n\nCongressional delegates who were not Washington partisans, such as [[Samuel Adams]] and [[James Lovell (Continental Congress)|James Lovell]], were reluctant to credit Washington but obliged to recognize the importance of the battle and keep to themselves any questions they might have had about the British success in reaching New York. The Washington loyalist [[Elias Boudinot]] wrote that \"none dare to acknowledge themselves his Enemies.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 386</ref> Washington's supporters were emboldened in defending his reputation; in July, Major General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] challenged Conway, the officer at the center of what Washington had perceived to be a conspiracy to remove him as commander-in-chief, to a duel in Philadelphia in which Conway was wounded in the mouth. [[Thomas McKean]], chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, was perhaps the only congressional delegate to register his disapproval of the affair, but did not think it wise to bring Cadwalader up before the court to answer for it.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 387\u2013388</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 423</ref> Faith in Washington had been restored, Congress became almost deferential to him, public criticism of him all but ceased and for the first time he was hailed as the Father of his Country.

But on June 30, after protesting his innocence to all who would listen, Lee wrote an insolent letter to Washington in which he blamed \"dirty earwigs\" for turning Washington against him, claimed his decision to retreat had saved the day and pronounced Washington to be \"guilty of an act of cruel injustice\" towards him. Instead of the apology Lee was tactlessly seeking, Washington replied that the tone of Lee's letter was \"highly improper\" and that he would initiate an official inquiry into Lee's conduct. Lee's response demanding a [[court-martial]] was again insolent; Washington ordered his arrest and set about obliging him.<ref name=\"Ferling 2009 p. 180\">Ferling 2009 p. 180</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 452</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 392\u2013393</ref>\n\nThe court convened on July 4, and three charges were laid before Lee: disobeying orders in not attacking on the morning of the battle, contrary to \"repeated instructions\"; conducting an \"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat\"; and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief.

It was addressed to the \"Royal Commissioners\", i.e. Lord [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] and Richard's brother, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], respectively the British naval and army commanders in North America at the time, and detailed a plan by which the British might defeat the rebellion. Moore's discovery, presented in a paper titled ''The Treason of Charles Lee'' in 1858, influenced perceptions of Lee for decades. Although most modern scholars reject the idea that Lee was guilty of treason, it is given credence in some accounts, examples being Randall's account of the battle in ''George Washington: A Life'', published in 1997, and Dominick Mazzagetti's ''Charles Lee: Self Before Country'', published in 2013.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 111\u2013112</ref><ref>Randall 1997 p. 358</ref><ref>Mazzagetti 2013 p. xi</ref>}}\n\n===Assessing the Continental Army===\nJoseph Bilby and Katherine Jenkins consider the battle to have marked the \"coming of age\" of a Continental Army that had previously achieved success only in small actions at Trenton and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]].<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 233, 237</ref> Their view is reflected by [[Joseph Ellis]], who writes of Washington's belief that \"the Continental Army was now a match for British professionals and could hold its own in a conventional, open-field engagement.\"<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 120</ref> Mark Lender and Garry Stone point out that while the Continental Army was unquestionably improved under Steuben's tutelage, the battle did not test its ability to meet a professional European army in European-style warfare in which brigades and divisions maneuvered against each other. The only army to mount any major offensive operation on the day was British; the Continental Army fought a largely defensive battle from cover, and a significant portion of it remained out of the fray on Perrine's Hill. The few American attacks, such as Cilley's, were small-unit actions.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 405\u2013406</ref>\n\nSteuben's influence was apparent in the way the rank and file conducted themselves. Half of the troops who marched onto the battlefield at Monmouth in June were new to the army, having been recruited only since January. The significant majority of Lee's vanguard comprised ad hoc battalions filled with men picked from numerous regiments. Without any inherent unit cohesion, their effectiveness depended on officers and men who had never before served together using and following the drills they had been taught. That they did so competently was demonstrated throughout the battle, in the advance to contact, Wayne's repulse of the dragoons, the orderly retreat in the face of a strong counter-attack and Cilley's attack on the Highlanders. The army was well served too by the artillery, which earned high praise from Washington.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 407\u2013408</ref> The professional conduct of the American troops gained widespread recognition even among the British; Clinton's secretary wrote, \"the Rebels stood much better than ever they did\", and Brigadier General Sir [[Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet|William Erskine]], who as commander of the light infantry had traded blows with the Continentals, characterized the battle as a \"handsome flogging\" for the British, adding, \"We had not receiv'd such an one in America.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 375, 405</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth Monument at Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|A {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on|sp=us}} tall monument to the battle in front of the [[Monmouth County Courthouse]] in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]]]]\nIn keeping with a battle that was more politically than militarily significant, the first reenactment in 1828 was staged to support the presidential candidacy of [[Andrew Jackson]]. In another attempt to reenact the battle in 1854, the weather added an authentic touch to the proceedings and the reenactment was called off due to the excessive heat. As the battle receded into history so too did its brutality, to be replaced by a sanitized romanticism. The public memory of the fighting was populated with dramatic images of heroism and glory, as epitomized by [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s ''Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth''. The transformation was aided by the inventiveness of 19th-century historians, none more creative than Washington's step-grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], whose account of the battle was as artistic as Leutze's painting. Custis was inevitably derogatory towards Lee, and Lee's calumny achieved an orthodoxy in such works as [[Washington Irving]]'s ''Life of George Washington'' (1855\u20131859) and [[George Bancroft]]'s ''History of the United States of America, from the Discovery of the American Continent'' (1854\u20131878). The role Lee had unsuccessfully advanced for the militia in the revolution was finally established in the poetic 19th-century popular narrative, in which the Continental Army was excised from the battle and replaced with patriotic citizen-soldiers.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 429\u2013436</ref>\n\nThe battlefield remained largely undisturbed until 1853, when the [[Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad]] opened a line that cut through the Point of Woods, across the Spotswood Middle Brook and through the Perrine estate. The area became popular with tourists, and the Parsonage, the site of Wayne's desperate battle with the Grenadiers and the 33rd Regiment, was a favorite attraction until it was demolished in 1860.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 432\u2013433</ref> During the 19th century, forests were cleared and marshes drained, and by the early 20th century traditional agriculture had been replaced by orchards and [[Market garden|truck farms]].<ref name=brochure>{{cite web |url=https://njparksandforests.org/parks/maps/monbat-brochure-map.pdf |title=Monmouth Battlefield Brochure and Map |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection |access-date=April 14, 2019 }}</ref> In 1884, the Monmouth Battle Monument was dedicated outside the modern-day county courthouse in Freehold, near where Wayne's troops first brushed with the British rearguard.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 437</ref> In the mid 20th century, two battlefield farms were sold to builders, but before the land could be developed, lobbying by state officials, Monmouth County citizens, the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Monmouth County Chapter of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] succeeded in initiating a program of preservation. In 1963, the first tract of battlefield land came under state ownership with the purchase of a 200-acre farm. The [[Monmouth Battlefield State Park]] was dedicated on the bicentennial of the battle in 1978 and a new visitor center was opened in 2013. By 2015, the park encompassed over 1,800 acres, incorporating most of the land on which the afternoon battle was fought. The state park helped restore a more realistic interpretation of the history of the battle to the public memory, and the Continental Army takes its rightful place in the annual reenactments staged every June.<ref name=brochure /><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 438\u2013439</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://njparksandforests.org/parks/monbat.html |title=Monmouth Battlefield State Park |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection |access-date=April 14, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Legend of Molly Pitcher===\n{{main|Molly Pitcher}}\nFive days after the battle, a surgeon treating the wounded reported a patient's story of a woman who had taken her husband's place working a gun after he was incapacitated. Two accounts attributed to veterans of the battle that surfaced decades later also speak of the actions of a woman during the battle; in one she supplied ammunition to the guns, in the other she brought water to the crews. The story gained prominence during the 19th century and became embellished as the legend of [[Molly Pitcher]]. The woman behind Molly Pitcher is most often identified as Mary Hays, whose husband William served with the Pennsylvania State Artillery, but it is likely that the legend is an amalgam of more than one woman seen on the battlefield that day; it was not unusual for [[camp followers]] to assist in 18th-century battles, though more plausibly in carrying ammunition and water than crewing the guns. Late 20th-century research identified a site near Stirling's artillery line as the location of a well from which the legendary Molly drew water, and a historic marker was placed there in 1992.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 326\u2013330</ref><ref>Martin 1993 pp. 228\u2013229</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Revolutionary War}}\n*[[List of American Revolutionary War battles]]\n*[[New Jersey in the American Revolution]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Adelberg |first=Michael S. |title=The American Revolution in Monmouth County: The Theatre of Spoil and Destruction |publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, South Carolina |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-61423-263-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Bilby |first1=Joseph G. |last2=Jenkins |first2=Katherine Bilby |lastauthoramp=y |title=Monmouth Court House: The Battle That Made the American Army |location=Yardley, Pennsylvania |publisher=Westholme Publishing |isbn=978-1-59416-108-7 |year=2010 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=E-Book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

It pitted the [[Continental Army]], commanded by General [[George Washington]], against the [[British Army]] in North America, commanded by General Sir [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]]. It was the last battle of the [[Philadelphia campaign]], begun the previous year, during which the British had inflicted two major defeats on Washington and occupied Philadelphia. Washington had spent the winter at [[Valley Forge]] rebuilding his army and defending his position against political enemies who favored his replacement as commander-in-chief. In February 1778, the [[Franco-American alliance]] tilted the strategic balance in favor of the Americans, forcing the British to abandon hopes of a military victory and adopt a defensive strategy. Clinton was ordered to evacuate Philadelphia and consolidate his army. The Continental Army shadowed the British as they marched across New Jersey to Sandy Hook, from where the Royal Navy would ferry them to New York. Washington's senior officers urged varying degrees of caution, but it was politically important for him not to allow the British to withdraw unscathed. Washington detached around a third of his army and sent it ahead under the command of [[Major general|Major General]] [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], hoping to land a heavy blow on the British without becoming embroiled in a major engagement. The battle began badly for the Americans when Lee botched an attack on the British rearguard at Monmouth Court House. A counter-attack by the main British column forced Lee to retreat until Washington arrived with the main body. Clinton disengaged when he found Washington in an unassailable defensive position and resumed the march to Sandy Hook.\n\nClinton had divided his army into two divisions for the march from Philadelphia; most of the combat troops were concentrated in the first division, while the second comprised most of the heavy transport of a 1,500-wagon baggage train. The British were harassed by increasingly strong American forces as they traversed New Jersey, and by June 27, Lee's [[vanguard]] was within striking distance. When the British left Monmouth Court House the next day, Lee attempted to isolate and defeat their rearguard. The attack was poorly coordinated, and the Americans were quickly outnumbered when the British first division returned. Some of Lee's units began to withdraw, leading to a breakdown in command and control and forcing Lee to order a general retreat. A fiercely fought rearguard action by the vanguard gave Washington enough time to deploy the main body in a strong defensive position, against which British efforts to press the vanguard foundered. The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel, during which Clinton began to disengage. The duel ended when a Continental brigade established artillery on a hill overlooking the British lines, forcing Clinton to withdraw his guns. Washington launched two small-unit attacks on Clinton's infantry as they withdrew, inflicting heavy casualties on the British during the second. An attempt by Washington to probe the British flanks was halted by sunset, and the two armies settled down within {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} of each other. The British slipped away unnoticed during the night to link up with the baggage train. The rest of the march to Sandy Hook was completed without further incident, and Clinton's army was ferried to New York in early July.\n\nThe battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side landed the blow they hoped to on the other, Washington's army remained an effective force in the field and the British redeployed successfully to New York. The Continental Army inflicted more casualties than it suffered, and it was one of the rare occasions on which it retained possession of a battlefield. It had proven itself to be much improved after the training it underwent over the winter, and the professional conduct of the American troops during the battle was widely noted by the British. Washington was able to present the battle as a triumph, and he was voted a formal thanks by [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] to honor \"the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.\" His position as commander-in-chief became unassailable. He was lauded for the first time as the Father of his Country, and his detractors were silenced. Lee was vilified for his failure to press home the attack on the British rearguard. Because of his tactless efforts to argue his case in the days after the battle, Washington had him arrested and court-martialed on charges of disobeying orders, conducting an \"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat\" and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. Lee made the fatal mistake of turning the proceedings into a contest between himself and Washington. He was found guilty on all counts, although his culpability on the first two charges was debatable.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Philadelphia campaign|Franco-American Alliance}}\n[[File:Washington peale.jpg|thumb|General George Washington|alt=Contemporary painting]]\nIn 1777, some two years into the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British commander-in-chief General Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] launched the [[Philadelphia campaign]] to capture the rebels' capital and persuade them to sue for peace. In the fall of that year, Howe inflicted two significant defeats on General [[George Washington]] and his [[Continental Army]], at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], and occupied Philadelphia, forcing the [[Second Continental Congress]] to hurriedly decamp to [[York, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 130\u2013135, 140</ref><ref>Martin 1993 p. 12</ref> Washington avoided battle for the rest of the year, and in December he withdrew to winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]], despite the desire of Congress that he continue campaigning.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 147\u2013148, 151\u2013152</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 109</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 24</ref> In comparison, his subordinate General [[Horatio Gates]] had won major victories in September and October at the [[Battles of Saratoga]].<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 126\u2013128, 137</ref> Washington was criticized in some quarters within the army and Congress for relying on a [[Fabian strategy]] to wear the British down in a long war of attrition instead of defeating it decisively in a pitched battle.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 141, 148</ref>\n\nIn November, Washington was hearing rumors of a \"Strong Faction\" within Congress that favored replacing him with Gates as commander-in-chief.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 139</ref> The congressional appointments of the known critic General [[Thomas Conway]] as [[History of the Office of The Inspector General of the United States Army|Inspector General of the Army]] and of Gates to the [[Board of War|Board of War and Ordnance]] in December convinced Washington there was a [[Conway Cabal|conspiracy]] to take command of the army from him.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 152\u2013153</ref>{{efn|Despite Washington's fears, his detractors were never part of an organized conspiracy to oust him, and those in Congress who favored his removal as commander-in-chief were in the minority.

Following the [[Franco-American alliance]] of February 1778, French forces were sent to North America to support the revolutionaries. This led to the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)]], which [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Spain]] would join on the French side in 1779. With the rest of Europe moving towards a [[First League of Armed Neutrality|hostile neutrality]], Great Britain would come under further pressure in 1780 when the Dutch allied with France, leading to the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]. Faced with military escalation, increasing diplomatic isolation and limited resources, the British were forced to prioritize the defense of the homeland and more valuable colonial possessions in the Caribbean and India above their North American colonies. They abandoned their efforts to win a decisive military victory, repealed the [[Intolerable Acts]] which had precipitated the rebellion and, in April 1778, sent the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]] in an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement. In Philadelphia, the newly installed commander-in-chief General Sir [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]] was ordered to redeploy 8,000 troops, a third of his army, to the West Indies and Florida, consolidate the rest of his army in New York and adopt a defensive posture.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 12\u201315</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 442</ref><ref name=Ferling175>Ferling 2009 p. 175</ref>\n\n===Continental Army===\n[[File:Sirhenryclinton2.jpg|thumb|left|General Henry Clinton|alt=Contemporary painting]]\nWashington's preference for a professional standing army rather than a militia had been another source of criticism.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 28</ref> He had seen his army dissolve in the fall of 1775 as short-term enlistments expired, and blamed his defeat in the [[Battle of Long Island]] in August 1776 in part on a poorly performing militia.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 118</ref> At his urging, Congress passed legislation between September and December 1776 to create an army in which troops would enlist for the duration. Recruitment failed to raise sufficient numbers, and the harsh discipline implemented by Washington, the long periods away from home and the defeats of 1777 further weakened the army through desertions and frequent officer resignations. Although the army that went into Valley Forge contained the kernel of regimental organization and a core of experienced officers and men, no-one was under any illusion that it was a match for the tactical skill of the British Army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 60\u201364, 66</ref> The situation improved measurably with the arrival in March 1778 of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], to whom Washington gave the responsibility for training the army. With the commander-in-chief's enthusiastic support, Steuben implemented a uniform standard of drill where none had previously existed and worked the army hard, transforming it into a more professional force that might compete on equal terms with the British Army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 65\u201366, 68</ref><ref name=\"Ellis116\u2013117\">Ellis 2004 pp. 116\u2013117</ref>{{efn|Friedrich Wilhelm August Heinrich Ferdinand had turned up as a volunteer at Valley Forge claiming the title of Baron von Steuben, an intimacy with the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king [[Frederick the Great]] and the rank of general in the [[Prussian Army]], none of which was true.

He had been critical of Washington's indecisiveness at New York and insubordinate during the retreat from the city. But Washington had regarded him as his most trusted adviser and the best officer in the Continental Army, and he eagerly welcomed Lee back as his second-in-command.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 84, 105, 175</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 443</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 110, 112, 117</ref> Sixteen months in captivity had not mellowed Lee.

Of the twelve responses, all agreed it was vital that, whatever course was chosen, the army had to perform well if public support for the revolution was to be maintained after the disappointments of the previous year. Most generals supported one or other of the offensive options, but Washington sided with the minority, among them Steuben, who argued the Continental Army still needed improvement at Valley Forge before it was ready to take on the British. After news of the Franco-American alliance arrived and as British activity in and around Philadelphia increased, Washington met with ten of his generals on May 8 to further discuss plans. This time they unanimously favored the defensive option and waiting until the British intentions became clearer.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 76\u201382</ref>\n\nIn May, it became evident that the British were preparing to evacuate Philadelphia, but Washington still had no detailed knowledge of Clinton's intentions and was concerned that the British would slip away overland through New Jersey. The [[2nd New Jersey Regiment]], which had been conducting operations against British foragers and sympathizers in New Jersey since March, was a valuable source of intelligence, and by the end of the month a British evacuation by land looked increasingly likely. Washington reinforced the regiment with the rest of the New Jersey Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General [[William Maxwell (Continental Army general)|William Maxwell]], with orders to obstruct and harry British activities.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 85\u201386, 88\u201390</ref> The Continentals were to co-operate with the experienced [[New Jersey militia]], commanded by Major General [[Philemon Dickinson]], one of the most capable militia commanders of the war and Washington's single best source of intelligence on British activities.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 92\u201394</ref> On May 18, Washington sent the inexperienced, 20-year-old Major General [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] with 2,200 men to establish an observation post at Barren Hill, {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Philadelphia. The Frenchman's first significant independent command almost ended in disaster for him two days later in the [[Battle of Barren Hill]], and only the discipline of his men prevented his entrapment by the British.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 91</ref>\n\n==March from Philadelphia==\n[[File:Monmouth1 plainsvg.svg|thumb|upright=2|Routes taken by the Continental Army from Valley Forge (dark blue) and the British Army from Philadelphia (red) to the Battle of Monmouth. Where the roads allowed, the British first division took the western route while the second division followed a parallel route farther east. The dashed blue line shows Lafayette's attempt to catch the British when he was commander of the vanguard.|alt=map]]\nOn June 15, the British began to withdraw from Philadelphia, crossing the River Delaware into New Jersey. The last troops crossed three days later, and the army consolidated around [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]]. Clinton, who had not yet decided on the exact route to New York approximately {{convert|90|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away, divided his army into two divisions and set out for [[Allentown, New Jersey|Allentown]], some {{convert|40|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} to the northeast. He accompanied the first division, which comprised some 10,000 troops under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Lord Cornwallis]]. The second division, commanded by Lieutenant General [[Wilhelm von Knyphausen]], comprised just over 9,000 personnel, of which over 7,500 were combatants. This division contained the bulk of the slow-moving heavy transport of the 1,500-wagon baggage train.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 97\u201398, 123\u2013124, 126\u2013127</ref>\n\nThe march was conducted in short segments during a heat wave in which temperatures frequently exceeded {{convert|90|F|C|0}}, which further slowed progress and caused casualties from heat exhaustion. The slow progress did not concern Clinton. He was confident his troops were more than a match for Washington's forces and felt that a major battle would compensate for the humiliation of having to abandon Philadelphia and might even deal a serious blow to the rebellion.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 141\u2013143</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 122</ref> Wherever possible, the two divisions followed parallel routes which allowed them to be mutually supporting. Light troops and [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] screened the route ahead of the main force and cleared obstacles, combat units were embedded with the baggage train and [[battalion]]-sized units provided flank guards.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 127, 131\u2013132</ref> The frequent sniping and skirmishing of Maxwell's Continentals and Dickinson's militia, and their attempts to obstruct and hinder the British by blocking roads, destroying bridges and spoiling wells, did not materially impede progress.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 127\u2013141</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 121</ref>\n\nOn June 24, the first division arrived at Allentown while the second reached [[Imlaystown, New Jersey|Imlaystown]], {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} to the east.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 140</ref> Clinton decided to head for [[Sandy Hook]], from where the [[Royal Navy]] could ferry his army to New York. When the march resumed at 04:00 the next day, the road network made it impossible for the two divisions to follow separate routes and still remain within supporting distance of each other. Knyphausen's second division led the {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|sp=us|0}} column on the road towards Monmouth Court House (modern-day [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]]). Cornwallis followed, [[Foot guards|Guards]] and [[Grenadier]]s at the rear, putting his combat-heavy division between the baggage train and the likely direction of attack. At the end of the day, Knyphausen camped at [[Freehold Township, New Jersey|Freehold Township]], some {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Monmouth Court House, while Clinton established his headquarters at Robin's Rising Sun Tavern, {{convert|12|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Knyphausen.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 150\u2013154</ref><ref>Martin 1993 p. 204</ref>\n\nThe next day, June 26, the British suffered almost forty casualties in near-constant skirmishing in which one unit came close to being overrun. Knyphausen reached Monmouth Court House early that morning, and by 10:00 the entire column had concentrated there. It was clear to Clinton that Washington's forces were gathering in numbers, and the British were exhausted after their {{convert|67|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|sp=us|0}} march from Philadelphia. Monmouth Court House offered a good defensive position, and it is possible that Clinton saw an opportunity for the battle he desired. He deployed his army to cover all approaches and decided to rest his troops for the next two nights. The bulk of his force, the first division, was deployed on the Allentown road, covering the second division in the village.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 156\u2013158</ref>\n\nThe revolution had precipitated a vicious civil war in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]] that did credit to neither side and which would continue after the armies had departed.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 47\u201348</ref> It was fought between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]], who sided with the rebellion, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], who remained loyal to Great Britain and even formed units, such as the [[Queen's Rangers|Queen's American Rangers]], which fought alongside the British Army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xviii, 212</ref> The two sides also fought each other in the civil arena, and it is estimated that fifty per cent of Monmouth County families suffered significant harm to person or property during the war.<ref>Adelberg 2010 pp. 32\u201333</ref> By spring 1778, the formerly loyalist Monmouth Court House had come under patriot control.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 211, 213</ref> When the British arrived, they found themselves in an enemy settlement that had been largely deserted by its inhabitants. Clinton's orders against pillaging were ignored by the rank and file and went unenforced by the officers. British and Hessian soldiers acting out of frustration and anger, and Loyalists acting out of rage and vengeance, committed numerous acts of vandalism, looting and arson. By the time Clinton resumed the march on June 28, thirteen of the village's near two dozen buildings had been destroyed, all of them Patriot owned.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 201, 214\u2013216</ref>\n\n===Pursuit===\nWashington learned the British were evacuating Philadelphia on June 17. He immediately convened a war council, at which all but two of seventeen generals believed the Continental Army still could not win a pitched battle against the British, Lee arguing it would be criminal to attempt one. Unsure of Clinton's exact intentions and with his officers urging caution, Washington determined to pursue the British and move to within striking distance. Lee's brigades led the Continental Army out of Valley Forge on the afternoon of June 18, and four days later the last troops crossed the Delaware into New Jersey at Coryell's Ferry.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 175\u2013176</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 99\u2013104, 173</ref> Washington divided his army into two wings commanded by Lee and Major General [[William Alexander, Lord Stirling|Lord Stirling]] and a reserve commanded by Lafayette. Traveling light, Washington reached [[Hopewell, New Jersey|Hopewell]] on June 23, less than {{convert|25|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} north of the British at Allentown. While the army set up camp, [[Colonel]] [[Daniel Morgan]] was ordered south with 600 light infantry to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 161\u2013167</ref>\n\nOn June 24, Dickinson informed Washington the efforts he and Maxwell were making to slow Clinton were having little impact, and that he believed Clinton was deliberately lingering in New Jersey to provoke a battle.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 172</ref> Washington convened another war council in which the twelve officers who attended all recommended varying degrees of caution. Lee argued that a victory would be of little benefit while a defeat would do irrevocable damage to the revolutionary cause. He preferred not to risk the Continental Army against a professional, well-trained enemy until French intervention swayed the odds in the Americans' favor and proposed that Clinton should be allowed to proceed to New York unmolested. Four other generals agreed. Even the most aggressive of the remainder wanted to avoid a major engagement; Brigadier General [[Anthony Wayne]] suggested the dispatch of 2,500\u20133,000 additional troops to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson that would enable them, with a third of the army, to make \"an Impression in force.\" In the end, a compromise was agreed in which 1,500 picked men{{efn|It was Washington's habit to pull the best troops out of their regiments and form them into elite, ad hoc light infantry battalions of picked men.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 26, 128</ref>}} would reinforce the [[vanguard]] to \"act as occasion may serve.\" To [[Lieutenant colonel|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], who attended as an aide, the council \"would have done honor to the most honorab[le] society of midwives, and to them only.\" A disappointed Washington sent the token force under the command of Brigadier General [[Charles Scott (governor)|Charles Scott]].<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\nSoon after the council adjourned, Wayne&nbsp;\u2013 who had refused to put his name to the compromise&nbsp;\u2013 Lafayette and Major General [[Nathanael Greene]] contacted Washington individually with the same plea for a stronger vanguard action supported by the main body, while still avoiding a major battle. Lafayette assured Washington that Steuben and Brigadier General [[Louis Leb\u00e8gue Duportail|Louis Duportail]] agreed, and told Washington it \"would be disgraceful for the leaders and humiliating for the troops to allow the enemy to cross the Jerseys with impunity.\" Greene emphasized the political aspect, advising Washington the public expected him to attack and that even if a limited attack did lead to a major battle, he thought their chances of success were good. It was all Washington, keen to erase the defeats of the previous year and prove his critics wrong, needed to hear. By the early hours of June 25 he had ordered Wayne to follow Scott with another 1,000 picked men. He wanted to do more than simply harass Clinton and, while still avoiding the risk of a major battle, hoped to inflict a heavy blow on the British, one that would surpass his success at the [[Battle of Trenton]] in 1776.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 175\u2013177</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 176\u2013177</ref>\n\n===Reining in Lafayette===\n[[File:Gilbert du Motier Marquis de Lafayette.PNG|thumb|left|Major General Lafayette|alt=Contemporary painting]]\nWashington offered Lee command of the vanguard, but Lee declined, stating the force was too small for a man of his rank and position.{{efn|According to Lender & Stone, the exact timing of Washington's offer to Lee to take command of the vanguard is not clear and may have come after the decision to send the additional troops under Wayne.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 178</ref> The historian [[John E. Ferling]] states it came before the decision.<ref name=Ferling177 />}} Washington appointed Lafayette instead, with orders to attack \"with the whole force of your command\" if the opportunity presented itself. Lafayette failed to establish full control of the disparate forces under his command, and in his haste to catch the British, he pushed his troops to breaking point and outran his supplies. Washington grew increasingly concerned, and on the morning of June 26 he warned Lafayette not to \"distress your men by an over hasty march.\" By that afternoon, Lafayette was at Robin's Tavern, where Clinton had stayed the previous night. He was within three miles of the British, too far away from the main army for it to support him, and his men were exhausted and hungry. He remained eager to fight and discussed with his officers a night march with the intention of striking Clinton the next morning.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 177\u2013180</ref>\n\nThat evening, Washington ordered Lafayette to leave Morgan and the militia behind as a screen and move to [[Englishtown, New Jersey|Englishtown]], where he would be back in range of both supplies and the main army.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 181\u2013182</ref>{{efn|As an indication of Lafayette's tenuous control over his command, Scott did not receive the orders to move to Englishtown. He continued on the assumption that the morning attack on Clinton was to proceed, and got to within a mile of what would have been a disastrous confrontation with the British before he finally learned that he was to withdraw.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 182</ref>}} By this time Lee, having realized Lafayette's force was more significant than he first thought, had changed his mind and requested command of it. Washington ordered Lee to take Scott's former brigade and the brigade of Brigadier General [[James Mitchell Varnum|James Varnum]], link up with Lafayette in Englishtown and take command of all advance forces. Greene took over command of Lee's wing of the main body.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 186\u2013189</ref>{{efn|The two brigades Lee took with him to Englishtown were severely under strength and together numbered only some 650 men.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 189</ref>}} By June 27, Lafayette was safely back in the fold with what was now Lee's vanguard of some 4,500 troops{{efn|Sources disagree on the exact size of Lee's vanguard.

Lee believed he had full discretion on whether and how to attack and called his own war council after Washington left. He intended to advance as soon as he knew Clinton was on the move, in the hope of catching the British rearguard when it was most vulnerable. In the absence of any intelligence about Clinton's intentions or the terrain, Lee believed it would be useless to form a precise plan of his own; he told his commanders only to be ready for action at short notice and follow his orders.<ref name=Ferling177 /><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 191\u2013193</ref> In response to a written order received from Washington in the early hours of June 28, Lee ordered Colonel [[William Grayson]] to take 700 men forward. They were to watch for any British move and, if one did occur, try and slow them to give the vanguard time to close the distance.<ref name=\"Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194\">Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194</ref>\n\nGrayson did not depart Englishtown until 06:00, an hour after news arrived that Clinton was on the move.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 198</ref> Both vanguard and main body broke camp immediately, and both were slow to move; the vanguard was delayed when brigades formed up in the wrong march order and the main body was slowed by its artillery train.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 236\u2013237</ref> At 07:00, Lee rode ahead to scout the situation for himself. Following some confusion when a militia rider erroneously reported the British were not withdrawing but preparing to attack, Lee learned that the British had begun moving at 02:00 and only a small party of infantry and cavalry remained in the area.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 238\u2013240</ref>\n\nClinton's first move had been to deploy the Queen's Rangers northwest of Monmouth Court House to cover the departure of the second division, scheduled for an hour later but delayed until 04:00. By 05:00, the first division had begun moving, and the last British troops left Monmouth Court House by 09:15, heading northeast on the road to [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown]]. Trailing the column was the rearguard, comprising a battalion of light infantry and a regiment of [[dragoon]]s which, with the Rangers, totaled 1,550\u20132,000 troops.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 249, 468</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 190</ref>\n\n===Advance to contact===\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - American vanguard attack.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Lee's attack on the British rearguard|alt=map]]\nThe first shots were exchanged around 08:00 in an entirely American skirmish between a small detachment of Rangers and Dickinson's militia. Grayson arrived just in time to deploy his troops in support of the militia near a bridge over a ravine and watch the Rangers withdraw.<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 240\u2013248</ref>{{efn|The Ranger detachment was operating well forward of the regiment's assigned position, having been ordered to chase down and capture a small party of rebels believed to have included Lafayette that had been spotted on a hill overlooking Monmouth Court House. It was in fact not Lafayette but Steuben, who, apparently oblivious to commotion he had caused, escaped with all but his hat, which ended up as a souvenir for the British.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 241\u2013245, 248</ref>}} The bridge was on the Englishtown\u2013Monmouth Court House road and spanned the Spotswood Middle Brook, one of three ravines bordered by marshy wetlands or 'morasses' that cut through what would soon become a battlefield. Other than by bridge, the ravines were negotiable with difficulty by infantry and not at all by artillery; any unit cut off on the wrong side or pinned up against them would find itself in grave danger. When Lee caught up with Grayson shortly after the skirmish, Dickinson, who still believed the British occupied Monmouth Court House in force, strongly urged him not to venture across the brook. With intelligence about British activity still contradictory, Lee lost an hour at the bridge. He did not advance until Lafayette arrived with the rest of the vanguard.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 250\u2013253</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 188\u2013189</ref>\n\nOnce the vanguard was concentrated at the bridge, Lee replaced Grayson with Wayne to command the approximately 550-man lead element, which comprised detachments led by Colonel [[Richard Butler (general)|Richard Butler]], Colonel [[Henry Jackson (general)|Henry Jackson]] and Grayson (returned to the command of his original composite battalion of Virginians), supported by four artillery.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 186, 195</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 253</ref> The vanguard advanced along the Englishtown road towards Monmouth Court House until it reached the junction with the road north to Foreman's Mill at around 09:30. Lee went forward with Wayne to reconnoiter Monmouth Court House, where they discovered the British rearguard. Estimating the British strength at some 2,000 men, Lee decided on a plan to hook round to their rear. He left Wayne with orders to fix the rearguard in place and returned to the rest of the vanguard to lead it on a left flanking maneuver. Lee's confidence crept into reports back to Washington that implied \"the certainty of success.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 253\u2013255, 261</ref>\n\nAfter Lee departed, Butler's detachment exchanged fire with mounted troops screening the rearguard, prompting the British to begin withdrawing to the northeast, towards the main column. In the subsequent pursuit, Wayne repulsed a charge by British dragoons and launched a feint against the British infantry, prompting the rearguard to halt and form up on a hill at the junction of the Middletown and [[Shrewsbury, New Jersey|Shrewsbury]] roads.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 255, 256, 258\u2013260</ref> Meanwhile, because Lee was leading the rest of the vanguard himself, he neglected to provide Scott and Maxwell with a detailed plan.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 256</ref> After a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on|spell=on|sp=us|0}} march, he emerged from some woods at around 10:30, in time to witness Wayne's troops in action to his left.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 261\u2013263</ref>\n\nWhen it became evident the British were present in considerably larger numbers than he had anticipated, Lee operated with Lafayette to secure what he considered to be a vulnerable right flank. On the left flank, the appearance of another British force 2,000\u20133,000 strong prompted Jackson to pull his regiment back from its isolated position on the banks of Spotswood North Brook.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 262\u2013264</ref> In the vanguard center, Scott and Maxwell, who was to Scott's left, were not in communication with Lee and not privy to his plan. They felt increasingly isolated watching Lee push out the right flank, and with British troops marching towards Monmouth Court House to their south, they became apprehensive about being cut off. They agreed between themselves to adjust their positions; Scott fell back a short distance southwest across the Spotswood Middle Brook to a more defensible position while Maxwell pulled back with the intention of circling round and coming up on Scott's right flank.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp.265\u2013266</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 199</ref>\n\nLee was dumbfounded when the two staff officers he had sent with orders for Scott returned with the news that he was nowhere to be found and disconcerted by their reports of the British returning in force. When he observed part of Lafayette's force retreating after a failed attempt to silence some British artillery, it appeared to Lee that the right flank too was pulling back without orders. It had become clear that he was losing control of the vanguard, and with his immediate command now only 2,500 strong, he realized his plan to envelop the British rearguard was finished. His priority now was the safety of his command in the face of superior numbers.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 266\u2013269</ref>\n\n===Counter-attack and retreat===\n[[File:Monmouth-map.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Contemporary map drawn by Lafayette's aide|alt=map]]\nAs soon as he received news that his rearguard was being probed, Clinton ordered Cornwallis to march the first division back towards Monmouth Court House. He believed Washington's main body was not close enough to come up in support and that the terrain would make it difficult for Lee to maneuver. He intended to do more than simply defend his baggage train; he thought the vanguard was vulnerable, and saw an opportunity to turn its right flank, just as Lee had feared, and destroy it.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 264\u2013265, 273</ref> After pausing at Monmouth Court House, Clinton began to push westwards. He formed his best troops into two columns, Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left and the guns of the [[Royal Artillery]] between them, while a regiment of dragoons ranged about them. The infantry of the 3rd and 4th Brigades followed in line, while the 5th Brigade remained in reserve at Monmouth Court House. The Queen's Rangers and the infantry of the rearguard operated on the British right flank. To the rear, a brigade of Hessian grenadiers remained in a defensive line to which Clinton could fall back if things went badly.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 273\u2013274, 275</ref> In total, his force comprised some 10,000 troops.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 265</ref>\n\nLee ordered a general retreat to a line about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} to the west of Monmouth Court House that ran from Craig's House, north of Spotswood Middle Brook, to Ker's House, south of the brook. He had significant difficulties communicating with his subordinates and exhausted his aides attempting to do so. Although he arrived in the vicinity of Ker's house with a sizeable force by noon, he was unable to exercise command and control of it as a unified organization. As disorganized as the retreat was for Lee, at unit level it was generally conducted with a discipline that did credit to Steuben's training. The Americans suffered only some one dozen casualties as they fell back, an indication of how little major fighting there was; there were no organized volleys by infantry [[musket]]s, and only the artillery engaged in any significant action.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 268\u2013272</ref> Lee believed he had conducted a model \"retrograde manoeuver in the face and under fire of an enemy\" and claimed his troops moved with \"order and precision.\"{{efn|There were some reports of disorder and poor discipline among the retreating troops, but at no stage was there any panic, and no unit broke. The artillery units were credited with exemplary spirit, and they in turn credited the infantry for protecting them at every stage.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 269, 271\u2013272</ref>}} He had remained calm during the retreat but began to unravel at Ker's house. When two of Washington's aides informed Lee that the main body was still some {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away and asked him what to report back, Lee replied \"that he really did not know what to say.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 270\u2013271</ref> Crucially, he failed to keep Washington informed of the retreat.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 178</ref>\n\nLee realized that a knoll in front of his lines would give the British, now deployed from column into line formation, command of the ground and render his position untenable. With no knowledge of the main body's whereabouts and believing he had little choice, Lee decided to fall back farther, across the Spotswood Middle Brook bridge. He believed he would be able to hold the British there from Perrine's Hill until the main body came up in support. With his aides out of action, Lee pressed whomever he could find into service as messengers to organize the withdrawal. It was during this period that he sent the army auditor, [[Major]] [[John Clark (spy)|John Clark]], to Washington with news of the retreat. But Washington was by now aware, having learned from Lee's troops who had already crossed the ravine.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 278\u2013281, 284</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 203</ref>\n\n===Washington's arrival===\nThe main body had reached Englishtown at 10:00, and by noon it was still some {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Monmouth Court House. Without any recent news from Lee, Washington had no reason to be concerned. At Tennent's Meeting House, some {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} east of Englishtown, he ordered Greene to take Brigadier General [[William Woodford]]'s brigade of some 550 men and 4 artillery pieces south then east to cover the right flank. The rest of the main body continued east along the Englishtown\u2013Monmouth Court House road. In the space of some ten minutes, Washington's confidence gave way to alarm as he encountered a straggler bearing the first news of Lee's retreat and then whole units in retreat. None of the officers Washington met could tell him where they were supposed to be going or what they were supposed to be doing. As the commander-in-chief rode on ahead, over the bridge and towards the front line, he saw the vanguard in full retreat but no sign of the British. At around 12:45, Washington found Lee marshalling the last of his command across the middle morass, marshy ground southeast of the bridge.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 281\u2013286</ref>\n\nExpecting praise for a retreat he believed had been generally conducted in good order, Lee was uncharacteristically lost for words when Washington asked without pleasantries, \"I desire to know, sir, what is the reason&nbsp;\u2013 whence arises this disorder and confusion?\"<ref name=Lender&Stone289>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 289</ref> When he regained his composure, Lee attempted to explain his actions. He blamed faulty intelligence and his officers, especially Scott, for pulling back without orders, leaving him no choice but to retreat in the face of a superior force, and reminded Washington that he had opposed the attack in the first place.<ref name=Lender&Stone289 /><ref name=Chernow448>Chernow 2010 p. 448</ref> Washington was not convinced; \"All this may be very true, sir,\" he replied, \"but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.\"<ref name=Lender&Stone289 /> Washington made it clear he was disappointed with Lee and rode off to organize the battle he felt his subordinate should have given. Lee followed at a distance, bewildered and believing he had been relieved of command.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 289\u2013290</ref>{{efn|According to Lender & Stone, the encounter between Washington and Lee \"became part of the folklore of the Revolution, with various witnesses (or would-be witnesses) taking increasing dramatic license with their stories over the years.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 290</ref> Ferling writes of eyewitness testimony in which a furious Washington, swearing \"till the leaves shook on the trees\" according to Scott, called Lee a \"damned poltroon\" and relieved him of command.<ref name=Ferling179 /> Chernow reports the same quote from Scott, quotes Lafayette to assert that a \"terribly excited\" Washington swore and writes that Washington \"banished [Lee] to the rear.\"<ref name=Chernow448 /> Bilby & Jenkins attribute the poltroon quote to Lafayette, then write that neither Scott nor Lafayette were present.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 205</ref> Lender & Stone are also skeptical, and assert that such stories are apocryphal nonsense which first appeared almost a half century or more after the event, that Scott was too far away to have heard what was said, and that Lee himself never accused Washington of profanity. According to Lender & Stone, \"careful scholarship has conclusively demonstrated that Washington was angry but not profane at Monmouth, and he never ordered Lee off the field.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 290\u2013291</ref>}}\n\nWith the main body still arriving and the British no more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away, Washington began to rally the vanguard to set up the very defenses Lee had been attempting to organize. The commander-in-chief directed Wayne to take three battalions and form a rearguard in the Point of Woods, south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, that could delay the British. He issued orders for the 2nd New Jersey Regiment and two smaller Pennsylvanian regiments to deploy on the slopes of Perrine's Hill, north of the brook overlooking the bridge; they would be the rallying point for the rest of the vanguard and the position on which the main body would form. Washington offered Lee a choice: remain and command the rearguard, or fall back to and organize the main body. Lee opted for the former and, as Washington departed to take care of the latter, promised he would \"be the last one to leave the field.\"<ref name=Ferling179>Ferling 2009 p. 179</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 291\u2013295</ref>\n\n===American rearguard action===\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - American rearguard.png|thumb|left|upright=2|American rearguard action|alt=map]]\nLee positioned himself with four guns supported by two infantry battalions on the crest of a hill to the right of Wayne. As the British advanced&nbsp;\u2013 Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left&nbsp;\u2013 they passed the Point of Woods, oblivious to the Continentals concealed in them. Wayne's troops inflicted up to forty casualties before the Guards, reacting as they were trained and with the support of the dragoons and some of the Grenadiers, crashed into the Americans at the charge. Within ten minutes, Wayne's three battalions were being chased back to the bridge. The rest of the Grenadiers, meanwhile, continued to advance on Lee's position, pushing the Continental artillery back to a hedgerow to which the two infantry battalions had already withdrawn. Another short, sharp fight ensued until Lee, seeing both flanks being turned, ordered his men to follow Wayne back across the bridge.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 298\u2013310</ref><ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 208\u2013209</ref>\n\nAs Lee and Wayne fought south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, Washington was deploying the main body on Perrine's Hill, northwest of the bridge across the brook. Stirling's wing had just taken up positions on the American left flank when its artillery started to engage troops of the British 3rd Brigade. Clinton had earlier ordered the brigade to move right, cross the brook and cut the vanguard's line of retreat at the bridge. After the infantry of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot]] crossed the brook, they ran into three battalions of Scott's detachment retreating westwards. Under pressure from the Highlanders, the Continentals continued through an orchard to the safety of Stirling's line while Stirling's artillery forced the Highlanders back to the orchard. A second battalion of Highlanders and the [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th Regiment of Foot]] that had swung right and crossed the Spotswood North Brook were also persuaded by the artillery to retreat. Even farther to the right, an attempt to outflank Stirling's position by the Queen's Rangers and the light infantry of the rearguard lacked the strength to carry it through, and they too fell back to join the 3rd Brigade.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 274\u2013276, 318</ref>\n\nAt 13:30, Lee was one of the last American officers to withdraw across Spotswood Middle Brook. The rearguard action had lasted no more than thirty minutes, enough time for Washington to complete the deployment of the main body. When a battalion of Grenadiers led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Henry Monckton]] chased Lee's troops over the bridge, the British found themselves facing Wayne's detachment reforming some {{convert|350|yd|m|sp=us|0}} away. As the Grenadiers advanced to engage Wayne they came under heavy fire from Stirling's artillery, another {{convert|350|yd|m|sp=us|0}} behind Wayne. Monckton became the highest-ranking British casualty of the day, and in the face of an unexpectedly strong enemy, the Grenadiers retreated back across the bridge to the hedgerow from which they had expelled Lee earlier.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 310\u2013314</ref>\n\nWashington had acted decisively to form a strong defensive position anchored on the right above the bridge on the Englishtown road and extending in a gentle curve {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} up the slope of Perrine's Hill. When Lee joined it, Washington sent him with two battalions of Maxwell's New Jersey Brigade, around half of Scott's detachment and some other units of the former vanguard to form a reserve at Englishtown. The rest of the vanguard, which included the other half of Scott's detachment and most of Wayne's, remained with Washington.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 296\u2013297, 315\u2013316</ref>{{efn|Shortly after Lee reached Englishtown, four brigades totaling some 2,200 fresh troops arrived, sent back by Washington from the main body, bringing the reserve's strength to over 3,000 men. Another arrival was Steuben, sent back by Washington to relieve Lee.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 316\u2013317, 348</ref>}} The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel across the {{convert|1,200|yd|m|sp=us|0}} of no-man's land either side of the brook, in which both sides suffered more casualties due to heat exhaustion than they did from enemy cannon.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 318, 320, 322\u2013324</ref>\n\n===British withdrawal===\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth - endgame.png|thumb|upright=2|British withdrawal and American attacks. The 1st Grenadier Battalion was left behind in the general withdrawal, and it was caught by Wayne's Pennsylvania Brigade as it moved south to link up with the 4th Brigade (not shown). The 33rd Regiment of the 4th Brigade came up in support, and together they forced the Pennsylvanians to retreat until Greene's artillery on Combs Hill forced the British to retreat in turn.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 344\u2013347</ref>|alt=map]]\nClinton had lost the initiative. He saw no prospect of success assaulting a strong enemy position in the brutal heat, and decided to break off the engagement.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 315, 331\u2013332</ref> His first task was to bring in his isolated right flank&nbsp;\u2013 the 3rd Brigade, Rangers and light infantry still sheltering in the orchard north of Spotswood Middle Brook. While the Highlanders of the 42nd Regiment remained in place to cover the withdrawal, the remainder fell back across the brook to join the Grenadiers at the hedgerow. Around 15:45, while the withdrawal was in progress, Greene arrived with Woodford's brigade at Combs Hill overlooking the British left flank and opened fire with his artillery. Clinton was forced to withdraw his own artillery, bringing the cannonade with Washington's guns on Perrine's Hill to an end, and move the Grenadiers to sheltered ground at the north end of the hedgerow.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 333\u2013335</ref>\n\nAt 16:30, Washington learned of 3rd Brigade's withdrawal and launched the first American offensive action in six hours. He ordered two battalions of picked men \"to go and see what [you] could do with the enemy's right wing.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 336\u2013337</ref> Only one battalion some 350 strong led by Colonel [[Joseph Cilley (state senator)|Joseph Cilley]] actually made it into action. Cilley made good use of cover along the Spotswood North Brook to close with and engage the 275\u2013325 troops of the 42nd Regiment in the orchard. The Highlanders found themselves in a disadvantageous position and, with the rest of British right flank already departed, they had no reason to stay. They conducted a fighting retreat in good order with minimal casualties. To the British, the rebels were \"unsuccessful in endeavouring to annoy.\" To the Americans, it was a significant psychological victory over one of the British Army's most feared regiments.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 335\u2013340</ref>\n\nAs his right flank pulled back, Clinton issued orders for what he intended to be a phased general withdrawal back towards Monmouth Court House.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 340</ref> His subordinates misunderstood. Instead of waiting until the 3rd Brigade had rejoined before pulling back, all but the 1st Grenadier Battalion withdrew immediately, leaving it and the 3rd Brigade dangerously exposed. Washington was buoyed by what he saw of Cilley's attack, and although he lacked specific intelligence about what the British were doing, the fact that their artillery had gone quiet suggested they might be vulnerable. He ordered Wayne to conduct an opportunistic advance with a detachment of Pennsylvanians.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 340\u2013341</ref>\n\nWayne's request for three brigades, some 1,300 men, was denied, and at 16:45 he crossed the bridge over Spotswood Middle Brook with just 400 troops of the Third Pennsylvania Brigade.{{efn|Wayne never forgave Major General [[Arthur St. Clair]], serving as an aide to Washington, for allowing only one brigade. Lender & Stone argue that St. Clair was acting on the authority of Washington, and that the modest size of the force is indicative of Washington's desire to avoid risking a substantial part of his army in a major action.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 341\u2013342</ref>}} The Pennsylvanians caught the 650\u2013700 men of the lone Grenadier battalion in the process of withdrawing, giving the British scant time to form up and receive the attack. The Grenadiers were \"losing men very fast\", Clinton wrote later, before the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment of Foot]] arrived with 300\u2013350 men to support them. The British pushed back, and the Pennsylvanian Brigade began to disintegrate as it retreated to Parsonage farm. The longest infantry battle of the day ended when the Continental artillery on Combs Hill stopped the British counter-attack in its tracks and forced the Grenadiers and infantry to withdraw.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 341\u2013347</ref>{{efn|According to [[Edward G. Lengel]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Aaron Burr]] led the Pennsylvanian Brigade attack, not Wayne.<ref>Lengel 2005 p. 303</ref> Lengel also writes that around the same time, a column of Guards and Grenadiers led by Cornwallis made an unsuccessful attack on Greene's position at Combs Hill, a claim also made in William Stryker's account of the battle, but Lender and Stone assert that such an attack was never ordered.<ref>Lengel 2005 pp. 303\u2013304</ref><ref>Stryker 1927 pp. 211\u2013213, cited in Lender & Stone 2016 p. 531</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 531</ref>}}\n\nWashington planned to resume the battle the next day, and at 18:00 he ordered four brigades he had previously sent back to the reserve at Englishtown to return. When they arrived, they took over Stirling's positions on Perrine's Hill, allowing Stirling to advance across the Spotswood Middle Brook and take up new positions near the hedgerow. An hour later, Washington ordered a reinforced brigade commanded by Brigadier General [[Enoch Poor]] to probe Clinton's right flank while Woodford's brigade was to drop down from Combs Hill and probe Clinton's left flank. Their cautious advance was halted by sunset before making contact with the British, and the two armies settled down for the night within {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} of each other, the closest British troops at Ker's House.<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 347\u2013349</ref>\n\nWhile the battle was raging, Knyphausen had led the baggage train to safety. His second division endured only light harassment from militia along the way, and eventually set up camp some {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} from Middletown. With the baggage train secure, Clinton had no intention of resuming the battle. At 23:00, he began withdrawing his troops. The first division slipped away unnoticed by Washington's forward troops and, after an overnight march, linked back up with Knyphausen's second division between 08:00 and 09:00 the next morning.<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 349\u2013352</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth (NYPL b13075520-422191) cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle of Monmouth|alt=Scan of engraving]]\nOn June 29, Washington withdrew his army to Englishtown, where they rested the next day. The British were in a strong position near Middletown, and their route to Sandy Hook was secure. They completed the march largely untroubled by a militia that considered the threat to have passed and had melted away to tend to crops. The last British troops embarked on naval transports on July 6, and the Royal Navy carried Clinton's army to New York. The timing was fortuitous for the British; on July 11, a superior French fleet commanded by Vice Admiral [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing]] anchored off Sandy Hook.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 354\u2013355, 372\u2013373, 378\u2013379</ref>\n\nThe battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side dealt a heavy blow to the other, and the Continental Army remained in the field while the British Army redeployed to New York, just as both would have if the battle had never been fought.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xiii, 382</ref>{{efn|Bilby and Jenkins write that the two armies \"fought to a standstill\" at Monmouth and characterize a British defeat in terms of the wider strategic situation.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 233\u2013234</ref> [[Willard Sterne Randall]] considers the fact that the British left the battlefield to Washington to be \"technically the sign of a victory\".<ref>Randall 1997 p. 359</ref> Chernow bases his conclusion that the battle ended in \"something close to a draw\" on conservative estimates of casualties.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 451</ref> David G.

Washington counted some 250 British dead, a figure later revised to a little over 300. Using a typical 18th-century wounded-to-killed ratio of no more than four to one and assuming no more than 160 British dead caused by enemy fire, Lender and Stone calculate the number of wounded could have been up to 640. A [[Monmouth County Historical Association]] study estimates total British casualties at 1,134&nbsp;\u2013 comprising 304 dead, 770 wounded and 60 prisoners. Washington reported his own casualties to be 370&nbsp;\u2013 comprising 69 dead, 161 wounded and 140 missing. Using the same wounded-to-killed ratio and assuming a proportion of the missing were fatalities, Lender and Stone estimate Washington's casualties could have exceeded 500.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 366\u2013369</ref><ref>Martin 1993 pp. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\n===Claims of victory===\nIn his post-battle report to Lord [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|George Germain]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], Clinton claimed he had conducted a successful operation to redeploy his army in the face of a superior force. The counter-attack was, he reported, a diversion intended to protect the baggage train and was ended on his own terms, though in private correspondence he conceded that he had also hoped to inflict a decisive defeat on Washington.<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 232</ref> Having marched his army through the heart of enemy territory without the loss of a single wagon, he congratulated his officers on the \"long and difficult retreat in the face of a greatly superior army without being tarnished by the smallest affront.\" While some of his officers showed a grudging respect for the Continental Army, their doubts were rooted not in the battlefield but in the realisation that the entry of France into the conflict had swung the strategic balance against Great Britain.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xii, 375\u2013378</ref>\n\nFor Washington, the battle was fought at a time of serious misgivings about his effectiveness as commander-in-chief, and it was politically important for him to present it as a victory.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xiii\u2013xiv, 382\u2013383</ref> On July 1, in his first significant communication to Congress from the front since the disappointments of the previous year, he wrote a full report of the battle. The contents were measured but unambiguous in claiming a significant win, a rare occasion on which the British had left the battlefield and their wounded to the Americans. Congress received it enthusiastically and voted a formal thanks to Washington and the army to honor \"the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.\"<ref>Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 349, 353, 383\u2013384</ref>\n\nIn their accounts of the battle, Washington's officers invariably wrote of a major victory, and some took the opportunity to finally put an end to criticism of Washington; Hamilton and Lieutenant Colonel [[John Laurens]], another of Washington's aides, wrote to influential friends&nbsp;\u2013 in the case of Laurens, his father [[Henry Laurens|Henry]], [[President of the Continental Congress]]&nbsp;\u2013 praising Washington's leadership. The American press portrayed the battle as a triumph with Washington at its center. Governor [[William Livingston]] of New Jersey, who never came any nearer to Monmouth Court House during the campaign than [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], almost {{convert|25|mi|km|spell=on|sp=us|0}} away, published an anonymous 'eyewitness' account in the ''New Jersey Gazette'' only days after the battle, in which he credited the victory to Washington. Articles were still being published in a similar vein in August.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 309, 384\u2013389</ref>\n\nCongressional delegates who were not Washington partisans, such as [[Samuel Adams]] and [[James Lovell (Continental Congress)|James Lovell]], were reluctant to credit Washington but obliged to recognize the importance of the battle and keep to themselves any questions they might have had about the British success in reaching New York. The Washington loyalist [[Elias Boudinot]] wrote that \"none dare to acknowledge themselves his Enemies.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 386</ref> Washington's supporters were emboldened in defending his reputation; in July, Major General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] challenged Conway, the officer at the center of what Washington had perceived to be a conspiracy to remove him as commander-in-chief, to a duel in Philadelphia in which Conway was wounded in the mouth. [[Thomas McKean]], chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, was perhaps the only congressional delegate to register his disapproval of the affair, but did not think it wise to bring Cadwalader up before the court to answer for it.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 387\u2013388</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 423</ref> Faith in Washington had been restored, Congress became almost deferential to him, public criticism of him all but ceased and for the first time he was hailed as the Father of his Country.

But on June 30, after protesting his innocence to all who would listen, Lee wrote an insolent letter to Washington in which he blamed \"dirty earwigs\" for turning Washington against him, claimed his decision to retreat had saved the day and pronounced Washington to be \"guilty of an act of cruel injustice\" towards him. Instead of the apology Lee was tactlessly seeking, Washington replied that the tone of Lee's letter was \"highly improper\" and that he would initiate an official inquiry into Lee's conduct.

Only the duel with Laurens actually transpired, during which Lee was wounded. In 1780, he sent such an obnoxious letter to Congress that it terminated his service with the army. He died in 1782.<ref>Ferling 2009 pp. 180\u2013181</ref><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 400\u2013401</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 455</ref> Lee's place in history was further tarnished in the 1850s when [[George Henry Moore (author)|George H. Moore]], the librarian at the [[New-York Historical Society]], discovered a manuscript dated March 29, 1777, written by Lee while he was the guest of the British as a prisoner of war. It was addressed to the \"Royal Commissioners\", i.e. Lord [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] and Richard's brother, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], respectively the British naval and army commanders in North America at the time, and detailed a plan by which the British might defeat the rebellion. Moore's discovery, presented in a paper titled ''The Treason of Charles Lee'' in 1858, influenced perceptions of Lee for decades. Although most modern scholars reject the idea that Lee was guilty of treason, it is given credence in some accounts, examples being Randall's account of the battle in ''George Washington: A Life'', published in 1997, and Dominick Mazzagetti's ''Charles Lee: Self Before Country'', published in 2013.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 111\u2013112</ref><ref>Randall 1997 p. 358</ref><ref>Mazzagetti 2013 p. xi</ref>}}\n\n===Assessing the Continental Army===\nJoseph Bilby and Katherine Jenkins consider the battle to have marked the \"coming of age\" of a Continental Army that had previously achieved success only in small actions at Trenton and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]].<ref>Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 233, 237</ref> Their view is reflected by [[Joseph Ellis]], who writes of Washington's belief that \"the Continental Army was now a match for British professionals and could hold its own in a conventional, open-field engagement.\"<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 120</ref> Mark Lender and Garry Stone point out that while the Continental Army was unquestionably improved under Steuben's tutelage, the battle did not test its ability to meet a professional European army in European-style warfare in which brigades and divisions maneuvered against each other. The only army to mount any major offensive operation on the day was British; the Continental Army fought a largely defensive battle from cover, and a significant portion of it remained out of the fray on Perrine's Hill. The few American attacks, such as Cilley's, were small-unit actions.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 405\u2013406</ref>\n\nSteuben's influence was apparent in the way the rank and file conducted themselves. Half of the troops who marched onto the battlefield at Monmouth in June were new to the army, having been recruited only since January. The significant majority of Lee's vanguard comprised ad hoc battalions filled with men picked from numerous regiments. Without any inherent unit cohesion, their effectiveness depended on officers and men who had never before served together using and following the drills they had been taught. That they did so competently was demonstrated throughout the battle, in the advance to contact, Wayne's repulse of the dragoons, the orderly retreat in the face of a strong counter-attack and Cilley's attack on the Highlanders. The army was well served too by the artillery, which earned high praise from Washington.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 407\u2013408</ref> The professional conduct of the American troops gained widespread recognition even among the British; Clinton's secretary wrote, \"the Rebels stood much better than ever they did\", and Brigadier General Sir [[Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet|William Erskine]], who as commander of the light infantry had traded blows with the Continentals, characterized the battle as a \"handsome flogging\" for the British, adding, \"We had not receiv'd such an one in America.\"<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 375, 405</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Battle of Monmouth Monument at Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|A {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on|sp=us}} tall monument to the battle in front of the [[Monmouth County Courthouse]] in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]]]]\nIn keeping with a battle that was more politically than militarily significant, the first reenactment in 1828 was staged to support the presidential candidacy of [[Andrew Jackson]]. In another attempt to reenact the battle in 1854, the weather added an authentic touch to the proceedings and the reenactment was called off due to the excessive heat. As the battle receded into history so too did its brutality, to be replaced by a sanitized romanticism. The public memory of the fighting was populated with dramatic images of heroism and glory, as epitomized by [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s ''Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth''. The transformation was aided by the inventiveness of 19th-century historians, none more creative than Washington's step-grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], whose account of the battle was as artistic as Leutze's painting. Custis was inevitably derogatory towards Lee, and Lee's calumny achieved an orthodoxy in such works as [[Washington Irving]]'s ''Life of George Washington'' (1855\u20131859) and [[George Bancroft]]'s ''History of the United States of America, from the Discovery of the American Continent'' (1854\u20131878). The role Lee had unsuccessfully advanced for the militia in the revolution was finally established in the poetic 19th-century popular narrative, in which the Continental Army was excised from the battle and replaced with patriotic citizen-soldiers.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 429\u2013436</ref>\n\nThe battlefield remained largely undisturbed until 1853, when the [[Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad]] opened a line that cut through the Point of Woods, across the Spotswood Middle Brook and through the Perrine estate. The area became popular with tourists, and the Parsonage, the site of Wayne's desperate battle with the Grenadiers and the 33rd Regiment, was a favourite attraction until it was demolished in 1860.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 432\u2013433</ref> During the 19th century, forests were cleared and marshes drained, and by the early 20th century traditional agriculture had been replaced by orchards and [[Market garden|truck farms]].<ref name=brochure>{{cite web |url=https://njparksandforests.org/parks/maps/monbat-brochure-map.pdf |title=Monmouth Battlefield Brochure and Map |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection |access-date=April 14, 2019 }}</ref> In 1884, the Monmouth Battle Monument was dedicated outside the modern-day county courthouse in Freehold, near where Wayne's troops first brushed with the British rearguard.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 p. 437</ref> In the mid 20th century, two battlefield farms were sold to builders, but before the land could be developed, lobbying by state officials, Monmouth County citizens, the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Monmouth County Chapter of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] succeeded in initiating a program of preservation. In 1963, the first tract of battlefield land came under state ownership with the purchase of a 200-acre farm. The [[Monmouth Battlefield State Park]] was dedicated on the bicentennial of the battle in 1978 and a new visitor center was opened in 2013. By 2015, the park encompassed over 1,800 acres, incorporating most of the land on which the afternoon battle was fought. The state park helped restore a more realistic interpretation of the history of the battle to the public memory, and the Continental Army takes its rightful place in the annual reenactments staged every June.<ref name=brochure /><ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 438\u2013439</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://njparksandforests.org/parks/monbat.html |title=Monmouth Battlefield State Park |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection |access-date=April 14, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Legend of Molly Pitcher===\n{{main|Molly Pitcher}}\nFive days after the battle, a surgeon treating the wounded reported a patient's story of a woman who had taken her husband's place working a gun after he was incapacitated. Two accounts attributed to veterans of the battle that surfaced decades later also speak of the actions of a woman during the battle; in one she supplied ammunition to the guns, in the other she brought water to the crews. The story gained prominence during the 19th century and became embellished as the legend of [[Molly Pitcher]]. The woman behind Molly Pitcher is most often identified as Mary Hays, whose husband William served with the Pennsylvania State Artillery, but it is likely that the legend is an amalgam of more than one woman seen on the battlefield that day; it was not unusual for [[camp followers]] to assist in 18th-century battles, though more plausibly in carrying ammunition and water than crewing the guns. Late 20th-century research identified a site near Stirling's artillery line as the location of a well from which the legendary Molly drew water, and a historic marker was placed there in 1992.<ref>Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 326\u2013330</ref><ref>Martin 1993 pp. 228\u2013229</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Revolutionary War}}\n*[[List of American Revolutionary War battles]]\n*[[New Jersey in the American Revolution]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Adelberg |first=Michael S. |title=The American Revolution in Monmouth County: The Theatre of Spoil and Destruction |publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, South Carolina |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-61423-263-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Bilby |first1=Joseph G. |last2=Jenkins |first2=Katherine Bilby |lastauthoramp=y |title=Monmouth Court House: The Battle That Made the American Army |location=Yardley, Pennsylvania |publisher=Westholme Publishing |isbn=978-1-59416-108-7 |year=2010 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=E-Book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene.

Chloroquine then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion.

They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene.

Depending on the scope of the operation, a plantation's size may vary from a small family farm operation to a corporate facility encompassing large tracts of land, multiple physical plants, and many employees.\n\nProduction-related activities on a plantation may include cultivating and harvesting the fruit, transporting the picked bunches to a packing shed, hanging to ripen in large bunches, dividing large bunches into smaller market-friendly bunches, sorting, labeling, washing, drying, packing, boxing, storing, refrigeration, shipping, and marketing. Depending on the scope of the operation, other activities may include drying, food preparation, tourism, and market research.<ref name=\"Elevitch 2006 1\"/>\n\n===Soil===\nBananas will grow and fruit under poor soil conditions but will be less productive without deep, well-drained soil; forest loam, rocky sand, marl, red laterite, volcanic ash, sandy clay, or even heavy clay. The key element in soil type for successful banana plant growth is good drainage. Alluvial soils of river valleys are ideal for banana growing. Bananas prefer an acid soil.<ref>Morton, J. 1987.

Morton, Miami, FL.</ref>\n\n===Physical plant===\n[[File:Big banana.JPG|thumb|left|The Big Banana - A tourist facility on an [[Australia]]n banana plantation.]]\nPhysical plants on banana plantations, aside from growing fields, may include facilities or machinery for plant propagation, cultivation, labor housing, fertilization and pest mitigation, harvesting assists such as tractors or overhead cable systems, washing tanks, storage buildings, boxing or bagging, shipping docks, offices, [[public relations]]/[[tourism]], and general maintenance.\n\nCultivation techniques specific to the type of banana produced may dictate the specific physical plant makeup. Much of banana cultivation since the mid-1950s has centered around a single [[monoculture]]: The [[Cavendish banana]].

As a result, farmers face difficulties to go back to normalcy and sustain their life. There are various strategies developed so far to revitalize flood degraded soil. However, most of the strategies require higher initial investment and/or take longer time to restore due to which farmers are unable to generate income as before.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://answers.practicalaction.org/our-resources/item/banana-farming-in-flood-deposited-sandy-soil|title=Banana farming in flood deposited sandy soil|website=answers.practicalaction.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==== Method of establishing banana orchard in flood deposited sandy soil ====\n[[Banana]] can be grown in variety of soil. However, while planting in flood prone area and sand deposited soil, regular management practice should be slightly amended. If sand deposition is above 0.5 m and the area gets inundate for longer duration (more than 2-3 days) during monsoon, then such site should not be considered for banana plantation. These are the necessary things to be considered in each step of banana farming in flood affected area:\n\nI. Variety selection \n\nIn flood affected areas, there is always a high chance of banana plant being submerged in flood during monsoon. If it is fully submerged for more than two days, plant can eventually die. Therefore tall variety plants with deep root system should be planted in such areas. In Nepal, people usually grow malbhog variety of banana in the areas which are prone to annual flood but are not inundate for longer than three days. Malbhog variety grows up to the height of 5 m and root goes down to more than 1 m deep into the soil. Production is quiet lower compared to hybrid varieties but fetch good market price because of its taste.\n\nII. Propagation material \n\nIn Nepal, banana is propagated exclusively using suckers. Suckers are lateral shoot that develops from the rhizome near the mother plant and are categorically of two types, sword sucker and water sucker. Generally, sword suckers are preferred over water suckers as the plant developed from water suckers are weak and take longer to bear fruits. Sword suckers can be easily distinguished because of its well developed base with narrow sword shaped blades at the early stages. Two to four months old suckers from healthy and high yielding mother plant should be selected for [[Plant propagation|propagation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://floodresilience.net/resources/item/banana-farming-in-flood-deposited-sandy-soil|title=Banana farming in flood deposited sandy soil - Flood Resilience Portal|website=floodresilience.net|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIII. Planting method \n\nBanana suckers are usually planted in a 0.2 to 0.25 m furrow or pit of size 0.6x0.6x0.6&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> at a depth of 0.3 m. But in flood affected areas, suckers should be planted in a pit of size more or less equal to 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>. The pit is filled with mixture of topsoil and farmyard manure at a 1:1 ratio and sucker is planted at 0.5 to 0.75&nbsp;m depth depending upon the height of sand above original ground level. A total of 2 x 3 m spacing should be maintained between the plants.\n\nIV. Crop management \n\n[[Intensive crop farming|Crop management]] begins with the planting, continues with crop maintenance during growth and development, and ends with crop harvest, storage and distribution. For good harvest, crop management strategy should be contextualized based on the soil type, topography, climate and availability and affordability of inputs.\n\n==Social aspects==\n===Early benefits in tribal/clanship culture===\nCertain [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[clan]]ships benefited from early development of intensive banana cultivation by expanding previously territorial land views into concepts of [[cooperative]] inter-clan trading relationships.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Kodesh\n  | first = Neil\n  | title = Networks of knowledge: clanship and collective well-being in buganda\n  | journal = The Journal of African History\n  | volume = 11\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 39\u201372\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n  | location = United Kingndom\n  | date = 2008-07-01\n  | doi = 10.1017/S0021853708003629 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Schoenbrun\n  | first = David L.\n  | title = Cattle herds and banana gardens: the historical geography of the western Great Lakes region, ca AD 800\u20131500\n  | journal = African Archaeological Review\n  | volume = 20\n  | pages = 75\u201383\n  | date = 2008-02-08}}\n</ref>\n\n===Labor conditions===\nLabor conditions in the banana industry have historically drawn attention both in criticism of the traditionally poor industry [[working conditions]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mlot | first1 = Christine | year = 2004 | title = Greening the World's Most Popular Fruit | url = | journal = National Wildlife | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 18\u201319 }}</ref> and more recently in attempts by labor advocacy groups and some producers to improve labor conditions.<ref>http://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/research/researchcentres/CGLR/events/09012008.html</ref>\n\nWorkers on banana plantations in [[Central America]] have been exposed to [[pesticides]] which have been found to cause various health conditions including [[Infertility|sterility]]. Banana industry advocates maintain that exposure levels were too low to produce health issues, but juries in the [[U.S.|United States]] found [[Dole Food Company]] guilty of specific cases of worker sterility related to pesticide exposure in the late 1970s. One successful lawsuit presented evidence that Dole continued to use the pesticide [[DBCP]] on banana plantations in [[Nicaragua]] after the agent was found by the manufacturer to cause health problems and was banned in California in 1977. The jury found the chemical manufacturer, [[Dow Chemical]], 20% liable and Dole 80% liable because Dow had warned Dole of the dangers of [[aerial spraying]] in the presence of workers, yet evidence presented in court indicated Dole continued using the agent in close proximity to workers on its Nicaraguan banana plantations. Financial liability in the case was later stricken because of international jurisdiction issues, however the finding of culpability by the jury was left intact.<ref>{{cite court\n  |litigants=Tellez et al. v.

In 2004, banana producing countries totaled 130. Production, as well as exports and imports of bananas, are nonetheless concentrated in a few equatorial countries. 75% of total banana production in 2004 was generated in 10 counties. [[India]], Ecuador, [[Brazil]] and [[China]] produced half of total bananas. [[Latin American]] and [[Caribbean]] countries led banana production up to the 1980s, and Asian nations took the lead in banana production during the 1990s.

Depending on the scope of the operation, a plantation's size may vary from a small family farm operation to a corporate facility encompassing large tracts of land, multiple physical plants, and many employees.\n\nProduction-related activities on a plantation may include cultivating and harvesting the fruit, transporting the picked bunches to a packing shed, hanging to ripen in large bunches, dividing large bunches into smaller market-friendly bunches, sorting, labeling, washing, drying, packing, boxing, storing, refrigeration, shipping, and marketing. Depending on the scope of the operation, other activities may include drying, food preparation, tourism, and market research.<ref name=\"Elevitch 2006 1\"/>\n\n===Soil===\nBananas will grow and fruit under poor soil conditions but will be less productive without deep, well-drained soil; forest loam, rocky sand, marl, red laterite, volcanic ash, sandy clay, or even heavy clay. The key element in soil type for successful banana plant growth is good drainage. Alluvial soils of river valleys are ideal for banana growing. Bananas prefer an acid soil.<ref>Morton, J. 1987. Fruits of warm climates, p. 29\u201346, Julia F. Morton, Miami, FL.</ref>\n\n===Physical plant===\n[[File:Big banana.JPG|thumb|left|The Big Banana - A tourist facility on an [[Australia]]n banana plantation.]]\nPhysical plants on banana plantations, aside from growing fields, may include facilities or machinery for plant propagation, cultivation, labor housing, fertilization and pest mitigation, harvesting assists such as tractors or overhead cable systems, washing tanks, storage buildings, boxing or bagging, shipping docks, offices, [[public relations]]/[[tourism]], and general maintenance.\n\nCultivation techniques specific to the type of banana produced may dictate the specific physical plant makeup. Much of banana cultivation since the mid-1950s has centered around a single [[monoculture]]: The [[Cavendish banana]]. The ravages of [[Fusarium oxysporum|Panama Disease]] in that particular [[cultivar]] may cause a shift in variety selection, subsequently causing a major change in the physical plant structure of banana plantations.<ref>Interview.

Banana industry advocates maintain that exposure levels were too low to produce health issues, but juries in the [[U.S.|United States]] found [[Dole Food Company]] guilty of specific cases of worker sterility related to pesticide exposure in the late 1970s. One successful lawsuit presented evidence that Dole continued to use the pesticide [[DBCP]] on banana plantations in [[Nicaragua]] after the agent was found by the manufacturer to cause health problems and was banned in California in 1977. The jury found the chemical manufacturer, [[Dow Chemical]], 20% liable and Dole 80% liable because Dow had warned Dole of the dangers of [[aerial spraying]] in the presence of workers, yet evidence presented in court indicated Dole continued using the agent in close proximity to workers on its Nicaraguan banana plantations. Financial liability in the case was later stricken because of international jurisdiction issues, however the finding of culpability by the jury was left intact.<ref>{{cite court\n  |litigants=Tellez et al. v.

Boulogne had a high and low town, and the citadel of Boulogne was in the low town adjacent to the harbour near the mouth of the river Liane. To the north a Roman lighthouse called the 'Old Man' was fortified, and a new fort built between the Old Man and Boulogne in 1545 was called the 'Young Man.' The surveyor of these works was John Rogers who had been a master mason. The military engineer [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Richard Lee]] and [[Thomas Palmer (died 1553)|Thomas Palmer]], treasurer of [[Gu\u00eenes]], brought additional instructions directly from Henry VIII.  Another outlying fort was built on a hill to east from May 1546. Now called Mont Lambert, it was then called Boulemberg. However, Nicolas Arnold, the captain of Boulogne complained of its shortcomings; it held no well, or room for storage. It was abandoned in 1549 on the approach of a French army. The French fortified south of the Liane, building the Fort de Ch\u00e2tillon and Fort d'[[Outreau]]. The building of any new fortifications was supposed to have ceased under the Treaty of Camp (or Treaty of Ardres) made in June 1546. The treaty provided that the English would evacuate Boulogne in 1554 in return for 2,000,000 [[Crown (British coin)|crowns]].<ref>Colvin, Howard, ed., ''History of the King's Works'', vol. 3 part 1, (1975) 383\u2013393.</ref> The English possession of Boulogne was eventually compromised by the French construction of a fort at [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]], north of the town, which could blockade supplies.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 274 & note.</ref> Although records are incomplete, it is clear that large numbers of English labourers died or became sick during the works.

Most of their wheels and stocks were said to be rotten and decayed. The totals were; 4 cannons; 5 demi-cannons; 10 [[culverin]]s; 14 demi-culverins; 18 [[Saker (cannon)|sakers]]; 21 falcons, falconets, and chamber falcons; 25 great brass mortars; 19 small brass mortars; 9 iron mortars; 3 iron bombards; 3 iron cannon-perrier; 16 port-pieces; 24 [[Veuglaire|fowlers]]; 7 slings; 12 [[Breech-loading swivel guns|double bases]]; 54 shrimp bases; 114 privy bases; 2 robinets; and 73 [[Arquebus|brass hagbuts]]. The guns were in four positions; the Old Man; High Boulogne; Base Boulogne; and the Boulemberg (Mont Lambert).<ref>Starkey, David, ed., ''Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries (1998), 132, no. 6170-6188.</ref> When Boulogne was returned to France in March 1550, Edward VI noted that the guns too would be handed over. These included recently captured pieces and; 2 basilisks; 2 demi-cannon; 3 culverins; 2 demi-culverins; 3 sakers; 16 falcons; 94 arquebus a croc with wooden tails (muskets for fixed positions); and 21 iron guns.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966), 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Continuing conflict===\nThere was a truce between the French and English at Boulogne according to a treaty made between [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Francis I of France]] in March 1547.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign Edward VI'', (1861), 10, noted only; see ''Foedera'', vol. 15, (1725), 135, Latin.</ref> In June 1547, an international dispute arose over a wall the English were building at the harbour. The French claimed it was a new fortification in breach of truce under the Treaty of Camp, while the English maintained that it was merely a sea wall to protect the haven. In the diplomacy, this dispute was connected with arguments over English and French intentions and intervention at [[St Andrews Castle]] in Scotland.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 505\u20136, 511, 513, 522.</ref> In the summer of 1548, the French observed the [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] was provided with a flanker and cannon; the English insisted it was merely to protect the workmen. French ships fired at it and the English returned fire.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Foreign'', Edward VI, (1861), 352, Calais Papers 10 August 15498.</ref> [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] told [[Fran\u00e7ois van der Delft]] that the French were constructing forts at Boulogne in contravention of treaty in September 1548; in December the French managed to destroy two new outposts the English were building, and another fort nearer to [[Gu\u00eenes]] and Calais called Fort Fiennes.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish,'' vol. 9 (1912), 291, 326.</ref>\n\nA major attempt on Boulogne by the French was repulsed in May 1549. The Imperial ambassador, [[Simon Renard]], reported a failed assault on the fort at Boulemberg, or Mount Lambert. The French leader, [[Gaspard II de Coligny]], sieur de Ch\u00e2tillon, a nephew of the [[Anne de Montmorency|Constable of France]], set ladders against the fort at 2:00am but the alarm was sounded by members of the garrison who he believed he had successfully bribed. 200 French were killed. The English suspected treachery as four guns blew up on their first firing and around seventy men were absent without leave. The womenfolk in the fort were said to have saved the day. Some laughed at Ch\u00e2tillon, saying he had made his scaling ladders too short, although the action was well-conceived as the fort was crucial to the defence of the town. Moreover, the action was said to be in breach of treaty.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 373, 376\u2013377.</ref>\n\nEdward VI recorded this night assault in his chronicle, with a failed attempt to burn the ships in the harbour. In the summer, Coligny bombarded the pier with a battery of 20,000 shot, and blockaded the mouth of the haven with artillery. The English overran this artillery position and the French set up another which was less commanding. An attempt to foul the harbour with a hulk laden with stones also failed to inconvenience the English garrison.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966),12, 16.</ref>\n\n===English withdrawal===\nAlthough by the Treaty of Camp, the English had agreed to evacuate Boulogne in 1554, the town was returned to France in 1550 under the Treaty of Boulogne which also concluded the [[The Rough Wooing|war of Rough Wooing]] in Scotland. Simon Renard reported that the English captain accepted his order to surrender from the [[Privy Council]] with a sigh. [[Henry II of France]] formally entered the town on 16 May 1550. He stayed three days and visited the forts of the Boulemberg, [[Ambleteuse]], the Tower of [[Ardres]], the Great Fort and Fort Ch\u00e2tillon (also called Ch\u00e2tillon's garden). He was impressed with some of these recent fortification works and also with the English scheme for bringing freshwater to the town. Henry II determined to continue building the English [[star fort]] at Ambleteuse and the neighbouring work at [[Cap Gris Nez|Blackness]]. The French also admired the mole, which they called 'la Dunette,' and when completed Henry II compared it to a Roman work.<ref>de Rosny, A., ''M\u00e9moires de la societ\u00e9 acad\u00e9mique de Boulogne'' vol. 27, 'Documents in\u00e9dits, concernant les si\u00e8ges de Boulogne, 1548\u20131549' (1912), 533: quoted ''HKW'' (1975), 390.</ref> The [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne]], destroyed or badly damaged by the English, was to be rebuilt, Henry II gave the church a silver statue of Our Lady, and other nobles subscribed money.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 10, (1914) 92\u201393, 24 May 1550.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1544 Siege of Boulogne by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was depicted in the 4th season of the television series ''[[The Tudors]]''.\n\n==Citations==\n{{Portal|Italy|War}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Arnold, Thomas F.

Of 1,200 men sent in January 1545, only 300 were still working in June.<ref>History of the King's Works, vol. 3 part 1 (1975), 392 citing ''Letters & Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 20 part 1, nos. 121, 925.</ref>\n\n===Armoury===\nThe guns of Boulogne were listed in the [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of English crown possessions]] taken after Henry VIII's death on 28 January 1547. Most of their wheels and stocks were said to be rotten and decayed. The totals were; 4 cannons; 5 demi-cannons; 10 [[culverin]]s; 14 demi-culverins; 18 [[Saker (cannon)|sakers]]; 21 falcons, falconets, and chamber falcons; 25 great brass mortars; 19 small brass mortars; 9 iron mortars; 3 iron bombards; 3 iron cannon-perrier; 16 port-pieces; 24 [[Veuglaire|fowlers]]; 7 slings; 12 [[Breech-loading swivel guns|double bases]]; 54 shrimp bases; 114 privy bases; 2 robinets; and 73 [[Arquebus|brass hagbuts]]. The guns were in four positions; the Old Man; High Boulogne; Base Boulogne; and the Boulemberg (Mont Lambert).<ref>Starkey, David, ed., ''Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries (1998), 132, no. 6170-6188.</ref> When Boulogne was returned to France in March 1550, Edward VI noted that the guns too would be handed over. These included recently captured pieces and; 2 basilisks; 2 demi-cannon; 3 culverins; 2 demi-culverins; 3 sakers; 16 falcons; 94 arquebus a croc with wooden tails (muskets for fixed positions); and 21 iron guns.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966), 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Continuing conflict===\nThere was a truce between the French and English at Boulogne according to a treaty made between [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Francis I of France]] in March 1547.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Foreign Edward VI'', (1861), 10, noted only; see ''Foedera'', vol. 15, (1725), 135, Latin.</ref> In June 1547, an international dispute arose over a wall the English were building at the harbour. The French claimed it was a new fortification in breach of truce under the Treaty of Camp, while the English maintained that it was merely a sea wall to protect the haven. In the diplomacy, this dispute was connected with arguments over English and French intentions and intervention at [[St Andrews Castle]] in Scotland.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 505\u20136, 511, 513, 522.</ref> In the summer of 1548, the French observed the [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] was provided with a flanker and cannon; the English insisted it was merely to protect the workmen. French ships fired at it and the English returned fire.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Foreign'', Edward VI, (1861), 352, Calais Papers 10 August 15498.</ref> [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] told [[Fran\u00e7ois van der Delft]] that the French were constructing forts at Boulogne in contravention of treaty in September 1548; in December the French managed to destroy two new outposts the English were building, and another fort nearer to [[Gu\u00eenes]] and Calais called Fort Fiennes.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish,'' vol. 9 (1912), 291, 326.</ref>\n\nA major attempt on Boulogne by the French was repulsed in May 1549. The Imperial ambassador, [[Simon Renard]], reported a failed assault on the fort at Boulemberg, or Mount Lambert. The French leader, [[Gaspard II de Coligny]], sieur de Ch\u00e2tillon, a nephew of the [[Anne de Montmorency|Constable of France]], set ladders against the fort at 2:00am but the alarm was sounded by members of the garrison who he believed he had successfully bribed. 200 French were killed. The English suspected treachery as four guns blew up on their first firing and around seventy men were absent without leave. The womenfolk in the fort were said to have saved the day. Some laughed at Ch\u00e2tillon, saying he had made his scaling ladders too short, although the action was well-conceived as the fort was crucial to the defence of the town. Moreover, the action was said to be in breach of treaty.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 9 (1912), 373, 376\u2013377.</ref>\n\nEdward VI recorded this night assault in his chronicle, with a failed attempt to burn the ships in the harbour. In the summer, Coligny bombarded the pier with a battery of 20,000 shot, and blockaded the mouth of the haven with artillery. The English overran this artillery position and the French set up another which was less commanding. An attempt to foul the harbour with a hulk laden with stones also failed to inconvenience the English garrison.<ref>Jordan, W. K., ed.,  ''The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI'', George Allen & Unwin, (1966),12, 16.</ref>\n\n===English withdrawal===\nAlthough by the Treaty of Camp, the English had agreed to evacuate Boulogne in 1554, the town was returned to France in 1550 under the Treaty of Boulogne which also concluded the [[The Rough Wooing|war of Rough Wooing]] in Scotland. Simon Renard reported that the English captain accepted his order to surrender from the [[Privy Council]] with a sigh. [[Henry II of France]] formally entered the town on 16 May 1550. He stayed three days and visited the forts of the Boulemberg, [[Ambleteuse]], the Tower of [[Ardres]], the Great Fort and Fort Ch\u00e2tillon (also called Ch\u00e2tillon's garden). He was impressed with some of these recent fortification works and also with the English scheme for bringing freshwater to the town. Henry II determined to continue building the English [[star fort]] at Ambleteuse and the neighbouring work at [[Cap Gris Nez|Blackness]]. The French also admired the mole, which they called 'la Dunette,' and when completed Henry II compared it to a Roman work.<ref>de Rosny, A., ''M\u00e9moires de la societ\u00e9 acad\u00e9mique de Boulogne'' vol. 27, 'Documents in\u00e9dits, concernant les si\u00e8ges de Boulogne, 1548\u20131549' (1912), 533: quoted ''HKW'' (1975), 390.</ref> The [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne]], destroyed or badly damaged by the English, was to be rebuilt, Henry II gave the church a silver statue of Our Lady, and other nobles subscribed money.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol. 10, (1914) 92\u201393, 24 May 1550.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1544 Siege of Boulogne by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was depicted in the 4th season of the television series ''[[The Tudors]]''.\n\n==Citations==\n{{Portal|Italy|War}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Arnold, Thomas F.

Genetic mutations ([[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal]] or [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]]) can lead to defects in beta cell function. Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, [[chronic pancreatitis]] and [[cystic fibrosis]]). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of [[insulin receptor|insulin-antagonistic]] [[hormone]]s can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increase [[insulin resistance]] (especially [[glucocorticoid]]s which can provoke \"[[steroid diabetes]]\").

Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], [[Rockland County]], and [[Westchester County]], he is sometimes compared to [[Baron Haussmann]] of [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] [[Paris]], and was one of the most [[polarization (politics)|polarizing]] figures in the history of urban development in the United States. His decisions favoring highways over [[public transit]] helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island and influenced a generation of [[engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, and [[urban planner]]s who spread his philosophies across the nation despite his not having been trained in those professions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moses would call himself a \"coordinator\" and was referred to in the media as a \"master builder\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRobert Moses at one point held 12 titles simultaneously (including [[New York City Parks Commissioner]] and Chairman of the [[Long Island State Park Commission]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/environment/the-legacy-of-robert-moses/16018/|title=The legacy of Robert Moses|last=Sarachan|first=Sydney|date=2013-01-17|website=Need to Know {{!}} PBS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>, but was never elected to any public office ([[1934 New York state election|he ran only once]], for governor of New York as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1934 and lost to [[Herbert H. Lehman]] in a landslide). Nevertheless, he created and led numerous [[Public authority|public authorities]] that gave him autonomy from the general public and elected officials. Through these authorities, he controlled millions of dollars in income from his projects, such as tolls, and he could issue bonds to borrow vast sums for new ventures with little or no input from legislative bodies. This removed him from the [[power of the purse]] as it normally functioned in the United States, and from the process of [[public comment]] on major [[public work]]s. As a result of Moses' work, New York has the United States' greatest proportion of [[New York state public-benefit corporations|public benefit corporations]], which are the prime mode of infrastructure building and maintenance in New York and account for most of the state's debt.\n\nMoses' projects were considered by many to be necessary for the region's development after the [[Great Depression]]. During the height of his powers, New York City built campuses to host two [[World's Fair]]s: one in [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and the other in [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964]]. Moses also helped persuade the [[United Nations]] to locate [[Headquarters of the United Nations|its headquarters]] in [[Manhattan]], instead of in [[Philadelphia]], by helping the state secure the money and land needed for the project.\n\nMoses' reputation for efficiency and nonpartisan leadership was permanently damaged by [[Robert Caro]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography ''[[The Power Broker]]'' (1974), which exposed Moses's lust for power, questionable ethics, vindictiveness and racism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |date=October 23, 2015 |title=The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert Caro review \u2013 a landmark study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/the-power-broker-robert-moses-and-the-fall-of-new-york-robert-caro-review |work=The Guardian |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and rise to power==\nMoses was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to assimilated [[German Jewish]] parents, Bella (Silverman) and Emanuel Moses.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1218.html | title=Robert Moses, Master Builder, is Dead at 92}}</ref> He spent the first nine years of his life living at 83 Dwight Street in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], two blocks from [[Yale University]].

While New York City and New York State were perpetually strapped for money, the bridge's toll revenues amounted to tens of millions of dollars a year.

Bridges can be wider and cheaper to build, but taller and longer bridges use more ramp space at landfall than tunnels do.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} A \"Brooklyn Battery Bridge\" would have decimated [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] and physically encroached on the financial district, and for this reason, the bridge was opposed by the [[Regional Plan Association]], historical preservationists, [[Wall Street]] financial interests, property owners, various high society people, [[construction]] [[labor union|unions]], the Manhattan [[borough president]], Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], and governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Despite this, Moses favored a bridge, which could both carry more automobile traffic and serve as a higher visibility monument than a tunnel. LaGuardia and Lehman as usual had little money to spend, in part due to the [[Great Depression]], while the federal government was running low on funds after recently spending $105 million ($1.8 billion in 2016) on the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] and other City projects and refused to provide any additional funds to New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/brooklyn-battery/ |title=Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (I-478) |publisher=Nycroads.com |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> Awash in funds from Triborough Bridge tolls, Moses deemed that money could only be spent on a bridge. He also clashed with chief engineer of the project, [[Ole Singstad]], who preferred a tunnel instead of a bridge.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nOnly a lack of a key federal approval thwarted the bridge project. President Roosevelt ordered the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to assert that [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] a bridge in that location would block [[East River]] access to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] upstream. Thwarted, Moses dismantled the [[New York Aquarium]] on [[Castle Clinton]] and moved it to [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn, where it grew much bigger. This was in apparent retaliation, based on specious claims that the proposed tunnel would undermine Castle Clinton's foundation. He also attempted to raze Castle Clinton itself, the historic fort surviving only after being transferred to the federal government.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Moses now had no other option for a trans-river crossing than to build a tunnel. He commissioned the [[Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel]] (now officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel), a tunnel connecting Brooklyn to [[Lower Manhattan]]. A 1941 publication from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority claimed that the government had forced them to build a tunnel at \"twice the cost, twice the operating fees, twice the difficulty to engineer, and half the traffic,\" although engineering studies did not support these conclusions, and a tunnel may have held many of the advantages Moses publicly tried to attach to the bridge option.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nThis had not been the first time Moses pressed for a bridge over a tunnel. He had tried to upstage the Tunnel Authority when the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] was being planned.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/queens-midtown/ |title=Queens-Midtown Tunnel |website=NYCRoads.com |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> He had raised the same arguments, which failed due to their lack of political support.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\"/>\n\n===Post-war influence of urban development and projects===\n[[File:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[headquarters of the United&nbsp;Nations]] in New York City, viewed from the [[East River]].

This set of buildings straddles the [[FDR Drive]], another of Moses's creations.]]\nMoses's power increased after [[World War II]] after Mayor LaGuardia retired and a series of successors consented to almost all of his proposals. Named city \"construction coordinator\" in 1946 by Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]], Moses became New York City's ''de facto'' representative in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Moses was also given powers over [[New York City Housing Authority|public housing]] that had eluded him under LaGuardia. When O'Dwyer was forced to resign in disgrace and was succeeded by [[Vincent R. Impellitteri]], Moses was able to assume even greater behind-the-scenes control over [[infrastructure]] projects.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} One of Moses's first steps after Impellitteri took office was halting the creation of a citywide Comprehensive Zoning Plan underway since 1938 that would have curtailed his nearly unlimited power to build within the city and removed the Zoning Commissioner from power in the process. Moses was also empowered as the sole authority to negotiate in Washington for New York City projects. By 1959, he had overseen construction of 28,000 apartment units on hundreds of acres of land. In clearing the land for high-rises in accordance with the [[towers in the park]] concept, which at that time was seen as innovative and beneficial by leaving more grassy areas between high-rises, Moses sometimes destroyed almost as many housing units as he built.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1960s, Robert Moses was responsible for the construction of the [[Triborough Bridge|Triborough]], the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge|Marine Parkway]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge|Throgs Neck]], the [[Bronx-Whitestone Bridge|Bronx-Whitestone]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge|Henry Hudson]], and the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazzano\u2013Narrows]] bridges. His other projects included the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]] and [[Staten Island Expressway]], which together comprised most of [[Interstate 278]]; the [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]]; many New York State [[Parkway (New York)|parkways]]; and other highways. Federal interest had shifted from parkway to [[freeway]] systems, and the new roads mostly conformed to the new vision, lacking the landscaping or the commercial traffic restrictions of the pre-war highways. He was the mover behind [[Shea Stadium]] and [[Lincoln Center]], and contributed to the [[United Nations headquarters]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses had influence outside the New York area as well. Public officials in many smaller American cities hired him to design freeway networks in the 1940s and early 1950s. For example, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] hired Moses in 1943; his plan included a loop around the [[Downtown Portland|city center]], with [[spur route|spurs]] running through neighborhoods. Of this plan, only [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]], its links with [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|I-5]], and the [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]] were built.<ref>{{cite web| title= Feb. 4, 1974: Portland kills the Mount Hood Freeway| url= http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html | date= November 5, 2014| first= Aaron|last= Mesh | publisher= [[Willamette Week]] | quote= Every great civilization has an origin story.

Moreover, O'Malley's proposal \u2014 to have the city acquire the property for several times as much as he had originally said he was willing to pay \u2014 was rejected by both pro- and anti-Moses officials, newspapers, and the public as an unacceptable government subsidy of a private business enterprise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/nyh/89.1/fetter.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505064446/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/nyh/89.1/fetter.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 5, 2010 |title=Revising the Revisionists: Walter O'Malley, Robert Moses, and the End of the Brooklyn Dodgers |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=New York History (New York State Historical Association) |first=Henry D. |last=Fetter |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMoses envisioned New York's newest stadium being built in Queens' [[Flushing Meadows]] on the former (and as it turned out, future) site of the World's Fair, where it would eventually host all three of the city's major league teams of the day.

Around this time, Moses' political acumen began to fail him, as he unwisely picked several controversial political battles he could not possibly win. For example, his campaign against the free [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] program received much negative publicity, and his effort to destroy a shaded playground in [[Central Park]] to make way for a parking lot for the expensive [[Tavern on the Green|Tavern-on-the-Green]] restaurant earned him many enemies among the middle-class voters of the [[Upper West Side]].\n\nThe opposition reached a climax over the demolition of [[Pennsylvania Station (former building)|Pennsylvania Station]], which many attributed to the \"development scheme\" mentality cultivated by Moses<ref>{{cite news |title=Rethinking Robert Moses |first=Phillip |last=Lopate |url=http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301063044/http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 1, 2009 |magazine=[[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]] |date=March 13, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> even though it was the impoverished [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] that was actually responsible for the demolition.<ref name=\"The Nation\">{{Cite journal |title=Robert Moses: The Master Builder |first=Jane Holtz |last=Kay |url=http://www.janeholtzkay.com/articles/masterbuilder.pdf |journal=The Nation |date=April 24, 1989 |volume=248 |page=569 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |issue=16 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This casual destruction of one of New York's greatest architectural landmarks helped prompt many city residents to turn against Moses's plans to build a [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], which would have gone through [[Greenwich Village]] and what is now [[SoHo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2007/05/robert-moses-new-york-citys-master.html |title=Environmental and Urban Economics: Robert Moses: New York City's Master Builder? |publisher=Greeneconomics.blogspot.com |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> This plan and the [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] both failed politically.

His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties in the face of evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities.<ref name=\"Nexus\"/> In his organization of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way in moments of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the [[Bureau of International Expositions]] (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, would be devastating to the success of the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGMdyCdCT9c|title=Robert Moses: Long Island's Master Builder|website=YouTube|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate.<ref name=\"learn.columbia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.columbia.edu/moses/|title=Robert Moses|publisher=Learn.columbia.edu|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> The United States had already staged the sanctioned [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1962.

The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].\n\nAfter the World's Fair debacle, New York City mayor [[John Lindsay]], along with Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], sought to direct toll revenues from the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]]'s (TBTA) bridges and tunnels to cover deficits in the city's then financially ailing agencies, including the [[New York City Subway|subway system]]. Moses opposed this idea and fought to prevent it.<ref name=\"The Nation\"/> Lindsay then removed Moses from his post as the city's chief advocate for federal highway money in Washington.\n\nThe legislature's vote to fold the TBTA into the newly created [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) could have led to a lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders. Since the bond contracts were written into state law, it was unconstitutional to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the right of approval over such actions. However, the largest holder of TBTA bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], headed then by [[David Rockefeller]], the governor's brother. No suit was filed. Moses could have directed TBTA to go to court against the action, but having been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out\u2014the promised role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out of power.<ref name=\"Murphy\"/>\n\nMoses had thought he had convinced Nelson Rockefeller of the need for one last great bridge project, a span [[Long Island Crossing|crossing Long Island Sound]] from [[Rye (town), New York|Rye]] to [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]]. Rockefeller did not press for the project in the late 1960s through 1970, fearing public backlash among suburban Republicans would hinder his re-election prospects. A 1972 study found the bridge was fiscally prudent and could be environmentally manageable (according to the comparatively low environmental impact parameters of that period), but the anti-development sentiment was now insurmountable and in 1973 Rockefeller canceled plans for the bridge.\n\n====''The Power Broker''====\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?112640-1/power-broker-robert-moses Presentation by Robert Caro on Robert Moses and urban development at the Brookings Institution, September 28, 1998], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Main|The Power Broker}}\nMoses's image suffered a further blow in 1974 with the publication of ''[[The Power Broker]]'', a [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning biography by [[Robert A.

A statue of Moses was erected next to the [[Village hall|Village Hall]] in his long-time hometown, [[Babylon (village), New York|Babylon Village, New York]], in 2003, as well as a bust on the [[Lincoln Center]] campus of [[Fordham University]], although it has since been removed from display and is currently in storage.\n\nDuring his tenure as chief of the state park system, the state's inventory of parks grew to nearly {{Convert|2600000|acre}}.

The book highlighted his practice of starting large projects well beyond funding approved by the New York State legislature, with the knowledge they would eventually have to pay for the rest to avoid looking like they had failed to review the project properly (this is a tactic known as {{italics correction|''[[:wikt:fait accompli|fait accompli]]''}}). He was also characterized as using his political power to benefit cronies, including a case where he secretly shifted the planned route of the [[Northern State Parkway]] large distances to avoid impinging on the estates of the rich, while telling owners of the family farms who lost land and sometimes their livelihood, that it was based on \"engineering considerations\".{{sfn|Caro|1974}} The book charged that Moses [[libel]]ed other officials who opposed him, to have them removed from office, calling some of them [[communist]]s during the [[Red Scare]]. The biography further notes that Moses fought against schools and other public needs in favor of his preference for parks.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses's critics charge that he preferred automobiles over people. They point out that he displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the [[South Bronx]] and the [[amusement park]]s of [[Coney Island]], caused the departure of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to [[disinvestment]] and neglect.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} His building of expressways hindered the [[proposed expansion of the New York City Subway]] from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 [[Program for Action]], which was never completed, was hoped to counter this.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Other critics charge that he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built.\n\n====Racism====\n\nCaro's ''The Power Broker'' accused Moses of building the bridges across his parkways low in order to \"restrict the use of state parks by poor and lower-middle-class families,\" who did not own cars and would arrive by bus, and of discouraging blacks, in particular, from visiting Jones Beach, the centerpiece of the Long Island state park system, by such measures as making it difficult for black groups to get permits to park buses even if they came anyway (by other roads); assigning black lifeguards to \"distant, less developed beaches\" instead; and keeping the water temperature in the pool low.{{sfn|Caro}} While the exclusion of commercial vehicles, and the use of low bridges where appropriate, were standard on earlier parkways, where they had been instituted for aesthetic reasons, Moses appears to have made greater use of low bridges, which his aide Sidney Shapiro said was done in order to make it more difficult for future legislators to allow commercial vehicles.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=952}}<ref name=\"Campanella\">{{cite web |last1=Campanella |first1=Thomas |title=How Low Did He Go? |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/how-low-did-he-go/533019/ |website=Citylab |accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nMoses vocally opposed allowing black war veterans to move into [[Stuyvesant Town]], a Manhattan residential development complex created to house World War II veterans.<ref name=nyplmoses>{{cite web |title=Wrestling with Moses: How Jane Jacobs Took on New York's Master Builder and Transformed the American City |first=Cynthia |last=Chaldekas |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/03/16/wrestling-moses-jane-jacobs |website=[[New York Public Library]] |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Caro|1974}} In response to the biography, Moses defended his forced displacement of poor and minority communities as an inevitable part of urban revitalization, stating \"I raise my stein to the builder who can remove [[ghetto]]s without moving people as I hail the chef who can make omelets without breaking eggs.\"<ref name=\"Boeing2017Moses\" /> Additionally, close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in neighborhoods with predominantly white populations by making the water too cold.<ref name=nyt2cities>{{Cite news|title=A Tale of Two Cities |first=Michael |last=Powell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/nyregion/thecity/06hist.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |quote=As for the pool-cooling, Mr. Caro interviewed Moses's associates on the record (\"You can pretty well keep them out of any pool if you keep the water cold enough,\" he quotes Sidney M.

Through these authorities, he controlled millions of dollars in income from his projects, such as tolls, and he could issue bonds to borrow vast sums for new ventures with little or no input from legislative bodies. This removed him from the [[power of the purse]] as it normally functioned in the United States, and from the process of [[public comment]] on major [[public work]]s.

While New York City and New York State were perpetually strapped for money, the bridge's toll revenues amounted to tens of millions of dollars a year.

Bridges can be wider and cheaper to build, but taller and longer bridges use more ramp space at landfall than tunnels do.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} A \"Brooklyn Battery Bridge\" would have decimated [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] and physically encroached on the financial district, and for this reason, the bridge was opposed by the [[Regional Plan Association]], historical preservationists, [[Wall Street]] financial interests, property owners, various high society people, [[construction]] [[labor union|unions]], the Manhattan [[borough president]], Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], and governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Despite this, Moses favored a bridge, which could both carry more automobile traffic and serve as a higher visibility monument than a tunnel. LaGuardia and Lehman as usual had little money to spend, in part due to the [[Great Depression]], while the federal government was running low on funds after recently spending $105 million ($1.8 billion in 2016) on the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] and other City projects and refused to provide any additional funds to New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/brooklyn-battery/ |title=Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (I-478) |publisher=Nycroads.com |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> Awash in funds from Triborough Bridge tolls, Moses deemed that money could only be spent on a bridge. He also clashed with chief engineer of the project, [[Ole Singstad]], who preferred a tunnel instead of a bridge.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nOnly a lack of a key federal approval thwarted the bridge project. President Roosevelt ordered the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to assert that [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] a bridge in that location would block [[East River]] access to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] upstream. Thwarted, Moses dismantled the [[New York Aquarium]] on [[Castle Clinton]] and moved it to [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn, where it grew much bigger. This was in apparent retaliation, based on specious claims that the proposed tunnel would undermine Castle Clinton's foundation. He also attempted to raze Castle Clinton itself, the historic fort surviving only after being transferred to the federal government.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Moses now had no other option for a trans-river crossing than to build a tunnel. He commissioned the [[Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel]] (now officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel), a tunnel connecting Brooklyn to [[Lower Manhattan]]. A 1941 publication from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority claimed that the government had forced them to build a tunnel at \"twice the cost, twice the operating fees, twice the difficulty to engineer, and half the traffic,\" although engineering studies did not support these conclusions, and a tunnel may have held many of the advantages Moses publicly tried to attach to the bridge option.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nThis had not been the first time Moses pressed for a bridge over a tunnel. He had tried to upstage the Tunnel Authority when the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]] was being planned.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/queens-midtown/ |title=Queens-Midtown Tunnel |website=NYCRoads.com |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> He had raised the same arguments, which failed due to their lack of political support.<ref name=\"nycroads.com\"/>\n\n===Post-war influence of urban development and projects===\n[[File:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[headquarters of the United&nbsp;Nations]] in New York City, viewed from the [[East River]].

This set of buildings straddles the [[FDR Drive]], another of Moses's creations.]]\nMoses's power increased after [[World War II]] after Mayor LaGuardia retired and a series of successors consented to almost all of his proposals. Named city \"construction coordinator\" in 1946 by Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]], Moses became New York City's ''de facto'' representative in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Moses was also given powers over [[New York City Housing Authority|public housing]] that had eluded him under LaGuardia. When O'Dwyer was forced to resign in disgrace and was succeeded by [[Vincent R. Impellitteri]], Moses was able to assume even greater behind-the-scenes control over [[infrastructure]] projects.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} One of Moses's first steps after Impellitteri took office was halting the creation of a citywide Comprehensive Zoning Plan underway since 1938 that would have curtailed his nearly unlimited power to build within the city and removed the Zoning Commissioner from power in the process. Moses was also empowered as the sole authority to negotiate in Washington for New York City projects. By 1959, he had overseen construction of 28,000 apartment units on hundreds of acres of land. In clearing the land for high-rises in accordance with the [[towers in the park]] concept, which at that time was seen as innovative and beneficial by leaving more grassy areas between high-rises, Moses sometimes destroyed almost as many housing units as he built.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1960s, Robert Moses was responsible for the construction of the [[Triborough Bridge|Triborough]], the [[Marine Parkway\u2013Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge|Marine Parkway]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge|Throgs Neck]], the [[Bronx-Whitestone Bridge|Bronx-Whitestone]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge|Henry Hudson]], and the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazzano\u2013Narrows]] bridges. His other projects included the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]] and [[Staten Island Expressway]], which together comprised most of [[Interstate 278]]; the [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]]; many New York State [[Parkway (New York)|parkways]]; and other highways. Federal interest had shifted from parkway to [[freeway]] systems, and the new roads mostly conformed to the new vision, lacking the landscaping or the commercial traffic restrictions of the pre-war highways. He was the mover behind [[Shea Stadium]] and [[Lincoln Center]], and contributed to the [[United Nations headquarters]].{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses had influence outside the New York area as well. Public officials in many smaller American cities hired him to design freeway networks in the 1940s and early 1950s. For example, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] hired Moses in 1943; his plan included a loop around the [[Downtown Portland|city center]], with [[spur route|spurs]] running through neighborhoods. Of this plan, only [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]], its links with [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|I-5]], and the [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]] were built.<ref>{{cite web| title= Feb. 4, 1974: Portland kills the Mount Hood Freeway| url= http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html | date= November 5, 2014| first= Aaron|last= Mesh | publisher= [[Willamette Week]] | quote= Every great civilization has an origin story.

Moreover, O'Malley's proposal \u2014 to have the city acquire the property for several times as much as he had originally said he was willing to pay \u2014 was rejected by both pro- and anti-Moses officials, newspapers, and the public as an unacceptable government subsidy of a private business enterprise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/nyh/89.1/fetter.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505064446/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/nyh/89.1/fetter.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 5, 2010 |title=Revising the Revisionists: Walter O'Malley, Robert Moses, and the End of the Brooklyn Dodgers |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=New York History (New York State Historical Association) |first=Henry D. |last=Fetter |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMoses envisioned New York's newest stadium being built in Queens' [[Flushing Meadows]] on the former (and as it turned out, future) site of the World's Fair, where it would eventually host all three of the city's major league teams of the day.

Around this time, Moses' political acumen began to fail him, as he unwisely picked several controversial political battles he could not possibly win. For example, his campaign against the free [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] program received much negative publicity, and his effort to destroy a shaded playground in [[Central Park]] to make way for a parking lot for the expensive [[Tavern on the Green|Tavern-on-the-Green]] restaurant earned him many enemies among the middle-class voters of the [[Upper West Side]].\n\nThe opposition reached a climax over the demolition of [[Pennsylvania Station (former building)|Pennsylvania Station]], which many attributed to the \"development scheme\" mentality cultivated by Moses<ref>{{cite news |title=Rethinking Robert Moses |first=Phillip |last=Lopate |url=http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301063044/http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20070313/rethinking-robert-moses |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 1, 2009 |magazine=[[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]] |date=March 13, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> even though it was the impoverished [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] that was actually responsible for the demolition.<ref name=\"The Nation\">{{Cite journal |title=Robert Moses: The Master Builder |first=Jane Holtz |last=Kay |url=http://www.janeholtzkay.com/articles/masterbuilder.pdf |journal=The Nation |date=April 24, 1989 |volume=248 |page=569 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |issue=16 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This casual destruction of one of New York's greatest architectural landmarks helped prompt many city residents to turn against Moses's plans to build a [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], which would have gone through [[Greenwich Village]] and what is now [[SoHo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2007/05/robert-moses-new-york-citys-master.html |title=Environmental and Urban Economics: Robert Moses: New York City's Master Builder? |publisher=Greeneconomics.blogspot.com |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref> This plan and the [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] both failed politically.

His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties in the face of evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities.<ref name=\"Nexus\"/> In his organization of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way in moments of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the [[Bureau of International Expositions]] (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, would be devastating to the success of the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGMdyCdCT9c|title=Robert Moses: Long Island's Master Builder|website=YouTube|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate.<ref name=\"learn.columbia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.columbia.edu/moses/|title=Robert Moses|publisher=Learn.columbia.edu|accessdate=December 24, 2014}}</ref> The United States had already staged the sanctioned [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1962.

The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].\n\nAfter the World's Fair debacle, New York City mayor [[John Lindsay]], along with Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], sought to direct toll revenues from the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]]'s (TBTA) bridges and tunnels to cover deficits in the city's then financially ailing agencies, including the [[New York City Subway|subway system]]. Moses opposed this idea and fought to prevent it.<ref name=\"The Nation\"/> Lindsay then removed Moses from his post as the city's chief advocate for federal highway money in Washington.\n\nThe legislature's vote to fold the TBTA into the newly created [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) could have led to a lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders. Since the bond contracts were written into state law, it was unconstitutional to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the right of approval over such actions. However, the largest holder of TBTA bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], headed then by [[David Rockefeller]], the governor's brother. No suit was filed. Moses could have directed TBTA to go to court against the action, but having been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out\u2014the promised role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out of power.<ref name=\"Murphy\"/>\n\nMoses had thought he had convinced Nelson Rockefeller of the need for one last great bridge project, a span [[Long Island Crossing|crossing Long Island Sound]] from [[Rye (town), New York|Rye]] to [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]]. Rockefeller did not press for the project in the late 1960s through 1970, fearing public backlash among suburban Republicans would hinder his re-election prospects. A 1972 study found the bridge was fiscally prudent and could be environmentally manageable (according to the comparatively low environmental impact parameters of that period), but the anti-development sentiment was now insurmountable and in 1973 Rockefeller canceled plans for the bridge.\n\n====''The Power Broker''====\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?112640-1/power-broker-robert-moses Presentation by Robert Caro on Robert Moses and urban development at the Brookings Institution, September 28, 1998], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Main|The Power Broker}}\nMoses's image suffered a further blow in 1974 with the publication of ''[[The Power Broker]]'', a [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning biography by [[Robert A.

Moses is blamed for having destroyed more than a score of neighborhoods by building 13 expressways across New York City and by building large [[urban renewal]] projects with little regard for the urban fabric or for human scale.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Yet the author is more neutral in his central premise: the city would have developed much differently without Moses. Other U.S. cities were doing the same thing as New York in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; [[Central Artery|Boston]], [[Embarcadero Freeway|San Francisco]], and [[Alaskan Way Viaduct|Seattle]], for instance, each built highways straight through their downtown areas.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} The New York City architectural [[intelligentsia]] of the 1940s and 1950s, who largely believed in such proponents of the automobile as [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], had supported Moses. Many other cities, like [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Chicago]], and [[St. Louis]], also built massive, unattractive public housing projects.<ref>{{cite news |title=Great Cities Need Great Builders |first=Edward |last=Glaeser |url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/great-cities-need-great-builders/47012/ |newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] |date=January 19, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Caro|1974}} However, Caro also points out that Moses [[#Racism|demonstrated racist tendencies]].{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=510, 514}}  These allegedly included opposing black World War II veterans to move into a residential complex specifically designed for these veterans,<ref name=nyplmoses/> {{Failed verification|date=December 2019}} and purportedly trying to make swimming pool water cold in order to drive away potential African American residents in white neighborhoods.<ref name=nyt2cities/>\n\nPeople had come to see Moses as a bully who disregarded public input, but until the publication of Caro's book, they had not known many details of his private life\u2014for instance, that his brother Paul had spent much of his life in poverty. Paul, whom Caro interviewed shortly before the former's death, claimed Robert had exerted undue influence on their mother to change her will in Robert's favor shortly before her death.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Caro notes that Paul was on bad terms with their mother over a long period and she may have changed the will of her own accord, and implies that Robert's subsequent treatment of Paul may have been legally justifiable but was morally questionable.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Robert Moses Crypt 1024.jpg|thumb|right|The crypt of Robert Moses]]\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Moses concentrated on his lifelong love of [[human swimming|swimming]] and was an active member of the Colonie Hill Health Club.\n\nMoses died of [[heart disease]] on July 29, 1981, at the age of 92 at [[Good Samaritan Hospital (West Islip)|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in [[West Islip, New York]].\n\nMoses was of Jewish origin and raised in a [[Secularism|secularist]] manner inspired by the [[Ethical Culture]] movement of the late 19th century.

The [[Niagara Scenic Parkway]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] was originally named the Robert Moses State Parkway in his honor; its name was changed in 2016. A hydro-electric power dam in [[Massena, New York]] also bears Moses' name. Moses also has a school named after him in [[North Babylon, New York]] on Long Island; there is also a [[Robert Moses Playground]] in New York City. There are other signs of the surviving appreciation held for him by some circles of the public. A statue of Moses was erected next to the [[Village hall|Village Hall]] in his long-time hometown, [[Babylon (village), New York|Babylon Village, New York]], in 2003, as well as a bust on the [[Lincoln Center]] campus of [[Fordham University]], although it has since been removed from display and is currently in storage.\n\nDuring his tenure as chief of the state park system, the state's inventory of parks grew to nearly {{Convert|2600000|acre}}.

The book highlighted his practice of starting large projects well beyond funding approved by the New York State legislature, with the knowledge they would eventually have to pay for the rest to avoid looking like they had failed to review the project properly (this is a tactic known as {{italics correction|''[[:wikt:fait accompli|fait accompli]]''}}). He was also characterized as using his political power to benefit cronies, including a case where he secretly shifted the planned route of the [[Northern State Parkway]] large distances to avoid impinging on the estates of the rich, while telling owners of the family farms who lost land and sometimes their livelihood, that it was based on \"engineering considerations\".{{sfn|Caro|1974}} The book charged that Moses [[libel]]ed other officials who opposed him, to have them removed from office, calling some of them [[communist]]s during the [[Red Scare]]. The biography further notes that Moses fought against schools and other public needs in favor of his preference for parks.{{sfn|Caro|1974}}\n\nMoses's critics charge that he preferred automobiles over people. They point out that he displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the [[South Bronx]] and the [[amusement park]]s of [[Coney Island]], caused the departure of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to [[disinvestment]] and neglect.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} His building of expressways hindered the [[proposed expansion of the New York City Subway]] from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 [[Program for Action]], which was never completed, was hoped to counter this.{{sfn|Caro|1974}} Other critics charge that he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built.\n\n====Racism====\n\nCaro's ''The Power Broker'' accused Moses of building the bridges across his parkways low in order to \"restrict the use of state parks by poor and lower-middle-class families,\" who did not own cars and would arrive by bus, and of discouraging blacks, in particular, from visiting Jones Beach, the centerpiece of the Long Island state park system, by such measures as making it difficult for black groups to get permits to park buses even if they came anyway (by other roads); assigning black lifeguards to \"distant, less developed beaches\" instead; and keeping the water temperature in the pool low.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=318-319}}. While the exclusion of commercial vehicles, and the use of low bridges where appropriate, were standard on earlier parkways, where they had been instituted for aesthetic reasons, Moses appears to have made greater use of low bridges, which his aide Sidney Shapiro said was done in order to make it more difficult for future legislators to allow commercial vehicles.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pp=952}}<ref name=\"Campanella\">{{cite web |last1=Campanella |first1=Thomas |title=How Low Did He Go? |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/how-low-did-he-go/533019/ |website=Citylab |accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nMoses vocally opposed allowing black war veterans to move into [[Stuyvesant Town]], a Manhattan residential development complex created to house World War II veterans.<ref name=nyplmoses>{{cite web |title=Wrestling with Moses: How Jane Jacobs Took on New York's Master Builder and Transformed the American City |first=Cynthia |last=Chaldekas |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2010/03/16/wrestling-moses-jane-jacobs |website=[[New York Public Library]] |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Caro|1974}} In response to the biography, Moses defended his forced displacement of poor and minority communities as an inevitable part of urban revitalization, stating \"I raise my stein to the builder who can remove [[ghetto]]s without moving people as I hail the chef who can make omelets without breaking eggs.\"<ref name=\"Boeing2017Moses\" /> Additionally, close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in neighborhoods with predominantly white populations by making the water too cold.<ref name=nyt2cities>{{Cite news|title=A Tale of Two Cities |first=Michael |last=Powell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/nyregion/thecity/06hist.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |quote=As for the pool-cooling, Mr. Caro interviewed Moses's associates on the record (\"You can pretty well keep them out of any pool if you keep the water cold enough,\" he quotes Sidney M.

They argue that his legacy is more relevant than ever and that people take the parks, playgrounds and housing Moses built, now generally binding forces in those areas, for granted even if the old-style New York neighborhood was of no interest to Moses himself; moreover, were it not for Moses' public infrastructure and his resolve to carve out more space, New York might not have been able to recover from the blight and flight of the 1970s and '80s and become the economic magnet it is today.<ref name=\"nyt-2007-01-28\">{{Cite news|title=Rehabilitating Robert Moses |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |authorlink=Robin Pogrebin |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3D61F30F93BA15752C0A9619C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 28, 2007 |at=p. 1, Section 2, col. 3 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n\"Every generation writes its own history,\" said [[Kenneth T.

It was first built in 1810.\n\nThe limit of legal powers between the [[Port of London Authority]], the navigation authority downstream to the [[North Sea]] and that upstream to small headwaters of the river, the [[Environment Agency]], is marked nearby by an [[obelisk]] on the \"[[Surrey]]\" ([[Thames Path|towpath]], right) bank.{{refn|group=n|A bank of the River Thames by convention takes as its name its [[Historic counties of England|Historic county]], [[boxing the compass|compass point]] or a general north ([[Bank (geography)|left]]) or general south (right) description}}  The [[weir]] named '''Teddington Weir''' marks the river's usual [[tidal limit]] and is the lowest on the Thames. This lock is the lowest full-tide lock and second lowest of all-tide locks on the Thames.\n\nThe complex of civil engineering or infrastructure in essence consists of a large long weir and three locks: a conventional launch lock in regular use, very large barge lock and a small [[Thames skiff|skiff]] lock. The barge lock was made to accommodate long barges, steamers or [[passenger ferry|passenger ferries]] and has an additional set of gates half-way to operate more quickly for shorter craft. The staggered structures incorporate two reinforced narrow islands. The upper island is traversed by and accessible by the [[lock (water navigation)|lock gate]]s or [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==Location and design==\nThe greater lock is against the general south (right, towpath or Surrey) bank of the river which is for 500&nbsp;m north-east here{{refn|group=n|As the south bank is north-east or north, as beside the commercial district [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] which is centred {{convert|2.2|mi}} north, the Thames at Teddington Lock flows westward against its strongly eastward general flow; downstream of [[Oxfordshire]] other such circuitous [[meander]]s are at [[Wargrave]], for a few metres in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and at the [[Greenwich Peninsula]]}}; a middle lock being that most regularly used spans a long thin island which has lawns, places for boat owners to sit and a lock keeper's cabin and short thin island which is a thin wedge of concrete and a broad canoe/kayak stepped portage facility.\n\nThe river downstream of the lock is the Richmond and Twickenham reach of the [[Tideway]], a {{convert|3.2|mi|adj=on}} reach of semi-[[tide|tidal]] river due to the fact the [[Richmond Lock and Footbridge|Richmond Lock and half-tide barrages]] limits the fall of water thereby maintaining a head of water to aid navigability at and around low tide.{{refn|group=n|See [[tidal barrage]].}}\n\nThough the weir at '''Teddington Weir''' marks the managed river's usual [[tidal limit]], after prolonged rainfall causing very high fluvial flow, specifically at high tide, a higher limit of [[slack water|slack water (stand of the tide)]] causes [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] to arise as far upstream as [[East Molesey|the top of this reach]], the [[Molesey Lock|next lock]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26133660 |title=How does the Thames Barrier stop London flooding? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2014 |access-date= 26 March 2019|first=Tom |last=de Castella}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6080&p=0 |title=Operation of the Thames Barrier |publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe large, bow-shaped '''Teddington Weir''' is against the opposite bank. A series of two footbridges at differing heights make up a structure which crosses the locks, the middle island that has the lock keeper's cabin and the weir pool, [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==History==\n===First lock, 1810===\nThe [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]] obtained in April 1771 by the Thames Navigation Commission did not allow them to build locks below [[Maidenhead Bridge]],{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=153}} but from 1802, several plans for locks in the First District of the Thames, stretching from Staines to Teddington, were drawn up. Stephen Leach took over the post of Clerk of Works for the First District in 1802, following the retirement of Charles Truss at the age of 82. Just before his retirement, Truss proposed locks at Molesey and Teddington, each having a weir with long tumbling bays, similar to modern practice. [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] had suggested a series of long cuts in 1794, and Truss adopted the same idea. Rennie and [[William Jessop]] again proposed four long cuts in 1805, each about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, but the Navigation Committee were thwarted by strong opposition from landowners.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}\n\nZacchary Allnutt, by then Surveyor for the Second and Third Districts, stretching from Staines to [[Mapledurham Lock|Mapledurham]] near Reading, suggested locks at Chertsey, Sunbury and Teddington in 1805. Rennie submitted new proposals in 1809 for nine locks between Staines and Twickenham; two would be without weirs, seven would require large weirs to be built. Finally Leach drafted plans in 1810, which he suggested were \"at once practicable and expedient, the least expensive, and the most likely to pass through Parliament without opposition and yet calculated to remedy the most prominent evils complained of.\" An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained by the [[City of London Corporation]] in June 1810, which authorised construction of locks and weirs at [[Chertsey Lock|Chertsey]], [[Shepperton Lock|Shepperton]], [[Sunbury Lock|Sunbury]] and Teddington. Each would be {{convert|150|by|20|ft|m}} with the associated weirs having ample capacity for flood conditions. Rennie, Leach and the Navigation Committee visited the sites in July, to finalise the positioning of the lock.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}  Leach then took charge of the work, which was undertaken by contractors Joseph Kimber and John Dows who also built Sunbury Lock.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jeOMfpYMOtYC&lpg=PA397 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland |editor-first=Alec W. |editor-last=Skempton |publisher=Thomas Telford, on behalf of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] |location=London |year=2002 |volume=1 |pages=14,397 |isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2 |oclc=223272473}}</ref><ref name=\"Thacker1914\">{{cite book |first=Fred.

The lock was finished and opened in June 1811, but the weir was incomplete. The cofferdam protecting the works would need to be removed as river levels rose in the winter, which would have delayed completion until the following July, and so again Leach stepped in, awarding advance payments to the contractors, which enabled them to finish on time.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} The lock was further upstream than the present lock complex at the point where the footbridge now crosses.

It is noted that in 1843 the lock keeper prevented a steam vessel from ascending the lock. At that time steam vessels were limited to travel as far (upstream) as Richmond. As originally built, the lock had timber sides up to normal head water level, and turf above that. The crest of the weir was {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} above low water level at Teddington, but following the removal of the piers of old [[London Bridge]] (demolished 1831) in 1832, the drop increased to {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} and increased to {{convert|6|ft|m}} when dredging of the river was carried out.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} At tidally lower water occasional grounding of [[barges]] took place below the bottom sill.\n\nConsideration was given to removing the lock altogether in 1840.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kxJAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&dq |title=Number II, The Mapledurham Scheme |journal=The Civil Engineers and Architect's Journal |date=February 1840 |volume=13 |page=66}}</ref> However, it was decided to rebuild the lock and in June 1854 proposals included providing capacity for seagoing craft with a side lock for pleasure traffic. In June 1857 the first stone of the new lock was laid at the present position, the central of the three, opened in 1858 together with the narrow [[Thames skiff|skiff]] lock,{{refn|group=n|Nicknamed among lock-keepers and lock users \"the coffin\"}}. The boat slide, separate, was added in 1869 and in the 1870s the weir collapsed twice causing enormous damage. After the weir had been rebuilt in 1871, sluice bays spanned around {{convert|240|ft|m}}, similar to the tumbling bays.{{refn|group=n|The terms sluice bay and tumbling bay are two types of weir structures; the first, suspended and the second, a rising or fixed barrier.}}{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}}\n\n===Footbridges and barge lock===\nThe [[Teddington Lock Footbridges|footbridges]] were opened in 1889 and finally the barge lock, the largest lock on the river, was built in 1904\u20131905.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fred.

Parking is generally over 100&nbsp;m distant. The nearest road is Riverside Drive in Ham. Alternatively the lock can be reached from Ferry Road Teddington over the footbridges which cross the river there.\n\n==Reach above the lock==\n[[File:KingstonRiver01.JPG|thumb|left|Kingston from the river]]\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi}} above the lock is [[Trowlock Island]], towards the Teddington bank, followed by [[Steven's Eyot]] in the centre of the river. There are then [[Kingston Railway Bridge|Kingston Railway]] and [[Kingston Bridge, London|Kingston Bridges]]. After {{convert|1|mi}} the river then curves sharply to the right with [[Thames Ditton Island]] towards the village of the same name. Finally before Molesey Lock is [[Hampton Court Bridge]].\n\nDespite settlements on both sides of the lock having formed part of London since the 1960s, the banks are still often referred to as the \"Middlesex\" and \"Surrey\" banks.\n\nOn the Middlesex (Teddington etc.) side of the river going upstream, the bank generally consists of homes and gardens/communal grounds up to and inclusive of [[Hampton Wick]] at Kingston Bridge; [[Teddington Studios]], [[Lensbury]] Club, watersports clubs/a football club and the nature reserve at Trowlock are on the stretch. Above Kingston Bridge is [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court Park]], which stretches as far as Hampton Court Bridge. Half the [[Longford River]], which feeds the water-features of Hampton Court Palace, runs out of a grated culvert opposite Raven's Ait and below the Water Gallery. After Hampton Court Bridge (along the side of the weir stream) the bank adopts food/hotel use then residential use.\n[[File:TeddLockReach01.JPG|left|thumb|Scullers, [[Thames skiff|skiff]]s and [[Thames A Class Rater (scow)|Thames Raters]] at Raven's Ait on one of the most active stretches of the river]]\n\nOn the Surrey side is a consistent [[buffer zone|green buffer]] and towpath between the river and [[Ham, London|Ham]]/[[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], widening to [[Canbury Gardens]], until the high-rise town centre is reached. The town's buildings switch to entertainment immediately south of Kingston Bridge. After the canalised mouth of the [[Hogsmill River|Hogsmill]] the riverside switches to a promenade with road by residential uses until [[Seething Wells]] reservoirs. [[Raven's Ait]] is upstream of the bridges in the centre of the river at [[Surbiton]], followed by a marina. [[Thames Ditton|Long and Thames Dittons]]'s riverside homes and pubs follow until beyond Thames Ditton Island.  A riverside park and playing fields flank the mouth of the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]] until Hampton Court Bridge, near to the top of the reach, overlooking part of the Palace. [[Hampton Court railway station]] is before the bridge and just above it is [[Molesey Lock]].\n\n===Boats===\nThere are [[navigation transit markers]] between Kingston Bridge and Raven's Ait on the Hampton Court bank, to allow river users to check their speed. A powered boat may not pass except in emergencies between the markers in less than one minute.  The reach is home to at least five [[sailing]] clubs, five [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs, two [[skiffing]] and punting clubs, the [[Royal Canoe Club]] and two [[Sea Cadet]] centres. Numerous pleasure boats ply for trade, London Riverboat services and chartered trips between Kingston and Hampton Court.\n\n===Thames Path===\nThe [[Thames Path]] as its towpath follows the Surrey side to Kingston Bridge where it crosses to run alongside Hampton Court Park, before returning to what is traditionally (and in navigation use) termed the \"Surrey side\" at Hampton Court Bridge.\n\n===Sinuosity===\nThe river makes an acute inside angle on this reach \u2014 the two locks are less than half the distance apart by land.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sports clubs on the reach===\n[[File:TeddSkiffLock.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The skiff lock at Teddington]]\n* [[Royal Canoe Club]]\n* [[Kingston Rowing Club]] [[File:Lady Margaret Rowing Blade.svg|50px|]]\n* [[Walbrook Rowing Club]] [[File:Walbrook Rowing Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* [[Tiffin School Boat Club]] [[File:Tiffin School Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px|]]\n* Kingston Grammar School Boat Club [[File:Kingston Grammar School Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* Kingston University Boat Club [[File:Kingston University Boat Club Rowing Blade.svg|50px]]\n* [[The Skiff Club]] [[File:BladeSC.jpg|60px]]\n* [[Dittons Skiff and Punting Club]] [[File:BladeDSPC.JPG|60px]]\n* [[Thames Sailing Club]]\n* Tamesis Sailing Club\n* Minima Yacht Club\n* [[Kingston Royals Dragon Boat Racing Club]]\n* 1st Surbiton (Sealion) Sea Scouts\n* Ajax Sea Scouts\n* Leander Sea Scouts\n\n==Popular culture and the media==\n\nThe lock was the location of the [[Monty Python]] [[The Fish-Slapping Dance|Fish-Slapping Dance]] sketch.\n\nIn episode 1 of series 5 of the BBC TV police drama ''[[New Tricks]]'', the villain is arrested at Teddington Lock.\n\n[[Thames Television]] had purpose-built studios at Teddington Lock.\n\nIn a Third Season Episode of \"Murder Maps\", Teddington Lock was the location of the brutal murder of two teenage girls in the summer of 1953.

It was first built in 1810.\n\nThe limit of legal powers between the [[Port of London Authority]], the navigation authority downstream to the [[North Sea]] and that upstream to small headwaters of the river, the [[Environment Agency]], is marked nearby by an [[obelisk]] on the \"[[Surrey]]\" ([[Thames Path|towpath]], right) bank.{{refn|group=n|A bank of the River Thames by convention takes as its name its [[Historic counties of England|Historic county]], [[boxing the compass|compass point]] or a general north ([[Bank (geography)|left]]) or general south (right) description}}  The [[weir]] named '''Teddington Weir''' marks the river's usual [[tidal limit]] and is the lowest on the Thames. This lock is the lowest full-tide lock and second lowest of all-tide locks on the Thames.\n\nThe complex of civil engineering or infrastructure in essence consists of a large long weir and three locks: a conventional launch lock in regular use, very large barge lock and a small [[Thames skiff|skiff]] lock. The barge lock was made to accommodate long barges, steamers or [[passenger ferry|passenger ferries]] and has an additional set of gates half-way to operate more quickly for shorter craft. The staggered structures incorporate two reinforced narrow islands. The upper island is traversed by and accessible by the [[lock (water navigation)|lock gate]]s or [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==Location and design==\nThe greater lock is against the general south (right, towpath or Surrey) bank of the river which is for 500&nbsp;m north-east here{{refn|group=n|As the south bank is north-east or north, as beside the commercial district [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] which is centred {{convert|2.2|mi}} north, the Thames at Teddington Lock flows westward against its strongly eastward general flow; downstream of [[Oxfordshire]] other such circuitous [[meander]]s are at [[Wargrave]], for a few metres in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and at the [[Greenwich Peninsula]]}}; a middle lock being that most regularly used spans a long thin island which has lawns, places for boat owners to sit and a lock keeper's cabin and short thin island which is a thin wedge of concrete and a broad canoe/kayak stepped portage facility.\n\nThe river downstream of the lock is the Richmond and Twickenham reach of the [[Tideway]], a {{convert|3.2|mi|adj=on}} reach of semi-[[tide|tidal]] river due to the fact the [[Richmond Lock and Footbridge|Richmond Lock and half-tide barrages]] limits the fall of water thereby maintaining a head of water to aid navigability at and around low tide.{{refn|group=n|See [[tidal barrage]].}}\n\nThough the weir at '''Teddington Weir''' marks the managed river's usual [[tidal limit]], after prolonged rainfall causing very high fluvial flow, specifically at high tide, a higher limit of [[slack water|slack water (stand of the tide)]] causes [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] to arise as far upstream as [[East Molesey|the top of this reach]], the [[Molesey Lock|next lock]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26133660 |title=How does the Thames Barrier stop London flooding? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2014 |access-date= 26 March 2019|first=Tom |last=de Castella}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6080&p=0 |title=Operation of the Thames Barrier |publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe large, bow-shaped '''Teddington Weir''' is against the opposite bank. A series of two footbridges at differing heights make up a structure which crosses the locks, the middle island that has the lock keeper's cabin and the weir pool, [[Teddington Lock Footbridge]].\n\n==History==\n===First lock, 1810===\nThe [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]] obtained in April 1771 by the Thames Navigation Commission did not allow them to build locks below [[Maidenhead Bridge]],{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=153}} but from 1802, several plans for locks in the First District of the Thames, stretching from Staines to Teddington, were drawn up. Stephen Leach took over the post of Clerk of Works for the First District in 1802, following the retirement of Charles Truss at the age of 82. Just before his retirement, Truss proposed locks at Molesey and Teddington, each having a weir with long tumbling bays, similar to modern practice. [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] had suggested a series of long cuts in 1794, and Truss adopted the same idea. Rennie and [[William Jessop]] again proposed four long cuts in 1805, each about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, but the Navigation Committee were thwarted by strong opposition from landowners.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}\n\nZacchary Allnutt, by then Surveyor for the Second and Third Districts, stretching from Staines to [[Mapledurham Lock|Mapledurham]] near Reading, suggested locks at Chertsey, Sunbury and Teddington in 1805. Rennie submitted new proposals in 1809 for nine locks between Staines and Twickenham; two would be without weirs, seven would require large weirs to be built. Finally Leach drafted plans in 1810, which he suggested were \"at once practicable and expedient, the least expensive, and the most likely to pass through Parliament without opposition and yet calculated to remedy the most prominent evils complained of.\" An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained by the [[City of London Corporation]] in June 1810, which authorised construction of locks and weirs at [[Chertsey Lock|Chertsey]], [[Shepperton Lock|Shepperton]], [[Sunbury Lock|Sunbury]] and Teddington. Each would be {{convert|150|by|20|ft|m}} with the associated weirs having ample capacity for flood conditions. Rennie, Leach and the Navigation Committee visited the sites in July, to finalise the positioning of the lock.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=165}}  Leach then took charge of the work, which was undertaken by contractors Joseph Kimber and John Dows who also built Sunbury Lock.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jeOMfpYMOtYC&lpg=PA397 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland |editor-first=Alec W. |editor-last=Skempton |publisher=Thomas Telford, on behalf of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] |location=London |year=2002 |volume=1 |pages=14,397 |isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2 |oclc=223272473}}</ref><ref name=\"Thacker1914\">{{cite book |first=Fred.

The lock was finished and opened in June 1811, but the weir was incomplete. The cofferdam protecting the works would need to be removed as river levels rose in the winter, which would have delayed completion until the following July, and so again Leach stepped in, awarding advance payments to the contractors, which enabled them to finish on time.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} The lock was further upstream than the present lock complex at the point where the footbridge now crosses.

It is noted that in 1843 the lock keeper prevented a steam vessel from ascending the lock. At that time steam vessels were limited to travel as far (upstream) as Richmond. As originally built, the lock had timber sides up to normal head water level, and turf above that. The crest of the weir was {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} above low water level at Teddington, but following the removal of the piers of old [[London Bridge]] (demolished 1831) in 1832, the drop increased to {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} and increased to {{convert|6|ft|m}} when dredging of the river was carried out.{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}} At tidally lower water occasional grounding of [[barges]] took place below the bottom sill.\n\nConsideration was given to removing the lock altogether in 1840.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kxJAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&dq |title=Number II, The Mapledurham Scheme |journal=The Civil Engineers and Architect's Journal |date=February 1840 |volume=13 |page=66}}</ref> However, it was decided to rebuild the lock and in June 1854 proposals included providing capacity for seagoing craft with a side lock for pleasure traffic. In June 1857 the first stone of the new lock was laid at the present position, the central of the three, opened in 1858 together with the narrow [[Thames skiff|skiff]] lock,{{refn|group=n|Nicknamed among lock-keepers and lock users \"the coffin\"}}. The boat slide, separate, was added in 1869 and in the 1870s the weir collapsed twice causing enormous damage. After the weir had been rebuilt in 1871, sluice bays spanned around {{convert|240|ft|m}}, similar to the tumbling bays.{{refn|group=n|The terms sluice bay and tumbling bay are two types of weir structures; the first, suspended and the second, a rising or fixed barrier.}}{{sfn |Skempton |1996 |p=166}}\n\n===Footbridges and barge lock===\nThe [[Teddington Lock Footbridges|footbridges]] were opened in 1889 and finally the barge lock, the largest lock on the river, was built in 1904\u20131905.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fred.

Parking is generally over 100&nbsp;m distant. The nearest road is Riverside Drive in Ham. Alternatively the lock can be reached from Ferry Road Teddington over the footbridges which cross the river there.\n\n==Reach above the lock==\n[[File:KingstonRiver01.JPG|thumb|left|Kingston from the river]]\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi}} above the lock is [[Trowlock Island]], towards the Teddington bank, followed by [[Steven's Eyot]] in the centre of the river. There are then [[Kingston Railway Bridge|Kingston Railway]] and [[Kingston Bridge, London|Kingston Bridges]]. After {{convert|1|mi}} the river then curves sharply to the right with [[Thames Ditton Island]] towards the village of the same name. Finally before Molesey Lock is [[Hampton Court Bridge]].\n\nDespite settlements on both sides of the lock having formed part of London since the 1960s, the banks are still often referred to as the \"Middlesex\" and \"Surrey\" banks.\n\nOn the Middlesex (Teddington etc.) side of the river going upstream, the bank generally consists of homes and gardens/communal grounds up to and inclusive of [[Hampton Wick]] at Kingston Bridge; [[Teddington Studios]], [[Lensbury]] Club, watersports clubs/a football club and the nature reserve at Trowlock are on the stretch. Above Kingston Bridge is [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court Park]], which stretches as far as Hampton Court Bridge. Half the [[Longford River]], which feeds the water-features of Hampton Court Palace, runs out of a grated culvert opposite Raven's Ait and below the Water Gallery. After Hampton Court Bridge (along the side of the weir stream) the bank adopts food/hotel use then residential use.\n[[File:TeddLockReach01.JPG|left|thumb|Scullers, [[Thames skiff|skiff]]s and [[Thames A Class Rater (scow)|Thames Raters]] at Raven's Ait on one of the most active stretches of the river]]\n\nOn the Surrey side is a consistent [[buffer zone|green buffer]] and towpath between the river and [[Ham, London|Ham]]/[[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], widening to [[Canbury Gardens]], until the high-rise town centre is reached. The town's buildings switch to entertainment immediately south of Kingston Bridge. After the canalised mouth of the [[Hogsmill River|Hogsmill]] the riverside switches to a promenade with road by residential uses until [[Seething Wells]] reservoirs. [[Raven's Ait]] is upstream of the bridges in the centre of the river at [[Surbiton]], followed by a marina. [[Thames Ditton|Long and Thames Dittons]]'s riverside homes and pubs follow until beyond Thames Ditton Island.  A riverside park and playing fields flank the mouth of the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]] until Hampton Court Bridge, near to the top of the reach, overlooking part of the Palace. [[Hampton Court railway station]] is before the bridge and just above it is [[Molesey Lock]].\n\n===Boats===\nThere are [[navigation transit markers]] between Kingston Bridge and Raven's Ait on the Hampton Court bank, to allow river users to check their speed. A powered boat may not pass except in emergencies between the markers in less than one minute.  The reach is home to at least five [[sailing]] clubs, five [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs, two [[skiffing]] and punting clubs, the [[Royal Canoe Club]] and two [[Sea Cadet]] centres.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

For the rest of an entire year, paid observers followed them to ensure dietary compliance.  The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.  But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate. Once that situation resolved, the glucosuria disappeared.<ref name=\"McClellanDuBois1930\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/83/3/747.full.pdf|title=THE EFFECT OF AN EXCLUSIVE MEAT DIET LASTING ONE YEAR ON THE CARBOHYDRATE TOLERANCE OF TWO NORMAL MEN.|last=Tolstoi|first=Edward|date=June 20, 1929|pages=747\u2013752|accessdate=2015-12-16|journal=J.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".  Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

While the Inuit diet derived a percentage of its calories from the [[glycogen]] found in the [[raw meat]]s, the native Inuit ate a diet of primarily stewed (boiled) fish and meats while occasionally eating raw fish.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Peter Heinbecker | year = 1928 | title = Studies on the Metabolism of Eskimos | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/80/2/461 | format = PDF | journal = J.

For the rest of an entire year, paid observers followed them to ensure dietary compliance.  The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.  But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate. Once that situation resolved, the glucosuria disappeared.<ref name=\"McClellanDuBois1930\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/83/3/747.full.pdf|title=THE EFFECT OF AN EXCLUSIVE MEAT DIET LASTING ONE YEAR ON THE CARBOHYDRATE TOLERANCE OF TWO NORMAL MEN.|last=Tolstoi|first=Edward|date=June 20, 1929|pages=747\u2013752|accessdate=2015-12-16|journal=J.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".  Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

During the next 2 days he took much less protein and more fat so that he received about 20 percent of his calories from protein and 80 percent from fat. In these two days his intestinal condition became normal without medication. Thereafter the protein calories did not exceed 25 per cent of the total for more than 1 day at a time.\u201d}}</ref>\n\nThere were no deficiency problems; the two men remained perfectly healthy; their bowels remained normal, except that their stools were smaller and did not smell. Stefansson's [[gingivitis]] disappeared by the end of the experiment although there was an increase in the deposit of tartar on his teeth.  During this experiment his intake had varied between 2,000 and 3,100 calories per day and he derived, by choice, an average of almost eighty percent of his energy from animal fat and almost twenty percent from protein.<ref name=\"Groves\" />  Daily intake varied from 100-140 grams of protein, 200-300 grams of fat, and 7-12 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{cite news |ref={{SfnRef|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920}}|date= January 30, 1920|title= 50 Year Old Cache Found|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86091349/1920-01-30/ed-1/seq-3/|newspaper=The Pioche Record|publisher=L.H.
