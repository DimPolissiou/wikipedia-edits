He signed with the club as a teenager in 1938 and retired in 1961, having scored 228 goals in 534 appearances (placing Liddell fourth and 12th in the respective club rankings as of August 2010). He was Liverpool's leading goalscorer in the league in eight out of nine seasons from 1949\u201350 to 1957\u201358,<ref name=\"Stat\">Keith, John (2005), pp. 302\u20135</ref> and surpassed [[Elisha Scott]]'s club record for most league appearances in 1957.\n\nWith Liverpool, Liddell won a league championship in 1947 and featured in the club's [[1950 FA Cup Final]] defeat by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at international level on 29 occasions. While serving as a [[Royal Air Force]] navigator during the [[World War II|Second World War]], Liddell continued his career by appearing in unofficial games for Liverpool and guesting for various teams in the United Kingdom and Canada. After his retirement from football, in 1961, Liddell occupied himself as a [[Justice of the Peace]] (from 1958), [[bursar]] of [[Liverpool University]], and voluntary worker. He died in 2001.\n\nPrimarily a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]], Liddell's versatility enabled him to play comfortably on the opposite wing and as a striker, at [[Striker (association football)|centre]] and [[inside forward]]. Liddell became noted for his strong physique, acceleration, powerful shot,<ref name=\"LFCH\">[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/359 Profile: Billy Liddell], lfchistory.net.

Retrieved 28 April 2008.</ref> He did not originally consider football as a viable profession, eventually choosing accountancy in preference to the civil service and church. His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of football boots as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.<ref name=\"Keia\"/>\n\nAs a pupil at [[Dunfermline High School, Dunfermline|Dunfermline High School]], Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and two other languages. He became a reluctant rugby player, under the guidance of retired Welsh international [[Ronnie Boon]], while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], and [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Liverpool manager [[George Kay]] became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish halfback [[Matt Busby]], who learned of the teenager from [[Manchester City|Manchester City's]] [[Alex Herd]] while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take [[Willie McAndrew]], manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Stats/Article/2561|title=A timeline for Liverpool Football Club - LFChistory - Stats galore for Liverpool FC!|first=|last=LFChistory.net|website=www.lfchistory.net}}</ref> and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3.<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.<ref name=\"LFCH\"/><ref name=\"Matthews\"/><ref>Keith, John (2005), p. 11</ref>\n\nLiddell entered the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth team]] on his arrival in 1938. Before he established himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer [[Bert Shelley|Albert Shelley]] advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against [[Blackburn Rovers]] threatened to end his career prematurely. He had struck his knee against concrete near the corner flag after being challenged while running with the ball. Doctors informed him of the extent of tissue damage, causing Liddell anxiety about his future. He remained in [[Blackburn]] for two weeks, living in the family home of a colleague, before returning to Liverpool to continue his recovery.<ref>Keith, John (2005), pp. 16\u20137</ref> The [[World War II|Second World War]] precluded an official debut for Liddell, as [[the Football Association]] suspended competitive football from the abandoned [[1939-40 in English football|1939\u20131940]] season and instituted a regional system in its place.<ref>Anderson, Jeff (2004), p. 48</ref> Until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Liddell guested for various domestic sides when unavailable for Liverpool and represented select teams, including a Football Association XI and Scottish Services XI.

He signed with the club as a teenager in 1938 and retired in 1961, having scored 228 goals in 534 appearances (placing Liddell fourth and 12th in the respective club rankings as of August 2010). He was Liverpool's leading goalscorer in the league in eight out of nine seasons from 1949\u201350 to 1957\u201358,<ref name=\"Stat\">Keith, John (2005), pp. 302\u20135</ref> and surpassed [[Elisha Scott]]'s club record for most league appearances in 1957.\n\nWith Liverpool, Liddell won a league championship in 1947 and featured in the club's [[1950 FA Cup Final]] defeat by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at international level on 29 occasions. While serving as a [[Royal Air Force]] navigator during the [[World War II|Second World War]], Liddell continued his career by appearing in unofficial games for Liverpool and guesting for various teams in the United Kingdom and Canada. After his retirement from football, in 1961, Liddell occupied himself as a [[Justice of the Peace]] (from 1958), [[bursar]] of [[Liverpool University]], and voluntary worker. He died in 2001.\n\nPrimarily a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]], Liddell's versatility enabled him to play comfortably on the opposite wing and as a striker, at [[Striker (association football)|centre]] and [[inside forward]].

Retrieved 28 April 2008.</ref> He did not originally consider football as a viable profession, eventually choosing accountancy in preference to the civil service and church. His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of football boots as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.<ref name=\"Keia\"/>\n\nAs a pupil at [[Dunfermline High School, Dunfermline|Dunfermline High School]], Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and two other languages. He became a reluctant rugby player, under the guidance of retired Welsh international [[Ronnie Boon]], while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], and [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Liverpool manager [[George Kay]] became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish halfback [[Matt Busby]], who learned of the teenager from [[Manchester City|Manchester City's]] [[Alex Herd]] while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take [[Willie McAndrew]], manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Stats/Article/2561|title=A timeline for Liverpool Football Club - LFChistory - Stats galore for Liverpool FC!|first=|last=LFChistory.net|website=www.lfchistory.net}}</ref> and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3.<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.<ref name=\"LFCH\"/><ref name=\"Matthews\"/><ref>Keith, John (2005), p. 11</ref>\n\nLiddell entered the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth team]] on his arrival in 1938. Before he established himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer [[Bert Shelley|Albert Shelley]] advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against [[Blackburn Rovers]] threatened to end his career prematurely.
