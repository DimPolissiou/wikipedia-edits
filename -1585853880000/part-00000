On 19 May, for failing to appear, he was denounced as a rebel, and on 11 January 1593 he was charged, on pain of rebellion, to appear before and answer to the king and council. He failed to appear, and in 1593 the king, during a progress in the north, demolished his castle. On 30 September 1594 he was again denounced as a rebel, the special charges against him being communing with conspirators against the true religion, and open avowing of [[papistry]]. In May 1594, the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] having recommended that he and others should be apprehended, the king expressed his willingness to do so if possible.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=314}}\n\nLindsay went abroad, and probably visited Spain.

In 1580 he became a gentleman of the bedchamber to [[James VI of Scotland]], and also joined a group of young men who subscribed to serve the king in time of war at their own expense.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=314}}\n\n==Catholic convert==\nThrough the influence of the Jesuits [[James Gordon (Jesuit)|James Gordon]] and [[William Crichton (Jesuit)|William Crichton]] Lindsay became a convert to Catholicism; he said he was the first whom they induced to recant and openly profess the change of faith.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=314}} He kept an English Jesuit in his house, and it became a rendezvous of Catholics: his chaplain for 18 months was [[John Ingram (martyr)|John Ingram]].{{sfn|Butler|Burns|1995|p=209}} It was, he stated, mainly through his example that [[George Gordon, 1st Marquis of Huntly]], [[Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll]], and [[William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus]] were induced to make open confession of Catholicism.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=314}}\n\nIn 1589 Lindsay was imprisoned in [[Edinburgh Castle]] but on 29 November was conditionally released, [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], becoming his caution that he would enter again into ward and remain there till his trial. On 19 May, for failing to appear, he was denounced as a rebel, and on 11 January 1593 he was charged, on pain of rebellion, to appear before and answer to the king and council. He failed to appear, and in 1593 the king, during a progress in the north, demolished his castle. On 30 September 1594 he was again denounced as a rebel, the special charges against him being communing with conspirators against the true religion, and open avowing of [[papistry]]. In May 1594, the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] having recommended that he and others should be apprehended, the king expressed his willingness to do so if possible.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=314}}\n\nLindsay went abroad, and probably visited Spain. Having returned to Scotland towards the end of 1598, Lindsay was again denounced: he agreed to enter into a conference with the ministers of the kirk, and to remain within the bounds of the presbytery of [[Brechin]] till he had satisfied the kirk regarding his religion. On 24 May 1599, [[Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie]] became caution for him in five thousand [[merk (coin)|merk]]s; the presumption is that he made his peace with the kirk.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=314}}\n\n==Death==\nLindsay took part in the feuds of the Lindsays, and led a turbulent life.

Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:\n\n<poem>\n\"On a horse they go to church,\nOn a horse they kiss the icons,\nOn a horse they receive communion\nFrom the priest's hand.\"\n</poem>\n\nHis father, [[Konstantinos Kolokotronis]], took part in an armed rebellion, the [[Orlov Revolt]], instigated by the administration of [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia.

While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world.

Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the liberation of Tripolis, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Nafplion===\nHe next commanded Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]]. He took the port, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos.\n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the famous [[Acropolis]] in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. Dramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-Classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Ibrahim's campaign===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. Kolokotronis used guerrilla tactics to wear Ibrahim's forces down; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis's weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Personal items of T.

The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the liberation of Tripolis, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Nafplion===\nHe next commanded Greek troops in the siege of the coastal town of [[Nafplion]]. He took the port, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos.\n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the famous [[Acropolis]] in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. Dramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-Classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Ibrahim's campaign===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. Kolokotronis used guerrilla tactics to wear Ibrahim's forces down; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis's weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Personal items of T.

He described the religious prohibitions thereof as criminal, and argued that the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|declaration]] of the human \"[[right to life]]\" played into the hands of religious campaigners.\nAccording to Rajneesh, one has no right to knowingly inflict a lifetime of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, \"If a child is born [[deaf-mute|deaf, dumb]], and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep\" rather than \"take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: \"Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHe stated that the decision to have a child should be a medical matter, and that oversight of population and genetics must be kept in the realm of science, outside of politicians' control: \"If genetics is in the hands of Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, what will be the fate of the world?\" He believed that in the right hands, these measures could be used for good: \"Once we know how to change the program, thousands of possibilities open up. We can give every man and woman the best of everything. There is no need for anyone to suffer unnecessarily.

India, and as the \"Rolls-Royce guru\" in the United States.<ref name=\"Gordon114\" /> He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, and poked fun at the

movement was widely considered a [[cult]]. Rajneesh was seen to live \"in ostentation and offensive opulence\", while his followers, most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all or most of their money and possessions to the commune, might be at a mere \"subsistence level\".<ref name=Zaitz4 /><ref name=Galanter>{{harvnb|Galanter|1989|pp=95\u201396, 102}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal by scholars of religion ===\nAcademic assessments of Rajneesh's work have been mixed and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], speaking of \"gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings\" that \"exploit\" the \"ignorance and gullibility\" of his listeners.<ref name=Mehta>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=151}}</ref> The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of \"a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions\"... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory\".<ref name=\"BM48\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=48}}</ref> American religious studies professor [[Hugh B. Urban]] also said Rajneesh's teaching was neither original nor especially profound, and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> [[George Chryssides]], on the other hand, found such descriptions of Rajneesh's teaching as a \"potpourri\" of various religious teachings unfortunate because Rajneesh was \"no amateur philosopher\". Drawing attention to Rajneesh's academic background he stated that; \"Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others.\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" /> He described Rajneesh as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of \"Beat Zen\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\">{{harvnb|Chryssides|1999|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref> and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Rajneesh's teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" />\n\nSimilarly with respect to Rajneesh's embracing of Western counter-culture and the human potential movement, though Mullan acknowledged that Rajneesh's range and imagination were second to none,<ref name=\"BM48\" /> and that many of his statements were quite insightful and moving, perhaps even profound at times,<ref name=\"BM32\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=32}}</ref> he perceived \"a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas\" focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of \"being okay\", the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual's responsibility for their own destiny, and the need to drop the ego, along with fear and guilt.<ref name=\"BM48-89-90\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=48, 89\u201390}}</ref> Mehta notes that Rajneesh's appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments, which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru tradition]] and the Western [[growth movement]].<ref name=Mehta133 /> He saw this as a [[marketing strategy]] to meet the desires of his audience.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> Urban, too, viewed Rajneesh as negating a dichotomy between spiritual and material desires, reflecting the preoccupation with the body and sexuality characteristic of late [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[consumer culture]] and in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.<ref name=GIA183 />\n\nThe British professor of religious studies [[Peter B. Clarke]] said that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualisation as defined by American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] and the [[human potential movement]].<ref name=\"Clarke466\" /> He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups.<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\" /> Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was \"neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense\".<ref name=\"Clarke466\" />\n\nIn 2005, Urban observed that Rajneesh had undergone a \"remarkable [[apotheosis]]\" after his return to India, and especially in the years since his death, going on to describe him as a powerful illustration of what [[F. Max M\u00fcller]], over a century ago, called \"that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East\".<ref name=GIA183>{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Clarke also said that Rajneesh has come to be \"seen as an important teacher within India itself\" who is \"increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current 'world-accepting' trend of spirituality based on self-development\".<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\">{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|pp=432\u2013433}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal as charismatic leader ===\nA number of commentators have remarked upon Rajneesh's charisma. Comparing Rajneesh with [[Gurdjieff]], [[Anthony Storr]] wrote that Rajneesh was \"personally extremely impressive\", noting that \"many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged.

Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age.

spiritual leaders to have emerged from India in the twentieth century.<ref name=Mehta133>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=133}}</ref><ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" /> His message of sexual, emotional, spiritual, and institutional liberation, as well as the pleasure he took in causing offence, ensured that his life was surrounded by controversy.<ref name=\"JMF7\"/> Rajneesh became known as the \"sex guru\" in India, and as the \"Rolls-Royce guru\" in the United States.<ref name=\"Gordon114\" /> He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, and poked fun at the leading figures of various religions, who in turn found his arrogance insufferable.<ref>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=1}}</ref><ref name=Mehta83>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=83}}</ref> His teachings on sex, marriage, family, and relationships contradicted traditional values and aroused a great deal of anger and opposition around the world.<ref name=\"NYT160981\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=2}}</ref> His movement was widely considered a [[cult]]. Rajneesh was seen to live \"in ostentation and offensive opulence\", while his followers, most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all or most of their money and possessions to the commune, might be at a mere \"subsistence level\".<ref name=Zaitz4 /><ref name=Galanter>{{harvnb|Galanter|1989|pp=95\u201396, 102}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal by scholars of religion ===\nAcademic assessments of Rajneesh's work have been mixed and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], speaking of \"gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings\" that \"exploit\" the \"ignorance and gullibility\" of his listeners.<ref name=Mehta>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=151}}</ref> The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of \"a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions\"... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory\".<ref name=\"BM48\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=48}}</ref> American religious studies professor [[Hugh B. Urban]] also said Rajneesh's teaching was neither original nor especially profound, and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> [[George Chryssides]], on the other hand, found such descriptions of Rajneesh's teaching as a \"potpourri\" of various religious teachings unfortunate because Rajneesh was \"no amateur philosopher\". Drawing attention to Rajneesh's academic background he stated that; \"Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others.\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" /> He described Rajneesh as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of \"Beat Zen\"<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\">{{harvnb|Chryssides|1999|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref> and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Rajneesh's teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.<ref name=\"Chryss207-208\" />\n\nSimilarly with respect to Rajneesh's embracing of Western counter-culture and the human potential movement, though Mullan acknowledged that Rajneesh's range and imagination were second to none,<ref name=\"BM48\" /> and that many of his statements were quite insightful and moving, perhaps even profound at times,<ref name=\"BM32\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=32}}</ref> he perceived \"a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas\" focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of \"being okay\", the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual's responsibility for their own destiny, and the need to drop the ego, along with fear and guilt.<ref name=\"BM48-89-90\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=48, 89\u201390}}</ref> Mehta notes that Rajneesh's appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments, which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru tradition]] and the Western [[growth movement]].<ref name=Mehta133 /> He saw this as a [[marketing strategy]] to meet the desires of his audience.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB169\" /> Urban, too, viewed Rajneesh as negating a dichotomy between spiritual and material desires, reflecting the preoccupation with the body and sexuality characteristic of late [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[consumer culture]] and in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.<ref name=GIA183 />\n\nThe British professor of religious studies [[Peter B. Clarke]] said that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualisation as defined by American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] and the [[human potential movement]].<ref name=\"Clarke466\" /> He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups.<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\" /> Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was \"neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense\".<ref name=\"Clarke466\" />\n\nIn 2005, Urban observed that Rajneesh had undergone a \"remarkable [[apotheosis]]\" after his return to India, and especially in the years since his death, going on to describe him as a powerful illustration of what [[F. Max M\u00fcller]], over a century ago, called \"that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East\".<ref name=GIA183>{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Clarke also said that Rajneesh has come to be \"seen as an important teacher within India itself\" who is \"increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current 'world-accepting' trend of spirituality based on self-development\".<ref name=\"Clarke432-433\">{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|pp=432\u2013433}}</ref>\n\n=== Appraisal as charismatic leader ===\nA number of commentators have remarked upon Rajneesh's charisma. Comparing Rajneesh with [[Gurdjieff]], [[Anthony Storr]] wrote that Rajneesh was \"personally extremely impressive\", noting that \"many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged. [Rajneesh] seemed to radiate energy and to awaken hidden possibilities in those who came into contact with him\".<ref name=Storr47>{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=47}}</ref> Many sannyasins have stated that hearing Rajneesh speak, they \"fell in love with him\".<ref name=\"SJP122\">{{harvnb|Palmer|1988|p=122}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|p=368}}</ref><ref name=\"BM67\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=67}}</ref> Susan J. Palmer noted that even critics attested to the power of his presence.<ref name=\"SJP122\" /> James S. Gordon, a psychiatrist and researcher, recalls inexplicably finding himself laughing like a child, hugging strangers and having tears of gratitude in his eyes after a glance by Rajneesh from within his passing Rolls-Royce.<ref name=Gordon109>{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=109}}</ref> [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] concluded upon listening to Rajneesh in person that he was a brilliant lecturer, and expressed surprise at his talent as a comedian, which had not been apparent from reading his books, as well as the hypnotic quality of his talks, which had a profound effect on his audience.<ref name=\"FF2-106\">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986b|p=106}}</ref> Hugh Milne (Swami Shivamurti), an ex-devotee who between 1973 and 1982 worked closely with Rajneesh as leader of the Poona Ashram Guard<ref>{{harvnb|Wallis|1986|p=159}}</ref> and as his personal bodyguard,<ref>{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Belfrage|1981|p=137}}</ref> noted that their first meeting left him with a sense that far more than words had passed between them: \"There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and in a split second transferring vital information.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=48}}</ref> Milne also observed another facet of Rajneesh's charismatic ability in stating that he was \"a brilliant manipulator of the unquestioning disciple\".<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=307}}</ref>\n\nHugh B. Urban said that Rajneesh appeared to fit with [[Max Weber]]'s classical image of [[charismatic authority|the charismatic figure]], being held to possess \"an extraordinary supernatural power or 'grace', which was essentially irrational and affective\".<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB168\">{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=168}}</ref> Rajneesh corresponded to Weber's pure charismatic type in rejecting all rational laws and institutions and claiming to subvert all hierarchical authority, though Urban said that the promise of absolute freedom inherent in this resulted in bureaucratic organisation and institutional control within larger communes.<ref name=\"HBU-ZTB168\" />\n\nSome scholars have suggested that Rajneesh, may have had a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] personality.<ref>{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=50}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Huth|1993|pp=204\u2013226}}</ref><ref name=clarke /> In his paper ''The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh'', Ronald O. Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at [[Oregon State University]], argued that Rajneesh exhibited all the typical features of [[narcissistic personality disorder]], such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness; a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success; a need for constant attention and admiration; a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem; disturbances in interpersonal relationships; a preoccupation with [[personal grooming]] combined with frequent resorting to prevarication or outright lying; and a lack of empathy.<ref name=clarke /> Drawing on Rajneesh's reminiscences of his childhood in his book ''Glimpses of a Golden Childhood'', he suggested that Rajneesh suffered from a fundamental lack of [[parental discipline]], due to his growing up in the care of overindulgent grandparents.<ref name=clarke /> Rajneesh's self-avowed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a [[delusion]]al system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder; a condition of ego-inflation rather than egolessness.<ref name=clarke>{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|pp=55\u201389}}</ref>\n\n=== Wider appraisal as a thinker and speaker ===\nThere are widely divergent assessments of Rajneesh's qualities as a thinker and speaker. [[Khushwant Singh]], an eminent author, historian, and former editor of the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', has described Rajneesh as \"the most original thinker that India has produced: the most erudite, the most clearheaded and the most innovative\".<ref name=Bhawuk>{{harvnb|Bhawuk|2003|p=14}}</ref> Singh believes that Rajneesh was a \"free-thinking agnostic\" who had the ability to explain the most abstract concepts in simple language, illustrated with witty anecdotes, who mocked gods, [[prophet]]s, scriptures, and religious practices, and gave a totally new dimension to religion.<ref>Khushwant Singh, writing in the ''[[Indian Express]]'', 25 December 1988, quoted e.g., [https://web.archive.org/web/20030523024043/http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/SearchResults.asp?prodstock=11216 here]</ref> German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]], a one time devotee of Rajneesh's (living at the Pune ashram from 1978 to 1980), described him as a \"[[Wittgenstein]] of religions\", ranking him as one of the greatest figures of the 20th century; in his view, Rajneesh had performed a radical deconstruction of the word games played by the world's religions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sloterdijk|1996|p=105}}</ref><ref>[https://petersloterdijk.net/vita/ Peter Sloterdijk vita]. Retrieved 16 October 2019.</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1980s, a number of commentators in the popular press were dismissive of Rajneesh.<ref name=\"BM8-9\" /> The Australian critic [[Clive James]] scornfully referred to him as \"Bagwash\", likening the experience of listening to one of his discourses to sitting in a laundrette and watching \"your tattered underwear revolve soggily for hours while exuding grey suds. The Bagwash talks the way that looks.\"<ref name=\"BM8-9\">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=8\u20139}}</ref><ref name=Bagwash /> James finished by saying that Rajneesh, though a \"fairly benign example of his type\", was a \"rebarbative dingbat who manipulates the manipulable into manipulating one another\".<ref name=\"BM8-9\" /><ref name=Bagwash /><ref>\"Adieu to God: Why Psychology Leads to Atheism\" Mick Power. p114</ref> Responding to an enthusiastic review of Rajneesh's talks by [[Bernard Levin]] in ''[[The Times]]'', Dominik Wujastyk, also writing in ''The Times'', similarly expressed his opinion that the talk he heard while visiting the Poona ''ashram'' was of a very low standard, wearyingly repetitive and often factually wrong, and stated that he felt disturbed by the [[personality cult]] surrounding Rajneesh.<ref name=\"BM8-9\" /><ref>(10 August 2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090621002100/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1469028/Bernard-Levin.html Obituary of Bernard Levin], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

Robbins, while stressing that he was not a disciple, further stated that he had \"read enough vicious propaganda and slanted reports to suspect that he was one of the most maligned figures in history\".<ref name=Bhawuk /> Rajneesh's commentary on the [[Sikh]] scripture known as ''[[Japuji]]'' was hailed as the best available by [[Giani Zail Singh]], the former [[President of India]].<ref name=\"TJ\" /> In 2011, author [[Farrukh Dhondy]] reported that film star [[Kabir Bedi]] was a fan of Rajneesh, and viewed Rajneesh's works as \"the most sublime interpretations of Indian philosophy that he had come across\". Dhondy himself said Rajneesh was \"the cleverest intellectual confidence trickster that India has produced. His output of the 'interpretation' of Indian texts is specifically slanted towards a generation of disillusioned westerners who wanted (and perhaps still want) to 'have their cake, eat it' [and] claim at the same time that cake-eating is the highest virtue according to ancient-fused-with-scientific wisdom.\"<ref>(25 April 2011) [[Farrukh Dhondy]].

At 18, he stole cars for a living and sold the cars to local [[chop shop]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Murders==\nDuring his incarceration for car theft, L\u00f3pez claimed he was brutally gang-raped<ref name=\"NineNews\"/> and that he hunted down his rapists and killed the most brutal while still in prison. He said that after his jail term, he started murdering young girls in Peru. He claimed that, by 1978, he had killed over 100 of them and that he had been caught by a native tribe, who were preparing to execute him, when an American Christian missionary intervened and persuaded them to hand him over to the state police. The police soon released him. He said he moved to Colombia and later Ecuador, killing about three girls a week. L\u00f3pez said: \"I like the girls in Ecuador; they are more gentle and trusting.

The victims were all girls 12 years of age. In 1983, he was found guilty of the murder of 110 girls in [[Ecuador]]. He further confessed to an additional 240 murders in [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]].\n\n==Early life==\nL\u00f3pez's mother was a prostitute named Benilda L\u00f3pez De Casteneda. According to L\u00f3pez, witnessing acts of prostitution while growing up had disturbing effects on his psyche. Subsequently, his mother caught him fondling his younger sister in 1957, when he was eight years old, and evicted him from the family home.<ref name=\"NineNews\">{{cite web |last1=Pearson |first1=Nick |title=World's second worst serial killer walked free from prison |url=https://www.9news.com.au/world/pedro-lopez-worlds-second-worst-serial-killer-walked-free-from-prison/2be19c5c-95c5-44e2-8dd1-3253319a34e5 |website=Nine News |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=5 December 2018}}</ref> Following this, L\u00f3pez fled to [[Bogot\u00e1]], Colombia's capital city. He says he was picked up by a man, taken to a deserted house and repeatedly sodomized. At age twelve, he was taken in by an American family and enrolled in a school for orphans. He ran away after two years because he was allegedly molested by a male teacher. An alternative account says he ran away with a teacher. At 18, he stole cars for a living and sold the cars to local [[chop shop]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Murders==\nDuring his incarceration for car theft, L\u00f3pez claimed he was brutally gang-raped<ref name=\"NineNews\"/> and that he hunted down his rapists and killed the most brutal while still in prison. He said that after his jail term, he started murdering young girls in Peru. He claimed that, by 1978, he had killed over 100 of them and that he had been caught by a native tribe, who were preparing to execute him, when an American Christian missionary intervened and persuaded them to hand him over to the state police. The police soon released him. He said he moved to Colombia and later Ecuador, killing about three girls a week. L\u00f3pez said: \"I like the girls in Ecuador; they are more gentle and trusting.
