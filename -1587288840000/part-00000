The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]] and reach  {{nowrap|3-5 m}} long. A young palm produces about 30 leaves a year. Established palms over 10 years produce about 20 leaves a year. The [[flower]]s are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.\n\nThe palm fruit takes 5\u20136 months to mature from pollination to maturity. It is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single [[seed]] (the [[palm kernel]]), also rich in oil. When ripe, each bunch of fruit weighs between {{convert|5|and|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} depending on the age of the palm tree.\n\n==Planting==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis fruits on tree.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm fruit]]\nFor each [[hectare]] of oil palm, which is harvested year-round, the annual production averages 20&nbsp;tonnes {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of fruit yielding {{nowrap|4,000 kg}} of palm oil and {{nowrap|750 kg}} {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of [[seed]] kernels yielding {{nowrap|500 kg}} of high-quality palm kernel oil, as well as {{nowrap|600 kg}} of kernel meal.

Although common commercial germinated seed is as thick-shelled as the dura mother palm, the resulting palm will produce thin-shelled tenera fruit. An alternative to germinated seed, once constraints to mass production are overcome, are tissue-cultured or \"clonal\" palms, which provide \"true copies\" of high-yielding DxP palms.\n\nAn oil palm nursery must have an uninterrupted supply of clean water and topsoil which is both well-structured and sufficiently deep to accommodate three rounds of on-site bag-filling. About 35&nbsp;ha can grow enough seedlings over a three-year period to plant a 5,000-ha plantation. Prenursery seedlings must be watered daily. Whenever rainfall is less than 10&nbsp;mm per day, irrigation is required, and the system must be capable of uniformly applying 6.5&nbsp;mm water per day.\n\nPrenursery seedlings in the four-leaf stage of development (10 to 14 weeks after planting) are usually transplanted to the main nursery after their gradual adjustment to full sunlight and a rigid selection process. During culling, seedlings that have grassy, crinkled, twisted, or rolled leaves are discarded.\n\nWeeds growing in the [[polybag]]s must be carefully pulled out. Herbicides should not be used. Numerous insects (ants, armyworms, bagworms, aphids, thrips, mites, grasshoppers, and mealybugs) and vertebrates (rats, squirrels, porcupines, wild boar, and monkeys) are pests in oil-palm nurseries and must be carefully identified before control measures are implemented.\n\nAfter eight months in the nursery, normal healthy plants should be 0.8\u20131&nbsp;m in height and display five to eight functional leaves.\n\nThe proper approach to oil palm development begins with the establishment of leguminous cover plants, immediately following land clearing. They help prevent soil erosion and surface run-off, improve soil structure and palm root development, increase the response to mineral fertilizer in later years, and reduce the danger of micronutrient deficiencies. Leguminous cover plants also help prevent outbreaks of ''Oryctes'' beetles, which nest in exposed decomposing vegetation. Both phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are needed to maximize the leguminous cover plants' symbiotic nitrogen-fixation potential of around 200&nbsp;kg nitrogen/ha/yr, and are applied to most soils at 115 to 300&nbsp;kg phosphorus oxide/ha and 35 to 60&nbsp;kg potassium oxide/ha. Young palms are severely set back where grasses are allowed to dominate the inter-row vegetation, particularly on poor soils where the correction of nutrient deficiencies is difficult and costly.\n\n==Crop nutrient==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis0.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm ''Elaeis guinnensis'']]\n[[Mineral uptake|Nutrient uptake]] is low during the first year, but increases steeply between year one and year three (when harvesting commences) and stabilizes around years five to six. Early applications of [[fertilizer]], better planting material, and more rigid culling have led to a dramatic increase in early yields in the third to sixth years from time of planting. In regions without a significant [[drought|drop in rainfall]], yields of over 25 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches per hectare have been achieved in the second year of harvesting.\n\n[[Nitrogen deficiency]] is usually associated with conditions of water-logging, heavy weed infestation, and topsoil [[erosion]]. Symptoms are a general paling and stiffening of the pinnae, which lose their glossy lustre. Extended deficiency will reduce the number of effective fruit bunches produced, as well as the bunch size.\n\nPhosphorus-deficient leaves do not show specific symptoms, but frond length, bunch size, and trunk diameter are all reduced.\n\n[[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] is very common and is the major yield constraint in sandy or [[peat|peaty soils]]. The most frequent symptom is \"confluent orange spotting\". Pale green spots appear on the pinnae of older leaves; as the deficiency intensifies, the spots turn orange or reddish-orange and [[desiccation]] sets in, starting from the tips and outer margins of the pinnae. Other symptoms are \"orange blotch\" and \"midcrown yellowing\". In soils having a low water-holding capacity (sands and peats), potassium deficiency can lead to a rapid, premature desiccation of fronds.\n\n[[Copper deficiency (plants)|Copper deficiency]] is common on deep peat soils and occurs also on very sandy soils. It appears initially as whitish-yellow mottling of younger fronds. As the deficiency intensifies, yellow, mottled, interveinal stripes appear, and rusty, brown spots develop on the distal ends of leaflets. Affected fronds and leaflets are stunted and leaflets dry up. On sandy soils, palms recover rapidly after a basal application of 50&nbsp;grams of copper sulphate. On peat soils, lasting correction of copper deficiency is difficult, as applied [[copper sulphate]] is rendered unavailable. A promising method of correcting copper deficiency on peat soil is to mix copper sulphate with [[clay]] soil and to form tennis-ball sized \"copper mudballs\" that are placed around the palm to provide a slow-release source of available copper.\n\nHealthy, well selected seedlings are necessary for early and sustained high yield. In most cases, granular multinutrient compound fertilizers are the preferred nutrient source for seedlings in the nursery. Where subsoil is used to fill the polybags, extra dressings of Kieserite may be required (10-15&nbsp;g every six to eight weeks). Where compound fertilizers are not available, equivalent quantities of straight materials should be used.\n\nTo maintain good fertilizer response and high yields in older palms, selective [[thinning]] is often necessary.\n\n==Cross-breeding==\n{{expand section|Cross-breeding ''E. guineensis'' with ''E. oleifera'' should be included|date=September 2012}}\nUnlike other relatives, oil palms do not produce [[offshoot (plant)|offshoot]]s; propagation is by sowing the [[seed]]s.\n\nSeveral [[variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[Form (botany)|forms]] of ''Elaeis guineensis'' have been selected that have different characteristics. These include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicos.org/Name/2400016?tab=subordinatetaxa|title=Tropicos}}</ref>\n:::::*''E. guineensis'' fo. ''dura''\n:::::*''E. guineensis'' var. ''pisifera''\n:::::*''E, guineensis'' fo. ''tenera''\n\nBefore the Second World War, selection work had started in the ''Deli dura'' population in Malaya. Pollen was imported from Africa, and DxT and DxP crosses were made. Segregation of fruit forms in crosses made in the 1950s was often incorrect. In the absence of a good marker gene, there was no way of knowing whether control of pollination was adequate.\n\nAfter the work of Beirnaert and Vanderweyen (1941), it became feasible to monitor the efficacy of controlled pollination. From 1963 until the introduction of the palm-pollinating weevil ''Elaeidobius kamerunicus'' in 1982, contamination in Malaysia's commercial plantings was generally low. Thrips, the main pollinating agent at that time, apparently rarely gained access to bagged female inflorescences. However, ''E. kamerunicus'' is much more persistent, and after it was introduced, ''Deli dura'' contamination{{clarify|date=September 2012}} became a significant problem. This problem apparently persisted for much of the 1980s, but in a 1991 comparison of seed sources, contamination had been reduced to below 2%, indicating control had been restored.\n\nA 1992 study at a trial plot in [[Banting]], Selangor, revealed the \"yield of Deli dura oil palms after four generations of selection was 60% greater than that of the unselected base population. Crossing the dura and pisifera to give the thin-shelled tenera fruit type improved partitioning of dry matter within the fruit, giving a 30% increase in oil yield at the expense of shell, without changing total dry matter production.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00039396 |first1=R.

''Ganoderma'' is an extraordinary organism capable exclusively of degrading [[lignin]] to [[carbon dioxide]] and water; celluloses are then available as nutrients for the fungus. It is necessary to consider this mode of attack as a white rot involving lignin biodegradation, for integrated control. The existing literature does not report this area and appears to be concerned particularly with the mode of spread and molecular biology of ''Ganoderma''. The white rot perception opens up new fields in breeding/selecting for resistant cultivars of oil palms with high [[lignin]] content, ensuring the conditions for lignin decomposition are reduced, and simply sealing damaged oil palms to stop decay. The spread likely is by spores rather than roots. The knowledge gained can be employed in the rapid degradation of oil palm waste on the plantation floor by inoculating suitable fungi, and/or treating the waste more appropriately (e.g. chipping and spreading over the floor rather than windrowing).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2006.11.009 |title=Ganoderma disease of oil palm\u2014A white rot perspective necessary for integrated control |year=2007 |last1=Paterson |first1=R.R.M. |journal=Crop Protection |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=1369\u20131376|hdl=1822/7349 }}</ref>\n\nEndophytic bacteria are organisms inhabiting plant organs that at some time in their life cycles can colonize the internal plant tissues without causing apparent harm to the host.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Azevedo |first1=Jo\u00e3o L\u00facio |last2=Maccheroni |first2=Walter |last3=Pereira |first3=Jos\u00e9 Odair |last4=De Ara\u00fajo |first4=Welington Luiz |year=2000 |title=Endophytic microorganisms: a review on insect control and recent advances on tropical plants |journal=Electronic Journal of Biotechnology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15\u20136 |doi=10.2225/vol3-issue1-fulltext-4}}</ref> Introducing endophytic bacteria to the roots to control plant disease is to manipulate the indigenous bacterial communities of the roots in a manner, which leads to enhanced suppression of soil-borne pathogens.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]] and reach  {{nowrap|3-5 m}} long. A young palm produces about 30 leaves a year. Established palms over 10 years produce about 20 leaves a year. The [[flower]]s are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.\n\nThe palm fruit takes 5\u20136 months to mature from pollination to maturity. It is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single [[seed]] (the [[palm kernel]]), also rich in oil. When ripe, each bunch of fruit weighs between {{convert|5|and|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} depending on the age of the palm tree.\n\n==Planting==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis fruits on tree.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm fruit]]\nFor each [[hectare]] of oil palm, which is harvested year-round, the annual production averages 20&nbsp;tonnes {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of fruit yielding {{nowrap|4,000 kg}} of palm oil and {{nowrap|750 kg}} {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of [[seed]] kernels yielding {{nowrap|500 kg}} of high-quality palm kernel oil, as well as {{nowrap|600 kg}} of kernel meal.

Although common commercial germinated seed is as thick-shelled as the dura mother palm, the resulting palm will produce thin-shelled tenera fruit. An alternative to germinated seed, once constraints to mass production are overcome, are tissue-cultured or \"clonal\" palms, which provide \"true copies\" of high-yielding DxP palms.\n\nAn oil palm nursery must have an uninterrupted supply of clean water and topsoil which is both well-structured and sufficiently deep to accommodate three rounds of on-site bag-filling. About 35&nbsp;ha can grow enough seedlings over a three-year period to plant a 5,000-ha plantation. Prenursery seedlings must be watered daily. Whenever rainfall is less than 10&nbsp;mm per day, irrigation is required, and the system must be capable of uniformly applying 6.5&nbsp;mm water per day.\n\nPrenursery seedlings in the four-leaf stage of development (10 to 14 weeks after planting) are usually transplanted to the main nursery after their gradual adjustment to full sunlight and a rigid selection process. During culling, seedlings that have grassy, crinkled, twisted, or rolled leaves are discarded.\n\nWeeds growing in the [[polybag]]s must be carefully pulled out. Herbicides should not be used. Numerous insects (ants, armyworms, bagworms, aphids, thrips, mites, grasshoppers, and mealybugs) and vertebrates (rats, squirrels, porcupines, wild boar, and monkeys) are pests in oil-palm nurseries and must be carefully identified before control measures are implemented.\n\nAfter eight months in the nursery, normal healthy plants should be 0.8\u20131&nbsp;m in height and display five to eight functional leaves.\n\nThe proper approach to oil palm development begins with the establishment of leguminous cover plants, immediately following land clearing. They help prevent soil erosion and surface run-off, improve soil structure and palm root development, increase the response to mineral fertilizer in later years, and reduce the danger of micronutrient deficiencies. Leguminous cover plants also help prevent outbreaks of ''Oryctes'' beetles, which nest in exposed decomposing vegetation. Both phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are needed to maximize the leguminous cover plants' symbiotic nitrogen-fixation potential of around 200&nbsp;kg nitrogen/ha/yr, and are applied to most soils at 115 to 300&nbsp;kg phosphorus oxide/ha and 35 to 60&nbsp;kg potassium oxide/ha. Young palms are severely set back where grasses are allowed to dominate the inter-row vegetation, particularly on poor soils where the correction of nutrient deficiencies is difficult and costly.\n\n==Crop nutrient==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis0.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm ''Elaeis guinnensis'']]\n[[Mineral uptake|Nutrient uptake]] is low during the first year, but increases steeply between year one and year three (when harvesting commences) and stabilizes around years five to six. Early applications of [[fertilizer]], better planting material, and more rigid culling have led to a dramatic increase in early yields in the third to sixth years from time of planting. In regions without a significant [[drought|drop in rainfall]], yields of over 25 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches per hectare have been achieved in the second year of harvesting.\n\n[[Nitrogen deficiency]] is usually associated with conditions of water-logging, heavy weed infestation, and topsoil [[erosion]]. Symptoms are a general paling and stiffening of the pinnae, which lose their glossy lustre. Extended deficiency will reduce the number of effective fruit bunches produced, as well as the bunch size.\n\nPhosphorus-deficient leaves do not show specific symptoms, but frond length, bunch size, and trunk diameter are all reduced.\n\n[[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] is very common and is the major yield constraint in sandy or [[peat|peaty soils]]. The most frequent symptom is \"confluent orange spotting\". Pale green spots appear on the pinnae of older leaves; as the deficiency intensifies, the spots turn orange or reddish-orange and [[desiccation]] sets in, starting from the tips and outer margins of the pinnae. Other symptoms are \"orange blotch\" and \"midcrown yellowing\". In soils having a low water-holding capacity (sands and peats), potassium deficiency can lead to a rapid, premature desiccation of fronds.\n\n[[Copper deficiency (plants)|Copper deficiency]] is common on deep peat soils and occurs also on very sandy soils. It appears initially as whitish-yellow mottling of younger fronds. As the deficiency intensifies, yellow, mottled, interveinal stripes appear, and rusty, brown spots develop on the distal ends of leaflets. Affected fronds and leaflets are stunted and leaflets dry up. On sandy soils, palms recover rapidly after a basal application of 50&nbsp;grams of copper sulphate. On peat soils, lasting correction of copper deficiency is difficult, as applied [[copper sulphate]] is rendered unavailable. A promising method of correcting copper deficiency on peat soil is to mix copper sulphate with [[clay]] soil and to form tennis-ball sized \"copper mudballs\" that are placed around the palm to provide a slow-release source of available copper.\n\nHealthy, well selected seedlings are necessary for early and sustained high yield. In most cases, granular multinutrient compound fertilizers are the preferred nutrient source for seedlings in the nursery. Where subsoil is used to fill the polybags, extra dressings of Kieserite may be required (10-15&nbsp;g every six to eight weeks). Where compound fertilizers are not available, equivalent quantities of straight materials should be used.\n\nTo maintain good fertilizer response and high yields in older palms, selective [[thinning]] is often necessary.\n\n==Cross-breeding==\n{{expand section|Cross-breeding ''E. guineensis'' with ''E. oleifera'' should be included|date=September 2012}}\nUnlike other relatives, oil palms do not produce [[offshoot (plant)|offshoot]]s; propagation is by sowing the [[seed]]s.\n\nSeveral [[variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[Form (botany)|forms]] of ''Elaeis guineensis'' have been selected that have different characteristics. These include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicos.org/Name/2400016?tab=subordinatetaxa|title=Tropicos}}</ref>\n:::::*''E. guineensis'' fo. ''dura''\n:::::*''E. guineensis'' var. ''pisifera''\n:::::*''E, guineensis'' fo. ''tenera''\n\nBefore the Second World War, selection work had started in the ''Deli dura'' population in Malaya. Pollen was imported from Africa, and DxT and DxP crosses were made. Segregation of fruit forms in crosses made in the 1950s was often incorrect. In the absence of a good marker gene, there was no way of knowing whether control of pollination was adequate.\n\nAfter the work of Beirnaert and Vanderweyen (1941), it became feasible to monitor the efficacy of controlled pollination. From 1963 until the introduction of the palm-pollinating weevil ''Elaeidobius kamerunicus'' in 1982, contamination in Malaysia's commercial plantings was generally low. Thrips, the main pollinating agent at that time, apparently rarely gained access to bagged female inflorescences. However, ''E. kamerunicus'' is much more persistent, and after it was introduced, ''Deli dura'' contamination{{clarify|date=September 2012}} became a significant problem. This problem apparently persisted for much of the 1980s, but in a 1991 comparison of seed sources, contamination had been reduced to below 2%, indicating control had been restored.\n\nA 1992 study at a trial plot in [[Banting]], Selangor, revealed the \"yield of Deli dura oil palms after four generations of selection was 60% greater than that of the unselected base population. Crossing the dura and pisifera to give the thin-shelled tenera fruit type improved partitioning of dry matter within the fruit, giving a 30% increase in oil yield at the expense of shell, without changing total dry matter production.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00039396 |first1=R.

''Ganoderma'' is an extraordinary organism capable exclusively of degrading [[lignin]] to [[carbon dioxide]] and water; celluloses are then available as nutrients for the fungus. It is necessary to consider this mode of attack as a white rot involving lignin biodegradation, for integrated control. The existing literature does not report this area and appears to be concerned particularly with the mode of spread and molecular biology of ''Ganoderma''. The white rot perception opens up new fields in breeding/selecting for resistant cultivars of oil palms with high [[lignin]] content, ensuring the conditions for lignin decomposition are reduced, and simply sealing damaged oil palms to stop decay. The spread likely is by spores rather than roots. The knowledge gained can be employed in the rapid degradation of oil palm waste on the plantation floor by inoculating suitable fungi, and/or treating the waste more appropriately (e.g. chipping and spreading over the floor rather than windrowing).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2006.11.009 |title=Ganoderma disease of oil palm\u2014A white rot perspective necessary for integrated control |year=2007 |last1=Paterson |first1=R.R.M. |journal=Crop Protection |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=1369\u20131376|hdl=1822/7349 }}</ref>\n\nEndophytic bacteria are organisms inhabiting plant organs that at some time in their life cycles can colonize the internal plant tissues without causing apparent harm to the host.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Azevedo |first1=Jo\u00e3o L\u00facio |last2=Maccheroni |first2=Walter |last3=Pereira |first3=Jos\u00e9 Odair |last4=De Ara\u00fajo |first4=Welington Luiz |year=2000 |title=Endophytic microorganisms: a review on insect control and recent advances on tropical plants |journal=Electronic Journal of Biotechnology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15\u20136 |doi=10.2225/vol3-issue1-fulltext-4}}</ref> Introducing endophytic bacteria to the roots to control plant disease is to manipulate the indigenous bacterial communities of the roots in a manner, which leads to enhanced suppression of soil-borne pathogens.

It plays an important role in methane production from acetate and the optimum condition for its growth should be considered to harvest biogas as renewable fuel.<ref name=\"ejbiotechnology.info\"/>\n\nUnfortunately, the production of palm oil has detrimental effects on the environment and is not considered to be a sustainable biofuel.

There, Hindu beliefs mixed with the local [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] culture and started the usage of palm seeds by traditional healers suffixed with ''tok '[[bomoh]]' ''or ''pawang'' in the local language. Every bunch of palm fruit usually bears a single 'illustrious' seed which looks like a shiny black pearl called ''[[sbatmi]]'' in Tamil and ''shakti'' in Malay. These are used as accessories by the ''bomoh'' and ''pawang'' in the mixed ritual for peace with nature as these are believed to contain mystical healing properties, and those wearing them are blessed by nature.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nModern usage has seen more common people keeping these as charm or fashion items to feel at peace, owing to their use by celebrities. All palm seeds contain acid; these ''sbatmi ''are no different and should be handled with care. ''Sbatmi'' lost some popularity when it was used in a grisly ritual by [[Mona Fandey]] in 1993.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Energy and the environment]]\n* ''[[Journal of Oil Palm Research]]''\n* ''[[Journal of Plantation Crops]]''\n* [[Malaysian Palm Oil Board]]\n* [[List of Arecaceae genera]]\n* [[Social and environmental impact of palm oil]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Elaeis guineensis}}\n{{WestAfricanPlants|Elaeis guineensis}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070706035506/http://www.rspo.org/default.aspx Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]\n\n{{Palm oil|state=expanded}}\n{{Nuts}}\n{{Forestry}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q165403}}\n\n[[Category:Cocoseae]]\n[[Category:Oil palm]]\n[[Category:Fruits originating in Africa]]\n[[Category:Flora of Africa]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin]]\n", "name_user": "314r", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaeis_guineensis"}

In 1966 the Association was formed to commemorate the martyrs of Theresienstadt, whose members were former prisoners of the Theresienstadt concentration camp now living in Israel, including former members of Zionist youth organisations. The association did not only aim at meetings of the survivors, but also at the founding of an educational institution. This institution was to keep the memory of the murdered alive, especially that of the victims of the [[HeHalutz]] and their leading member [[Jakob Edelstein|Jacob Edelstein]], the first [[Judenrat]] of the Theresienstadt ghetto.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gedenkstaetten-uebersicht.de/index.php|title=Gedenkst\u00e4tten\u00fcbersicht -\u00a0Europa|website=www.gedenkstaetten-uebersicht.de|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://bterezin.org.il/en/beit-theresienstadt/founding-beit-terezin/|title=The Founding of Beit Terezin|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05df|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\nOne motivation for setting up Beit Terezin was that the communist government of Czechoslovakia avoided commemorating the Holocaust. Therefore the [[Theresienstadt Small Fortress (1940\u20131945)|Theresienstadt Small Fortress]] became a national memorial for the victims of fascism, but neither here nor on the commemorative plaque in the city were the murdered Jews explicitly mentioned. The [[Pinkas Synagogue]] in [[Prague]], which served as the national memorial site for the murdered Jews of Czechoslovakia from 1960 to 1968, had not been open since the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn its first meetings, the preparatory committee dealt with fundamental questions such as the opening of the association for all survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp or only for the members of Hechaluz. A further question was whether only the victims who died in Theresienstadt or those who were murdered in other camps after imprisonment in Theresienstadt should be remembered here. In 1966, when the Association for the Remembrance of the Martyrs of Theresienstadt was formally recognised, the members met in caf\u00e9s or in the offices of members who had access to suitable rooms due to their professional activities. It was agreed that there was an urgent need for rooms for meetings, commemorations, and for the storage of documents and research documents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the mid-1960s many survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp lived in Kibbutz [[Givat Haim (Ihud)]]. In addition, many Jews from Germany and Austria and members of the Zionist youth organisations, who had often lost relatives in Theresienstadt, were among the founders of the Kibbutz. This group of people was benevolent towards the establishment of a memorial or educational institution on the land of the kibbutz. In addition, it was the wish of the Association that Beit Terezin be established in the midst of a living community and not far from civilization. The choice of the Kibbutz Givat Haim (Ihud) was additionally favoured by its central location - at that time only a few of the members of the association scattered all over Israel had a motor vehicle, most of them relying on public transportation. After all, Jakob Edelstein, who was generally revered and murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp, wanted to settle in the then undivided Kibbutz Givat Haim after emigrating to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Because the kibbutz was to use rooms in Beit Terezin for its own cultural events from the very beginning, the association was assigned a building site in the middle of the kibbutz.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFounding members of the association were the Israeli journalist and translator [[Ruth Bondy]], a survivor of the Holocaust and former prisoner of the Theresienstadt concentration camp and several other concentration camps, and the diplomat Zeev Shek, also a survivor of Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and the Kaufering remote camp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Shek later became Israeli ambassador to Austria.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]] was laid in 1969 and the buildings were constructed with the support of Zionist youth organisations. Beit Terezin was opened at the beginning of May 1975 on the 30th anniversary of the liberation of the Theresienstadt concentration camp by the [[Red Army]]. At this time the facility was far from complete. Therefore the memorial hall consisted only of a floor mosaic and a [[torah]], the walls were bare. There were proposals for a modern audiovisual presentation of the ghetto's history, but the available financial means ruled it out. Following a suggestion by Albin Glaser, backlit transparencies with accompanying texts were attached to the walls to illustrate the development of the ghetto. It took until 1974 to bring the exhibition to its desired Display.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://bterezin.org.il/en/beit-theresienstadt/founding-beit-terezin/|title=Construction of the building|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05df|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4151 Beit Terezin Givat Haim.JPG|thumb|Sign at the entrance of Beit Terezin]]\n[[File:Theresienstadt 1941-1945.JPG|thumb|Interior view of the Rotunda]]\nBeit Terezin's planning had to take into account the limited financial means of the association in memory of the martyrs of Theresienstadt. The design of the complex was developed by the architect Albin Glaser, himself a survivor of the Theresienstadt concentration camp. His design is an interior in simple architecture, the rooms of which can be used for a variety of purposes. The central element is the twelve-sided rotunda made of reddish-brown bricks, whose ground plan and material are intended to remind us of the Theresienstadt fortress, which originally served as a memorial hall and place of remembrance. Today it is the main room of the Beit Theresienstadt Museum and the core of Beit Terezin with its permanent exhibition.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor use by the Kibbutz, a library with a reading room and a small hall for lectures and cultural events were built. For Beit Terezin itself, the complex includes an archive, a reading room and a lecture hall.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nGlaser's original planning included a building to house the documents about the Theresienstadt concentration camp that Zeev Shek had compiled in Prague immediately after the Second World War on behalf of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] and brought to Israel. These documents were initially housed for years at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and were to form the basis of the Beit Terezin archive. At the instigation of the then Israeli Foreign Minister [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Scharet]], whose secretary was Zeev Shek at the time, the documents on the Holocaust were not to be distributed among many small institutions, but stored centrally. Therefore, Shek handed the documents over to [[Yad Vashem]]. The resulting renunciation of a documentation and study center led to a dispute within the association. In the end, smaller premises were created to house the archive, without competing in any way with Yad Vashem or other large institutions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA second conflict over the design of Beit Terezin concerned the floor mosaic of the rotunda planned by Glaser. The design depicted the path network and the buildings of the Theresienstadt ghetto and its realisation cost 100,000 [[Israeli pound]]s. Within the association the costs were criticized, some members saw the amount better invested in education and research. In addition to the financial aspect, it was argued that the visual representation would be understood only by the survivors of the ghetto, while other members were convinced that the detailed representation of the ghetto's streets, paths, and buildings would preserve the atmosphere of oppression for future generations. Finally, the mosaics were made according to Glaser's design in Kibbutz [[Givat HaShlosha]], and the design is generally accepted.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Beit Theresienstadt 9397v.jpg|thumb|243x243px|Exhibition room of Bei Terezin with children's drawings]]\nThe theme of the permanent exhibition is the occupation of the Czech Republic by [[Nazism|National Socialist]] Germany from 1939 to 1945, in particular the history of the Jews in the Theresienstadt Ghetto from November 1941 to May 1945.

The first exhibition, entitled \"They called him a friend\", deals with the children's magazine \"Kamar\u00e1d\" of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, in which contributions written or drawn by children about their everyday experiences with hunger, death, illness, dirt and overcrowding of the camp were published. In addition to the description of the magazine with exhibits, the fates of the authors up to their murder in the Auschwitz concentration camp are presented. A second exhibition is entitled \"Sport and Youth in Theresienstadt\". The exhibition is dedicated to the many sporting activities of children and young people in the concentration camp and refers in particular to the importance of sport for the education and value education of young prisoners.\n\nIn 2011 Beit Terezin was accredited as the 54th Museum and Third Holocaust Museum of the [[Israel|State of Israel]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://bterezin.org.il/en/beit-theresienstadt/founding-beit-terezin/|title=Development of Beit Terezin|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05df|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>\n\n== Educational center ==\nThe Beit Terezin Education Centre was opened in 1993 and is dedicated to researching and documenting the Holocaust.

Thanks to his good contacts, Zeev Shek was able to obtain a copy of an index containing the data of more than 162,000 Jewish prisoners of the Theresienstadt concentration camp from Czechoslovakia, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and other European countries. The index was produced in Prague immediately after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. This index was invaluable during the Cold War, especially since the Czechoslovak government had broken off diplomatic relations and severely restricted the exchange of information after Israel's victory in the Six-Day War in 1967, as had all the Eastern bloc states. This index forms the core of Beit Terezin's archive and information about the fate of missing persons is still provided to their relatives upon request.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bterezin.org.il/en/beit-theresienstadt/general-information/|title=General Information|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05df|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned index, Shek succeeded in taking the archives of Hechaluz Theresienstadt to Palestine.

Extensive photographic material from this collection is in the Beit Terezin archive.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Staff ==\nIn the early years almost all the work, from the construction of Beit Terezin, the administration, the guided tours through the exhibition to the educational events, was carried out by volunteers. In most cases these were survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, and to a lesser extent residents of the kibbutz and other volunteers. The administration of the Kibbutz Givat Haim (Ihud) assigned Pinda Shefa (until 1982) and Aliza Schiller (until 1998), two members of the Kibbutz and Theresienstadt survivors, to run Beit Terezin. The age and deaths of the members of the first generation and the steadily increasing workload made it necessary to fill the management of Beit Terezin full-time from 1998. Today, permanent staff are employed for various tasks in the museum, educational sector and archive.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Sponsoring association ==\nBeit Terezin is still under the auspices of the Association for the Remembrance of the Martyrs of Theresienstadt (Theresienstadt (Terezin) Martyrs Remembrance Association). In the beginning, the association was made up of survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp. However, the association gradually opened up, first by welcoming the \"second generation\", children of survivors born after the liberation of their parents. In 1997, the statutes of the association established the representation of the \"second generation\" in all committees of the association. Today any member who is willing to support the work and goals of Beit Terezin can become a member.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Newsletter Dapei Kesher ==\nSince 1976, Beit Terezin has published the semi-annual newsletter Dapei Kesher. The purpose of this publication is to maintain contact and exchange information about Beit Terezin between members of the (Terezin) Martyrs Remembrance Association spread all over the world. Further contents refer to the history of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, with information on meetings of survivors, congresses, exhibitions, cultural events, publications of books and media from all over the world.

In 1966 the Association was formed to commemorate the martyrs of Theresienstadt, whose members were former prisoners of the Theresienstadt concentration camp now living in Israel, including former members of Zionist youth organisations. The association did not only aim at meetings of the survivors, but also at the founding of an educational institution. This institution was to keep the memory of the murdered alive, especially that of the victims of the [[HeHalutz]] and their leading member [[Jakob Edelstein|Jacob Edelstein]], the first [[Judenrat]] of the Theresienstadt ghetto.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gedenkstaetten-uebersicht.de/index.php|title=Gedenkst\u00e4tten\u00fcbersicht -\u00a0Europa|website=www.gedenkstaetten-uebersicht.de|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://bterezin.org.il/en/beit-theresienstadt/founding-beit-terezin/|title=The Founding of Beit Terezin|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05df|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\nOne motivation for setting up Beit Terezin was that the communist government of Czechoslovakia avoided commemorating the Holocaust. Therefore the [[Theresienstadt Small Fortress (1940\u20131945)|Theresienstadt Small Fortress]] became a national memorial for the victims of fascism, but neither here nor on the commemorative plaque in the city were the murdered Jews explicitly mentioned. The [[Pinkas Synagogue]] in [[Prague]], which served as the national memorial site for the murdered Jews of Czechoslovakia from 1960 to 1968, had not been open since the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn its first meetings, the preparatory committee dealt with fundamental questions such as the opening of the association for all survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp or only for the members of Hechaluz. A further question was whether only the victims who died in Theresienstadt or those who were murdered in other camps after imprisonment in Theresienstadt should be remembered here. In 1966, when the Association for the Remembrance of the Martyrs of Theresienstadt was formally recognised, the members met in caf\u00e9s or in the offices of members who had access to suitable rooms due to their professional activities. It was agreed that there was an urgent need for rooms for meetings, commemorations, and for the storage of documents and research documents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the mid-1960s many survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp lived in Kibbutz [[Givat Haim (Ihud)]]. In addition, many Jews from Germany and Austria and members of the Zionist youth organisations, who had often lost relatives in Theresienstadt, were among the founders of the Kibbutz. This group of people was benevolent towards the establishment of a memorial or educational institution on the land of the kibbutz. In addition, it was the wish of the Association that Beit Terezin be established in the midst of a living community and not far from civilization. The choice of the Kibbutz Givat Haim (Ihud) was additionally favoured by its central location - at that time only a few of the members of the association scattered all over Israel had a motor vehicle, most of them relying on public transportation. After all, Jakob Edelstein, who was generally revered and murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp, wanted to settle in the then undivided Kibbutz Givat Haim after emigrating to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Because the kibbutz was to use rooms in Beit Terezin for its own cultural events from the very beginning, the association was assigned a building site in the middle of the kibbutz.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFounding members of the association were the Israeli journalist and translator [[Ruth Bondy]], a survivor of the Holocaust and former prisoner of the Theresienstadt concentration camp and several other concentration camps, and the diplomat Zeev Shek, also a survivor of Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and the Kaufering remote camp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Shek later became Israeli ambassador to Austria.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]] was laid in 1969 and the buildings were constructed with the support of Zionist youth organisations. Beit Terezin was opened at the beginning of May 1975 on the 30th anniversary of the liberation of the Theresienstadt concentration camp by the [[Red Army]]. At this time the facility was far from complete. Therefor the memorial hall consisted only of a floor mosaic and a [[torah]], the walls were bare. There were proposals for a modern audiovisual presentation of the ghetto's history, but the available financial means ruled it out. Following a suggestion by Albin Glaser, backlit transparencies with accompanying texts were attached to the walls to illustrate the development of the ghetto. It took until 1974 to bring the exhibition to its desired Display.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://bterezin.org.il/en/beit-theresienstadt/founding-beit-terezin/|title=Construction of the building|website=\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05df|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4151 Beit Terezin Givat Haim.JPG|thumb|Sign at the entrance of Beit Terezin]]\n[[File:Theresienstadt 1941-1945.JPG|thumb|Interior view of the Rotunda]]\nBeit Terezin's planning had to take into account the limited financial means of the association in memory of the martyrs of Theresienstadt. The design of the complex was developed by the architect Albin Glaser, himself a survivor of the Theresienstadt concentration camp. His design is an interior in simple architecture, the rooms of which can be used for a variety of purposes. The central element is the twelve-sided rotunda made of reddish-brown bricks, whose ground plan and material are intended to remind us of the Theresienstadt fortress, which originally served as a memorial hall and place of remembrance. Today it is the main room of the Beit Theresienstadt Museum and the core of Beit Terezin with its permanent exhibition.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor use by the Kibbutz, a library with a reading room and a small hall for lectures and cultural events were built. For Beit Terezin itself, the complex includes an archive, a reading room and a lecture hall.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nGlaser's original planning included a building to house the documents about the Theresienstadt concentration camp that Zeev Shek had compiled in Prague immediately after the Second World War on behalf of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] and brought to Israel. These documents were initially housed for years at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and were to form the basis of the Beit Terezin archive. At the instigation of the then Israeli Foreign Minister [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Scharet]], whose secretary was Zeev Shek at the time, the documents on the Holocaust were not to be distributed among many small institutions, but stored centrally. Therefore, Shek handed the documents over to [[Yad Vashem]]. The resulting renunciation of a documentation and study center led to a dispute within the association. In the end, smaller premises were created to house the archive, without competing in any way with Yad Vashem or other large institutions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA second conflict over the design of Beit Terezin concerned the floor mosaic of the rotunda planned by Glaser. The design depicted the path network and the buildings of the Theresienstadt ghetto and its realisation cost 100,000 [[Israeli pound|Israeli pounds]]. Within the association the costs were criticized, some members saw the amount better invested in education and research. In addition to the financial aspect, it was argued that the visual representation would be understood only by the survivors of the ghetto, while other members were convinced that the detailed representation of the ghetto's streets, paths, and buildings would preserve the atmosphere of oppression for future generations. Finally, the mosaics were made according to Glaser's design in Kibbutz [[Givat HaShlosha]], and the design is generally accepted.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Beit Theresienstadt 9397v.jpg|thumb|243x243px|Exhibition room of Bei Terezin with children's drawings]]\nThe theme of the permanent exhibition is the occupation of the Czech Republic by [[Nazism|National Socialist]] Germany from 1939 to 1945, in particular the history of the Jews in the Theresienstadt Ghetto from November 1941 to May 1945.

In the 2006 league season the club would relocate the team to [[Shaanxi]] and rename themselves Xi'an Chanba International, however by the 2012 league season, the club relocated this time to [[Guizhou]], and changed their name to Guizhou Renhe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.163.com/12/0108/13/7N8FQJ0I00051C89.html|script-title=zh:\u9655\u897f\u4eba\u548c\u5b98\u65b9\u5ba3\u5e03\u7403\u961f\u5357\u8fc1 \u6ce8\u518c\u5730\u5df2\u53d8\u66f4\u8d35\u5dde\u7701|publisher=sports.163.com|date=2012-01-08|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=zh}}</ref> In the 2016 league season the club relocated the team to [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]], [[Beijing]], and changed their name to Beijing Renhe. Throughout the club's history their greatest achievement has been winning the [[2013 Chinese FA Cup]] while the highest position they have ever finished was second within the 2003 league season.\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded on February 3, 1995 in Pudong, Shanghai to take part in the recently formed fully professional football league system and they started at the bottom of the football pyramid in the third division, where they named themselves Shanghai Pudong. Playing in all blue in their debut season, they would immediately taste success when they won the division title and promotion to the second tier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china95.html |title=China League Tables 1995 |publisher=rsssf.com |date=19 Jun 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> The following seasons, however, saw the team languish within the division until they brought in [[Xu Genbao]] to manage the side at the beginning of the 2000 season and would make the club promotion contenders. Under Xu Genbao's leadership, they didn't have to wait long to win promotion when they would go on to win the division title at the end of the season and a chance to play in the top tier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china01.html |title=China League Tables 2001 |publisher=rsssf.com |date=19 Jun 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> Under the ownership of Shanghai Yungtay Engineering and COSCO Real Estate, the club rebranded themselves with a new blue and white striped football kit. They were big spenders who wanted to achieve immediate success by bringing in established Chinese internationals such as [[Cheng Yaodong]], [[Jiang Jin]] and particularly [[Wu Chengying]] who set a Chinese transfer fee record of 13,000,000 [[Renminbi|RMB]]. This saw them become genuine title contenders and under their new manager Cheng Yaodong, they would fight for the league title with [[Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C.|Shanghai Greenland Shenhua]] and only come second by a single point at the end of the [[Chinese Jia-A League 2003|2003 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china03.html |title=China League Tables 2003 |publisher=rsssf.com |date=18 Apr 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> On June 13, 2012 it was discovered by the police the real reason the team lost the 2003 title was because the club's players [[Shen Si]], [[Qi Hong]], [[Jiang Jin]] and [[Li Ming (footballer, born 1975)|Li Ming (1975)]] took a bribe from former [[Tianjin Teda F.C.|Tianjin Teda]] general manager Yang Yifeng to lose their November 30, 2003 game, which saw all offending participants fined and jailed for their crimes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/nsp/Sports/2012/06/14/Matchfixing%2Bled%2Bto%2Bstars%2Bdownfall/ |title=Match-fixing led to stars' downfall|publisher=shanghaidaily.com |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>\n\nThe owners could not maintain the level of spending that they had done and the team's results would start to slip. Finding that they could not compete with Shanghai Shenhua and in the 2005 season, they had to face additional competition in [[Shanghai Pudong Zobon F.C.|Shanghai Zobon]], the team decided to move to Xi'an after months of speculation. With the newly branded team known as Shanghai International, or Inter Shanghai by the fans, they would start to move away from the previous [[Yuanshen Stadium]] to the [[Shaanxi Province Stadium]] and renamed themselves Xi'an Chanba International by 2006 or Inter Xi'an by the fans. In 2007, their ownership was transferred to Baorong Investment and it was during this period that the club would start to experiment with a new yellow football kit. This would surprisingly seem to work when the club looked as if they were title contenders once more during the 2008 season, however their title hopes quickly faded and the team eventually finished fifth. The following season, however, would see the team languish near the bottom of the table and Cheng Yaodong decided to resign, which would see former Chinese national football coach [[Zhu Guanghu]] come in and guide the team away from the relegation zone.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[2010 Chinese Super League|2010 season]], Dai Yongge and the Renhe Commercial Holdings Company would start to invest heavily within the club. This would see the club bring in Chinese internationals [[Sun Jihai]], [[Zhao Xuri]], [[Qu Bo (footballer)|Qu Bo]] and [[Mao Jianqing]] into the team. However, despite the signings, the club struggled within the league and Zhu Guanghu left the club while three time Chinese league winner [[Milorad Kosanovi\u0107]] replaced him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.sina.com.cn/j/2010-05-08/22034975002.shtml|script-title=zh:\u9655\u897f\u6d50\u705e\u5b98\u65b9\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e3b\u5e05\u6731\u5e7f\u6caa\u4e0b\u8bfe \u79d1\u8428\u8bfa\u7ef4\u5947\u63a5\u4efb|publisher=sports.sina.com.cn|date=2010-05-08|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=zh}}</ref> Milorad Kosanovi\u0107's reign at the club was unsuccessful and he was soon replaced by [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]].

[[Association football|football]] club that currently participates in the [[Chinese League One]] under licence from the [[Chinese Football Association]] (CFA). The team is based in [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]], [[Beijing]] and their home stadium is the [[Beijing Fengtai Stadium]] that has a seating capacity of 31,043. Their current majority shareholder is Chinese property developers of shopping centers Renhe Commercial Holdings Company Limited.\n\nThe club was founded in [[Pudong]], [[Shanghai]] on February 3, 1995 and were originally known as Shanghai Pudong before they made their debut in the third tier of China's football league pyramid in the 1995 league season. They would work there way up to the top tier while changing name to accommodate their sponsors. In the 2006 league season the club would relocate the team to [[Shaanxi]] and rename themselves Xi'an Chanba International, however by the 2012 league season, the club relocated this time to [[Guizhou]], and changed their name to Guizhou Renhe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.163.com/12/0108/13/7N8FQJ0I00051C89.html|script-title=zh:\u9655\u897f\u4eba\u548c\u5b98\u65b9\u5ba3\u5e03\u7403\u961f\u5357\u8fc1 \u6ce8\u518c\u5730\u5df2\u53d8\u66f4\u8d35\u5dde\u7701|publisher=sports.163.com|date=2012-01-08|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=zh}}</ref> In the 2016 league season the club relocated the team to [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]], [[Beijing]], and changed their name to Beijing Renhe. Throughout the club's history their greatest achievement has been winning the [[2013 Chinese FA Cup]] while the highest position they have ever finished was second within the 2003 league season.\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded on February 3, 1995 in Pudong, Shanghai to take part in the recently formed fully professional football league system and they started at the bottom of the football pyramid in the third division, where they named themselves Shanghai Pudong. Playing in all blue in their debut season, they would immediately taste success when they won the division title and promotion to the second tier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china95.html |title=China League Tables 1995 |publisher=rsssf.com |date=19 Jun 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> The following seasons, however, saw the team languish within the division until they brought in [[Xu Genbao]] to manage the side at the beginning of the 2000 season and would make the club promotion contenders. Under Xu Genbao's leadership, they didn't have to wait long to win promotion when they would go on to win the division title at the end of the season and a chance to play in the top tier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china01.html |title=China League Tables 2001 |publisher=rsssf.com |date=19 Jun 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> Under the ownership of Shanghai Yungtay Engineering and COSCO Real Estate, the club rebranded themselves with a new blue and white striped football kit. They were big spenders who wanted to achieve immediate success by bringing in established Chinese internationals such as [[Cheng Yaodong]], [[Jiang Jin]] and particularly [[Wu Chengying]] who set a Chinese transfer fee record of 13,000,000 [[Renminbi|RMB]]. This saw them become genuine title contenders and under their new manager Cheng Yaodong, they would fight for the league title with [[Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C.|Shanghai Greenland Shenhua]] and only come second by a single point at the end of the [[Chinese Jia-A League 2003|2003 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/china03.html |title=China League Tables 2003 |publisher=rsssf.com |date=18 Apr 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> On June 13, 2012 it was discovered by the police the real reason the team lost the 2003 title was because the club's players [[Shen Si]], [[Qi Hong]], [[Jiang Jin]] and [[Li Ming (footballer, born 1975)|Li Ming (1975)]] took a bribe from former [[Tianjin Teda F.C.|Tianjin Teda]] general manager Yang Yifeng to lose their November 30, 2003 game, which saw all offending participants fined and jailed for their crimes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/nsp/Sports/2012/06/14/Matchfixing%2Bled%2Bto%2Bstars%2Bdownfall/ |title=Match-fixing led to stars' downfall|publisher=shanghaidaily.com |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>\n\nThe owners could not maintain the level of spending that they had done and the team's results would start to slip. Finding that they could not compete with Shanghai Shenhua and in the 2005 season, they had to face additional competition in [[Shanghai Pudong Zobon F.C.|Shanghai Zobon]], the team decided to move to Xi'an after months of speculation. With the newly branded team known as Shanghai International, or Inter Shanghai by the fans, they would start to move away from the previous [[Yuanshen Stadium]] to the [[Shaanxi Province Stadium]] and renamed themselves Xi'an Chanba International by 2006 or Inter Xi'an by the fans. In 2007, their ownership was transferred to Baorong Investment and it was during this period that the club would start to experiment with a new yellow football kit. This would surprisingly seem to work when the club looked as if they were title contenders once more during the 2008 season, however their title hopes quickly faded and the team eventually finished fifth. The following season, however, would see the team languish near the bottom of the table and Cheng Yaodong decided to resign, which would see former Chinese national football coach [[Zhu Guanghu]] come in and guide the team away from the relegation zone.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[2010 Chinese Super League|2010 season]], Dai Yongge and the Renhe Commercial Holdings Company would start to invest heavily within the club. This would see the club bring in Chinese internationals [[Sun Jihai]], [[Zhao Xuri]], [[Qu Bo (footballer)|Qu Bo]] and [[Mao Jianqing]] into the team. However, despite the signings, the club struggled within the league and Zhu Guanghu left the club while three time Chinese league winner [[Milorad Kosanovi\u0107]] replaced him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.sina.com.cn/j/2010-05-08/22034975002.shtml|script-title=zh:\u9655\u897f\u6d50\u705e\u5b98\u65b9\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e3b\u5e05\u6731\u5e7f\u6caa\u4e0b\u8bfe \u79d1\u8428\u8bfa\u7ef4\u5947\u63a5\u4efb|publisher=sports.sina.com.cn|date=2010-05-08|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=zh}}</ref> Milorad Kosanovi\u0107's reign at the club was unsuccessful and he was soon replaced by [[Slobodan Santra\u010d]].

In the [[2015 Chinese Super League|2015 season]] they were relegated to the [[China League One|League One]], but the team managed to advance back to the [[2018 Chinese Super League|Super League]] in 2018.
