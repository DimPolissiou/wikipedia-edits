The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\".

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|12|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|9|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=15?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 15, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 12\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|3|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/16|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 16|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to the species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. It has been hypothesised that secretarybirds may have employed a similar hunting technique to the extinct [[Phorusrhacidae]] because they are anatomically similar (although they are not closely related).<ref name=portugal /><!-- cites previous 6 sentences -->\n\nSecretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, expect in the case of [[tawny eagle]]s which will [[Kleptoparasitism|steal their kills]].

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method.

It became the capital and most important city in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Following the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], it became the capital of the Republic of Peru (Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa). Around one-third of the national population lives in the [[Lima Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]].\n\nLima is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The [[National University of San Marcos]], founded on 12 May 1551, during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Spanish colonial empire]], is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas.\n\nNowadays the city is considered as the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of the country. Internationally, it is one of the [[List of urban areas by population|thirty most populated urban agglomerations in the world]]. Due to its geostrategic importance, it has been defined as a \"beta\" city.\n\nJurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller portion, to the west, within the constitutional province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Ch\u00e1vez airport are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.\n\nIn October 2013, Lima was chosen to host the [[2019 Pan American Games]], these games were held at venues in and around Lima, and were the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country. It also hosted the [[APEC]] Meetings of 2008 and 2016, the [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] in October 2015,  the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in December 2014, and the [[Miss Universe 1982]] contest.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Lima foundation.jpg|thumb|Lima Foundation by Francisco Pizarro (1535)|alt=|left]]\n\nAccording to early Spanish articles the Lima area was once called ''Itchyma'',{{cn|date=April 2020}} after its original inhabitants. However, even before the [[Inca]] occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the R\u00edmac valley had come to be known by visitors as ''Limaq'' ('''Limaq''', pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8li.m\u0251q|}}, which means \"talker\" or \"speaker\" in the [[Quechua II|coastal Quechua]] that was the area's primary language before the Spanish arrival). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted: the chronicles show \"L\u00edmac\" replacing \"Ychma\" as the common name for the area.<ref name=\"Limaq\">{{cite web|url=http://aymara.org/biblio/lima_etimologia.pdf|title=Limaq|accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nModern scholars speculate that the word \"Lima\" originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects [[stop consonant]]s in word-final position. Non-Peruvian Spanish speakers may mistakenly define the city name as the direct Spanish translation of \"[[Lime (fruit)|lime]]\", the citrus fruit.\n[[File:CATEDRAL DE LIMA (FISQUET 1846).jpg|thumb|Lima Cathedral in 1846]]\n\nThe city was founded in 1535 under the name City of [[Biblical Magi|Kings]] ({{Lang-es|link=no|Ciudad de los Reyes}}) because its foundation was decided on 6 January, date of the feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. This name quickly fell into disuse, and ''Lima'' became the city's name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both ''Lima'' and ''Ciudad de los Reyes'' can be seen together.\n\nThe river that feeds Lima is called ''R\u00edmac'' and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is \"Talking River\" (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua in which the word for \"talker\" was pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8rim\u0251q|}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701034625/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |archive-date=2015-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the [[Cusco|Cuzco]] nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of [[Cusco Quechua|Cuzco Quechua]].\n\nLater, as the original inhabitants died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed.

They organized social clubs and built their own schools. Examples are [[Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The American School of Lima|The American-Peruvian school]], the [[Alliance fran\u00e7aise|Alianza Francesa de Lima]], the Lyc\u00e9e Franco-P\u00e9ruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; [[Markham College]], the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, [[Antonio Raymondi District]] Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also, several German-Peruvian schools.\n\nChinese and a lesser number of Japanese came to Lima and established themselves in the [[Barrios Altos]] neighborhood in downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their [[Chinatown, Lima|Chinatown]] as ''Calle Capon'' and the city's ubiquitous [[Chifa]] restaurants{{spaced ndash}}small, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisine{{spaced ndash}}can be found by the dozens in this enclave.\n\nIn 2014, the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica) reported that the population in Lima's 49 districts was 9,752,000 people, including the Constitutional Province of Callao. The city and (metropolitan area) represents around 29% of the national population. Of the city's population 48.7% are men and 51.3% are women. The 49 districts in Metropolitan Lima are divided into 5 areas: Cono Norte (North Lima), Lima Este (East Lima), Constitutional Province of Callao, Lima Centro (Central Lima) and Lima Sur (South Lima). The largest areas are Lima Norte with 2,475,432 people and Lima Este with 2,619,814 people, including the largest single district San Juan de Lurigancho, which hosts 1 million people.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\" />\n\nLima is considered a \"young\" city. According to INEI, by mid 2014 the age distribution in Lima was: 24.3% between 0 and 14, 27.2% between 15 and 29, 22.5% between 30 and 44, 15.4% between 45 and 59 and 10.6% above 60.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nMigration to Lima from the rest of Peru is substantial. In 2013, 3,480,000 people reported arriving from other regions. This represents almost 36% of the entire population of Metropolitan Lima. The three regions that supply most of the migrants are Junin, Ancash and Ayacucho. By contrast only 390,000 emigrated from Lima to other regions.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nThe annual population growth rate is 1.57%. Some of the 43 metropolitan districts are considerably more populous than others. For example, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Ate, Comas, Villa El Salvador and Villa Maria del Triunfo host more than 400,000, while San Luis, San Isidro, Magdalena del Mar, Lince and Barranco have less than 60,000 residents.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nA 2005 household survey study shows a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6,000 soles (around US$1,840) or more for socioeconomic level A; between 2,000 soles (US$612) and 6,000 soles (US$1,840) for level B; from 840 soles (US$257) to 2,000 soles (US$612) for level C; from 420 soles (US$128) to 1200 soles (US$368) for level D; and up to 840 soles (US$257) for level E. In Lima, 18% were in level E; 32.3% in level D; 31.7% in level C; 14.6% in level B; and 3.4% in level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 soles (or US$612) monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apeim.com.pe/wp-content/themes/apeim/docs/nse/APEIM-NSE-2003-2004-LIMA.pdf|title=Niveles socioecon\u00f3micos en Lima Metropolitana y Callao \u2013 APEIM |trans-title=Socioeconomic levels in Metropolitan Lima and Callao \u2013 APEIM |publisher=Asociaci\u00f3n Peruana de Empresas de Investigaci\u00f3n de Mercados|language=es|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the percentage of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The level of poverty is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The level of poverty has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%).

It is the country's largest airport hosting the largest number of domestic and international passengers.\nIt serves as the fourth-largest hub in the Latin American air network. Lima possesses five other airports: the Las Palmas Air Force Base, Collique Airport and runways in [[Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar (Peru)|Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar]], [[San Bartolo District|San Bartolo]] and [[Chilca]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gc.kls2.com/|title=Great Circle Mapper|publisher=Gc.kls2.com|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Road===\n{{Details|Highways in Peru}}\nLima is a major stop on the [[Pan-American Highway]]. Because of its location on the country's central coast, Lima is an important junction in Peru's highway system. Three major highways originate in Lima.\n*The [[Peru Highway 1|Northern Panamerican Highway]] extends more than {{convert|1330|km|mi|sp=us}} to the border with Ecuador connecting the northern districts and with many major cities along the northern Peruvian coast.\n*The Central Highway ({{lang-es|Carretera Central|links=no}}) connects the eastern districts and with cities in central Peru. The highway extends {{convert|860|km|mi|sp=us}} with its terminus at the city of [[Pucallpa]] near Brazil.\n*The [[Peru Highway 1|Southern Panamerican Highway]] connects the southern districts and to cities on the southern coast. The highway extends {{convert|1450|km|mi|sp=us}} to the border with Chile.\n\nThe city has one big bus terminal next to the mall Plaza Norte. This bus station is the point of departure and arrival point for national and international destinations. Other bus stations serve private bus companies around the city. In addition, informal bus stations are located in the south, center and north of the city.\n\n===Maritime===\n[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Port of [[Callao]].]]\nLima's proximity to the port of [[Callao]] allows Callao to act as the metropolitan area's major port and one of Latin America's largest. Callao hosts nearly all maritime transport for the metropolitan area. A small port in [[Lur\u00edn District|Lur\u00edn]] serves oil tankers due to a nearby refinery. Maritime transport inside Lima city limits is relatively insignificant compared to that of Callao.\n\n===Rail===\nLima is connected to the Central Andean region by the [[Ferrocarril Central Andino]] which runs from Lima through the departments of [[Jun\u00edn Region|Jun\u00edn]], [[Huancavelica Region|Huancavelica]], [[Pasco Region|Pasco]] and [[Hu\u00e1nuco Region|Hu\u00e1nuco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrocarrilcentral.com.pe/index_.php|title=Ferrocarril Central Andino S.A.|publisher=Ferrocarrilcentral.com.pe|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref> Major cities along this line include [[Huancayo]], [[La Oroya]], [[Huancavelica]] and [[Cerro de Pasco]].

Lima operates a network of nine freeways \u2013 the Via Expresa Paseo de la Republica, Via Expresa Javier Prado, Via Expresa Grau, Panamericana Norte, Panamericana Sur, Carretera Central, Via Expresa Callao, Autopista Chillon Trapiche and the Autopista Ramiro Priale.<ref name=\"arqandina.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arqandina.com/pages/p4/f413.htm|title=Periodo 1945\u20131965 \u2013 Galer\u00eda de Fotos y Planos|publisher=Arqandina.com|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"arqandina.com\"/>\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey, the majority of the population uses public or collective transportation (75.6%), while 12.3% uses a car, taxi or motorcycle.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\nThe urban transport system is composed of over 652 transit routes<ref name=\"proinversion.gob.pe\"/> that are served by buses, microbuses and combis. The system is unorganized and is characterized by its informality. The service is run by 464 private companies that are poorly regulated by local government. Fares average one [[Peruvian nuevo sol|sol]] or {{USD|0.40}}.\n\nTaxis are mostly informal and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary in size from small four-door compacts to large vans. They account for a large part of the car stock. In many cases they are just a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. Additionally, several companies provide on-call taxi service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/lima/2868020156.html|title=Lima : Planning a Trip: Getting Around|publisher=Frommers.com|date=28 July 2008|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Colectivos====\n[[Colectivo]]s render express service on some major roads. The colectivos signal their specific destination with a sign on their windshield. Their routes are not generally publicitized but are understood by frequent users. The cost is generally higher than public transport; however, they cover greater distances at greater speeds due to the lack of stops.

The goal is to reduce passengers' commute times, protect the environment, provide improved security and overall quality of service. Metropolitano was executed with funds from the City of Lima and financing from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[World Bank]]. Metropolitana is the first BRT system to operate with natural gas, seeking to reduce air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metropolitano.com.pe|title=Metropolitano}}</ref> This system links the principal points of the Lima Metropolitan Area. The first phase of this project has {{convert|33|km}} of line (north) to [[Chorrillos District|Chorrillos]] (south). It began commercial operations on 28 July 2010.

It begins in the Industrial Park of Villa El Salvador, south of the city, continuing on to Av. Pachac\u00fatec in Villa Mar\u00eda del Triunfo and then to Av. Los H\u00e9roes in San Juan de Miraflores. Afterwards, it continues through Av. Tom\u00e1s Marsano in Surco to reach Ov. Los Cabitos, to Av. Aviaci\u00f3n and then cross the river Rimac to finish, after almost {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}}, in the east of the capital in [[San Juan de Lurigancho]]. The system operates 24 trains, each with six wagons. Each wagon has the capacity to transport 233 people. The metro system began operating in December 2012 and transported 78,224 people on average on a daily basis.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\" />\n\n===Other transportation issues===\nLima has high traffic congestion, especially at peak hours. 1 million 397 thousand vehicles were in use by the end of 2012. The region operates 65.3% of the cars in the country.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\nThe Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) offered economic incentives for municipalities to implement bicycle routes in their districts. Recreational bike lanes can be found in 39 districts. The Proyecto Especial Metropolitano de Transporte No Motorizado (PEMTNM) estimates that more than a million and a half people used the bike lanes in 2012. The bike lanes ran for {{convert|71|km|0|abbr=on}}. They estimate that the use of the bike lanes prevented the emission of 526 tons of carbon dioxide in 2012.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\nSan Borja district was the first to implement a bike-share program called San Borja en Bici. It supplied 200 bicycles and six stations across the district (two of them connecting with the Metro). By December 2012, the program had 2,776 subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munisanborja.gob.pe/bicisanborja/|title=:::.- San Borja en Bici -.:::|work=munisanborja.gob.pe}}</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\n===Environment===\n====Air====\nLima suffers most from air pollution. The sedimentary dust has solid particles that settle as dust on different surfaces or float through the air. The fine particles are the most dangerous given that they are able to damage human respiratory systems. The recommended limit of these particles by the [[World Health Organization]] is 5 tons/km2/month. In February 2014, Lima recorded an average of 15.2 tons/km2. The two districts with the highest concentration of sedimentary dust are El Agustino (46.1 tons/km2) and Independencia (25.5 tons/km2) in February 2014.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/boletines/estadisticas-ambientales-febrero-2014.pdf |title=Estad\u00edsticas Ambientales |date=February 2014 |website=inei.gob.pe |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nLima has built [[billboard]]s which serve as [[air purifier]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/84013/this-billboard-sucks-pollution-from-the-sky-and-returns-purified-air/|title=This Billboard Sucks Pollution from the Sky and Returns Purified Air|last=Peckham|first=Matt|date=May 1, 2014|website=Time|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\n====Water====\nThe permissible limit of lead in the water supply is 0.05 milligrams per liter, according to the Norm ITINTEC. In January 2014, the concentration of minerals in water treatment facilities of SEDAPAL was 0.051 iron, 0.005 lead, 0.0012 cadmium and 0.0810 aluminum. These values increased 15.9% and 33.3% in iron and cadmium with respect to January 2013 and a decrease of 16.7% and 12.4% in lead and aluminum. The values are within the recommended limits.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Solid waste====\nThe amount of solid waste produced per capita in Lima is about {{convert|0.7|kg|0|abbr=on}} per day. In 2012, each resident produced {{convert|273.36|kg|0|abbr=on}} of solid waste. The district municipalities only collect about 67% of the solid waste they generate. The rest ends up in informal landfills, rivers, or the ocean. Three municipalities recycle 20% or more of their waste.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\n===Access to basic services===\nIn Lima, 93% of households have access to water supply in their homes. In addition, 92% of homes connect with sewage systems. 99.6% of homes have grid electric service. Although most households have water and sewage systems, some are available for only a few hours a day.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\n===Security===\n[[File:Lima from above.jpg|left|thumb|San Isidro, Lima from above.]]\nThe perception of security varies by district. For example, San Isidro has the lowest perception of insecurity (21.4%), while Rimac has the highest perception of insecurity (85%), according to a 2012 survey. The five districts with the lowest perception of insecurity are San Isidro, San Borja, Miraflores, La Molina and Jesus Maria.

The younger population (ages 15 to 29 years old) has the highest victimization rate (47.9%).<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/> In 2012, citizens reported thefts (47.9%): in homes or establishments (19.4%), robbery or attack (14.9%), gang aggression (5.7%), among others in lesser frequency. The districts with the highest level of victimization are Rimac, El Agustino, Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos. The safest districts by level of victimization are Lurin, Lurigancho-Chosica, San Borja, Magdalena and Surquillo. These districts do not necessarily correspond to the districts with highest or lowest perception of insecurity.<ref name=\"ciudadnuestra.org\"/>\n\nWhile the Police force is nationally controlled and funded, each district in Lima has a community policing structure called Serenazgo. The quantity of Serenazgos officials and resources varies by district. For example, Villa Maria del Triunfo has 5,785 citizens per official. Twenty-two districts in Lima have a ratio above 1000 citizens per Serenazgo official, while 14 districts have ratios below 200 citizens per official, including Miraflores with 119 and San Isidro with 57.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nThe satisfaction with the Serenazgos also varies greatly by district. The highest satisfaction rates can be found in San Isidro (88.3%), Miraflores (81.6%), San Borja (77%) and Surco (75%). The lowest satisfaction rates can be found in Villa Maria del Triunfo (11%), San Juan de Miraflores (14.8%), Rimac (16.3%) and La Victoria (20%).<ref name=\"ciudadnuestra.org\"/>\n\n==Notable people from Lima==\n{{See also|List of people from Lima}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n[[File:Santa_Rosa_de_Lima_Ebrafol.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Rosa de Lima|St. Rose of Lima]] 1586\u20131617]]\n||\n[[File:San Martin de Porres huaycan.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[St. Martin de Porres]], 1579\u20131639]]\n||\n[[File:Palma1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Ricardo Palma]], writer, 1833\u20131919]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Mario Testino.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Mario Testino]], celebrity photographer]]\n||\n[[File:Gaston acurio.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gaston Acurio]], Chef of Peruvian Cuisine]]\n||\n[[File:Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (1982).jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], Former UN Secretary General]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Carlos Noriega.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Carlos Noriega]], US-Peruvian Astronaut]]\n||\n[[File:Bayly Jaime IMGP3054.JPG|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Jaime Bayly]], journalist]]\n||\n[[File:Christian Meier in 2 October 2015.png|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Christian Meier]], Peruvian actor]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Gian Marco.png|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gian Marco Zignago]] Singer, Songwriter]]\n||\n[[File:Gise 6gala.png|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gisela Valcarcel]] Television Hostess]]\n||\n[[File:Florez Juan Diego-4300 (16960810518) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Juan Diego Florez]], Tenor Opera Singer]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Eva ayllon 2010.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Eva Ayllon]], AfroPeruvian Singer]]\n||\n[[File:Claudia Llosa (111).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Claudia Llosa]], film director, writer and producer.]]\n|}\n\n*[[Rose of Lima]] (First Catholic in the Americas to be declared a saint)\n*[[Martin de Porres]] (Patron saint of mixed-race people)\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Baqu\u00edjano y Carrillo, Count of Vistaflorida]] (Economist, jurist, writer and politician of the Viceroyalty of Peru)\n*[[Francisco Antonio de Zela]] (Revolutionary against Spanish domination)\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Olaya]] (Afro-Peruvian hero)\n*[[Ricardo Palma]] (Writer)\n*[[Jose de la Riva Aguero]] (First Head State of Peru)\n*[[Mario Testino]] (Celebrity Photographer)\n*[[Gaston Acurio]] (Chef Ambassador of Peruvian Cuisine)\n*[[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peruvian writer \u2013 Nobel Prize winner of literature)\n*[[Juan Diego Florez]] (Opera Singer \u2013 Tenor)\n*[[Carlos Noriega]] (NASA Astronaut)\n*[[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] (Diplomat, Politician and former UN Secretary General)\n*[[Eva Ayllon]] (Afro-Peruvian Singer)\n*[[Paolo Guerrero]] (Soccer player)\n*[[Saby Kamalich]] (Actress)\n*[[Christian Meier]] (Actor, singer, model, businessman)\n*[[Jaime Cuadra]] (Music producer, composer, singer and voiceover artist)\n*[[Mar\u00eda Rostworowski]] (Historian)\n*[[Fernando de Szyszlo]] (Painter, Sculptor)\n*[[Jaime Bayly]] (Writer, Journalist)\n*[[Gian Marco Zignago]] (Singer-Songwriter)\n*[[Iv\u00e1n Thays]] (Author, professor and television host)\n*[[Luis Llosa]] (Film Director)\n*[[Jefferson Farfan]] (Soccer player)\n*[[Madeleine Truel]] (French-Peruvian who helped people from Nazis)\n*[[Gisela Valcarcel]] (Television hostess)\n*[[Alex Valle]] (Peruvian American professional fighting game player)\n*[[Valentina Shevchenko (fighter)|Valentina Shevchenko]] (Kyrgyzstani-Peruvian Mixed Martial Artist fighting out of Lima)\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in South America}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities===\nLima is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>Sister Cities International, [http://www.sister-cities.org/icrc/directory/Americas/Peru Online Directory: Peru, Americas].

It is located in the valleys of the [[Chill\u00f3n River|Chill\u00f3n]], [[R\u00edmac River|R\u00edmac]] and [[Lur\u00edn River|Lur\u00edn]] rivers, in the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Together with the seaport of [[Callao]], it forms a contiguous urban area known as the [[Lima Metropolitan Area]]. With a population of more than 9 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.inei.gob.pe/prensa/noticias/lima-alberga-9-millones-320-mil-habitantes-al-2018-10521/ |title=Lima alberga 9 millones 320 mil habitantes al 2018 |website=inei.gob.pe |publisher=INEI |language=es |accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref> Lima is the most populous [[List of metropolitan areas of Peru|metropolitan area of Peru]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|seventh-largest metropolitan area in the Americas]].\n\nLima was named by natives in the agricultural region known by native Peruvians as Limaq, a name that it had acquired over time. It became the capital and most important city in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Following the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], it became the capital of the Republic of Peru (Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa). Around one-third of the national population lives in the [[Lima Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]].\n\nLima is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The [[National University of San Marcos]], founded on 12 May 1551, during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Spanish colonial empire]], is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas.\n\nNowadays the city is considered as the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of the country. Internationally, it is one of the [[List of urban areas by population|thirty most populated urban agglomerations in the world]]. Due to its geostrategic importance, it has been defined as a \"beta\" city.\n\nJurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller portion, to the west, within the constitutional province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Ch\u00e1vez airport are located. Both provinces have regional autonomy since 2002.\n\nIn October 2013, Lima was chosen to host the [[2019 Pan American Games]], these games were held at venues in and around Lima, and were the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country. It also hosted the [[APEC]] Meetings of 2008 and 2016, the [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group]] in October 2015,  the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in December 2014, and the [[Miss Universe 1982]] contest.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Lima foundation.jpg|thumb|Lima Foundation by Francisco Pizarro (1535)|alt=|left]]\n\nAccording to early Spanish articles the Lima area was once called ''Itchyma'',{{cn|date=April 2020}} after its original inhabitants. However, even before the [[Inca]] occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the R\u00edmac valley had come to be known by visitors as ''Limaq'' ('''Limaq''', pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8li.m\u0251q|}}, which means \"talker\" or \"speaker\" in the [[Quechua II|coastal Quechua]] that was the area's primary language before the Spanish arrival). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted: the chronicles show \"L\u00edmac\" replacing \"Ychma\" as the common name for the area.<ref name=\"Limaq\">{{cite web|url=http://aymara.org/biblio/lima_etimologia.pdf|title=Limaq|accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nModern scholars speculate that the word \"Lima\" originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects [[stop consonant]]s in word-final position. Non-Peruvian Spanish speakers may mistakenly define the city name as the direct Spanish translation of \"[[Lime (fruit)|lime]]\", the citrus fruit.\n[[File:CATEDRAL DE LIMA (FISQUET 1846).jpg|thumb|Lima Cathedral in 1846]]\n\nThe city was founded in 1535 under the name City of [[Biblical Magi|Kings]] ({{Lang-es|link=no|Ciudad de los Reyes}}) because its foundation was decided on 6 January, date of the feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. This name quickly fell into disuse, and ''Lima'' became the city's name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both ''Lima'' and ''Ciudad de los Reyes'' can be seen together.\n\nThe river that feeds Lima is called ''R\u00edmac'' and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is \"Talking River\" (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua in which the word for \"talker\" was pronounced {{IPA-qu|\u02c8rim\u0251q|}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701034625/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Per%C3%BA-The-Incas-Country-226473.html |archive-date=2015-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the [[Cusco|Cuzco]] nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of [[Cusco Quechua|Cuzco Quechua]].\n\nLater, as the original inhabitants died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. Nowadays, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.<ref name=\"Limaq\" />\n\n==Symbols==\n===Flag===\nHistorically, the [[Flag of Lima]] has been known as the \"Banner of Peru's Kings' City\".<ref name=\"flag\">{{cite web|url=http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |title=Ciudad de Lima |editor=Heralatin.t35.com |access-date=11 February 2015 |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810152715/http://heralatin.t35.com/peru/lima.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref> It is made from a golden-colored silk canvas and embroidered in the center is its coat of arms.<ref name=\"flag\"/>\n\n===Anthem===\nLima's anthem was heard for the first time on 18 January 2008, in a formal meeting with important politicians, including [[List of Presidents of Peru|Peruvian President]] [[Alan Garc\u00eda]], and other authorities.

These generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from Andean storms arrive from the east.

They organized social clubs and built their own schools. Examples are [[Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The American School of Lima|The American-Peruvian school]], the [[Alliance fran\u00e7aise|Alianza Francesa de Lima]], the Lyc\u00e9e Franco-P\u00e9ruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; [[Markham College]], the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, [[Antonio Raymondi District]] Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also, several German-Peruvian schools.\n\nChinese and a lesser number of Japanese came to Lima and established themselves in the [[Barrios Altos]] neighborhood in downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their [[Chinatown, Lima|Chinatown]] as ''Calle Capon'' and the city's ubiquitous [[Chifa]] restaurants{{spaced ndash}}small, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisine{{spaced ndash}}can be found by the dozens in this enclave.\n\nIn 2014, the National Institute for Statistics and Information (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica e Informatica) reported that the population in Lima's 49 districts was 9,752,000 people, including the Constitutional Province of Callao. The city and (metropolitan area) represents around 29% of the national population. Of the city's population 48.7% are men and 51.3% are women. The 49 districts in Metropolitan Lima are divided into 5 areas: Cono Norte (North Lima), Lima Este (East Lima), Constitutional Province of Callao, Lima Centro (Central Lima) and Lima Sur (South Lima). The largest areas are Lima Norte with 2,475,432 people and Lima Este with 2,619,814 people, including the largest single district San Juan de Lurigancho, which hosts 1 million people.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\" />\n\nLima is considered a \"young\" city. According to INEI, by mid 2014 the age distribution in Lima was: 24.3% between 0 and 14, 27.2% between 15 and 29, 22.5% between 30 and 44, 15.4% between 45 and 59 and 10.6% above 60.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nMigration to Lima from the rest of Peru is substantial. In 2013, 3,480,000 people reported arriving from other regions. This represents almost 36% of the entire population of Metropolitan Lima. The three regions that supply most of the migrants are Junin, Ancash and Ayacucho. By contrast only 390,000 emigrated from Lima to other regions.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nThe annual population growth rate is 1.57%. Some of the 43 metropolitan districts are considerably more populous than others. For example, San Juan de Lurigancho, San Martin de Porres, Ate, Comas, Villa El Salvador and Villa Maria del Triunfo host more than 400,000, while San Luis, San Isidro, Magdalena del Mar, Lince and Barranco have less than 60,000 residents.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nA 2005 household survey study shows a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6,000 soles (around US$1,840) or more for socioeconomic level A; between 2,000 soles (US$612) and 6,000 soles (US$1,840) for level B; from 840 soles (US$257) to 2,000 soles (US$612) for level C; from 420 soles (US$128) to 1200 soles (US$368) for level D; and up to 840 soles (US$257) for level E. In Lima, 18% were in level E; 32.3% in level D; 31.7% in level C; 14.6% in level B; and 3.4% in level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 soles (or US$612) monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apeim.com.pe/wp-content/themes/apeim/docs/nse/APEIM-NSE-2003-2004-LIMA.pdf|title=Niveles socioecon\u00f3micos en Lima Metropolitana y Callao \u2013 APEIM |trans-title=Socioeconomic levels in Metropolitan Lima and Callao \u2013 APEIM |publisher=Asociaci\u00f3n Peruana de Empresas de Investigaci\u00f3n de Mercados|language=es|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the percentage of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The level of poverty is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The level of poverty has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%).

It is the country's largest airport hosting the largest number of domestic and international passengers.\nIt serves as the fourth-largest hub in the Latin American air network. Lima possesses five other airports: the Las Palmas Air Force Base, Collique Airport and runways in [[Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar (Peru)|Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar]], [[San Bartolo District|San Bartolo]] and [[Chilca]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gc.kls2.com/|title=Great Circle Mapper|publisher=Gc.kls2.com|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Road===\n{{Details|Highways in Peru}}\nLima is a major stop on the [[Pan-American Highway]]. Because of its location on the country's central coast, Lima is an important junction in Peru's highway system. Three major highways originate in Lima.\n*The [[Peru Highway 1|Northern Panamerican Highway]] extends more than {{convert|1330|km|mi|sp=us}} to the border with Ecuador connecting the northern districts and with many major cities along the northern Peruvian coast.\n*The Central Highway ({{lang-es|Carretera Central|links=no}}) connects the eastern districts and with cities in central Peru. The highway extends {{convert|860|km|mi|sp=us}} with its terminus at the city of [[Pucallpa]] near Brazil.\n*The [[Peru Highway 1|Southern Panamerican Highway]] connects the southern districts and to cities on the southern coast. The highway extends {{convert|1450|km|mi|sp=us}} to the border with Chile.\n\nThe city has one big bus terminal next to the mall Plaza Norte. This bus station is the point of departure and arrival point for national and international destinations. Other bus stations serve private bus companies around the city. In addition, informal bus stations are located in the south, center and north of the city.\n\n===Maritime===\n[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Port of [[Callao]].]]\nLima's proximity to the port of [[Callao]] allows Callao to act as the metropolitan area's major port and one of Latin America's largest. Callao hosts nearly all maritime transport for the metropolitan area. A small port in [[Lur\u00edn District|Lur\u00edn]] serves oil tankers due to a nearby refinery. Maritime transport inside Lima city limits is relatively insignificant compared to that of Callao.\n\n===Rail===\nLima is connected to the Central Andean region by the [[Ferrocarril Central Andino]] which runs from Lima through the departments of [[Jun\u00edn Region|Jun\u00edn]], [[Huancavelica Region|Huancavelica]], [[Pasco Region|Pasco]] and [[Hu\u00e1nuco Region|Hu\u00e1nuco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrocarrilcentral.com.pe/index_.php|title=Ferrocarril Central Andino S.A.|publisher=Ferrocarrilcentral.com.pe|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref> Major cities along this line include [[Huancayo]], [[La Oroya]], [[Huancavelica]] and [[Cerro de Pasco]].

Lima operates a network of nine freeways \u2013 the Via Expresa Paseo de la Republica, Via Expresa Javier Prado, Via Expresa Grau, Panamericana Norte, Panamericana Sur, Carretera Central, Via Expresa Callao, Autopista Chillon Trapiche and the Autopista Ramiro Priale.<ref name=\"arqandina.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arqandina.com/pages/p4/f413.htm|title=Periodo 1945\u20131965 \u2013 Galer\u00eda de Fotos y Planos|publisher=Arqandina.com|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"arqandina.com\"/>\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey, the majority of the population uses public or collective transportation (75.6%), while 12.3% uses a car, taxi or motorcycle.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\nThe urban transport system is composed of over 652 transit routes<ref name=\"proinversion.gob.pe\"/> that are served by buses, microbuses and combis. The system is unorganized and is characterized by its informality. The service is run by 464 private companies that are poorly regulated by local government. Fares average one [[Peruvian nuevo sol|sol]] or {{USD|0.40}}.\n\nTaxis are mostly informal and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary in size from small four-door compacts to large vans. They account for a large part of the car stock. In many cases they are just a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. Additionally, several companies provide on-call taxi service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/lima/2868020156.html|title=Lima : Planning a Trip: Getting Around|publisher=Frommers.com|date=28 July 2008|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Colectivos====\n[[Colectivo]]s render express service on some major roads. The colectivos signal their specific destination with a sign on their windshield. Their routes are not generally publicitized but are understood by frequent users. The cost is generally higher than public transport; however, they cover greater distances at greater speeds due to the lack of stops.

The goal is to reduce passengers' commute times, protect the environment, provide improved security and overall quality of service. Metropolitano was executed with funds from the City of Lima and financing from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and the [[World Bank]]. Metropolitana is the first BRT system to operate with natural gas, seeking to reduce air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metropolitano.com.pe|title=Metropolitano}}</ref> This system links the principal points of the Lima Metropolitan Area. The first phase of this project has {{convert|33|km}} of line (north) to [[Chorrillos District|Chorrillos]] (south). It began commercial operations on 28 July 2010.

It begins in the Industrial Park of Villa El Salvador, south of the city, continuing on to Av. Pachac\u00fatec in Villa Mar\u00eda del Triunfo and then to Av. Los H\u00e9roes in San Juan de Miraflores. Afterwards, it continues through Av. Tom\u00e1s Marsano in Surco to reach Ov. Los Cabitos, to Av. Aviaci\u00f3n and then cross the river Rimac to finish, after almost {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}}, in the east of the capital in [[San Juan de Lurigancho]]. The system operates 24 trains, each with six wagons. Each wagon has the capacity to transport 233 people. The metro system began operating in December 2012 and transported 78,224 people on average on a daily basis.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\" />\n\n===Other transportation issues===\nLima has high traffic congestion, especially at peak hours. 1 million 397 thousand vehicles were in use by the end of 2012. The region operates 65.3% of the cars in the country.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\nThe Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) offered economic incentives for municipalities to implement bicycle routes in their districts. Recreational bike lanes can be found in 39 districts. The Proyecto Especial Metropolitano de Transporte No Motorizado (PEMTNM) estimates that more than a million and a half people used the bike lanes in 2012. The bike lanes ran for {{convert|71|km|0|abbr=on}}. They estimate that the use of the bike lanes prevented the emission of 526 tons of carbon dioxide in 2012.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\nSan Borja district was the first to implement a bike-share program called San Borja en Bici. It supplied 200 bicycles and six stations across the district (two of them connecting with the Metro). By December 2012, the program had 2,776 subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munisanborja.gob.pe/bicisanborja/|title=:::.- San Borja en Bici -.:::|work=munisanborja.gob.pe}}</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\n===Environment===\n====Air====\nLima suffers most from air pollution. The sedimentary dust has solid particles that settle as dust on different surfaces or float through the air. The fine particles are the most dangerous given that they are able to damage human respiratory systems. The recommended limit of these particles by the [[World Health Organization]] is 5 tons/km2/month. In February 2014, Lima recorded an average of 15.2 tons/km2. The two districts with the highest concentration of sedimentary dust are El Agustino (46.1 tons/km2) and Independencia (25.5 tons/km2) in February 2014.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/boletines/estadisticas-ambientales-febrero-2014.pdf |title=Estad\u00edsticas Ambientales |date=February 2014 |website=inei.gob.pe |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nLima has built [[billboard]]s which serve as [[air purifier]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/84013/this-billboard-sucks-pollution-from-the-sky-and-returns-purified-air/|title=This Billboard Sucks Pollution from the Sky and Returns Purified Air|last=Peckham|first=Matt|date=May 1, 2014|website=Time|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\n====Water====\nThe permissible limit of lead in the water supply is 0.05 milligrams per liter, according to the Norm ITINTEC. In January 2014, the concentration of minerals in water treatment facilities of SEDAPAL was 0.051 iron, 0.005 lead, 0.0012 cadmium and 0.0810 aluminum. These values increased 15.9% and 33.3% in iron and cadmium with respect to January 2013 and a decrease of 16.7% and 12.4% in lead and aluminum. The values are within the recommended limits.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Solid waste====\nThe amount of solid waste produced per capita in Lima is about {{convert|0.7|kg|0|abbr=on}} per day. In 2012, each resident produced {{convert|273.36|kg|0|abbr=on}} of solid waste. The district municipalities only collect about 67% of the solid waste they generate. The rest ends up in informal landfills, rivers, or the ocean. Three municipalities recycle 20% or more of their waste.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\n===Access to basic services===\nIn Lima, 93% of households have access to water supply in their homes. In addition, 92% of homes connect with sewage systems. 99.6% of homes have grid electric service. Although most households have water and sewage systems, some are available for only a few hours a day.<ref name=\"limacomovamos.org\"/>\n\n===Security===\n[[File:Lima from above.jpg|left|thumb|San Isidro, Lima from above.]]\nThe perception of security varies by district. For example, San Isidro has the lowest perception of insecurity (21.4%), while Rimac has the highest perception of insecurity (85%), according to a 2012 survey. The five districts with the lowest perception of insecurity are San Isidro, San Borja, Miraflores, La Molina and Jesus Maria. The districts with the highest perception of insecurity are Rimac, San Juan de Miraflores, La Victoria, Comas and Ate.<ref name=\"ciudadnuestra.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ciudadnuestra.org/segunda_encuesta_nacional_urbana_de_victimizacion_2012___peru.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606042705/http://ciudadnuestra.org/segunda_encuesta_nacional_urbana_de_victimizacion_2012___peru.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-06-06|title=Ciudad Nuestra \u2013 Segunda Encuesta Nacional Urbana de Victimizaci\u00f3n 2012 Per\u00fa|website=ciudadnuestra.org|language=es}}</ref>\n\nOverall, 40% of the population in Lima above 15 years old has been a crime victim. The younger population (ages 15 to 29 years old) has the highest victimization rate (47.9%).<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/> In 2012, citizens reported thefts (47.9%): in homes or establishments (19.4%), robbery or attack (14.9%), gang aggression (5.7%), among others in lesser frequency. The districts with the highest level of victimization are Rimac, El Agustino, Villa El Salvador, San Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos. The safest districts by level of victimization are Lurin, Lurigancho-Chosica, San Borja, Magdalena and Surquillo. These districts do not necessarily correspond to the districts with highest or lowest perception of insecurity.<ref name=\"ciudadnuestra.org\"/>\n\nWhile the Police force is nationally controlled and funded, each district in Lima has a community policing structure called Serenazgo. The quantity of Serenazgos officials and resources varies by district. For example, Villa Maria del Triunfo has 5,785 citizens per official. Twenty-two districts in Lima have a ratio above 1000 citizens per Serenazgo official, while 14 districts have ratios below 200 citizens per official, including Miraflores with 119 and San Isidro with 57.<ref name=\"inei.gob.pe\"/>\n\nThe satisfaction with the Serenazgos also varies greatly by district. The highest satisfaction rates can be found in San Isidro (88.3%), Miraflores (81.6%), San Borja (77%) and Surco (75%). The lowest satisfaction rates can be found in Villa Maria del Triunfo (11%), San Juan de Miraflores (14.8%), Rimac (16.3%) and La Victoria (20%).<ref name=\"ciudadnuestra.org\"/>\n\n==Notable people from Lima==\n{{See also|List of people from Lima}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n[[File:Santa_Rosa_de_Lima_Ebrafol.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Rosa de Lima|St. Rose of Lima]] 1586\u20131617]]\n||\n[[File:San Martin de Porres huaycan.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[St. Martin de Porres]], 1579\u20131639]]\n||\n[[File:Palma1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Ricardo Palma]], writer, 1833\u20131919]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Mario Testino.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Mario Testino]], celebrity photographer]]\n||\n[[File:Gaston acurio.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gaston Acurio]], Chef of Peruvian Cuisine]]\n||\n[[File:Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (1982).jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], Former UN Secretary General]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Carlos Noriega.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Carlos Noriega]], US-Peruvian Astronaut]]\n||\n[[File:Bayly Jaime IMGP3054.JPG|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Jaime Bayly]], journalist]]\n||\n[[File:Christian Meier in 2 October 2015.png|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Christian Meier]], Peruvian actor]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Gian Marco.png|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gian Marco Zignago]] Singer, Songwriter]]\n||\n[[File:Gise 6gala.png|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Gisela Valcarcel]] Television Hostess]]\n||\n[[File:Florez Juan Diego-4300 (16960810518) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Juan Diego Florez]], Tenor Opera Singer]]\n|-\n|\n[[File:Eva ayllon 2010.jpg|thumb|center|upright=0.7|[[Eva Ayllon]], AfroPeruvian Singer]]\n||\n[[File:Claudia Llosa (111).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Claudia Llosa]], film director, writer and producer.]]\n|}\n\n*[[Rose of Lima]] (First Catholic in the Americas to be declared a saint)\n*[[Martin de Porres]] (Patron saint of mixed-race people)\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Baqu\u00edjano y Carrillo, Count of Vistaflorida]] (Economist, jurist, writer and politician of the Viceroyalty of Peru)\n*[[Francisco Antonio de Zela]] (Revolutionary against Spanish domination)\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Olaya]] (Afro-Peruvian hero)\n*[[Ricardo Palma]] (Writer)\n*[[Jose de la Riva Aguero]] (First Head State of Peru)\n*[[Mario Testino]] (Celebrity Photographer)\n*[[Gaston Acurio]] (Chef Ambassador of Peruvian Cuisine)\n*[[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peruvian writer \u2013 Nobel Prize winner of literature)\n*[[Juan Diego Florez]] (Opera Singer \u2013 Tenor)\n*[[Carlos Noriega]] (NASA Astronaut)\n*[[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] (Diplomat, Politician and former UN Secretary General)\n*[[Eva Ayllon]] (Afro-Peruvian Singer)\n*[[Paolo Guerrero]] (Soccer player)\n*[[Saby Kamalich]] (Actress)\n*[[Christian Meier]] (Actor, singer, model, businessman)\n*[[Jaime Cuadra]] (Music producer, composer, singer and voiceover artist)\n*[[Mar\u00eda Rostworowski]] (Historian)\n*[[Fernando de Szyszlo]] (Painter, Sculptor)\n*[[Jaime Bayly]] (Writer, Journalist)\n*[[Gian Marco Zignago]] (Singer-Songwriter)\n*[[Iv\u00e1n Thays]] (Author, professor and television host)\n*[[Luis Llosa]] (Film Director)\n*[[Jefferson Farfan]] (Soccer player)\n*[[Madeleine Truel]] (French-Peruvian who helped people from Nazis)\n*[[Gisela Valcarcel]] (Television hostess)\n*[[Alex Valle]] (Peruvian American professional fighting game player)\n*[[Valentina Shevchenko (fighter)|Valentina Shevchenko]] (Kyrgyzstani-Peruvian Mixed Martial Artist fighting out of Lima)\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in South America}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities===\nLima is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>Sister Cities International, [http://www.sister-cities.org/icrc/directory/Americas/Peru Online Directory: Peru, Americas].

While the commentarial tradition downplayed the importance of the ''Brahma-vihara'', Gombrich notes that the Buddhist usage of the ''brahma-vih\u0101ra'' originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to \"living with Brahman\" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as \"living with Brahman\" by rebirth in the Brahma-world.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=84-85}} According to Gombrich, \"the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=62}}\n\nAlexander Wynne states that the ''dhyana''-scheme is poorly understood.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as ''sati'', ''sampaj\u0101no'', and ''upekkh\u0101'', are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects:{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}}\n{{quote|Thus the expression ''sato sampaj\u0101no'' in the third ''jh\u0101na'' must denote a state of awareness different from the meditative absorption of the second ''jh\u0101na'' (''cetaso ekodibh\u0101va''). It suggests that the subject is doing something different from remaining in a meditative state, i.e. that he has come out of his absorption and is now once again aware of objects. The same is true of the word ''upek(k)h\u0101'': it does not denote an abstract 'equanimity', [but] it means to be aware of something and indifferent to it [...] The third and fourth ''jh\u0101na-s'', as it seems to me, describe the process of directing states of meditative absorption towards the mindful awareness of objects.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107}}}}\n\nThanissaro Bhikkhu, a western teacher in the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], argues that the ''Visuddhimagga'' deviates from the Pali Canon in its description of the jhanas, and warns against the development of strong states of concentration.{{sfn|Quli|2008}} Arbel describes the fourth ''jhana'' as \"non-reactive and lucid awareness,\" not as a state of deep concentration.{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}\n\n===The ''arupas''===\n{{See also|Formless Realm}}\n\nGrouped into the ''jhana''-scheme are four meditative states, referred to in the early texts as ''arupas''. These are also referred to in commentarial literature as immaterial/formless ''jh\u0101nas'' (''ar\u016bpajh\u0101nas''), also translated as The Formless Dimensions, in distinction from the first four ''jh\u0101nas'' (''r\u016bpa jh\u0101nas''). In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word \"''jh\u0101na''\" is never explicitly used to denote them, they are instead referred to as ''[[\u0101yatana]]''. However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four ''jh\u0101nas'' (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jh\u0101nas. The immaterial are related to, or derived from, yogic meditation, while the ''jhanas'' proper are related to the cultivation of the mind. The state of complete dwelling in emptiness is reached when the eighth ''jh\u0101na'' is transcended.\n\nThe four ''arupas'' are:\n* ''fifth jh\u0101na:'' infinite space (Pali ''\u0101k\u0101s\u0101na\u00f1c\u0101yatana'', Skt. ''\u0101k\u0101\u015b\u0101nanty\u0101yatana''),\n* ''sixth jh\u0101na:'' infinite consciousness (Pali ''vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u00f1c\u0101yatana'', Skt. ''vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101nanty\u0101yatana''),\n* ''seventh jh\u0101na:'' infinite nothingness (Pali ''\u0101ki\u00f1ca\u00f1\u00f1\u0101yatana'', Skt. ''\u0101ki\u1e43cany\u0101yatana''),\n* ''eighth jh\u0101na:'' neither perception nor non-perception (Pali ''nevasa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101yatana'', Skt. ''naivasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101yatana'').\n\nAlthough the \"Dimension of Nothingness\" and the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\" are included in the list of nine ''jh\u0101nas'' taught by the Buddha (see section on ''Nirodha-Samapatti'' below), they are not included in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the ''jh\u0101nas'', the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\n===Nirodha-sam\u0101patti===\nBeyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception lies a state called Nirodha sam\u0101patti, the \"cessation of perception, feelings and consciousness\".<ref name=\"Anuppada Sutta, MN#111\">Majjhima NIkaya 111, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.111.than.html ''Anuppada Sutta'']</ref>\nOnly in commentarial and scholarly literature this sometimes is called the \"ninth jh\u0101na\".<ref name=\"Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135\">Steven Sutcliffe, ''Religion: Empirical Studies.''

According to this story, he learned two kinds of meditation, which did not lead to enlightenment. He then underwent harsh ascetic practices with which he eventually also became disillusioned. The Buddha then recalled a meditative state he entered by chance as a child:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}\n{{quote|I thought: 'I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, then \u2014 quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities \u2014 I entered & remained in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. Could that be the path to Awakening?' Then following on that memory came the realization: 'That is the path to Awakening.'{{sfn|Nanamoli|1995}}}}\n\nOriginally the practice of dhyana itself may have constituted the core liberating practice of early Buddhism, since in this state all \"pleasure and pain\" had waned.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} According to Vetter, \n{{quote|[P]robably the word \"immortality\" (a-mata) was used by the Buddha for the first interpretation of this experience and not the term cessation of suffering that belongs to the four noble truths [...] the Buddha did not achieve the experience of salvation by discerning the four noble truths and/or other data. But his experience must have been of such a nature that it could bear the interpretation \"achieving immortality\".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5-6}}}}\n\n===Brahmanical influences===\nAlexander Wynne attempted to find parallels in Brahmanical texts to the meditative goals the two teachers claimed to have taught, drawing especially on some of the Upanishads and the Mokshadharma chapter of the Mahabharata.{{sfn|Wynne|2007}}\n\n====Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama====\nThe suttas describe how the Buddha learned meditative practices from two teachers, Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama. Alex Wynne argues that Uddaka Ramaputta belonged to the pre-Buddhist tradition portrayed by the Buddhist and Brahmanic sources, in which the philosophical formulations of the early Upanishads were accepted, and the meditative state of \"neither perception nor non-perception\" was equated with the self.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=44, see also 45\u201349}} Wynne further argues that the goal of Alara Kalama was a Brahminical concept. Evidence in the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' and the ''Taittiriya Upanishad'' suggests that a different early Brahminic philosophical tradition held the view that the unmanifest state of Brahman was a form of non-existence.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=196}} According to Wynne it thus seems likely that both element and formless meditation was learned by the Buddha from his two teachers, and adapted by him to his own system.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=50}}{{refn|group=note|According to Bronkhorst, the account of the Buddha practicing under Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama is entirely fictitious, and meant to flesh out the mentioning of those names in the post-enlightenment narrative in Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}<ref name=\"Vishvapani\" /> According to Bronkhorst, the Buddha's teachings developed primarily in response to Jain teachings, not Brahmanical teachings.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}}}\n\n====Brahmanical practices====\n\n=====Formless spheres=====\nIt appears that in early Brahminic yoga, the formless spheres were attained following element meditation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=56}} This is also taught as an option in the early Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=29-31}} The primary method taught to achieve the formless attainment in early Buddhist scriptures, on the other hand, is to proceed to the sphere of infinite space following the fourth ''jh\u0101na''.<ref>Henepola Gunaratana, ''The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation.'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html].</ref>\n\n=====Reversal of the creation of the world=====\nWynne claimed that Brahminic passages on meditation suggest that the most basic presupposition of early Brahmanical yoga is that the creation of the world must be reversed, through a series of meditative states, by the yogin who seeks the realization of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|self]].{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=41, 56}} These states were given doctrinal background in early Brahminic cosmologies, which classified the world into successively coarser strata. One such stratification is found at [[Taittiriya Upanishad|TU]] II.1 and [[Mahabharata|Mbh]] XII.195, and proceeds as follows: [[Atman (Hinduism)|self]], space, wind, fire, water, earth. Mbh XII.224 gives alternatively: [[Brahman]], mind, space, wind, fire, water, earth.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=49}}\n\nIn Brahmanical thought, the meditative states of consciousness were thought to be identical to the subtle strata of the cosmos.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=42}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da#Commentary on Vedic cosmogeny]].}} There is no similar theoretical background to element meditation in the early Buddhist texts, where [[Mahabhuta|the elements]] appear simply as suitable objects of meditation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=39}} It is likely that the Brahmanic practices of element-meditation were borrowed and adapted by early Buddhists, with the original Brahmanic ideology of the practices being discarded in the process.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=41}}\n\n=====Investigation of self=====\nOn this point, it is thought that the uses of the elements in early Buddhist literature have in general very little connection to Brahmanical thought; in most places they occur in teachings where they form the objects of a detailed contemplation of the human being. The aim of these contemplations seems to have been to bring about the correct understanding that the various perceived aspects of a human being, when taken together, nevertheless do not comprise a 'self'.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=35}} Moreover, the self is conceptualized in terms similar to both \"nothingness\"  and \"neither perception nor non-perception\" at different places in early Upanishadic literature.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe latter corresponds to [[Yajnavalkya]]\u2019s definition of the self in his famous dialogue with Maitreyi in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' and the definition given in the post-Buddhist ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''. This is mentioned as a claim of non-Buddhist ascetics and Brahmins in the ''Pa\u00f1cattaya Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 102.2).<ref>M II.228.16 ff according to the PTS numbering.</ref>{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=43}} In the same dialogue in the ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', Yajnavalkya draws the conclusions that the self that is neither perceptive nor non-perceptive is a state of consciousness without object. The early Buddhist evidence suggests much the same thing for the eighth absorption or ''jh\u0101na'', the state of \"neither perception nor non-perception\".{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=43}} It is a state without an object of awareness, that is not devoid of awareness.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=44}} The ninth ''jh\u0101na'' that is sometimes said to be beyond this state, the \"cessation of perception and sensation\", is devoid not only of objectivity, [[Nibbana#Transcendent knowing|but of subjectivity as well]].{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=99}}\n\n====Criticism of Wynne====\nThe Brahmanical texts cited by Wynne assumed their final form long after the Buddha's lifetime.

Koans can be used to provoke the \"great doubt\", and test a student's progress in Zen practice.\n\nK\u014dan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), [[kinhin]] (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. K\u014dan practice is particularly emphasized by the Japanese [[Rinzai school]], but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.{{sfn|Loori|2006}}\n\nThe Zen student's mastery of a given k\u014dan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as ''dokusan'' (\u72ec\u53c2), ''daisan'' (\u4ee3\u53c2), or ''sanzen'' (\u53c2\u7985)). While there is no unique answer to a k\u014dan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the k\u014dan and of Zen through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}\n\n===Vajray\u0101na===\n[[B.

While the commentarial tradition downplayed the importance of the ''Brahma-vihara'', Gombrich notes that the Buddhist usage of the ''brahma-vih\u0101ra'' originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to \"living with Brahman\" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as \"living with Brahman\" by rebirth in the Brahma-world.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=84-85}} According to Gombrich, \"the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=62}}\n\nAlexander Wynne states that the ''dhyana''-scheme is poorly understood.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as ''sati'', ''sampaj\u0101no'', and ''upekkh\u0101'', are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}} whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects:{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106}}\n{{quote|Thus the expression ''sato sampaj\u0101no'' in the third ''jh\u0101na'' must denote a state of awareness different from the meditative absorption of the second ''jh\u0101na'' (''cetaso ekodibh\u0101va''). It suggests that the subject is doing something different from remaining in a meditative state, i.e. that he has come out of his absorption and is now once again aware of objects. The same is true of the word ''upek(k)h\u0101'': it does not denote an abstract 'equanimity', [but] it means to be aware of something and indifferent to it [...] The third and fourth ''jh\u0101na-s'', as it seems to me, describe the process of directing states of meditative absorption towards the mindful awareness of objects.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107}}}}\n\nThanissaro Bhikkhu, a western teacher in the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], argues that the ''Visuddhimagga'' deviates from the Pali Canon in its description of the jhanas, and warns against the development of strong states of concentration.{{sfn|Quli|2008}} Arbel describes the fourth ''jhana'' as \"non-reactive and lucid awareness,\" not as a state of deep concentration.{{sfn|Arbel|2017}}\n\n===The ''arupas''===\n{{See also|Formless Realm}}\n\nGrouped into the ''jhana''-scheme are four meditative states, referred to in the early texts as ''arupas''. These are also referred to in commentarial literature as immaterial/formless ''jh\u0101nas'' (''ar\u016bpajh\u0101nas''), also translated as The Formless Dimensions, in distinction from the first four ''jh\u0101nas'' (''r\u016bpa jh\u0101nas''). In the Buddhist canonical texts, the word \"''jh\u0101na''\" is never explicitly used to denote them, they are instead referred to as ''[[\u0101yatana]]''. However, they are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four ''jh\u0101nas'' (other texts. e.g. MN 121 treat them as a distinct set of attainments) and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jh\u0101nas. The immaterial are related to, or derived from, yogic meditation, while the ''jhanas'' proper are related to the cultivation of the mind. The state of complete dwelling in emptiness is reached when the eighth ''jh\u0101na'' is transcended.\n\nThe four ''arupas'' are:\n* ''fifth jh\u0101na:'' infinite space (Pali ''\u0101k\u0101s\u0101na\u00f1c\u0101yatana'', Skt.

Noble Path number eight is \"Samma Samadhi\" (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered \"Right Concentration\". If he takes a disciple through all the ''jh\u0101nas'', the emphasis is on the \"Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions\" rather than stopping short at the \"Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception\".\n\n===Nirodha-sam\u0101patti===\nBeyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception lies a state called Nirodha sam\u0101patti, the \"cessation of perception, feelings and consciousness\".<ref name=\"Anuppada Sutta, MN#111\">Majjhima NIkaya 111, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.111.than.html ''Anuppada Sutta'']</ref>\nOnly in commentarial and scholarly literature this sometimes is called the \"ninth jh\u0101na\".<ref name=\"Steven Sutcliffe 2004, page 135\">Steven Sutcliffe, ''Religion: Empirical Studies.''

According to this story, he learned two kinds of meditation, which did not lead to enlightenment. He then underwent harsh ascetic practices with which he eventually also became disillusioned. The Buddha then recalled a meditative state he entered by chance as a child:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}\n{{quote|I thought: 'I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was working, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, then \u2014 quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful mental qualities \u2014 I entered & remained in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. Could that be the path to Awakening?' Then following on that memory came the realization: 'That is the path to Awakening.'{{sfn|Nanamoli|1995}}}}\n\nOriginally the practice of dhyana itself may have constituted the core liberating practice of early Buddhism, since in this state all \"pleasure and pain\" had waned.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{Page needed|date=March 2015}} According to Vetter, \n{{quote|[P]robably the word \"immortality\" (a-mata) was used by the Buddha for the first interpretation of this experience and not the term cessation of suffering that belongs to the four noble truths [...] the Buddha did not achieve the experience of salvation by discerning the four noble truths and/or other data. But his experience must have been of such a nature that it could bear the interpretation \"achieving immortality\".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5-6}}}}\n\n===Brahmanical influences===\nAlexander Wynne attempted to find parallels in Brahmanical texts to the meditative goals the two teachers claimed to have taught, drawing especially on some of the Upanishads and the Mokshadharma chapter of the Mahabharata.{{sfn|Wynne|2007}}\n\n====Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama====\nThe suttas describe how the Buddha learned meditative practices from two teachers, Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama. Alex Wynne argues that Uddaka Ramaputta belonged to the pre-Buddhist tradition portrayed by the Buddhist and Brahmanic sources, in which the philosophical formulations of the early Upanishads were accepted, and the meditative state of \"neither perception nor non-perception\" was equated with the self.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=44, see also 45\u201349}} Wynne further argues that the goal of Alara Kalama was a Brahminical concept. Evidence in the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' and the ''Taittiriya Upanishad'' suggests that a different early Brahminic philosophical tradition held the view that the unmanifest state of Brahman was a form of non-existence.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=196}} According to Wynne it thus seems likely that both element and formless meditation was learned by the Buddha from his two teachers, and adapted by him to his own system.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=50}}{{refn|group=note|According to Bronkhorst, the account of the Buddha practicing under Uddaka Ramaputta and Alara Kalama is entirely fictitious, and meant to flesh out the mentioning of those names in the post-enlightenment narrative in Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}<ref name=\"Vishvapani\" /> According to Bronkhorst, the Buddha's teachings developed primarily in response to Jain teachings, not Brahmanical teachings.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}}}\n\n====Brahmanical practices====\n\n=====Formless spheres=====\nIt appears that in early Brahminic yoga, the formless spheres were attained following element meditation.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=56}} This is also taught as an option in the early Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=29-31}} The primary method taught to achieve the formless attainment in early Buddhist scriptures, on the other hand, is to proceed to the sphere of infinite space following the fourth ''jh\u0101na''.<ref>Henepola Gunaratana, ''The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation.'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html].</ref>\n\n=====Reversal of the creation of the world=====\nWynne claimed that Brahminic passages on meditation suggest that the most basic presupposition of early Brahmanical yoga is that the creation of the world must be reversed, through a series of meditative states, by the yogin who seeks the realization of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|self]].{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=41, 56}} These states were given doctrinal background in early Brahminic cosmologies, which classified the world into successively coarser strata.

The aim of these contemplations seems to have been to bring about the correct understanding that the various perceived aspects of a human being, when taken together, nevertheless do not comprise a 'self'.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=35}} Moreover, the self is conceptualized in terms similar to both \"nothingness\"  and \"neither perception nor non-perception\" at different places in early Upanishadic literature.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe latter corresponds to [[Yajnavalkya]]\u2019s definition of the self in his famous dialogue with Maitreyi in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' and the definition given in the post-Buddhist ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.

The early Buddhist evidence suggests much the same thing for the eighth absorption or ''jh\u0101na'', the state of \"neither perception nor non-perception\".{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=43}} It is a state without an object of awareness, that is not devoid of awareness.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=44}} The ninth ''jh\u0101na'' that is sometimes said to be beyond this state, the \"cessation of perception and sensation\", is devoid not only of objectivity, [[Nibbana#Transcendent knowing|but of subjectivity as well]].{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=99}}\n\n====Criticism of Wynne====\nThe Brahmanical texts cited by Wynne assumed their final form long after the Buddha's lifetime.

According to Alexander Wynne, the ultimate aim of ''dhyana'' was the attainment of insight,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}} and the application of the meditative state to the practice of mindfulness.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}} According to Frauwallner, mindfulness was a means to prevent the arising of craving, which resulted simply from contact between the senses and their objects.

In this sense, samadhi and jhana are close in meaning.{{refn|group=note|Gunarathana refers to [[Buddhaghosa]], who explains samadhi etymologically as \"the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object [...] the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and unscattered (Vism.84\u201385; PP.85).\"<ref name=\"Guna\" />}} Nevertheless, they are not exactly identical, since \"certain differences in their suggested and contextual meanings prevent unqualified identification of the two terms.\" Samadhi signifies only one mental factor, namely one-pointedness, while the word \"jhana\" encompasses the whole state of consciousness, \"or at least the whole group of mental factors individuating that meditative state as a jhana.\"<ref name=\"Guna\" /> Furthermore, according to Gunaratana, samadhi involves \"a wider range of reference than jhana,\" noting that \"the Pali exegetical tradition recognizes three levels of samadhi: preliminary concentration (''parikammasamadhi'') [...] access concentration (''upacarasamadhi'') [...] and absorption concentration (''appanasamadhi'').\"<ref name=\"Guna\" />\n\n====Development and application of concentration====\nAccording to the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li canon]] commentary, access/neighbourhood concentration (''upac\u0101ra-sam\u0101dhi'') is a stage of meditation that the meditator reaches before entering into ''jh\u0101na''.

The word and the practice of meditation entered into Chinese through the translations of [[An Shigao]] (fl. c. 148\u2013180 CE), and [[Kum\u0101raj\u012bva]] (334\u2013413 CE), who translated [[Dhy\u0101na sutras]], which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the [[Yogacara]] meditation teachings of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] school of [[Kashmir]] circa 1st-4th centuries CE.<ref name=Deleanu>Deleanu, Florin (1992); [https://ahandfulofleaves.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mindfulness-of-breathing-in-the-dhayana-sutra_florin-deleanu_1992.pdf Mindfulness of Breathing in the Dhy\u0101na S\u016btras].

[[Hong Kong]], 1953.]]\n\nDuring sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the [[lotus position]], half-lotus, Burmese, or [[yoga]] postures, using the [[Mudra#Dhy.C4.81na Mudr.C4.81|dhy\u0101na]] [[mudra|mudr\u0101]]. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath or by bringing that awareness to the energy center below the navel (see also [[\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasati]]).<ref name=\"shengyen\">{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Meditation|last=Sheng|first=Yen|url=http://www.chancenter.org/chanctr/ddp/talks/zuochan.html}}</ref> Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. This practice may simply be called sitting dhy\u0101na, which is ''zu\u00f2ch\u00e1n'' (\u5750\u7985) in Chinese, and ''[[zazen]]'' (\u5750\u7985) in Japanese, ''jwaseon'' (\u5750\u7985) in Korean.\n\n=====Observing the mind=====\nIn the S\u014dt\u014d school of Zen, meditation with no objects, anchors, or content, is the primary form of practice. The meditator strives to be aware of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found throughout [[D\u014dgen]]'s ''Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d'', as for example in the \"Principles of Zazen\"<ref name=\"zazengi\">{{cite web|title=Zazengi translation|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|author=S\u014dt\u014d Zen Text Project|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=15 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022108/http://web.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.html|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the \"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\".<ref name=\"fukanzazengi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/gongyo_seiten/translations/part_3/fukan_zazengi.html|title=Fukan Zazengi|author=S\u014dt\u014d Zen Text Project|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2008-03-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429201213/http://www.stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/gongyo_seiten/translations/part_3/fukan_zazengi.html|archivedate=2008-04-29}}</ref> In the Japanese language, this practice is called ''[[Shikantaza]]''.\n\n====Insight====\n\n=====Pointing to the nature of the mind=====\nAccording to Charles Luk, in the earliest traditions of Ch\u00e1n, there was no fixed method or formula for teaching meditation, and all instructions were simply heuristic methods, to point to the true nature of the mind, also known as ''[[Buddha-nature]]''.<ref name=\"Luk\"/> According to Luk, this method is referred to as the \"Mind Dharma\", and exemplified in the story of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha holding up a flower silently, and [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa]] smiling as he understood.{{refn|group+note|See [[Flower Sermon]]}}<ref name=\"Luk\">Luk, Charles. ''The Secrets of Chinese Meditation.'' 1964. p. 44</ref> A traditional formula of this is, \"Ch\u00e1n points directly to the human mind, to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas.\"<ref>Nan, Huai-Chin. ''Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen.'' 1997. p. 92</ref>\n\n=====K\u014dan practice=====\n{{Main|K\u014dan}}\n[[File:Wu (negative).svg|thumb|right|upright|[[Chinese characters|Chinese character]] for \"[[Mu (negative)|nothing]]\" ({{CJKV|p=w\u00fa|r=mu|rr=mu}}). It figures in the famous ''Zhaozhou's dog'' [[k\u014dan]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the [[S\u00f2ng dynasty]], practice with the k\u014dan method became popular, whereas others practiced \"silent illumination.\"{{sfn|Blyth|1966}} This became the source of some differences in practice between the [[Linji school|L\u00ednj\u00ec]] and [[C\u00e1od\u00f2ng school]]s.\n\nA k\u014dan, literally \"public case\", is a story or dialogue, describing an interaction between a Zen master and a student. These anecdotes give a demonstration of the master's insight. Koans emphasize the non-conceptional insight that the Buddhist teachings are pointing to. Koans can be used to provoke the \"great doubt\", and test a student's progress in Zen practice.\n\nK\u014dan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), [[kinhin]] (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. K\u014dan practice is particularly emphasized by the Japanese [[Rinzai school]], but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.{{sfn|Loori|2006}}\n\nThe Zen student's mastery of a given k\u014dan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as ''dokusan'' (\u72ec\u53c2), ''daisan'' (\u4ee3\u53c2), or ''sanzen'' (\u53c2\u7985)). While there is no unique answer to a k\u014dan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the k\u014dan and of Zen through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}\n\n===Vajray\u0101na===\n[[B.

Snow Lion Publications: 2009 pg 264-5</ref> According to Wallace, one possible explanation for this situation is that virtually all Tibetan Buddhist meditators seek to become enlightened through the use of [[Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric practices]].

At the stage of ''pratyahara'', the consciousness of the individual is internalized in order that the sensations from the [[senses]] of taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell don't reach their respective centers in the brain and takes the ''[[sadhaka]]'' (practitioner) to next stages of [[Yoga]], namely [[Dharana]] (concentration), [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] (meditation), and [[Sam\u0101dhi (Buddhism)|Samadhi]] (mystical absorption), being the aim of all [[Yogic]] practices.<ref>[http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/Yogaplus/Article.aspx?id=934 Moving Inward: The Journey from Asana to Pratyahara] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719232925/http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/Yogaplus/Article.aspx?id=934 |date=July 19, 2011 }} ''[[Himalayan Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy]]''.</ref>\n\nThe Eight Limbs of the yoga sutras show Samadhi as one of its limbs.

Stretford borders [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] to the east, [[Urmston]] to the west, Salford to the north, and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] to the south. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] bisects the town.\n\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Lancashire]], in the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural village, known locally as Porkhampton due to the large number of pigs produced for the Manchester market. It was also an extensive market-gardening area, producing more than {{convert|500|LT|sigfig=3}} of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the [[Trafford Park]] industrial estate, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century. By 2001 less than one per cent of Stretford's population was employed in agriculture.\n\nStretford has been the home of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United Football Club]] since 1910, and of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] since 1864. Notable residents have included the industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire [[John Rylands]], the [[suffragette]] [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], the painter [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Morrissey]], [[Joy Division]] frontman [[Ian Curtis]] and [[Jay Kay]] of [[Jamiroquai]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the name Stretford is \"street\" ([[Old English]] ''str\u00e6t'') on a ford across the [[River Mersey]].{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|Gelling|Richards|1970|p=177|ps=none}} The principal road through Stretford, the [[A56 road|A56 Chester Road]], follows the line of the old [[Roman road]] from [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) to [[Mamucium]] ([[Manchester]]), crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge, built at the location of the ancient ford.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\nThe earliest evidence of human occupation around Stretford comes from [[Neolithic]] stone axes found in the area, dating from about 2000&nbsp;BC. Stretford was part of the land occupied by the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Brigantes]] tribe before and during the Roman occupation, and lay on their border with the [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] on the southern side of the Mersey.{{sfnp|Bayliss|1996|p=6|ps=none}} By 1212, there were two [[manorialism|manors]] in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by [[Hamon de Massey|Hamon de Mascy]], while the land in the north, closer to the [[River Irwell]], was held by Henry de Trafford.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=12|ps=none}} In about 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, since when the two manors descended together.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\n\nThe de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land, much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels. Although there is known to have been a papermill operating in 1765, the area remained largely rural until the early 20th-century development of [[Trafford Park]] in the Old Trafford district north of the town.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=13|ps=none}} Until then Stretford \"remained in the background of daily life in England\",{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}} except for a brief cameo role during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], when Crossford Bridge was destroyed to prevent a crossing by [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s army during its abortive advance on London; the bridge was quickly rebuilt.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}}\n\nUntil the 1820s one of Stretford's main cottage industries was the hand-weaving of cotton. There were reported at one time to have been 302&nbsp;handlooms operating in Stretford, providing employment for 780 workers, but by 1826 only four were still in use, as the mechanised cotton mills of nearby Manchester replaced handlooms.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=38|ps=none}} As Manchester continued to grow, it offered a good and easily accessible market for Stretford's agricultural products, in particular [[rhubarb]], once known locally as Stretford beef.{{sfnp|Massey|1976|pp=39, 57|ps=none}} By 1836 [[market gardening]] had become so extensive around Stretford that one writer described it as the \"garden of Lancashire\";{{sfnp|Scola|1992|p=97|ps=none}} in 1845 more than 500&nbsp;tons of vegetables were being produced for the Manchester market each week.{{sfnp|Scola|1992|p=105|ps=none}} Stretford also became well known for its pig market and the production of [[black pudding]]s, leading to the village being given the nickname of Porkhampton. A local dish, known as Stretford goose, was made from pork stuffed with sage and onions. During the 1830s, between 800 and 1,000 pigs a week were being slaughtered for the Manchester market.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nSituated on the border with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=23|ps=none}} Large recreation areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist [[John Dalton]], because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution.{{r|RBHS}} In 1857, the gardens hosted the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester 1857, a City of Industry |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/whats-on/art-treasures-in-detail/manchester-1857/ |access-date=16 January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of \u00a338,000 to house the 16,000&nbsp;exhibits.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=107|ps=none}} The gardens were also chosen as a site for the [[Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Manchester 1887|Royal Jubilee Exhibition]] of 1887, celebrating [[Queen Victoria]]'s 50-year reign.

Stretford borders [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] to the east, [[Urmston]] to the west, Salford to the north, and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] to the south. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] bisects the town.\n\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Lancashire]], in the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural village, known locally as Porkhampton due to the large number of pigs produced for the Manchester market. It was also an extensive market-gardening area, producing more than {{convert|500|LT|sigfig=3}} of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the [[Trafford Park]] industrial estate, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century. By 2001 less than one per cent of Stretford's population was employed in agriculture.\n\nStretford has been the home of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United Football Club]] since 1910, and of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] since 1864. Notable residents have included the industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire [[John Rylands]], the [[suffragette]] [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], the painter [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Morrissey]], [[Joy Division]] frontman [[Ian Curtis]] and [[Jay Kay]] of [[Jamiroquai]].\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the name Stretford is \"street\" ([[Old English]] ''str\u00e6t'') on a ford across the [[River Mersey]].{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|Gelling|Richards|1970|p=177|ps=none}} The principal road through Stretford, the [[A56 road|A56 Chester Road]], follows the line of the old [[Roman road]] from [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) to [[Mamucium]] ([[Manchester]]), crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge, built at the location of the ancient ford.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\nThe earliest evidence of human occupation around Stretford comes from [[Neolithic]] stone axes found in the area, dating from about 2000&nbsp;BC. Stretford was part of the land occupied by the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Brigantes]] tribe before and during the Roman occupation, and lay on their border with the [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] on the southern side of the Mersey.{{sfnp|Bayliss|1996|p=6|ps=none}} By 1212, there were two [[manorialism|manors]] in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by [[Hamon de Massey|Hamon de Mascy]], while the land in the north, closer to the [[River Irwell]], was held by Henry de Trafford.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=12|ps=none}} In about 1250, a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, since when the two manors descended together.{{r|TownshipsStretford}}\n\nThe de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land, much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels. Although there is known to have been a papermill operating in 1765, the area remained largely rural until the early 20th-century development of [[Trafford Park]] in the Old Trafford district north of the town.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=13|ps=none}} Until then Stretford \"remained in the background of daily life in England\",{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}} except for a brief cameo role during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], when Crossford Bridge was destroyed to prevent a crossing by [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s army during its abortive advance on London; the bridge was quickly rebuilt.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=15|ps=none}}\n\nUntil the 1820s one of Stretford's main cottage industries was the hand-weaving of cotton. There were reported at one time to have been 302&nbsp;handlooms operating in Stretford, providing employment for 780 workers, but by 1826 only four were still in use, as the mechanised cotton mills of nearby Manchester replaced handlooms.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=38|ps=none}} As Manchester continued to grow, it offered a good and easily accessible market for Stretford's agricultural products, in particular [[rhubarb]], once known locally as Stretford beef.{{sfnp|Massey|1976|pp=39, 57|ps=none}} By 1836 [[market gardening]] had become so extensive around Stretford that one writer described it as the \"garden of Lancashire\";{{sfnp|Scola|1992|p=97|ps=none}} in 1845 more than 500&nbsp;tons of vegetables were being produced for the Manchester market each week.{{sfnp|Scola|1992|p=105|ps=none}} Stretford also became well known for its pig market and the production of [[black pudding]]s, leading to the village being given the nickname of Porkhampton. A local dish, known as Stretford goose, was made from pork stuffed with sage and onions. During the 1830s, between 800 and 1,000 pigs a week were being slaughtered for the Manchester market.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nSituated on the border with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=23|ps=none}} Large recreation areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist [[John Dalton]], because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution.{{r|RBHS}} In 1857, the gardens hosted the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester 1857, a City of Industry |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/whats-on/art-treasures-in-detail/manchester-1857/ |access-date=16 January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of \u00a338,000 to house the 16,000&nbsp;exhibits.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=107|ps=none}} The gardens were also chosen as a site for the [[Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Manchester 1887|Royal Jubilee Exhibition]] of 1887, celebrating [[Queen Victoria]]'s 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than six&nbsp;months and was attended by more than 4.75&nbsp;million visitors.{{sfnp|Masterson|Cliff|2002|pp=107\u2013110|ps=none}} The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928.<ref>{{cite web |title=White City Track |publisher=UK Running Track Directory |url=http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=manchester-wc |access-date=9 January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref> There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all that remains is the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II [[listed building|listed structure]] in 1987.<ref>{{NHLE |desc=Entrance Portal and Lodges to Former White City Greyhound Track |num=1067874 |accessdate=9 January 2008 |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n===Industrialisation===\nThe arrival of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town&nbsp;\u2013 the first planned industrial estate in the world{{sfnp|Nicholls|1996|p=xiii|ps=none}}&nbsp;\u2013 had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.<ref>{{cite web |title=1901 Census of England and Wales |work=A Vision of Britain Through Time |publisher=Great Britain Historical GIS Project |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/table_page.jsp?tab_id=EW1901COU_M12&u_id=10075592&show=DB&min_c=1&max_c=5  |access-date=12 July 2007 |mode=cs2}}</ref>{{sfnp|Nevell|1997|p=24|ps=none}}\n\nDuring the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of [[mat\u00e9riel]], including the [[Avro Manchester]] heavy bomber, and the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines used to power both the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]].{{sfnp|Nicholls|1996|pp=103\u2013104|ps=none}}{{efn|The Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was made by Ford, under licence.
