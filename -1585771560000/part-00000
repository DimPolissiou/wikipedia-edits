The conflict was part of a wider rebel war in which revolutionary organizations of Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs all fought over Macedonia.

IMRO was declared as a Macedonian organization open to all ethnic groups in Macedonia and, earlier on, IMRO claimed that it was fighting for the [[Autonomy for Macedonia and Adrianople regions|autonomy of Macedonia]] and not for annexation to Bulgaria. However, according to some authors and historians, it later became an agent serving Bulgarian interests in Balkan politics with the aim of eventually uniting the  entirety of Macedonia with [[Bulgaria]], first in struggles against the Ottoman Empire and later against the Serbian-led Yugoslav successor state controlling the territory of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and the Greek state which controlled the territory of [[Aegean Macedonia]].<ref>Encyclopedia of terrorism, Cindy C.

The Bishop of [[Kastoria]], [[Germanos Karavangelis]] sent to Macedonia by the ambassador of Greece [[Nikolaos Mavrokordatos]] and the consul of Greece in [[Bitola|Monastiri]], [[Ion Dragoumis]], realised that it was time to act in a more efficient way and started organising Greek opposition.\n\nWhile Dragoumis concerned himself with the financial organisation of the efforts, the central figure in the military struggle was the very capable [[Cretan]] officer [[Georgios Katehakis]].<ref>Bulgarian Historical Review, vol 31, 1-4, 2003, p 117 \"Only a few days later -on November 1- Katehakis arrived in Macedonia as Melas' successor\"</ref> Bishop Germanos Karavangelis animated the [[Greek Macedonians|Greek population]] against the IMRO and formed committees to promote the Greek national interests.\n\nTaking advantage of the internal political and personal disputes in IMRO, Katehakis and Karavangelis initially succeeded to recruit some IMRO former members and to organize guerrilla groups, that were later reinforced with people sent from Greece and thus were mainly composed of ex-officers of the [[Hellenic Army]], volunteers brought from [[Crete]], from the [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] area of the Peloponnese, as well as [[Macedonian Greeks]], such as [[Nikolaos Manos]], [[Theodoros Adam]], [[Dimitrios Stagas]], [[Konstantinos Papastavrou]], [[Georgios Modis]], [[Athanasios Stavroudis]], [[Michael Sionidis]], [[Ioannis Ramnalis]], [[Zisis Verros]], [[Georgios Thomopoulos]], [[Iraklis Patikas]], [[Ioannis Simanikas]], [[Periklis Drakos]], [[Ioannis Martzios]], [[Dimitrios Golnas]], [[Petros Christou]], [[Charalambos Boufidis]], Slavophones such as Dimitris Dalipis and [[Evangelos Natsis]], and even former IMRO members such as [[Gonos Yotas]] and [[Kottas]].\n\n==Greek activity==\n[[File:\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 \u0394\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2.JPG|thumb|[[Periklis Drakos]] from [[Kavala]] with co-fighters]]\n[[File:Gono-Iotov-cheta.jpg|thumb|The band of slavophone [[Gonos Yotas]] fought with the Greek side.]]\n\nThe Greek state became concerned, not only because of Bulgarian penetration in Macedonia but also due to Serbian interests, which were concentrated mainly in Skopje and Bitola area. The rioting in Macedonia and especially the death of [[Pavlos Melas]] in 1904 (he was the first Greek officer to enter Macedonia with guerrillas and was killed in battle with the Ottoman army) caused intense nationalistic feelings in Greece. This led to the decision to send more guerrilla troops in order to thwart Bulgarian efforts to bring all of the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic-speaking majority population of Macedonia]] on their side.\n\nThe Greek General Consulate in [[Thessaloniki]], under [[Lambros Koromilas]], became the centre of the struggle, coordinating the guerrilla troops, distributing military material and nursing the wounded. Fierce conflicts between the Greeks and Bulgarians started in the area of [[Kostur]], in the [[Giannitsa Lake]] area, and elsewhere. During 1905, guerilla activity increased and the Makedonomachoi gained significant advantage within 10 months, extending their control towards the areas of [[Mariovo]] and East Macedonia, Kastanohoria (near Kastoria), the plains north and south of [[Florina]] and the routes around [[Bitola|Monastir]].<ref name=Gounaris>{{cite web|last=Gounaris|first=Basil C.|title=National Claims, Conflicts and Developments in Macedonia, 1870-1912|url=http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HistoryOfMacedonia/Downloads/History%20Of%20Macedonia_EN-09.pdf|publisher=macedonian-heritage.gr|accessdate=8 May 2012|page=194}}</ref> However, from early 1906 the situation became critical and the forces of the Makedonomachoi were forced to withdraw from various areas.

IMRO was declared as a Macedonian organization open to all ethnic groups in Macedonia and, earlier on, IMRO claimed that it was fighting for the [[Autonomy for Macedonia and Adrianople regions|autonomy of Macedonia]] and not for annexation to Bulgaria. However, according to some authors and historians, it later became an agent serving Bulgarian interests in Balkan politics with the aim of eventually uniting the  entirety of Macedonia with [[Bulgaria]], first in struggles against the Ottoman Empire and later against the Serbian-led Yugoslav successor state controlling the territory of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and the Greek state which controlled the territory of [[Aegean Macedonia]].<ref>Encyclopedia of terrorism, Cindy C.

In April 1903, a group called ''[[Boatmen of Thessalon\u00edki|Gemidzhii]]'' with some assistance from the IMRO [[Thessaloniki bombings of 1903|blew up]] the French ship ''Guadalquivir'' and the Ottoman Bank in the harbour of [[Thessaloniki]]. In August 1903, IMRO managed to organise an uprising (the [[Ilinden Uprising]]) in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Adrianople Vilayet]]. After the forming of the short-lived [[Kru\u0161evo Republic]], the insurrection was suppressed by the [[Ottomans]] with the subsequent destruction of many villages and the devastation of large areas in Western Macedonia and around [[K\u0131rklareli|K\u0131rk Kilise]] near [[Adrianople]]. The failure of the 1903 insurrection resulted in the eventual split of the IMARO into a left-wing (federalist) faction and a right-wing faction (centralists) which weakened the organization additionally.\n\n==Macedonian Committee==\n[[File:Seal of the Greek-Macedonian Committee.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Seal of the Greek Macedonian Committee depicting [[Alexander the Great]] and Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]]]]\n[[File:Pavlos Melas.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Pavlos Melas]] in ''Macedonomachos'' uniform]]\n\nIn order to strengthen Greek efforts for Macedonia, the [[Hellenic Macedonian Committee]] was formed in 1903, under the leadership of wealthy publisher [[Dimitrios Kalapothakis]]; its members included [[Ion Dragoumis]] and [[Pavlos Melas]].<ref>Konstantinos Vakalopoulos, Historia tou voreiou hellenismou, vol 2, 1990, pp. 429-430</ref> Its fighters were known as ''Makedonomachoi'' (\"Macedonian fighters\").<ref name=\"BrownHamilakis2003\">{{cite book|author1=Keith S.

The Bishop of [[Kastoria]], [[Germanos Karavangelis]] sent to Macedonia by the ambassador of Greece [[Nikolaos Mavrokordatos]] and the consul of Greece in [[Bitola|Monastiri]], [[Ion Dragoumis]], realised that it was time to act in a more efficient way and started organising Greek opposition.\n\nWhile Dragoumis concerned himself with the financial organisation of the efforts, the central figure in the military struggle was the very capable [[Cretan]] officer [[Georgios Katehakis]].<ref>Bulgarian Historical Review, vol 31, 1-4, 2003, p 117 \"Only a few days later -on November 1- Katehakis arrived in Macedonia as Melas' successor\"</ref> Bishop Germanos Karavangelis animated the [[Greek Macedonians|Greek population]] against the IMRO and formed committees to promote the Greek national interests.\n\nTaking advantage of the internal political and personal disputes in IMRO, Katehakis and Karavangelis initially succeeded to recruit some IMRO former members and to organize guerrilla groups, that were later reinforced with people sent from Greece and thus were mainly composed of ex-officers of the [[Hellenic Army]], volunteers brought from [[Crete]], from the [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] area of the Peloponnese, as well as [[Macedonian Greeks]], such as [[Nikolaos Manos]], [[Theodoros Adam]], [[Dimitrios Stagas]], [[Konstantinos Papastavrou]], [[Georgios Modis]], [[Athanasios Stavroudis]], [[Michael Sionidis]], [[Ioannis Ramnalis]], [[Zisis Verros]], [[Georgios Thomopoulos]], [[Iraklis Patikas]], [[Ioannis Simanikas]], [[Periklis Drakos]], [[Ioannis Martzios]], [[Dimitrios Golnas]], [[Petros Christou]], [[Charalambos Boufidis]], Slavophones such as Dimitris Dalipis and [[Evangelos Natsis]], and even former IMRO members such as [[Gonos Yotas]] and [[Kottas]].\n\n==Greek activity==\n[[File:\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 \u0394\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2.JPG|thumb|[[Periklis Drakos]] from [[Kavala]] with co-fighters]]\n[[File:Gono-Iotov-cheta.jpg|thumb|The band of slavophone [[Gonos Yotas]] fought with the Greek side.]]\n\nThe Greek state became concerned, not only because of Bulgarian penetration in Macedonia but also due to Serbian interests, which were concentrated mainly in Skopje and Bitola area. The rioting in Macedonia and especially the death of [[Pavlos Melas]] in 1904 (he was the first Greek officer to enter Macedonia with guerrillas and was killed in battle with the Ottoman army) caused intense nationalistic feelings in Greece. This led to the decision to send more guerrilla troops in order to thwart Bulgarian efforts to bring all of the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic-speaking majority population of Macedonia]] on their side.\n\nThe Greek General Consulate in [[Thessaloniki]], under [[Lambros Koromilas]], became the centre of the struggle, coordinating the guerrilla troops, distributing military material and nursing the wounded. Fierce conflicts between the Greeks and Bulgarians started in the area of [[Kostur]], in the [[Giannitsa Lake]] area, and elsewhere. During 1905, guerilla activity increased and the Makedonomachoi gained significant advantage within 10 months, extending their control towards the areas of [[Mariovo]] and East Macedonia, Kastanohoria (near Kastoria), the plains north and south of [[Florina]] and the routes around [[Bitola|Monastir]].<ref name=Gounaris>{{cite web|last=Gounaris|first=Basil C.|title=National Claims, Conflicts and Developments in Macedonia, 1870-1912|url=http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HistoryOfMacedonia/Downloads/History%20Of%20Macedonia_EN-09.pdf|publisher=macedonian-heritage.gr|accessdate=8 May 2012|page=194}}</ref> However, from early 1906 the situation became critical and the forces of the Makedonomachoi were forced to withdraw from various areas.

It helped develop an intention to annex Greek-speaking areas, and bolster Greek presence in the still Ottoman-ruled Macedonia.\n\t\nThe events in Macedonia, specifically the consequences of the conflicts between Greek and Bulgarian national activists, including Greek massacres against the Bulgarian population in 1905 and 1906, gave rise to pogroms against the ca. 70,000-80,000 strong Greek communities that lived in Bulgaria, who were considered to share responsibility (including the support given to the guerrillas by some Bulgarian Greeks) for the actions of the Greek guerrilla groups.<ref name=Lange/><ref name=\"Dragostinova2011\">{{cite book|author=Theodora Dragostinova|title=Between Two Motherlands: Nationality and Emigration Among the Greeks of Bulgaria, 1900-1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUjV1Fd3W8oC&pg=PT66|year=2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-6116-2|pages=66\u2013|quote=New Greek massacres of Bulgarians in Macedonia in 1906 led to a repetition of anti-Greek violence in the Principality of Bulgaria}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the Young Turk movement resulted in a few instances of collaboration between Greek and Bulgarian bands, while this time the official policy in both countries continue to support the penetration of armed fighters into Ottoman Macedonia, but without having fully ensured that there would be no attacks on each other.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gounaris|first=Basil C.|title=National Claims, Conflicts and Developments in Macedonia, 1870-1912|url=http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HistoryOfMacedonia/Downloads/History%20Of%20Macedonia_EN-09.pdf|publisher=macedonian-heritage.gr|accessdate=8 May 2012|page=201}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nThe Greek fighters were portrayed by Greek writer [[Penelope Delta]] in her novel ''\u03a4\u03ac \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0392\u03ac\u03bb\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5'' (Ta Mystik\u00e1 tou V\u00e1ltou&nbsp;\u2013 The Secrets of the Swamp), as well as in the book of memoirs ''\u1f49 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u1f08\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd'' (The Macedonian Struggle) by [[Germanos Karavangelis]], while on the other side, the IMRO and their activities are depicted in the book ''Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit: A Californian in the Balkan Wars'', written by [[Albert Sonnichsen]], an American volunteer in the IMRO during the Macedonian Struggle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Macedonian Question]]\n*[[Macedonian Revolution (disambiguation)]]\n*[[History of Modern Greece]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Georgios|last1=Christopoulos|first2=Ioannis|last2=Bastias|title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2: \u039d\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf 1881 \u03c9\u03c2 1913|trans-title=History of the Greek Nation: Modern Greece from 1881 until 1913 |volume=XIV |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon|language=Greek|location=Athens|year=1977 |oclc= |ref=harv}}\n* Koliopoulos, Ioannis: ''History of Greece from 1800, Nation, State and Society'', Thessaloniki, 2000 {{ISBN|960-288-072-4}}\n* [[Douglas Dakin|Dakin, Douglas]]: \"The Greek Struggle in Macedonia 1897\u20131913\", 1993 {{ISBN|9607387007}}\n* Vakalopoulos, Apostolos: \"History of the Greek Nation 1204\u20131985\" (in Greek language)\n* Karavangelis, Germanos: \"The Macedonian Struggle\" (Memoirs)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061113081046/http://www.narrativepress.com/profile.php?book_id=1-58976-237-1 Sonnichsen, Albert: Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit: A Californian in the Balkan Wars, The Narrative Press], {{ISBN|1-58976-237-1}} (the Macedonian struggle from a perspective of an American volunteer in IMRO)\n* Rappoport, Alfred: [http://www.abebooks.de/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=966647133&searchurl=an%3DAlfred%2BRappoport%26ph%3D2%26sortby%3D3%26tn%3DAu%2BPays%2BDes%2BMartyrs ''Au pays des martyrs.

A relatively affluent hub having a large minority of its housing forming by luxury, well-served apartments or streets of grand middle-class Victorian houses, the seat has sporadic deprivation, typified by certain densely packed rows of terraced houses, home to many Labour-inclined and often low-income voters.  Two large, well-ranked, universities in the city centre, the professional services sector and a 21st-century increase in technology businesses has brought prosperity to the younger generations of the city.  The older generations of the city have lived through the closure of many mass consumer product manufacturing and materials processing businesses in Leeds throughout the mid-20th century.<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|title=Local statistics \u2013 Office for National Statistics|website=neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk}}</ref> Leeds' two universities produce a significant student [[wikt:electorate|electorate]].<ref name=census/><ref name=g>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics|title=Politics|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Middleton in the south of the seat has a golf course, a miniature railway and an upcoming urban mountain bike trail centre within the boundaries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n|+ '''Households as at March 2011<ref>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk Parish: Key Statistics: Economic.] ([[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]]) Retrieved 2016-05-04.</ref>'''\n|-\n!Status!!Number\n|-\n||Not Deprived in Any Dimension||16,201\n|-\n||Deprived in 1 Dimension||21,519\n|-\n||Deprived in 2 Dimensions||13,586\n|-\n||Deprived in 3 Dimensions||5,205\n|-\n||Deprived in 4 Dimensions||697\n|}\n\n==History==\n===First creation===\nThe constituency was created in 1885 by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], and was first used in the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|general election]] of that year *the large [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds]] seat had previously been represented by two MPs (1832\u20131868) and three MPs (1868\u20131885)). From 1885 it was represented by five single-member constituencies: Leeds Central, [[Leeds East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds East]], [[Leeds North (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North]], [[Leeds South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South]] and [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]].  The constituencies of [[Morley (UK Parliament constituency)|Morley]], [[Otley (UK Parliament constituency)|Otley]] and [[Pudsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Pudsey]] were also created in 1885. The constituency was abolished in 1955. After the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]] Leeds was represented by Leeds East (created 1885, abolished 1918, recreated 1955), [[Leeds North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North East]] (created 1918), [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North West]] (created 1950), [[Leeds South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South]] (created 1885), and [[Leeds South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South East]] (created 1918). There were also constituencies of [[Batley and Morley (UK Parliament constituency)|Batley and Morley]] (created 1918) and Pudsey (created 1885, replaced by Pudsey and Otley 1918\u20131950).\n\n===Second creation, current creation===\n;Revival\nThe constituency was re-created for the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]].\n\n;Results of the winning party\nThe seat has been won by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s candidate since 1983.  Benn, elected in 1999 on the demise of Fatchett, has achieved an absolute majority (plurality of votes) in three of five elections for Leeds Central. The 2015 result made the seat the 40-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority]  UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>\n\n;Opposition parties\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] runner-up, Wilson, in 2015 failed to reflect the positive national swing and fell to 17.3% of the votes cast. A candidature of [[UKIP]], not present in 2010, saw a total share of the vote, hence positive swing, of 15.7% and thus third position.{{refn|group=n|UKIP's swing nationally was +9.5% in 2015}}.

[[Hilary Benn]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}} A former guise of the seat spanned 1885 to 1955.\n\n== Boundaries ==\n'''1885\u20131918''': The Municipal Borough of Leeds wards of Mill Hill and West, and parts of the wards of Brunswick and Central.\n\n'''1918\u20131950''': The County Borough of Leeds wards of Central, Mill Hill, South, and West, and parts of the wards of Brunswick, Headingley, and North West.\n\n'''1950\u20131955''': The County Borough of Leeds wards of Armley and New Wortley, Blenheim, Central, Holbeck North, Mill Hill, and South and Westfield.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The City of Leeds wards of Beeston, City and Holbeck, Richmond Hill, and University.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': As above plus Hunslet.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The City of Leeds wards of [[Beeston and Holbeck (ward)|Beeston and Holbeck]], [[Burmantofts and Richmond Hill (ward)|Burmantofts and Richmond Hill]], City and Hunslet, Hyde Park and Woodhouse, and [[Middleton Park (ward)|Middleton Park]].\n\nFollowing the [[Leeds City Council]] [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England|ward boundary changes]] prior to the [[2018 Leeds City Council election|2018 election]], the majority of the City and Hunslet ward became the new [[Hunslet and Riverside (ward)|Hunslet and Riverside]] ward, whilst [[Leeds city centre]] was included in the new [[Little London and Woodhouse (ward)|Little London and Woodhouse]] ward. [[Hyde Park, Leeds|Hyde Park]] became part of a new [[Headingley and Hyde Park (ward)|Headingley and Hyde Park]] ward, shared with the [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North West]] constituency.\n\n== Constituency profile ==\nThe business and retail centre of Leeds is at the heart. A relatively affluent hub having a large minority of its housing forming by luxury, well-served apartments or streets of grand middle-class Victorian houses, the seat has sporadic deprivation, typified by certain densely packed rows of terraced houses, home to many Labour-inclined and often low-income voters.  Two large, well-ranked, universities in the city centre, the professional services sector and a 21st-century increase in technology businesses has brought prosperity to the younger generations of the city.  The older generations of the city have lived through the closure of many mass consumer product manufacturing and materials processing businesses in Leeds throughout the mid-20th century.<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|title=Local statistics - Office for National Statistics|website=neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk}}</ref> Leeds' two universities produce a significant student [[wikt:electorate|electorate]].<ref name=census/><ref name=g>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics|title=Politics|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Middleton in the south of the seat has a golf course, a miniature railway and an upcoming urban mountain bike trail centre within the boundaries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n|+ '''Households as at March 2011<ref>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk Parish: Key Statistics: Economic.] ([[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]]) Retrieved 2016-05-04.</ref>'''\n|-\n!Status!!Number\n|-\n||Not Deprived in Any Dimension||16,201\n|-\n||Deprived in 1 Dimension||21,519\n|-\n||Deprived in 2 Dimensions||13,586\n|-\n||Deprived in 3 Dimensions||5,205\n|-\n||Deprived in 4 Dimensions||697\n|}\n\n==History==\n===First creation===\nThe constituency was created in 1885 by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], and was first used in the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|general election]] of that year *the large [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds]] seat had previously been represented by two MPs (1832\u20131868) and three MPs (1868\u20131885)). From 1885 it was represented by five single-member constituencies: Leeds Central, [[Leeds East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds East]], [[Leeds North (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North]], [[Leeds South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South]] and [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]].  The constituencies of [[Morley (UK Parliament constituency)|Morley]], [[Otley (UK Parliament constituency)|Otley]] and [[Pudsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Pudsey]] were also created in 1885. The constituency was abolished in 1955. After the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]] Leeds was represented by Leeds East (created 1885, abolished 1918, recreated 1955), [[Leeds North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North East]] (created 1918), [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North West]] (created 1950), [[Leeds South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South]] (created 1885), and [[Leeds South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South East]] (created 1918). There were also constituencies of [[Batley and Morley (UK Parliament constituency)|Batley and Morley]] (created 1918) and Pudsey (created 1885, replaced by Pudsey and Otley 1918-1950).\n\n===Second creation, current creation===\n;Revival\nThe constituency was re-created for the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]].\n\n;Results of the winning party\nThe seat has been won by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s candidate since 1983.  Benn, elected in 1999 on the demise of Fatchett, has achieved an absolute majority (plurality of votes) in three of five elections for Leeds Central. The 2015 result made the seat the 40-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority]  UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>\n\n;Opposition parties\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] runner-up, Wilson, in 2015 failed to reflect the positive national swing and fell to 17.3% of the votes cast. A candidature of [[UKIP]], not present in 2010, saw a total share of the vote, hence positive swing, of 15.7% and thus third position.{{refn|group=n|UKIP's swing nationally was +9.5% in 2015}}.  Green Party running, not present in 2010, resulted in a 7.9% polling and fourth-place, its candidate retained his deposit.  The fifth-placed Liberal Democrat forfeited her [[deposit (politics)|deposit]].{{refn|group=n|The Liberal Democrats's swing nationally was -15.2% in 2015, 1.7% less than in Leeds Central}}.\n\n;Turnout\nIn general elections turnout has ranged from 87.9% in 1910 to 41.7% in 2001.  In its 1999 by-election the constituency experienced the lowest voter turnout post-[[World War II|war]] of 19.6%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M16.pdf |title=Archived

It later moved to [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of [[Corning (city), New York|Corning]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.\n\nOver 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby [[research and development]] facility, as well as operations associated with [[catalytic converters]] and [[Diesel particulate filter|diesel engine filter]] product lines. Corning has a long history of [[community development]] and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2008/2008042402.aspx |title=Corning Chairman Emphasizes Sustainable Performance and \"Unwavering\" Commitment to Innovation |publisher=Corning.com |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612085516/http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2008/2008042402.aspx |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[California Institute of Technology]]'s {{convert|200|in|m|adj=on}} telescope mirror at [[Palomar Observatory]] was cast by Corning during 1934\u20131936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.<ref name=Caltec>{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/palomar/history/ |title=Caltech Astronomy: History - 1908\u20131949 |date=n.d. |accessdate=March 17, 2008 |publisher=Caltech |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172200/http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/palomar/history/ |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>  In 1932, [[George Ellery Hale]] approached [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project.

Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank.  After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed.  The first blank now resides in [[Corning Museum of Glass|Corning's Museum of Glass.]]\n\nIn 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker [[Owens-Illinois]], which formed the company known today as [[Owens Corning]].

Such low attenuations made [[fiber optics]] practical for [[telecommunications]] and [[Computer network|networking]]. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.\n\nIn 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.<ref>https://customlaminatedmirror.com/{{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nCompany profits soared in the late 1990s during the [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants.  The company also entered the [[photonics]] market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems.  Failure to succeed in photonics and the [[Dot-com bubble#The bubble bursts|collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market]] had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, {{As of|2007|lc=on}} the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.\n\n==Current technologies==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\nThe turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a robust display screen for its upcoming [[iPhone]].

Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an [[Optical fiber cable|optical fiber]] with a low optical attenuation of 17&nbsp;dB per kilometer by [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] [[silica glass]] with [[titanium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jeffhecht.com/history.html |title=Fiber Optic History {{!}} Jeff Hecht |author=Jeff Hecht |website=www.jeffhecht.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120054747/http://www.jeffhecht.com/history.html |archivedate=November 20, 2015 }}</ref> A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4&nbsp;dB/km, using [[germanium oxide]] as the core [[dopant]]. Such low attenuations made [[fiber optics]] practical for [[telecommunications]] and [[Computer network|networking]]. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.\n\nIn 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.<ref>https://customlaminatedmirror.com/{{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nCompany profits soared in the late 1990s during the [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants.  The company also entered the [[photonics]] market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems.  Failure to succeed in photonics and the [[Dot-com bubble#The bubble bursts|collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market]] had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, {{As of|2007|lc=on}} the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.\n\n==Current technologies==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\nThe turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a robust display screen for its upcoming [[iPhone]].

The album's creation was difficult, namely due to power struggles and arguments between [[frontman]] [[Stephan Jenkins]] and [[lead guitar]]ist [[Kevin Cadogan]], leading to a quick but isolated recording experience between members. The album was generally well received by critics, and was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]], but performed below the band's prior album, the multi-platinum ''[[Third Eye Blind (album)|Third Eye Blind]]''. While managing to stay together for the creation of the album, shortly after its release, the band fired Cadogan, touring in support of the album with replacement guitarist Tony Fredianelli. As such, the album was the last to feature Cadogan, and the last to be released without significant gaps and delays prior to release.\n\n==Background==\n===Writing and recording===\nThe band enjoyed extensive success in 1997 with their first album, ''[[Third Eye Blind (album)|Third Eye Blind]]'', which eventually [[RIAA|went platinum]] six times.<ref name=\"Pitchfork1\">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/772-third-eye-blind-dashboard-confessional-and-the-cultural-shock-of-millennial-nostalgia/ |title=Third Eye Blind, Dashboard Confessional and the Cultural Shock of Millennial Nostalgia |last=de Revere |first=Paul |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=May 21, 2015 |accessdate=October 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022801/http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/772-third-eye-blind-dashboard-confessional-and-the-cultural-shock-of-millennial-nostalgia/ |archivedate=October 3, 2015 }}</ref> The band maintained popularity into 1998 through extensive touring and a number of singles that performed well in the charts, including \"[[Semi-Charmed Life]],\" \"[[How's It Going to Be]],\" \"[[Graduate (song)|Graduate]],\" \"[[Losing a Whole Year]],\" and \"[[Jumper (song)|Jumper]],\" but by the end of the year, the band looked to start working on new material.<ref name=\"Pitchfork1\"/>\n\nIn promoting the album, frontman and [[lead vocalist]] [[Stephan Jenkins]] recounted a pleasant experience in recording the album, referring to it as \"too much fun and feeling like...a complete recording group for the first time...We had these jam sessions that were fun\".<ref name=\"billboard3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stephanjenkins3eb.com/news/oldnews/1999/nov99.html |title=November 1999 Old News U Can Use |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816155237/http://www.stephanjenkins3eb.com/news/oldnews/1999/nov99.html |archivedate=August 16, 2016 }}</ref> He also commented that it had been more collaborative than their prior album; [[bassist]] Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while [[drummer]] Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album.<ref name=\"billboard3\"/> However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from [[Elektra Records]], and isolation between members, stating: <blockquote>\"We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost.

The album's creation was difficult, namely due to power struggles and arguments between [[frontman]] [[Stephan Jenkins]] and [[lead guitar]]ist [[Kevin Cadogan]], leading to a quick but isolated recording experience between members. The album was generally well received by critics, and was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]], but performed below the band's prior album, the multi-platinum ''[[Third Eye Blind (album)|Third Eye Blind]]''. While managing to stay together for the creation of the album, shortly after its release, the band fired Cadogan, touring in support of the album with replacement guitarist Tony Fredianelli. As such, the album was the last to feature Cadogan, and the last to be released without significant gaps and delays prior to release.\n\n==Background==\n===Writing and recording===\nThe band enjoyed extensive success in 1997 with their first album, ''[[Third Eye Blind (album)|Third Eye Blind]]'', which eventually [[RIAA|went platinum]] six times.<ref name=\"Pitchfork1\">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/772-third-eye-blind-dashboard-confessional-and-the-cultural-shock-of-millennial-nostalgia/ |title=Third Eye Blind, Dashboard Confessional and the Cultural Shock of Millennial Nostalgia |last=de Revere |first=Paul |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=May 21, 2015 |accessdate=October 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022801/http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/772-third-eye-blind-dashboard-confessional-and-the-cultural-shock-of-millennial-nostalgia/ |archivedate=October 3, 2015 }}</ref> The band maintained popularity into 1998 through extensive touring and a number of singles that performed well in the charts, including \"[[Semi-Charmed Life]],\" \"[[How's It Going to Be]],\" \"[[Graduate (song)|Graduate]],\" \"[[Losing a Whole Year]],\" and \"[[Jumper (song)|Jumper]],\" but by the end of the year, the band looked to start working on new material.<ref name=\"Pitchfork1\"/>\n\nIn promoting the album, frontman and [[lead vocalist]] [[Stephan Jenkins]] recounted a pleasant experience in recording the album, referring to it as \"too much fun and feeling like...a complete recording group for the first time...We had these jam sessions that were fun\".<ref name=\"billboard3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stephanjenkins3eb.com/news/oldnews/1999/nov99.html |title=November 1999 Old News U Can Use |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816155237/http://www.stephanjenkins3eb.com/news/oldnews/1999/nov99.html |archivedate=August 16, 2016 }}</ref> He also commented that it had been more collaborative than their prior album; [[bassist]] Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while [[drummer]] Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album.<ref name=\"billboard3\"/> However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from [[Elektra Records]], and isolation between members, stating: <blockquote>\"We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost. That's done in part because we were never in the studio at the same time, never rehearsed the songs together, never played them together. I did my best to, to produce that record and it was very hard to do. Then we succumbed to the time pressures from Elektra to get the album out in six months which we did.\"<ref name=\"SCPI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.3eb.co.uk/faq.php?faq=album_faq#faq_album_faq_bluevst |title=Stephan Jenkins - ''Blue'' Interview |accessdate=21 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807052033/http://www.3eb.co.uk/faq.php?faq=album_faq |archivedate=7 August 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA major issue of the recording sessions was internal strife between band members, namely between Jenkins, and lead guitarist and co-founding band-member [[Kevin Cadogan]].<ref name=\"GMagazine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/114129/re-reviews-third-eye-blinds-blue/ |title=Re-Reviews: Third Eye Blind's 'Blue' |last=Cowen |first=Trace William |publisher=Glide Magazine |date=November 15, 2013 |accessdate=October 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016133501/http://www.glidemagazine.com/114129/re-reviews-third-eye-blinds-blue/ |archivedate=October 16, 2015 }}</ref> The two actively fought for ownership of the band; Cadogan, under the impression that the band was made as an equal partnership, was outraged to find that Jenkins had made legal changes to make Jenkins the sole owner of the band.<ref name=\"GMagazine\"/> Cadogan was further frustrated by Salazar's and Hargreaves' lack of understanding and indifference to the arrangement.<ref name=\"GMagazine\"/> The album was almost not made at all, as the band manager informed Cadogan that Jenkins was attempting to remove Cadogan from the band prior to even starting work on the album.<ref name=\"GMagazine\"/> Cadogan did everything he could to stay in the band, including trying to push issues aside in order to just work on the album, having the band and sound engineer over to his home in order to record rough album ideas for two weeks.<ref name=\"GMagazine\"/> The sessions worked, but were very difficult, and ended up being the only period where the band worked together with one another.<ref name=\"GMagazine\"/> The rest of the album was recorded in solitude, with each member coming into the studio to record their parts of the album alone.<ref name=\"SCPI\"/> The recording process spread itself across multiple other studios over time, one of which being one of the studios where [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' had been recorded.<ref name=\"ViceRetro\"/>\n\n===Song selection===\nThe tension and isolation in the recording process led to complications in the song selection, which would, in turn create further tensions within the band.
