A pioneer in the field, she was the first female market researcher in Australia or the United Kingdom, and the first person to conduct an Australia-wide public opinion poll. Mentored by two of the finest market researchers of the day, she used her experience to great effect and steadily grew her business. During the [[Second World War]] her company experienced hardships due to a public that was suspicious of inquisitive representatives who would poll public sentiment about the war and the prime minister; in addition there was a reluctance among companies to spend money on market research, which they felt was unnecessary in a time of rationing. Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer. To her frustration, Ashby found that her subsidiary was being underused by ACP, and regularly wrote to Packer to suggest ways of using her services.<ref name=\"crawford-p18-19\"/>\n\n==Australian Research Service buy-back and death==\nIn 1974, both Packer and Ashby were looking to retire. In a magnanimous gesture to Ashby, Packer sold the Ashby Research Service back to her for the same amount that he had paid for it in 1941 &mdash; $2,800.<ref name=\"crawford-p21\"/> Ashby, who was by this time becoming very ill, sold the business to Beacon Research Co. Pty Ltd.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> As her health continued to fail, she became confined to a wheelchair, before finally dying of cancer on 9 September 1978 at [[Palm Beach, New South Wales]] and was cremated.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1471050?c=people Sylvia Rose Ashby] - [[Trove Australia]]\n* [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314880 Ashby Research Service records, ca. 19] - Archives [[State Library of NSW]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|goot-1993|\u03b7}} Goot, 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eldest-sister\">{{ref|table-talk-1929|\u03be}} ''Table Talk'' 1929, p. 64}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dict-sydney\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"children\">{{ref|weekly-times-1946|\u03bf}}''Weekly Times'' 1946, p. 26</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\">{{ref|daily-examiner-1939|\u03ba}} ''Daily Examiner'' 1939, p. 4</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"women-in-sport\">{{ref|daily-telegraph|1934|\u03bb}} ''The Daily Telegraph 1934, p. 16</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crawford-p6\">{{ref|crawford-2019|\u03b6}} Crawford 2019, p. 6</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing 'War Effort', 'Conscription, 1941', '2nd Conscription Survey, February 1942', 'War Psychology, September 1942', 'Election Survey, May 1943', 'Wartime and Political Knowledge, December 1942', Box 78, Ashby Research Service records, c1937-c1972 MLMSS 8907, [[Mitchell Library]], [[State Library of New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016, p. 34; citing [[Mitchell Library]] Correspondence files, MLMSS 8907.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"routledge\">{{ref|crawford-routeledge-2016|\u03b4}} Crawford 2016; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"billashby\">[[State Library of New South Wales]], MLMSS 8907, Box 70, 'Letter from W.

9 September 1978) was a British-born Australian [[market researcher]] and founder of the Ashby Research Service. A pioneer in the field, she was the first female market researcher in Australia or the United Kingdom, and the first person to conduct an Australia-wide public opinion poll. Mentored by two of the finest market researchers of the day, she used her experience to great effect and steadily grew her business. During the [[Second World War]] her company experienced hardships due to a public that was suspicious of inquisitive representatives who would poll public sentiment about the war and the prime minister; in addition there was a reluctance among companies to spend money on market research, which they felt was unnecessary in a time of rationing. Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer. To her frustration, Ashby found that her subsidiary was being underused by ACP, and regularly wrote to Packer to suggest ways of using her services.<ref name=\"crawford-p18-19\"/>\n\n==Australian Research Service buy-back and death==\nIn 1974, both Packer and Ashby were looking to retire. In a magnanimous gesture to Ashby, Packer sold the Ashby Research Service back to her for the same amount that he had paid for it in 1941 &mdash; $2,800.<ref name=\"crawford-p21\"/> Ashby, who was by this time becoming very ill, sold the business to Beacon Research Co. Pty Ltd.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> As her health continued to fail, she became confined to a wheelchair, before finally dying of cancer on 9 September 1978 at [[Palm Beach, New South Wales]] and was cremated.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1471050?c=people Sylvia Rose Ashby] - [[Trove Australia]]\n* [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314880 Ashby Research Service records, ca. 19] - Archives [[State Library of NSW]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|goot-1993|\u03b7}} Goot, 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eldest-sister\">{{ref|table-talk-1929|\u03be}} ''Table Talk'' 1929, p. 64}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dict-sydney\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"children\">{{ref|weekly-times-1946|\u03bf}}''Weekly Times'' 1946, p. 26</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\">{{ref||daily-examiner-1939|\u03ba}} ''Daily Examiner'' 1939, p. 4</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"women-in-sport\">{{ref|daily-telegraph|1934|\u03bb}} ''The Daily Telegraph 1934, p. 16</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crawford-p6\">{{ref|crawford-2019|\u03b6}} Crawford 2019, p. 6</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing 'War Effort', 'Conscription, 1941', '2nd Conscription Survey, February 1942', 'War Psychology, September 1942', 'Election Survey, May 1943', 'Wartime and Political Knowledge, December 1942', Box 78, Ashby Research Service records, c1937-c1972 MLMSS 8907, [[Mitchell Library]], [[State Library of New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016, p. 34; citing [[Mitchell Library]] Correspondence files, MLMSS 8907.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"routledge\">{{ref|crawford-routeledge-2016|\u03b4}} Crawford 2016; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"billashby\">[[State Library of New South Wales]], MLMSS 8907, Box 70, 'Letter from W.

It was founded in 1871 by Hungarian astronomer [[Mikl\u00f3s Konkoly-Thege]] (1842\u20131916) as a private observatory, and was donated to the state in 1899.<ref name=official_website>{{cite web|title=Konkoly Observatory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.konkoly.hu/index_en.shtml|website=www.konkoly.hu|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> Konkoly Observatory, officially known as ''MTA CSFK Konkoly Thege Mikl\u00f3s Csillag\u00e1szati Int\u00e9zete'' in Hungarian, is the largest astronomical research institute in Hungary, and hosts the largest telescopes in the country.\n\nAs well as performing astronomical research, the observatory publishes the [[Information Bulletin on Variable Stars]] on behalf of the [[International Astronomical Union]].<ref name=official_website/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The \u00d3gyalla and Sv\u00e1bhely Observatories ===\nHungarian nobleman Mikl\u00f3s Konkoly-Thege founded his private observatory in 1871 at [[Hurbanovo]], in Northern Hungary, known as \u00d3gyalla in Hungarian at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.konkoly.hu/staff/balazs/100ev.html|title=100 \u00e9ves az MTA Csillag\u00e1szati Kutat\u00f3int\u00e9zete|last=Bal\u00e1zs|first=Lajos|date=1999}}</ref> The instrumentation included a 6\" [[Refracting telescope|refractor]], a 10.5\" Browning [[Reflecting telescope|reflector]] (later replaced with a 10\" Merz refractor), a [[meridian circle]], a spectrograph, as well as various meteorological and geomagnetic instruments. Konkoly-Thege, who had no offspring, became increasingly afraid over time that his legacy will perish with his death. As a member of the Hungarian Parliament, he was able to convince the government to take the observatory into state property. In 1899, the Hurbanovo site was renamed to Royal Konkoly-founded Astrophysical Observatory, and operated under the direction of Konkoly-Thege and Rad\u00f3 K\u00f6vesligethy, a renowned geophysicist of the time. The main scientific profile of the institute was the photometry of stars, the observation of the Sun, meteor counting, and providing time service for the government. In 1913, an order for a 60&nbsp;cm (24\") telescope was finalized with the German Heyde company, but with the start of [[World War I]], the telescope was never built.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, \u00d3gyalla became part of the newly formed [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918\u20131938)|Czechoslovak Republic]]. The government transferred the scientific equipment to Budapest before the newly formed border was shut down, and in 1921 allocated a new property in the [[Buda Hills|Buda hills]] just west to Budapest to build a new astronomical observatory. The new building, known as the Sv\u00e1bhegy observatory after a nearby hill, was finished by 1924, and the 6\" refractor and the re-ordered 60&nbsp;cm Heyde telescope were set up in new domes by 1928. Scientific work in the observatory focussed on the light variations of [[Variable star|pulsating stars]], the orbits of [[binary star]]s, and searching for [[asteroid]]s. Measurements were made with [[photographic plate]]s and wedge photometers.\n\nThe observatory survived [[World War II]] with minor damages. In late 1944, observations were put on hold, and the optical elements of the telescopes were removed to protect them from aerial bombings. Soviet troops occupied the buildings from December 1944 until February 1945, but the library and the photographic laboratories were spared. Observations were resumed by July 1945.\n\nAfter the communist takeover of Hungary in 1948, a new network of research institutes, independent from universities, was set up under the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (HAS). The observatory was renamed to the Astronomical Institute of the HAS, but retained the traditional name, Konkoly Observatory, in English correspondences. With the communist isolation of the country, international relations shifted from predominantly German and American to Soviet and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern-bloc]] partnerships. However, the international recognition of then director [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Detre (astronomer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Detre]] kept some connections to the West alive. During one of his visits to the Western bloc, Detre received an RCA 1P21 photomultiplier tube from American astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]]  to start photometric measurements at the observatory in 1948. He subsequently smuggled in to the country despite the strict trade restrictions at the time. In 1957, after the launch of Sputnik, multiple independent satellite observing and tracking stations were set up in the country at the suggestion of the Soviet Union. The institute provided coordination for these stations, and in 1966, the [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] station merged into the institute.\n\nRelations with the West soon eased and at the 1961 General Assembly of the [[International Astronomical Union]] at Berkeley, the institute was tasked with setting up and circulating the ''Information Bulletin on Variable Stars''. The Bulletin was envisaged to be a rapid communications platform between variable star observers, but it later expanded into a peer-reviewed journal for short papers and notes about variable stars.\n\nThe institute expanded in the 1960-70s with the foundation and subsequent independence of the [[Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory]] and the installation of new telescopes at Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station. In 1982, the observatories in Debrecen and Budapest were merged back together to form the Research Institute for Astronomy of the HAS. In 1992, the Baja station was separated from the institute and handed over to the county council of [[B\u00e1cs-Kiskun County|B\u00e1cs-Kiskun]].\n\nIn 2012, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences reorganized the structure of its institute network:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/rhapsody-for-hungarian-science-1.9619|title=Rhapsody for Hungarian science|last=Schiermeier|first=Quirin|date=12 December 2011|work=Nature News}}</ref> the Astronomical Institute was merged with three other entities (Institutes for Geography, Geochemistry, and Geodesy and Geophysics) to form the Research Center for Astronomy and Earth Sciences.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"600\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Konkoly-main-building.jpg|The main building of the observatory.\nFile:Konkoly domes.jpg|Telescope domes at Konkoly Observatory in Budapest.

The latter houses the 60&nbsp;cm Heyde refractor.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory ===\n{{main|Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory}}\nIn 1946, a new Solar physics department was initiated under the leadership of L\u00f3r\u00e1nt Dezs\u0151. In 1958, the department moved to [[Debrecen]] to form a new solar observatory independent of the Astronomical Institute. Observations of the Sun started with two photoheliograph telescopes, one of which was relocated to the top of the water tower at [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]] in 1972. In 1973, a large [[coronagraph]] telescope with a 53&nbsp;cm aperture was set up, but observations were hindered by the cumbersome mechanical setup. Given the low elevation of the observatory of just 124 m above sea level, the coronagraph was only capable to observe the [[chromosphere]] of the Sun, not the [[solar corona|corona]] itself.\n\nThe main scientific output of the observatory has been the detailed documentation of the [[Photosphere|photospheric]] activity of the Sun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/en/databases/Summary/|title=Summary table of databases at the Debrecen Observatory|last=Baranyi|first=T\u00fcnde}}</ref> The positions, sizes, structures of sunspots and sunspot groups are determined and recorded daily, to provide long-term, homogeneous observations of the Sun. The Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) database is the direct continuation of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Greenwich]] Photoheliographic Results that were collected between 1874-1976. Originally, analog [[Photographic plate|photographs]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] images were collected locally, or from partner observatories, but with the advent of reliable space-based observations, the work transitioned to the analysis of images from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]] spacecrafts. Further data products include the reanalysis of the Greenwich catalog, and older observations based on Hungarian drawings of the Sun.\n\nIn 1982, the observatory merged back into the Konkoly Astronomical Institute, and became a department of it once again. In 2015, the old observatory building in Debrecen was deemed unfeasible to maintain, and was closed down. The coronagraph was disassembled, and offices and personnel were transferred to the [[ATOMKI]] institute of the HAS in Debrecen. Given that space-based imagery has superseded the ground-based observations as the input source of the databases, the two photoheliographs were also decommissioned and removed from their mounts at Debrecen and Gyula.\n\n=== Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station ===\n{{main|Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Station}}In 1951, the observatory secured funding for a new mapping telescope. The initial order was for a 0.9 m, f/3 Sonnefeld telescope but it was soon modified for a 60/90 com [[Schmidt camera|Schmidt telescope]]. With the light pollution of Budapest steadily increasing, a more remote location was sought for the telescope. After settling for Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 peak in the [[M\u00e1tra|M\u00e1tra mountains]], about 80&nbsp;km away from the capital, a residence building was constructed in 1960, and the new Schmidt telescope was installed in 1962. The telescope provided a 10\u00b0x10\u00b0 field of view with photographic plates and could be equipped with an objective prism for low-resolution mass spectroscopic observations. The large field-of-view led to numerous supernova and asteroid discoveries at the time.\n\nIn 1966, a smaller, 0.5 m Cassegrain telescope with a two-channel photoelectric photometer was installed.\n\nFinally, a 1 m [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope|Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien]]-[[Coud\u00e9 telescope|coud\u00e9]] (RCC) telescope was installed in 1974, for high-resolution imaging and photometry of fainter targets. This marked the end of the initial development of Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 station.[[File:Piszkesteto-observatory.jpg|alt=Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station|thumb|300x300px|Aerial image of Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station of the Konkoly Observatory in the M\u00e1tra hills.]]\n\nIn the late 1990s, photographic plates and photometers were replaced with CCD cameras on the Schmidt and RCC telescopes. In 2015, an echelle spectrograph with a spectral resolution of R=20,000 was installed on the RCC telescope.\n\nA 40&nbsp;cm Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien telescope was set up in 2010, intended for automated remote observations.

It was founded in 1871 by Hungarian astronomer [[Mikl\u00f3s Konkoly-Thege]] (1842\u20131916) as a private observatory, and was donated to the state in 1899.<ref name=official_website>{{cite web|title=Konkoly Observatory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.konkoly.hu/index_en.shtml|website=www.konkoly.hu|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> Konkoly Observatory, officially known as ''MTA CSFK Konkoly Thege Mikl\u00f3s Csillag\u00e1szati Int\u00e9zete'' in Hungarian, is the largest astronomical research institute in Hungary, and hosts the largest telescopes in the country.\n\nAs well as performing astronomical research, the observatory publishes the [[Information Bulletin on Variable Stars]] on behalf of the [[International Astronomical Union]].<ref name=official_website/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The \u00d3gyalla and Sv\u00e1bhely Observatories ===\nHungarian nobleman Mikl\u00f3s Konkoly-Thege founded his private observatory in 1871 at [[Hurbanovo]], in Northern Hungary, known as \u00d3gyalla in Hungarian at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.konkoly.hu/staff/balazs/100ev.html|title=100 \u00e9ves az MTA Csillag\u00e1szati Kutat\u00f3int\u00e9zete|last=Bal\u00e1zs|first=Lajos|date=1999}}</ref> The instrumentation included a 6\" [[Refracting telescope|refractor]], a 10.5\" Browning [[Reflecting telescope|reflector]] (later replaced with a 10\" Merz refractor), a [[meridian circle]], a spectrograph, as well as various meteorological and geomagnetic instruments. Konkoly-Thege, who had no offspring, became increasingly afraid over time that his legacy will perish with his death. As a member of the Hungarian Parliament, he was able to convince the government to take the observatory into state property. In 1899, the Hurbanovo site was renamed to Royal Konkoly-founded Astrophysical Observatory, and operated under the direction of Konkoly-Thege and Rad\u00f3 K\u00f6vesligethy, a renowned geophysicist of the time. The main scientific profile of the institute was the photometry of stars, the observation of the Sun, meteor counting, and providing time service for the government. In 1913, an order for a 60&nbsp;cm (24\") telescope was finalized with the German Heyde company, but with the start of [[World War I]], the telescope was never built.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, \u00d3gyalla became part of the newly formed [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918\u20131938)|Czechoslovak Republic]]. The government transferred the scientific equipment to Budapest before the newly formed border was shut down, and in 1921 allocated a new property in the [[Buda Hills|Buda hills]] just west to Budapest to build a new astronomical observatory. The new building, known as the Sv\u00e1bhegy observatory after a nearby hill, was finished by 1924, and the 6\" refractor and the re-ordered 60&nbsp;cm Heyde telescope were set up in new domes by 1928. Scientific work in the observatory focussed on the light variations of [[Variable star|pulsating stars]], the orbits of [[binary star]]s, and searching for [[asteroid]]s. Measurements were made with [[photographic plate]]s and wedge photometers.\n\nThe observatory survived [[World War II]] with minor damages. In late 1944, observations were put on hold, and the optical elements of the telescopes were removed to protect them from aerial bombings. Soviet troops occupied the buildings from December 1944 until February 1945, but the library and the photographic laboratories were spared. Observations were resumed by July 1945.\n\nAfter the communist takeover of Hungary in 1948, a new network of research institutes, independent from universities, was set up under the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (HAS). The observatory was renamed to the Astronomical Institute of the HAS, but retained the traditional name, Konkoly Observatory, in English correspondences. With the communist isolation of the country, international relations shifted from predominantly German and American to Soviet and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern-bloc]] partnerships. However, the international recognition of then director [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Detre (astronomer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Detre]] kept some connections to the West alive. During one of his visits to the Western bloc, Detre received an RCA 1P21 photomultiplier tube from American astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]]  to start photometric measurements at the observatory in 1948. He subsequently smuggled in to the country despite the strict trade restrictions at the time. In 1957, after the launch of Sputnik, multiple independent satellite observing and tracking stations were set up in the country at the suggestion of the Soviet Union. The institute provided coordination for these stations, and in 1966, the [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] station merged into the institute.\n\nRelations with the West soon eased and at the 1961 General Assembly of the [[International Astronomical Union]] at Berkeley, the institute was tasked with setting up and circulating the ''Information Bulletin on Variable Stars''. The Bulletin was envisaged to be a rapid communications platform between variable star observers, but it later expanded into a peer-reviewed journal for short papers and notes about variable stars.\n\nThe institute expanded in the 1960-70s with the foundation and subsequent independence of the [[Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory]] and the installation of new telescopes at Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station. In 1982, the observatories in Debrecen and Budapest were merged back together to form the Research Institute for Astronomy of the HAS. In 1992, the Baja station was separated from the institute and handed over to the county council of [[B\u00e1cs-Kiskun County|B\u00e1cs-Kiskun]].\n\nIn 2012, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences reorganized the structure of its institute network:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/rhapsody-for-hungarian-science-1.9619|title=Rhapsody for Hungarian science|last=Schiermeier|first=Quirin|date=12 December 2011|work=Nature News}}</ref> the Astronomical Institute was merged with three other entities (Institutes for Geography, Geochemistry, and Geodesy and Geophysics) to form the Research Center for Astronomy and Earth Sciences.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"600\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Konkoly-main-building.jpg|The main building of the observatory.\nFile:Konkoly domes.jpg|Telescope domes at Konkoly Observatory in Budapest.

The latter houses the 60&nbsp;cm Heyde refractor.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory ===\n{{main|Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory}}\nIn 1946, a new Solar physics department was initiated under the leadership of L\u00f3r\u00e1nt Dezs\u0151. In 1958, the department moved to [[Debrecen]] to form a new solar observatory independent of the Astronomical Institute. Observations of the Sun started with two photoheliograph telescopes, one of which was relocated to the top of the water tower at [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]] in 1972. In 1973, a large [[coronagraph]] telescope with a 53&nbsp;cm aperture was set up, but observations were hindered by the cumbersome mechanical setup. Given the low elevation of the observatory of just 124 m above sea level, the coronagraph was only capable to observe the [[chromosphere]] of the Sun, not the [[corona]] itself.\n\nThe main scientific output of the observatory has been the detailed documentation of the [[Photosphere|photospheric]] activity of the Sun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/en/databases/Summary/|title=Summary table of databases at the Debrecen Observatory|last=Baranyi|first=T\u00fcnde}}</ref> The positions, sizes, structures of sunspots and sunspot groups are determined and recorded daily, to provide long-term, homogeneous observations of the Sun. The Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) database is the direct continuation of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Greenwich]] Photoheliographic Results that were collected between 1874-1976. Originally, analog [[Photographic plate|photographs]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] images were collected locally, or from partner observatories, but with the advent of reliable space-based observations, the work transitioned to the analysis of images from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]] spacecrafts. Further data products include the reanalysis of the Greenwich catalog, and older observations based on Hungarian drawings of the Sun.\n\nIn 1982, the observatory merged back into the Konkoly Astronomical Institute, and became a department of it once again. In 2015, the old observatory building in Debrecen was deemed unfeasible to maintain, and was closed down. The coronagraph was disassembled, and offices and personnel were transferred to the [[ATOMKI]] institute of the HAS in Debrecen. Given that space-based imagery has superseded the ground-based observations as the input source of the databases, the two photoheliographs were also decommissioned and removed from their mounts at Debrecen and Gyula.\n\n=== Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station ===\n{{main|Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Station}}In 1951, the observatory secured funding for a new mapping telescope. The initial order was for a 0.9 m, f/3 Sonnefeld telescope but it was soon modified for a 60/90 com [[Schmidt camera|Schmidt telescope]]. With the light pollution of Budapest steadily increasing, a more remote location was sought for the telescope. After settling for Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 peak in the [[M\u00e1tra|M\u00e1tra mountains]], about 80&nbsp;km away from the capital, a residence building was constructed in 1960, and the new Schmidt telescope was installed in 1962. The telescope provided a 10\u00b0x10\u00b0 field of view with photographic plates and could be equipped with an objective prism for low-resolution mass spectroscopic observations. The large field-of-view led to numerous supernova and asteroid discoveries at the time.\n\nIn 1966, a smaller, 0.5 m Cassegrain telescope with a two-channel photoelectric photometer was installed.\n\nFinally, a 1 m [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope|Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien]]-[[Coud\u00e9 telescope|coud\u00e9]] (RCC) telescope was installed in 1974, for high-resolution imaging and photometry of fainter targets. This marked the end of the initial development of Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 station.[[File:Piszkesteto-observatory.jpg|alt=Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station|thumb|300x300px|Aerial image of Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Mountain Station of the Konkoly Observatory in the M\u00e1tra hills.]]\n\nIn the late 1990s, photographic plates and photometers were replaced with CCD cameras on the Schmidt and RCC telescopes. In 2015, an echelle spectrograph with a spectral resolution of R=20,000 was installed on the RCC telescope.\n\nA 40&nbsp;cm Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien telescope was set up in 2010, intended for automated remote observations.

From their earliest presence in [[North America]], European Canadians have contributed [[literature]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[theater]], [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[Agriculture|agricultural]] skills, [[food]]s, [[medicine]], [[science]] and [[technology]], [[fashion]] and [[clothing]] styles, [[music]], [[language]], [[business]], [[economics]], [[legal system]], [[political system]], and social and technological innovation to [[Canadian culture]]. European-Canadian culture derived its earliest influences from English, French, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers and is quantitatively the largest proportion of Canadian culture. The overall Canadian culture reflects European-Canadian culture, also known as White Canadian culture. The culture has been developing since long before Canada formed a separate country. Much of Canadian culture shows influences from English culture, with later periphery influence, due to 19th-century immigration, from different regions of Europe, such as the customs of [[Eastern European Canadians]]. Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the [[English language]], legal system and other cultural attributes.\n\n===Canadian flag===\n[[File:Ruth & George Stanley.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[George Stanley]] designer of the current [[Canadian flag]].]]\n*'''[[Canadian flag]]''' - In 1964, Prime Minister [[Lester B.

From their earliest presence in [[North America]], European Canadians have contributed [[literature]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[theater]], [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[Agriculture|agricultural]] skills, [[food]]s, [[medicine]], [[science]] and [[technology]], [[fashion]] and [[clothing]] styles, [[music]], [[language]], [[business]], [[economics]], [[legal system]], [[political system]], and social and technological innovation to [[Canadian culture]]. European-Canadian culture derived its earliest influences from English, French, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers and is quantitatively the largest proportion of Canadian culture. The overall Canadian culture reflects European-Canadian culture, also known as White Canadian culture. The culture has been developing since long before Canada formed a separate country. Much of Canadian culture shows influences from English culture, with later periphery influence, due to 19th-century immigration, from different regions of Europe, such as the customs of [[Eastern European Canadians]]. Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the [[English language]], legal system and other cultural attributes.\n\n===Canadian flag===\n[[File:Ruth & George Stanley.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[George Stanley]] designer of the current [[Canadian flag]].]]\n*'''[[Canadian flag]]''' - In 1964, Prime Minister [[Lester B.
