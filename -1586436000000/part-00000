The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on July 1, 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  A year later in 1997, two additional cars were purchased.  To generate additional revenues, the company started in 1899 a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  For the first time, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and to pay the mortgage on the city's new sports complex, the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortic Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on October 18, 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. which has its roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John Newfoundland]], is an international company which operates Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n=== LED lighting ===\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, contracted crews to convert approximate 5,000 street lamps that were using the older [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-vapour lamps]] which typically lasted six years, to the more energy efficient [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]] that could last as long as twenty years.  The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Contraversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on July 1, 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  A year later in 1997, two additional cars were purchased.  To generate additional revenues, the company started in 1899 a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$ 4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  For the first time, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and to pay the mortgage on the city's new sports complex, the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortic Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million.

The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Contraversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.

This is done by both individual households and by governments and institutions.\n\n==De-icing and anti-icing==\n[[File:Winter road treatment using salt brine.jpg|thumb|Salt [[brine]] sprayed and dried on a road surface for anti-icing before a snow storm]]\n{{Main article|De-icing}}\nDe-icing is defined as removal of existing snow, ice or frost from a roadway, airport runway, or other surface. It includes both mechanical means, such as plowing or scraping, and chemical means, such as application of salt or other ice-melting chemicals. Anti-icing is treatment with ice-melting chemicals before or during the onset of a storm in order to prevent or delay the formation and adhesion of ice and snow to the surface. [[Brine]], or wetted salt, is usually applied shortly before the beginning of a snowstorm. When properly performed, anti-icing can significantly reduce the amount of salt required and allow easier removal by mechanical methods, including plowing.<ref>Cornell Local Roads Program, ''Snow and Ice Control Operations for Local Highway Officials''</ref>\n\nThe de-icing of roads has historically been accomplished by [[snowplow]]s or specially-designed [[dump truck]]s that spread [[salt]], often mixed with [[sand]] and [[gravel]], onto slick roads. [[Rock salt]] is normally used because it is inexpensive and readily available in large quantities. However, [[brine]] freezes at \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C (0&nbsp;\u00b0F), and so it is ineffective at these low temperatures. It also has a strong tendency to cause corrosion, [[rust]]ing the [[steel]] used in most vehicles and the [[rebar]] in concrete bridges. More recent snowmelters use other salts, such as [[calcium chloride]] and [[magnesium chloride]], which not only decrease the freezing point of water to a much lower temperature<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/95202/005.cfm|title=Recommended Anti-Icing Practices - Manual of Practice for An Effective Anti-Icing Program , June 1996 - FHWA-RD-95-202|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref> but also produce an [[exothermic reaction]], whose dissipated heat further aids in melting. In addition, they are somewhat safer for [[concrete]] [[sidewalk]]s, but excess should still be removed.{{Disputed inline|Deicer safety|date=December 2015}}\n\nRecently, organic compounds have been developed that reduce the environmental impact associated with salts and that have longer residual effects when spread on roadways, usually in conjunction with salt brines or solids. These compounds are generated as byproducts of agricultural operations, such as [[sugar beet]] refining or [[ethanol]] [[distillation]].<ref>[http://www.betterroads.com/articles/brjul01a.htm Better Roads- dead link pending resolution with Better Roads magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624191744/http://betterroads.com/articles/brjul01a.htm |date=2006-06-24 }}</ref> A mixture of some selection of these organic compounds with a combination of salts results in a substance that is both more easily spread and more effective at lower temperatures (\u221234&nbsp;\u00b0C or \u221230&nbsp;\u00b0F). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magicsalt.info/Magic%20Salt.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605032512/http://www.magicsalt.info/Magic%20Salt.htm |archivedate=2009-06-05 }}</ref>\n\nSince the 1990s, use of liquid chemical melters has been increasing, [[sprayer|sprayed]] on roads by nozzles instead of a spinning spreader used with salts. Liquid melters are more effective at preventing the ice from bonding to the surface than melting through existing ice.\n\nSeveral proprietary products incorporate anti-icing chemicals into the pavement. Verglimit incorporates calcium chloride granules into asphalt pavement. The granules are continually exposed by traffic wear, and release calcium chloride onto the surface. This prevents snow and ice from sticking to the pavement <ref>Verglimit SA, Capabilities of Verglimit, http://www.verglimit.eu/en_capabilities.php, Sep 20, 2010, retrieved 12/14/2010</ref>\nCargill SafeLane is a proprietary pavement surface treatment that absorbs anti-icing brines, to be released during a storm or other icing event.

This system combines the mechanical action of the water to remove the snow and the > zero temperature of the water to melt the snow. This system can only be used where ground temperatures do not regularly drop below zero, otherwise sheet ice formation could result (although a continuous water flow would act as an impediment to this).]]\n\nIn Niigata, Japan, relatively inexpensive hot water bubbles up through holes in the pavement to melt snow, though this solution is only practical within a [[city]] or [[town]]. Some individual buildings may melt snow and ice with [[electric power|electric]] [[heating element]]s buried in the pavement, or even on a [[roof]] to prevent [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]] on the [[Roof shingle|shingles]], or to keep massive chunks of snow and dangerous [[icicle]]s from collapsing on anyone below. Small areas of pavement can be kept ice-free by circulating heated liquids in embedded piping systems.\n\n==Clearing by individuals==\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Plastic_Snow_Shovel.JPG|thumb|right|200 px|Inexpensive snow shovel for household use.]] -->\n[[Image:Uklizen\u00ed snehu.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Manual snow removal]][[File:Shoveling-snow-removal-pelleter-neige-deneigement-2012-12-29.webm|thumb|right|Snow removal two days after a record-breaking 45 cm of snow falls in [[Montreal]].]]\n\nMost snow removal by individuals is clearance of driveways and walkways. After heavy snowfalls, snow may be removed from roofs to reduce the risk of structural damage due to the weight.\n\nIn places with light snow, brooms or other light instruments can be used to brush off snow from walks and other surfaces. In regions with more precipitation, snow is commonly removed with [[snow shovel]]s, a large lightweight shovel used to push snow and lift it, and [[snow scoop]]s or sleigh shovels, a large and deep hopper-like implement fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it on any slippery surface to another location without lifting. Other tools include [[snow pusher]]s and shovels with one or more wheels.\n\nShovelling entails a considerable amount of physical effort and can strain the [[back]] and the [[heart]]. Each year many senior citizens and middle aged persons die from heart attacks while shovelling snow.<ref>[http://shovler.com/blog/dangers-of-shoveling-snow/ Dangers of Shoveling Snow<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[Snow blower]]s are often used by people unwilling or unable to perform this labour, people with large [[driveway]]s or other substantial surfaces and people who live in areas with long lasting winters with large amounts of snowfall. Others may hire a contractor with a plow bearing truck or a shovel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100213081136/http://thedailyreview.com/news/snow-slams-area-slick-roads-lead-to-travel-troubles-1.611110 Snow slams area: Slick roads lead to travel troubles - News - Daily Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> After a large snowfall, businessmen with plow trucks often drive through cities offering to plow for money.\n\nRemoving ice is more difficult. Snow blowers are usually ineffective at clearing ice. Picks are sometimes used, but a solid [[spade]] can break through most ice. There is always the risk of damaging the pavement with these instruments. Icy areas can be covered with [[salt]] or some other substance, bags of which are widely available.\n\nA recent technological advance is the [[snowmelt system]] that heats the pavement from below and melts snow and ice after a period of time. Such systems are expensive to install and operate and they are not cost effective in areas with very low winter temperatures and large snowfalls.\n\nSome governments offer free snow clearing for the elderly and others in need. In some cities, snow clearing for elder and handicapped residents counts towards community service hours assigned as a punishment for minor offences.<ref>FHWA Domestic Pedestrian Safety Scanning Tour http://www.cdtcmpo.org/bike/pedsafety.pdf, Sep. 2005, retrieved Dec. 2010</ref>\n\nIn some places, laws require homeowners to clear snow from the public [[sidewalk]] in front of their house, as well as a pathway on their own property to their [[post box|mailbox]]. Those who fail to do so, depending on the jurisdiction's laws, may experience fines and may be civilly liable for injuries suffered by another on a surface that they were required to clear. In some jurisdictions, such as New York, private home owners who shovel are held civilly liable for others' injuries incurred by falling in areas that have been shovelled{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.\n\nCleaning off and freeing one's vehicle is another matter. Some people who need their vehicles will only do barely what is necessary in order to drive the vehicle and remove it from its space. Failure to clear all the snow and ice from a vehicle causes hazards by impairing the driver's visibility, and ice from the roofs of driven vehicles can cause crashes.<ref>The rare but deadly danger of flying ice, Minneapolis St. Paul Star Tribune, January 16, 2009, http://www.startribune.com/local/37747909.html?page=1&c=y{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In some jurisdictions, motorists who fail to clear snow from their vehicle entirely may be fined.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/gloucester/index.ssf?/base/news-14/1265779531326870.xml&coll=8 A clean car is safe \u00d0 and legal - NJ.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Others may be more thorough in this process.\n\nIn some urban residential areas with [[curbside parking]], residents [[Parking space reservation in snowstorms|use objects to mark the spaces they dug out]] so they can reclaim their space upon their return.\n\nSome people use a leaf blower to blow off light powder snow from their car.  Also, some people use a leaf blower to blow off light powder snow from their driveway, walks and decks.  Only works well for very light powder snow.\n\n== Clearing by the owners of contiguous lands or buildings ==\n[[Image:snow plow machine.jpg| thumb | right | A [[snow grooming]] machine at [[Perisher Ski Resort]], Australia]]\nIn some countries, keeping sidewalks clear and safe in winter is a duty of the owner of the contiguous land or building. The owner can be an individual inhabitant, in case of a family house, but also the municipality, municipal district or their specific organization or a housing co-operative or some other company (especially if some office or industrial object is concerned). Owners of large buildings or building complexes generally have mechanized snow-removal equipment, but individual house owners mostly clean the sidewalk with hand tools.\n\nOne example of the longstanding debate over the obligation of snow removal comes from the [[Czech Republic]]. In [[Prague]], evidence of such a duty is documented since 1838.<ref>Pavel Fastr: ''Z\u00e1kon o pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00edch s koment\u00e1\u0159em a vyhl\u00e1\u0161kou.'', Praha, Linde, repeated editions since 1997</ref> The decree of the government of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] No. 1/1943 Sb. said that sidewalk cleaning in residential areas of municipalities with more than 5000 inhabitants, of district cities and of other specified municipalities is a duty of the owner or user of the contiguous land. The municipality was empowered to undertake this duty at the expense of the contiguous land owner. The Czechoslovak Road Act No. 135/1961 Sb. (\u00a723) adopted such legal regulations for all municipalities, but municipality offices could modify them. The new Road Act of the Czech Republic, No. 13/1997 Sb. (\u00a79 art. 4) left this enactment in place and stated that maintenance of a road, path, track etc. is an obligation of its owner without any exception. Despite this, \u00a727 art. 4 attached to the owner of contiguous land the liability for harm caused by defects of cleaning. In its 2002 and 2003 annual reports, the [[Ombudsman#Czech Republic|Czech Public Defender of Rights]] made a claim for there being a discrepancy between the theoretical and the practical interpretations of the act and recommended that an unequivocal formulation be enacted. This discrepancy was repeatedly handled by the courts, and the Supreme Administrative Court on 27 June 2005 and the Constitutional Court on 3 January 2007 each stated that the cleaning duty results indirectly from the stated liability for harm. Those who impugn the duty argued that it is a residue of feudal corv\u00e9e or of the totalitarian Nazi and communist regimes, that nowadays, compulsory labour mandated by law is in conflict with the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] and that systematic municipal cleaning is more effective than cleaning by individuals. On 6 December 2007, the [[Senate of the Czech Republic]] proposed at the instance of its Constitutional Committee to remove the controversial article from \u00a727 of the Road Act of 1997. The Czech Government gave support to it by a narrow majority. In a previous vote and after heated debate, the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic]] had sanctioned this change by a margin of 116 to 31 amongst the 190 members present. Since 16 April 2009, the changes made by Act No. 97/2009 Sb. mandate that sidewalk cleaning is an obligation only of the owner of the walkway or road, i.e. generally the municipality. Despite the abolition of the duty, many people, including its opponents, declared that they will continue the winter cleaning of municipal sidewalks and paths, but instead will do so voluntarily and on their own behalf.\n\nAs was mentioned during the discussion in the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] in a statement by the Czech Association of Cities and Municipalities, a similar duty belongs to owners of contiguous land exists in many other modern countries, e.g. Austria, France, the United States and some cities in [[Bavaria]].\n\n==Clearing by contractors==\n[[File:TahoeWorkz.jpg|thumb|Clearing a residential driveway in [[Incline Village, Nevada]]]]\nHiring a contractor with a [[winter service vehicle]] or a shovel.\n\nIn many high elevation or heavy snow accumulating areas, companies with snow removal equipment offer to provide services to remove the snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tahoeworkz.com/Hiring_a_Snow_Removal_Contractor.html|title=Hiring a Snow Removal Contractor|publisher=Tahoe Workz LLC Snow Removal Services|accessdate=2008-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083128/http://tahoeworkz.com/Hiring_a_Snow_Removal_Contractor.html|archive-date=2009-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Contractors may work on a per-time basis, full season contract, or will-call status.  Per-time service (or per-push) is usually invoiced monthly and customers will be charged for each time services are provided.  Some companies will charge per-time and per-inch where the depth of the snow is even taken into account.  A full season contract is quoted and paid upfront at the start of the season and services will be provided automatically according to the contracted terms. Terms may sometimes differ between companies. For example, some full season contracts will expire after a certain amount of trips where others are unlimited.  And finally, will-call service is where the client makes contact with the snow removal company to initiate a single clearing.  This is not an automatic service and charges are usually higher for will-call jobs.\n\nSnow removal services may include driveway<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tahoeworkz.com/Photos.html|title=Professional Snow Removal Photos|publisher=Tahoe Workz LLC Snow Removal Services|accessdate=2008-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328163431/http://tahoeworkz.com/Photos.html|archive-date=2009-03-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> and parking area snow removal, walkway and deck handwork, and occasionally roof clearing.  Contractors use hand shovels, walk behind snowblowers (or snow throwers), truck plows, skid-steers, light-weight tractors, and heavy front-end loaders.  Many times, these machines will require use of tire chains to perform their tasks.  Snow may be pushed by plowing methods or blown to an area of the property by snowblowers.  Contractors may apply sand or salt in some locations to help melt ice accumulations.\n\nMany snow removal contractors will require installation of snow poles or snow staking along the driveway.  This is to keep equipment out of the landscaping and to help identify the perimeter of an area.\n\n==Clearing by municipalities==\n[[File:Wagons removing snow in New York City, 1908.jpg|thumb|Line of horse-drawn wagons hauling snow in New York City, 1908.]]\nCities clear snow on a much larger scale than individuals.<ref name=\"McKelvey1995\">{{cite book|author=Blake McKelvey|title=Snow in the Cities: A History of America's Urban Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx9CZkssBfIC|year=1995|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-878822-54-3}}</ref> Most cities in areas that get regular snowfall maintain a fleet of snow clearing vehicles. The first to be dispatched are [[winter service vehicle#Gritter|gritter]]s who do some plowing but also salt the road.  The salt, via [[freezing point depression]], helps melt the snow and ice and also gives vehicles more traction. Later, usually when the snow has ceased falling, snow plows, [[front end loader]]s with snowplow attachments, and [[grader]]s cover every street pushing snow to the side of the road. Salt trucks often then return to deal with any remaining ice and snow. The trucks generally travel much faster than the plows, averaging between 30 and 40 kilometers per hour.   Most cities thus have at least twice as many plows as trucks. Smaller narrow body plows, with [[Caterpillar tracks]] or huge snow tires salt and clear [[sidewalk]]s in some cities, but in many others with less snowfall and/or less pedestrian traffic individuals are tasked with clearing the sidewalk in front of their homes. [[Ecological]] movements often oppose this use of salt because of the damage it does when it eventually washes off the roads and spreads to the environment in general. Credit for the concept that municipalities should remove snow from public roadways usually goes to [[Edward N. Hines]], a celebrated early 20th century transportation thinker who also was the first to put a painted center line stripe on an automobile-era road.\n\nIn cities where snow steadily accumulates over the winter it is also necessary to remove the piles of snow that build up on the side of the roads known as [[windrow]]s or snowbanks. There are a number of methods of doing this. ''Pulling snow'' is done when temperatures rise high enough for traffic to melt snow. The windrows are then broken up and spread over the road. ''Casting'' is the moving of snow by means of a shovel or plow to nearby public lands. On boulevards or highways ''winging back'' is done, which consists of pushing the snow banks further from the road. The most expensive option, but necessary when there are no nearby places to dump the snow, is to haul it away. This is most often done by large self-propelled snowblowers that gather the piles of snow at the side of the road and load it into [[dump truck]]s. The snow is then dumped on the outskirts of town, or in a nearby lake, river or harbor. (Some jurisdictions have banned dumping snow into local bodies of water for environmental reasons - modern roads can be contaminated with melting salt, motor oil, and other substances.) [[Snowmelter|Snow melting machines]] may be cheaper than moving snow, depending on the cost of fuel and the ambient temperature.<ref>[http://www.city.toronto.on.ca/transportation/snow/torontomelt.htm City of Toronto: Transportation Services - Snow management<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe windrows created by the plows in residential areas often block driveways and imprison parked cars. The snow pushed there by any plow is a dense, packed version of \"normal\" fallen snow. When the temperatures are significantly below freezing this packed snow takes some of the characteristics of solid ice. Its removal is nearly impossible without mechanical means. Recently, windrows created in residential neighborhoods by city operated snow plows have resulted in the snow plow operators being assaulted by angry homeowners. \n[[Image:Chasse neige.jpg|thumb|A street plow in [[Quebec City]], Canada]]\nThe largest roads and highways are the first to be cleared; roads with steep hills or other dangers are also often a priority. Streets used by [[bus]]es and other [[mass transit]] are also often given higher priorities. It often takes many hours, or even days, to cover every street in a city. In some places, a [[snow emergency]] will be declared, where automobile owners are instructed to remove their vehicles from the street (or one side of a street). If cars are in the way when the plows come around, they may be hauled away by [[tow truck]]s.  Some communities have standing snow emergency rules in winter, in which vehicles may not be parked on streets overnight, whether it snows or not. After smaller snow storms only main roads are cleared while residential ones are left to be melted by passing traffic. Decisions on immediate removal versus \"natural melting\" can be hard to make because the inconvenience to citizens and the economy in general must be weighed against the immediate effect on the snow removal budget at that particular moment in the season.\n\nIn large cities with heavy snowfalls like [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]], the snow clearing expense for each season is an important part of the seasonal public works budget and each snow storm provokes a major logistical operation involving thousands of employees working in shifts 24 hours a day. The effort can vary greatly depending on the amount of snow.  Montreal gets about 225&nbsp;cm of snow each winter and spends more than $158 million Canadian (2013)<ref>[http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/service_fin_fr/media/documents/budget-2013-ACTIVITES.pdf Montreal 2013 Budget]</ref> each year to remove it.  [[Toronto]], with about 50 per cent more population and 28 per cent more road surface, gets only 125&nbsp;cm of snow a year and spends about half that.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/finance/moneywise/story.html?id=2fe90713-1df8-4f24-9a00-fdbeb648426a Cost of Snow (December 24, 2004)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227035139/http://www.canada.com/finance/moneywise/story.html?id=2fe90713-1df8-4f24-9a00-fdbeb648426a |date=February 27, 2006 }}</ref> The higher cost in Montreal is due to the need to perform \"snow removal\" as opposed to simple \"snow clearing\" necessitated by both the high snowfall amounts and fewer melting days.\n\nIn [[Helsinki]], Finland, the amount of snow transported from streets and properties to [[snow dump site]]s during the [[Winter of 2009\u20132010 in Europe|winter of 2009\u20132010]] was 210,000 truckloads, equaling over 3 million cubic meters.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Helsingin lumitalkoissa on rikottu kaikki enn\u00e4tykset |author=Jenita Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 |journal=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |date=2011-03-06 |url=http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/helsingin_lumitalkoissa_on_rikottu_kaikki_ennatykset/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308182058/http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/helsingin_lumitalkoissa_on_rikottu_kaikki_ennatykset/ |archivedate=2011-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nSnow removal impacts the design of city infrastructure.  Where possible, street boulevards are wider to accommodate the windrows and sidewalks are not right next to the street.  [[Fire hydrant]]s will have tall flags to locate them under the windrows.  Reflective traffic [[lane marker]]s embedded in the roadbed is not possible (or much harder) due to risk of damage by plows.  Access to snow dumping locations (e.g. ravines) by heavy equipment is also planned.\n\nIt is estimated that Canada spends $1 billion annually on snow removal.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ice/ Ice<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The employees who do this work are generally the same workers who do road maintenance work during the summer months, but in some US cities garbage trucks are also equipped with plows and used for snow removal.  Many smaller US communities sign contracts with insurance companies, under which the insurance company assumes the risk of a heavy winter.  The insurance company of course sets the rates such that averaged over time they will make a profit; the town is willing to overpay for snow removal in mild winters in order to avoid the risk of running dramatically over budget in the occasional severe winter.\n\nLarge organizations such as [[university|universities]] and [[airport]]s also often have their own mechanized snow clearing force.  Public transit systems generally clear bus stops while [[post office]]s clear around [[Post box|mail box]]es. [[Railroad]]s have their own snow clearing devices such as [[rotary snowplow]]s.\n\nAirports, with their associated runways, taxiways and ramp areas are an exception to the use of salt, as the metals used in aircraft construction will corrode causing safety issues.\n\n==Snow dump sites==\n<!--\"snow dump\", \"snow dump site\", \"snow farm\" redirect here-->\n[[File:Snow removal in Helsinki 212.jpg|thumb|Snow in [[Helsinki]] being loaded on truck for transportation to a snow dump site]]\n[[File:Lumenkaatopaikka Lielahti.jpg|thumb|Snow dump site in [[Tampere]]. Melting has already begun and mostly sand and dirt is visible.]]\nA snow dump site is a location where snow is dumped as a part of the snow removal process. Designated sites are sometimes required to prevent water and ground pollution because the snow collected on roads typically contain a variety of grit, de-icing chemicals, vehicle fluids, engine emissions, and litter. Some pollutants become diluted and wash away with the melt-water and some concentrate at the dump site.<ref name=\"Alaska\" >\"Evaluation of Snow Disposal into Near Shore Marine Environments\" Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. June 2006.  https://dec.alaska.gov/water/wnpspc/stormwater/docs/adec_snow_disposal_evaluation..htm.pdf</ref> Dumping into fresh water is \"...almost universally prohibited due to the serious impact that deicer salts can have on freshwater aquatic life.\"<ref name=\"Alaska\"/> In the United States dumping snow into water bodies is not specifically prohibited by the [[Clean Water Act]] or the [[Ocean Dumping Act]]. The states and local governments determine their own dumping policies.\n\nSnow dump site selection is based on the availability of suitable land and pollution prevention factors that may include distances from lakes and streams, installation of silt fences, soil and aquifer type, and other factors. Some sites may use filters and settling ponds to help prevent the pollution from spreading. Occasionally an excessive amount of snow must be dumped and is sometimes allowed to be legally dumped into water bodies on an \"emergency only\" basis.\n\n==Surface treatments==\nThe surface is treated primarily by snow removal. Roads are also treated by spreading various materials on the surface. These materials generally fall into two categories: chemical and inert. Chemical (including salt) distribution induces [[freezing-point depression]], causing ice and snow to melt at a lower temperature. Chemical treatment can be applied as a preventive measure and/or after snowfall. Inert materials (i.e. sand, brash, slag) make the surface irregular to improve traction. Both types can be applied together, but the inert materials tend to lower traction once the snow and ice has melted.\n\nChemical treatment materials include:\n* [[Sodium chloride]] (common table salt, NaCl)\n* [[Calcium chloride]] (CaCl<sub>2</sub>)\n* [[Potassium chloride]] (KCl)\n* [[Magnesium chloride]] (MgCl<sub>2</sub>)\n* [[Ammonium nitrate]] (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>)\n* [[Ammonium sulfate]] [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]\n* [[Potassium acetate]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOK)\n* [[Urea]] [(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO]\n* [[Propylene glycol]] (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)\n* [[Calcium magnesium acetate]] (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Ca and C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Mg)\n* [[Sodium ferrocyanide]] (hydrous, Na<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>\u202210H<sub>2</sub>O)\n* [[Methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside]] (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) <ref>[http://www.wrightwoodcalif.com/forum/index.php?topic=2245.0;all Wrightwood Forum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.chemexper.com/chemicals/supplier/cas/97-30-3.html alpha-D-Methylglucoside - 97-30-3 - Catalog of Chemical Suppliers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, 98% of chemical treatment materials used in 2000 were [[sodium chloride]] in various forms. It is effective down to \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C, at the most \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C. For colder temperatures, [[calcium chloride]] (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) is added to NaCl in some countries, but deployment is limited as it costs about 6 times as much as sodium chloride. Other substances were used rarely and experimentally. Alternative substances (urea, alcohols, glycols) are often used at airports.<ref name=melcher>Karel Melcher: [http://ekolist.cz/zprava.shtml?x=49570 Posypov\u00e9 materi\u00e1ly pro zimn\u00ed \u00fadr\u017ebu komunikac\u00ed v \u010cR a v zem\u00edch EU] (Winter road maintenance spreadings in the Czech Republic and in EU countries), Ekolist.cz, 3. 12. 2001</ref>  In recent years, Geomelt, a combination of salt brine and beet juice that is otherwise considered a waste product has been used for pretreatment.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/research/2008-02-21-beeting-ice_N.htm|title=Cities, states testing beet juice mixture on roadways | work=USA Today | date=February 21, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010\n}}</ref> In Wisconsin, USA, surplus brine from cheese making has been used for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Yaccino |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/us/wisconsin-finds-another-role-for-cheese-de-icing-roads.html |title=Pouring Cheese on Icy Roads in (Where Else?)

Some chemicals can degrade [[concrete]], metals, and other materials.  The resulting [[meltwater]] and [[slush]] can cause [[frost heaving]] if it re-freezes, which can also damage pavement. Inert materials can damage vehicles and create dust.\n\nAs an example, in the [[Czech Republic]] during the winter season of 2000/2001, net material expenditure for road treatment was: 168 000 tonnes of salt (mostly NaCl), 348 000 tonnes of sand and crushed stone and 91 000 tonnes of other materials like slag. In Ireland, the annual expenditure of salt was 30 000 tonnes. Switzerland reports their annual expenditure as 600&nbsp;grammes of salt to every square metre of roads on average.<ref name=melcher />\n\n===Side effects===\nDe-icing chemicals and inert materials need to be selected and applied with care.\n\nChemicals may react with infrastructure, the environment, and vehicles. Chlorides corrode steel and aluminum in reinforced concrete, structures and vehicles. Acetates can cause asphalt stripping, weakening the bond between asphalt binder and aggregate. Sand and grit can clog pavement joints and cracks, preventing pavement from expanding in the summer and increasing stress in the pavement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pavementinteractive.org/2013/11/11/pavement-condition-and-winter-deicing-treatments/ |title=Pavement Condition and Winter Deicing Treatments|date=November 11, 2013 |author=Pavement Interactive}}</ref>\n\nSalts can be toxic to plants and aquatic life, including the trees lining the side of the roads. Sand can alter aquatic habitats where roads are near  streams and lakes. Acetates can reduce oxygen levels in smaller water bodies, stressing aquatic animal life. Sand can be ground by tires into very fine particulate matter and become airborne, contributing to air pollution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://stormwater.allianceforthebay.org/take-action/habits-to-help/winter-deicing/ |title=Winter Deicing |accessdate=2014-01-07 |publisher=the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/archive/notesdocs/25-25(4)_fr.pdf/nchrp_chapter_8.doc |title= Environmental Stewardship Practices, Procedures,and Policies for Highway Construction and Maintenance Chapter 8: Winter Operations and Salt, Sand, and Chemical Management |publisher=Transportation Research Board |date=September 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Snow removal tools==\n\n* [[Snow shovel]]\n* [[Snow blower]]\n* [[Snowplow]]\n* [[Ice pick]]\n* [[Spade]]\n* [[Winter service vehicle]]\n* [[Snowmelter]]\n* [[Snowmelt system]] embedded in pavement, also known as [[radiant heat]].\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Grit bin]]\n* [[Ice road]]\n* [[Metromelt]]\n*[[Parking chair]]\n* [[Road slipperiness]]\n* [[Snow emergency]]\n*[[Smart highway]]\n*[[Snow chains]]\n*[[Snow filtration]]\n*[[Snowmelt system]]\n*[[Street sweeper]]\n*[[Winter service vehicle]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.sima.org/ Snow and Ice Management Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090428171243/http://nsidc.org/snow/shovel.html Have Snow Shovel, Will Travel: A History of Snow Removal]\n*[http://chemistry.about.com/cs/howthingswork/a/aa120703a.htm Comparison of snow and ice melting substances]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snow Removal}}\n[[Category:Snow removal|*]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Inclement weather management]]\n[[Category:Snow|Removal]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Sidewalk plow.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|A sidewalk clearing plow in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\n[[Image:Snow blower 1933.jpg|thumb|right|Snowblower in [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], 1933]]\n'''Snow removal''' or '''snow clearing''' is the job of removing [[snow]] after a snowfall to make travel easier and safer.  This is done by both individual households and by governments and institutions.\n\n==De-icing and anti-icing==\n[[File:Winter road treatment using salt brine.jpg|thumb|Salt [[brine]] sprayed and dried on a road surface for anti-icing before a snow storm]]\n{{Main article|De-icing}}\nDe-icing is defined as removal of existing snow, ice or frost from a roadway, airport runway, or other surface. It includes both mechanical means, such as plowing or scraping, and chemical means, such as application of salt or other ice-melting chemicals. Anti-icing is treatment with ice-melting chemicals before or during the onset of a storm in order to prevent or delay the formation and adhesion of ice and snow to the surface. [[Brine]], or wetted salt, is usually applied shortly before the beginning of a snowstorm. When properly performed, anti-icing can significantly reduce the amount of salt required and allow easier removal by mechanical methods, including plowing.<ref>Cornell Local Roads Program, ''Snow and Ice Control Operations for Local Highway Officials''</ref>\n\nThe de-icing of roads has historically been accomplished by [[snowplow]]s or specially-designed [[dump truck]]s that spread [[salt]], often mixed with [[sand]] and [[gravel]], onto slick roads. [[Rock salt]] is normally used because it is inexpensive and readily available in large quantities. However, [[brine]] freezes at \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C (0&nbsp;\u00b0F), and so it is ineffective at these low temperatures. It also has a strong tendency to cause corrosion, [[rust]]ing the [[steel]] used in most vehicles and the [[rebar]] in concrete bridges. More recent snowmelters use other salts, such as [[calcium chloride]] and [[magnesium chloride]], which not only decrease the freezing point of water to a much lower temperature<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/95202/005.cfm|title=Recommended Anti-Icing Practices - Manual of Practice for An Effective Anti-Icing Program , June 1996 - FHWA-RD-95-202|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref> but also produce an [[exothermic reaction]], whose dissipated heat further aids in melting. In addition, they are somewhat safer for [[concrete]] [[sidewalk]]s, but excess should still be removed.{{Disputed inline|Deicer safety|date=December 2015}}\n\nRecently, organic compounds have been developed that reduce the environmental impact associated with salts and that have longer residual effects when spread on roadways, usually in conjunction with salt brines or solids. These compounds are generated as byproducts of agricultural operations, such as [[sugar beet]] refining or [[ethanol]] [[distillation]].<ref>[http://www.betterroads.com/articles/brjul01a.htm Better Roads- dead link pending resolution with Better Roads magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624191744/http://betterroads.com/articles/brjul01a.htm |date=2006-06-24 }}</ref> A mixture of some selection of these organic compounds with a combination of salts results in a substance that is both more easily spread and more effective at lower temperatures (\u221234&nbsp;\u00b0C or \u221230&nbsp;\u00b0F). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magicsalt.info/Magic%20Salt.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605032512/http://www.magicsalt.info/Magic%20Salt.htm |archivedate=2009-06-05 }}</ref>\n\nSince the 1990s, use of liquid chemical melters has been increasing, [[sprayer|sprayed]] on roads by nozzles instead of a spinning spreader used with salts. Liquid melters are more effective at preventing the ice from bonding to the surface than melting through existing ice.\n\nSeveral proprietary products incorporate anti-icing chemicals into the pavement. Verglimit incorporates calcium chloride granules into asphalt pavement. The granules are continually exposed by traffic wear, and release calcium chloride onto the surface. This prevents snow and ice from sticking to the pavement <ref>Verglimit SA, Capabilities of Verglimit, http://www.verglimit.eu/en_capabilities.php, Sep 20, 2010, retrieved 12/14/2010</ref>\nCargill SafeLane is a proprietary pavement surface treatment that absorbs anti-icing brines, to be released during a storm or other icing event.

Some individual buildings may melt snow and ice with [[electric power|electric]] [[heating element]]s buried in the pavement, or even on a [[roof]] to prevent [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]] on the [[Roof shingle|shingles]], or to keep massive chunks of snow and dangerous [[icicle]]s from collapsing on anyone below.

After heavy snowfalls, snow may be removed from roofs to reduce the risk of structural damage due to the weight.\n\nIn places with light snow, brooms or other light instruments can be used to brush off snow from walks and other surfaces. In regions with more precipitation, snow is commonly removed with [[snow shovel]]s, a large lightweight shovel used to push snow and lift it, and [[snow scoop]]s or sleigh shovels, a large and deep hopper-like implement fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it on any slippery surface to another location without lifting. Other tools include [[snow pusher]]s and shovels with one or more wheels.\n\nShovelling entails a considerable amount of physical effort and can strain the [[back]] and the [[heart]]. Each year many senior citizens and middle aged persons die from heart attacks while shovelling snow.<ref>[http://shovler.com/blog/dangers-of-shoveling-snow/ Dangers of Shoveling Snow<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[Snow blower]]s are often used by people unwilling or unable to perform this labour, people with large [[driveway]]s or other substantial surfaces and people who live in areas with long lasting winters with large amounts of snowfall.

Snow blowers are usually ineffective at clearing ice. Picks are sometimes used, but a solid [[spade]] can break through most ice. There is always the risk of damaging the pavement with these instruments. Icy areas can be covered with [[salt]] or some other substance, bags of which are widely available.\n\nA recent technological advance is the [[snowmelt system]] that heats the pavement from below and melts snow and ice after a period of time. Such systems are expensive to install and operate and they are not cost effective in areas with very low winter temperatures and large snowfalls.\n\nSome governments offer free snow clearing for the elderly and others in need. In some cities, snow clearing for elder and handicapped residents counts towards community service hours assigned as a punishment for minor offences.<ref>FHWA Domestic Pedestrian Safety Scanning Tour http://www.cdtcmpo.org/bike/pedsafety.pdf, Sep. 2005, retrieved Dec. 2010</ref>\n\nIn some places, laws require homeowners to clear snow from the public [[sidewalk]] in front of their house, as well as a pathway on their own property to their [[post box|mailbox]]. Those who fail to do so, depending on the jurisdiction's laws, may experience fines and may be civilly liable for injuries suffered by another on a surface that they were required to clear. In some jurisdictions, such as New York, private home owners who shovel are held civilly liable for others' injuries incurred by falling in areas that have been shovelled{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.\n\nCleaning off and freeing one's vehicle is another matter. Some people who need their vehicles will only do barely what is necessary in order to drive the vehicle and remove it from its space. Failure to clear all the snow and ice from a vehicle causes hazards by impairing the driver's visibility, and ice from the roofs of driven vehicles can cause crashes.<ref>The rare but deadly danger of flying ice, Minneapolis St. Paul Star Tribune, January 16, 2009, http://www.startribune.com/local/37747909.html?page=1&c=y{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In some jurisdictions, motorists who fail to clear snow from their vehicle entirely may be fined.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/gloucester/index.ssf?/base/news-14/1265779531326870.xml&coll=8 A clean car is safe \u00d0 and legal - NJ.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Others may be more thorough in this process.\n\nIn some urban residential areas with [[curbside parking]], residents [[Parking space reservation in snowstorms|use objects to mark the spaces they dug out]] so they can reclaim their space upon their return.\n\nSome people use a leaf blower to blow off light powder snow from their car.  Also, some people use a leaf blower to blow off light powder snow from their driveway, walks and decks.  Only works well for very light powder snow.\n\n== Clearing by the owners of contiguous lands or buildings ==\n[[Image:snow plow machine.jpg| thumb | right | A [[snow grooming]] machine at [[Perisher Ski Resort]], Australia]]\nIn some countries, keeping sidewalks clear and safe in winter is a duty of the owner of the contiguous land or building. The owner can be an individual inhabitant, in case of a family house, but also the municipality, municipal district or their specific organization or a housing co-operative or some other company (especially if some office or industrial object is concerned). Owners of large buildings or building complexes generally have mechanized snow-removal equipment, but individual house owners mostly clean the sidewalk with hand tools.\n\nOne example of the longstanding debate over the obligation of snow removal comes from the [[Czech Republic]]. In [[Prague]], evidence of such a duty is documented since 1838.<ref>Pavel Fastr: ''Z\u00e1kon o pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00edch s koment\u00e1\u0159em a vyhl\u00e1\u0161kou.'', Praha, Linde, repeated editions since 1997</ref> The decree of the government of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] No. 1/1943 Sb. said that sidewalk cleaning in residential areas of municipalities with more than 5000 inhabitants, of district cities and of other specified municipalities is a duty of the owner or user of the contiguous land. The municipality was empowered to undertake this duty at the expense of the contiguous land owner. The Czechoslovak Road Act No. 135/1961 Sb. (\u00a723) adopted such legal regulations for all municipalities, but municipality offices could modify them. The new Road Act of the Czech Republic, No. 13/1997 Sb. (\u00a79 art. 4) left this enactment in place and stated that maintenance of a road, path, track etc. is an obligation of its owner without any exception. Despite this, \u00a727 art. 4 attached to the owner of contiguous land the liability for harm caused by defects of cleaning. In its 2002 and 2003 annual reports, the [[Ombudsman#Czech Republic|Czech Public Defender of Rights]] made a claim for there being a discrepancy between the theoretical and the practical interpretations of the act and recommended that an unequivocal formulation be enacted. This discrepancy was repeatedly handled by the courts, and the Supreme Administrative Court on 27 June 2005 and the Constitutional Court on 3 January 2007 each stated that the cleaning duty results indirectly from the stated liability for harm. Those who impugn the duty argued that it is a residue of feudal corv\u00e9e or of the totalitarian Nazi and communist regimes, that nowadays, compulsory labour mandated by law is in conflict with the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] and that systematic municipal cleaning is more effective than cleaning by individuals. On 6 December 2007, the [[Senate of the Czech Republic]] proposed at the instance of its Constitutional Committee to remove the controversial article from \u00a727 of the Road Act of 1997. The Czech Government gave support to it by a narrow majority. In a previous vote and after heated debate, the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic]] had sanctioned this change by a margin of 116 to 31 amongst the 190 members present. Since 16 April 2009, the changes made by Act No. 97/2009 Sb. mandate that sidewalk cleaning is an obligation only of the owner of the walkway or road, i.e. generally the municipality. Despite the abolition of the duty, many people, including its opponents, declared that they will continue the winter cleaning of municipal sidewalks and paths, but instead will do so voluntarily and on their own behalf.\n\nAs was mentioned during the discussion in the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] in a statement by the Czech Association of Cities and Municipalities, a similar duty belongs to owners of contiguous land exists in many other modern countries, e.g. Austria, France, the United States and some cities in [[Bavaria]].\n\n==Clearing by contractors==\n[[File:TahoeWorkz.jpg|thumb|Clearing a residential driveway in [[Incline Village, Nevada]]]]\nHiring a contractor with a [[winter service vehicle]] or a shovel.\n\nIn many high elevation or heavy snow accumulating areas, companies with snow removal equipment offer to provide services to remove the snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tahoeworkz.com/Hiring_a_Snow_Removal_Contractor.html|title=Hiring a Snow Removal Contractor|publisher=Tahoe Workz LLC Snow Removal Services|accessdate=2008-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083128/http://tahoeworkz.com/Hiring_a_Snow_Removal_Contractor.html|archive-date=2009-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Contractors may work on a per-time basis, full season contract, or will-call status.  Per-time service (or per-push) is usually invoiced monthly and customers will be charged for each time services are provided.  Some companies will charge per-time and per-inch where the depth of the snow is even taken into account.  A full season contract is quoted and paid upfront at the start of the season and services will be provided automatically according to the contracted terms. Terms may sometimes differ between companies. For example, some full season contracts will expire after a certain amount of trips where others are unlimited.  And finally, will-call service is where the client makes contact with the snow removal company to initiate a single clearing.  This is not an automatic service and charges are usually higher for will-call jobs.\n\nSnow removal services may include driveway<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tahoeworkz.com/Photos.html|title=Professional Snow Removal Photos|publisher=Tahoe Workz LLC Snow Removal Services|accessdate=2008-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328163431/http://tahoeworkz.com/Photos.html|archive-date=2009-03-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> and parking area snow removal, walkway and deck handwork, and occasionally roof clearing.  Contractors use hand shovels, walk behind snowblowers (or snow throwers), truck plows, skid-steers, light-weight tractors, and heavy front-end loaders.  Many times, these machines will require use of tire chains to perform their tasks.  Snow may be pushed by plowing methods or blown to an area of the property by snowblowers.  Contractors may apply sand or salt in some locations to help melt ice accumulations.\n\nMany snow removal contractors will require installation of snow poles or snow staking along the driveway.  This is to keep equipment out of the landscaping and to help identify the perimeter of an area.\n\n==Clearing by municipalities==\n[[File:Wagons removing snow in New York City, 1908.jpg|thumb|Line of horse-drawn wagons hauling snow in New York City, 1908.]]\nCities clear snow on a much larger scale than individuals.<ref name=\"McKelvey1995\">{{cite book|author=Blake McKelvey|title=Snow in the Cities: A History of America's Urban Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx9CZkssBfIC|year=1995|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-878822-54-3}}</ref> Most cities in areas that get regular snowfall maintain a fleet of snow clearing vehicles. The first to be dispatched are [[winter service vehicle#Gritter|gritter]]s who do some plowing but also salt the road.  The salt, via [[freezing point depression]], helps melt the snow and ice and also gives vehicles more traction. Later, usually when the snow has ceased falling, snow plows, [[front end loader]]s with snowplow attachments and [[grader]]s cover every street pushing snow to the side of the road. Salt trucks often then return to deal with any remaining ice and snow. The trucks generally travel much faster than the plows, averaging between 30 and 40 kilometers per hour.   Most cities thus have at least twice as many plows as trucks. Smaller narrow body plows, with [[Caterpillar tracks]] or huge snow tires salt and clear [[sidewalk]]s in some cities, but in many others with less snowfall and/or less pedestrian traffic individuals are tasked with clearing the sidewalk in front of their homes. [[Ecological]] movements often oppose this use of salt because of the damage it does when it eventually washes off the roads and spreads to the environment in general. Credit for the concept that municipalities should remove snow from public roadways usually goes to [[Edward N. Hines]], a celebrated early 20th century transportation thinker who also was the first to put a painted center line stripe on an automobile-era road.\n\nIn cities where snow steadily accumulates over the winter it is also necessary to remove the piles of snow that build up on the side of the roads known as [[windrow]]s or snowbanks. There are a number of methods of doing this. ''Pulling snow'' is done when temperatures rise high enough for traffic to melt snow. The windrows are then broken up and spread over the road. ''Casting'' is the moving of snow by means of a shovel or plow to nearby public lands. On boulevards or highways ''winging back'' is done, which consists of pushing the snow banks further from the road. The most expensive option, but necessary when there are no nearby places to dump the snow, is to haul it away. This is most often done by large self-propelled snowblowers that gather the piles of snow at the side of the road and load it into [[dump truck]]s. The snow is then dumped on the outskirts of town, or in a nearby lake, river or harbor. (Some jurisdictions have banned dumping snow into local bodies of water for environmental reasons - modern roads can be contaminated with melting salt, motor oil, and other substances.) [[Snowmelter|Snow melting machines]] may be cheaper than moving snow, depending on the cost of fuel and the ambient temperature.<ref>[http://www.city.toronto.on.ca/transportation/snow/torontomelt.htm City of Toronto: Transportation Services - Snow management<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe windrows created by the plows in residential areas often block driveways and imprison parked cars. The snow pushed there by any plow is a dense, packed version of \"normal\" fallen snow. When the temperatures are significantly below freezing this packed snow takes some of the characteristics of solid ice. Its removal is nearly impossible without mechanical means. Recently, windrows created in residential neighborhoods by city operated snow plows have resulted in the snow plow operators being assaulted by angry homeowners. \n[[Image:Chasse neige.jpg|thumb|A street plow in [[Quebec City]], Canada]]\nThe largest roads and highways are the first to be cleared; roads with steep hills or other dangers are also often a priority. Streets used by [[bus]]es and other [[mass transit]] are also often given higher priorities. It often takes many hours, or even days, to cover every street in a city. In some places, a [[snow emergency]] will be declared, where automobile owners are instructed to remove their vehicles from the street (or one side of a street). If cars are in the way when the plows come around, they may be hauled away by [[tow truck]]s.  Some communities have standing snow emergency rules in winter, in which vehicles may not be parked on streets overnight, whether it snows or not. After smaller snow storms only main roads are cleared while residential ones are left to be melted by passing traffic. Decisions on immediate removal versus \"natural melting\" can be hard to make because the inconvenience to citizens and the economy in general must be weighed against the immediate effect on the snow removal budget at that particular moment in the season.\n\nIn large cities with heavy snowfalls like [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]], the snow clearing expense for each season is an important part of the seasonal public works budget and each snow storm provokes a major logistical operation involving thousands of employees working in shifts 24 hours a day. The effort can vary greatly depending on the amount of snow.  Montreal gets about 225&nbsp;cm of snow each winter and spends more than $158 million Canadian (2013)<ref>[http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/service_fin_fr/media/documents/budget-2013-ACTIVITES.pdf Montreal 2013 Budget]</ref> each year to remove it.  [[Toronto]], with about 50 per cent more population and 28 per cent more road surface, gets only 125&nbsp;cm of snow a year and spends about half that.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/finance/moneywise/story.html?id=2fe90713-1df8-4f24-9a00-fdbeb648426a Cost of Snow (December 24, 2004)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227035139/http://www.canada.com/finance/moneywise/story.html?id=2fe90713-1df8-4f24-9a00-fdbeb648426a |date=February 27, 2006 }}</ref> The higher cost in Montreal is due to the need to perform \"snow removal\" as opposed to simple \"snow clearing\" necessitated by both the high snowfall amounts and fewer melting days.\n\nIn [[Helsinki]], Finland, the amount of snow transported from streets and properties to [[snow dump site]]s during the [[Winter of 2009\u20132010 in Europe|winter of 2009\u20132010]] was 210,000 truckloads, equaling over 3 million cubic meters.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Helsingin lumitalkoissa on rikottu kaikki enn\u00e4tykset |author=Jenita Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 |journal=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |date=2011-03-06 |url=http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/helsingin_lumitalkoissa_on_rikottu_kaikki_ennatykset/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308182058/http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/helsingin_lumitalkoissa_on_rikottu_kaikki_ennatykset/ |archivedate=2011-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nSnow removal impacts the design of city infrastructure.  Where possible, street boulevards are wider to accommodate the windrows and sidewalks are not right next to the street.  [[Fire hydrant]]s will have tall flags to locate them under the windrows.  Reflective traffic [[lane marker]]s embedded in the roadbed is not possible (or much harder) due to risk of damage by plows.  Access to snow dumping locations (e.g. ravines) by heavy equipment is also planned.\n\nIt is estimated that Canada spends $1 billion annually on snow removal.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ice/ Ice<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The employees who do this work are generally the same workers who do road maintenance work during the summer months, but in some US cities garbage trucks are also equipped with plows and used for snow removal.  Many smaller US communities sign contracts with insurance companies, under which the insurance company assumes the risk of a heavy winter.  The insurance company of course sets the rates such that averaged over time they will make a profit; the town is willing to overpay for snow removal in mild winters in order to avoid the risk of running dramatically over budget in the occasional severe winter.\n\nLarge organizations such as [[university|universities]] and [[airport]]s also often have their own mechanized snow clearing force.  Public transit systems generally clear bus stops while [[post office]]s clear around [[Post box|mail box]]es. [[Railroad]]s have their own snow clearing devices such as [[rotary snowplow]]s.\n\nAirports, with their associated runways, taxiways and ramp areas are an exception to the use of salt, as the metals used in aircraft construction will corrode causing safety issues.\n\n==Snow dump sites==\n<!--\"snow dump\", \"snow dump site\", \"snow farm\" redirect here-->\n[[File:Snow removal in Helsinki 212.jpg|thumb|Snow in [[Helsinki]] being loaded on truck for transportation to a snow dump site]]\n[[File:Lumenkaatopaikka Lielahti.jpg|thumb|Snow dump site in [[Tampere]]. Melting has already begun and mostly sand and dirt is visible.]]\nA snow dump site is a location where snow is dumped as a part of the snow removal process. Designated sites are sometimes required to prevent water and ground pollution because the snow collected on roads typically contain a variety of grit, de-icing chemicals, vehicle fluids, engine emissions, and litter. Some pollutants become diluted and wash away with the melt-water and some concentrate at the dump site.<ref name=\"Alaska\" >\"Evaluation of Snow Disposal into Near Shore Marine Environments\" Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. June 2006.  https://dec.alaska.gov/water/wnpspc/stormwater/docs/adec_snow_disposal_evaluation..htm.pdf</ref> Dumping into fresh water is \"...almost universally prohibited due to the serious impact that deicer salts can have on freshwater aquatic life.\"<ref name=\"Alaska\"/> In the United States dumping snow into water bodies is not specifically prohibited by the [[Clean Water Act]] or the [[Ocean Dumping Act]]. The states and local governments determine their own dumping policies.\n\nSnow dump site selection is based on the availability of suitable land and pollution prevention factors that may include distances from lakes and streams, installation of silt fences, soil and aquifer type, and other factors. Some sites may use filters and settling ponds to help prevent the pollution from spreading. Occasionally an excessive amount of snow must be dumped and is sometimes allowed to be legally dumped into water bodies on an \"emergency only\" basis.\n\n==Surface treatments==\nThe surface is treated primarily by snow removal. Roads are also treated by spreading various materials on the surface. These materials generally fall into two categories: chemical and inert. Chemical (including salt) distribution induces [[freezing-point depression]], causing ice and snow to melt at a lower temperature. Chemical treatment can be applied as a preventive measure and/or after snowfall. Inert materials (i.e. sand, brash, slag) make the surface irregular to improve traction. Both types can be applied together, but the inert materials tend to lower traction once the snow and ice has melted.\n\nChemical treatment materials include:\n* [[Sodium chloride]] (common table salt, NaCl)\n* [[Calcium chloride]] (CaCl<sub>2</sub>)\n* [[Potassium chloride]] (KCl)\n* [[Magnesium chloride]] (MgCl<sub>2</sub>)\n* [[Ammonium nitrate]] (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>)\n* [[Ammonium sulfate]] [(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]\n* [[Potassium acetate]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOK)\n* [[Urea]] [(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO]\n* [[Propylene glycol]] (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)\n* [[Calcium magnesium acetate]] (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Ca and C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Mg)\n* [[Sodium ferrocyanide]] (hydrous, Na<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>\u202210H<sub>2</sub>O)\n* [[Methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside]] (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) <ref>[http://www.wrightwoodcalif.com/forum/index.php?topic=2245.0;all Wrightwood Forum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.chemexper.com/chemicals/supplier/cas/97-30-3.html alpha-D-Methylglucoside - 97-30-3 - Catalog of Chemical Suppliers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, 98% of chemical treatment materials used in 2000 were [[sodium chloride]] in various forms. It is effective down to \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C, at the most \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C. For colder temperatures, [[calcium chloride]] (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) is added to NaCl in some countries, but deployment is limited as it costs about 6 times as much as sodium chloride. Other substances were used rarely and experimentally. Alternative substances (urea, alcohols, glycols) are often used at airports.<ref name=melcher>Karel Melcher: [http://ekolist.cz/zprava.shtml?x=49570 Posypov\u00e9 materi\u00e1ly pro zimn\u00ed \u00fadr\u017ebu komunikac\u00ed v \u010cR a v zem\u00edch EU] (Winter road maintenance spreadings in the Czech Republic and in EU countries), Ekolist.cz, 3. 12. 2001</ref>  In recent years, Geomelt, a combination of salt brine and beet juice that is otherwise considered a waste product has been used for pretreatment.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/research/2008-02-21-beeting-ice_N.htm|title=Cities, states testing beet juice mixture on roadways | work=USA Today | date=February 21, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010\n}}</ref> In Wisconsin, USA, surplus brine from cheese making has been used for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Yaccino |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/us/wisconsin-finds-another-role-for-cheese-de-icing-roads.html |title=Pouring Cheese on Icy Roads in (Where Else?)

Some chemicals can degrade [[concrete]], metals, and other materials.  The resulting [[meltwater]] and [[slush]] can cause [[frost heaving]] if it re-freezes, which can also damage pavement. Inert materials can damage vehicles and create dust.\n\nAs an example, in the [[Czech Republic]] during the winter season of 2000/2001, net material expenditure for road treatment was: 168 000 tonnes of salt (mostly NaCl), 348 000 tonnes of sand and crushed stone and 91 000 tonnes of other materials like slag. In Ireland, the annual expenditure of salt was 30 000 tonnes. Switzerland reports their annual expenditure as 600&nbsp;grammes of salt to every square metre of roads on average.<ref name=melcher />\n\n===Side effects===\nDe-icing chemicals and inert materials need to be selected and applied with care.\n\nChemicals may react with infrastructure, the environment, and vehicles. Chlorides corrode steel and aluminum in reinforced concrete, structures and vehicles. Acetates can cause asphalt stripping, weakening the bond between asphalt binder and aggregate. Sand and grit can clog pavement joints and cracks, preventing pavement from expanding in the summer and increasing stress in the pavement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pavementinteractive.org/2013/11/11/pavement-condition-and-winter-deicing-treatments/ |title=Pavement Condition and Winter Deicing Treatments|date=November 11, 2013 |author=Pavement Interactive}}</ref>\n\nSalts can be toxic to plants and aquatic life, including the trees lining the side of the roads. Sand can alter aquatic habitats where roads are near  streams and lakes. Acetates can reduce oxygen levels in smaller water bodies, stressing aquatic animal life. Sand can be ground by tires into very fine particulate matter and become airborne, contributing to air pollution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://stormwater.allianceforthebay.org/take-action/habits-to-help/winter-deicing/ |title=Winter Deicing |accessdate=2014-01-07 |publisher=the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/archive/notesdocs/25-25(4)_fr.pdf/nchrp_chapter_8.doc |title= Environmental Stewardship Practices, Procedures,and Policies for Highway Construction and Maintenance Chapter 8: Winter Operations and Salt, Sand, and Chemical Management |publisher=Transportation Research Board |date=September 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Snow removal tools==\n\n* [[Snow shovel]]\n* [[Snow blower]]\n* [[Snowplow]]\n* [[Ice pick]]\n* [[Spade]]\n* [[Winter service vehicle]]\n* [[Snowmelter]]\n* [[Snowmelt system]] embedded in pavement, also known as [[radiant heat]].\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Grit bin]]\n* [[Ice road]]\n* [[Metromelt]]\n*[[Parking chair]]\n* [[Road slipperiness]]\n* [[Snow emergency]]\n*[[Smart highway]]\n*[[Snow chains]]\n*[[Snow filtration]]\n*[[Snowmelt system]]\n*[[Street sweeper]]\n*[[Winter service vehicle]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.sima.org/ Snow and Ice Management Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090428171243/http://nsidc.org/snow/shovel.html Have Snow Shovel, Will Travel: A History of Snow Removal]\n*[http://chemistry.about.com/cs/howthingswork/a/aa120703a.htm Comparison of snow and ice melting substances]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snow Removal}}\n[[Category:Snow removal|*]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Inclement weather management]]\n[[Category:Snow|Removal]]\n", "name_user": "Rosiechittick", "label": "safe", "comment": "added comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_removal"}

Sepoy [[Mangal Pandey]] shot and missed two Europeans, failed to kill himself, and was hanged. By April, the fire of Pandey's Uprising scorched north India and reached Meerut, the second-largest East India Company garrison. Here, Europeans and native sepoys were evenly balanced, with a little more than 2,000 on each side. The European cantonment was separated from the \u2018native lines.\u2019 Close by were Sadar Bazar and Lal Kurti Bazar, the latter named after the red uniforms worn by Company soldiers. On 24 April 1857, Meerut's commander, Colonel Carmichael Smyth, paraded 90 Indian sepoys of the Bengal Cavalry, hired mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. He ordered them to fire the new Enfield cartridges: 85 refused. The cartridges were covered with paper that had to be torn off: Muslims believed the paper was greased with pig fat and Hindus, with cow fat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/hashimpura-and-the-echoes-of-1857-meerut-is-common-to-both/|title=Hashimpura and the echoes of 1857: Meerut is common to both|work=Times Of India Blogs|accessdate=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726014434/http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/hashimpura-and-the-echoes-of-1857-meerut-is-common-to-both/|archive-date=26 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|date=5 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll 85 were stripped of their uniforms, imprisoned for ten years and shackled - this was a major humiliation. The rebels were from the 3rd cavalry: they owned their horses and were the upper-caste elite. If they could be shackled, what could others expect from the Company? On Sunday, 10 May 1857, [[Dhan Singh Gurjar|Kotwal Dhan Singh Gurjar]] opened the gates of the prison. These soldiers, along with the other imprisoned soldiers, escaped prison and declared themselves free, revolted, attacked and killed several of the British authorities to take the city under their control.

Sepoy [[Mangal Pandey]] shot and missed two Europeans, failed to kill himself, and was hanged. By April, the fire of Pandey's Uprising scorched north India and reached Meerut, the second-largest East India Company garrison. Here, Europeans and native sepoys were evenly balanced, with a little more than 2,000 on each side. The European cantonment was separated from the \u2018native lines.\u2019 Close by were Sadar Bazar and Lal Kurti Bazar, the latter named after the red uniforms worn by Company soldiers. On 24 April 1857, Meerut's commander, Colonel Carmichael Smyth, paraded 90 Indian sepoys of the Bengal Cavalry, hired mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. He ordered them to fire the new Enfield cartridges: 85 refused. The cartridges were covered with paper that had to be torn off: Muslims believed the paper was greased with pig fat and Hindus, with cow fat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/hashimpura-and-the-echoes-of-1857-meerut-is-common-to-both/|title=Hashimpura and the echoes of 1857: Meerut is common to both|work=Times Of India Blogs|accessdate=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726014434/http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/hashimpura-and-the-echoes-of-1857-meerut-is-common-to-both/|archive-date=26 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|date=5 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll 85 were stripped of their uniforms, imprisoned for ten years and shackled - this was a major humiliation.

{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2-3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short.

It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2-3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game.

L\u00fctjens is best known for his actions during [[World War II]] and his command of the [[battleship]] {{Ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} during its foray into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1941. In its aftermath, the episode entered into naval legend.\n\nBorn in 1889, he entered into the German Imperial Navy ({{Lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}}) in 1907. A diligent and intelligent [[cadet]] he progressed to [[Officer (armed forces)|officer rank]] before the outbreak of war, when he was assigned to a [[Torpedo boat]] Squadron. During [[World War I]] L\u00fctjens operated in the [[North Sea]] and [[English Channel]] and fought several actions with the British [[Royal Navy]]. He ended the conflict as a ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain lieutenant) with the [[Iron Cross]] 1st and 2nd class (1914) to his credit. After the war he remained in the service of the navy, now renamed the ''[[Reichsmarine]]''. He continued to serve in torpedo boat squadrons eventually becoming a [[Commanding Officer]] in 1925. In the [[Weimar Republic]] era, L\u00fctjens built a reputation as an excellent staff officer.\n\nIn 1935, after the [[Nazi Party]] came to power under [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933, the navy was remodelled again and renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. L\u00fctjens soon became acquainted with [[Erich Raeder]] and [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]; the two Commanders-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in World War II. His capability and friendship led to his promotion to ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) and a sea command at the helm of the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}. In the six years of peace he had risen to the rank of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral), a promotion conferred upon him October 1937.\n\nIn September 1939, World War II began with the [[German invasion of Poland]]. L\u00fctjens received the [[Clasp to the Iron Cross]] 2nd Class (1939) three days later. His command of [[destroyer]] operations in the North Sea over the winter, 1939\u201340, earned him the Clasp to the Iron Cross 1st Class. On 1 January 1940, he was promoted to  ''Vizeadmiral'' (Vice Admiral). In April 1940 he was given temporary command of the entire German surface fleet during the initial landing phase of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasions of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. His actions earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the campaign he was appointed the [[Fleet commander (Kriegsmarine)|fleet commander]] of the German Navy and promoted to Admiral on 1 September 1940. He was involved in the tentative planning for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the planned invasion of the [[United Kingdom]], but the plans were shelved after the [[Battle of Britain]]. German intentions turned to blockade and L\u00fctjens made the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} the centerpiece of his battle fleet; using the latter vessel as his [[flagship]]. In January 1941 he planned and executed [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']], an Atlantic raid to support [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] by attacking British merchant shipping lanes. The operation was a [[Tactical victory|tactical]] and [[propaganda]] victory. It came to a close in March 1941 when the ships docked in [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German-occupied France]] after sailing some 18,000 miles; a record for a German battle group at the time. His success led him to being chosen for further operations.\n\nIn May 1941, L\u00fctjens commanded a German task force, consisting of the battleship ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, during [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. In a repetition of ''Berlin'', L\u00fctjens was required to break out of their naval base in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]], sail via [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]], and attack merchant shipping. The operation went awry and the task force was soon spotted and engaged near [[Iceland]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} was sunk and three other British warships were forced to retreat. The two German ships then separated. Three days later, on 27 May, L\u00fctjens and most of the ship's crew lost their lives when ''Bismarck'' [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|was caught]] and sunk.\n\nIn 1955 the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was remilitarised and entered [[NATO]]. The ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was established the following year. In 1967 this organisation recognised L\u00fctjens and his service by naming the destroyer {{ship|German destroyer|L\u00fctjens|D185|2}} after him.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life==\nJohann G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens was born in [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Hesse-Nassau]], a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], on 25 May 1889.

At that point, D\u00f6nitz had been entrusted with the rebuilding of the U-Boat arm but had spent the summer at sea commanding {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}. After arriving at port, he met with Raeder.

L\u00fctjens attacked from a range of 14,000 yards south-east of the harbour. The Poles replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive manoeuvres and to lay a [[smoke screen]] to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit in the superstructure by a {{convert|152|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} shell from the [[Coastal artillery|coast defence]] [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] at [[Hel, Poland|Hel]] that killed four crewmen and wounded another four men. L\u00fctjens ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective.

On board his flagship [[German destroyer Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp|Z21 ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'']], he led six destroyers laden with naval mines. His own ship did not carry any mines and acted as cover. They reached the [[Humber Estuary]] undetected and departed unseen. Within days shipping losses began occurring among British transports in the area. L\u00fctjens did not repeat the operation.

His superior, ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Wilhelm Marschall]], had fallen ill just before the operation, so he assumed command of the [[Narvik]] and [[Trondheim]] landings.<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was to lead ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', with his flag in the latter, on escort operation for a force of 10 destroyers commanded by ''F\u00fchrer der Zerst\u00f6rer'' (Leader of Destroyers) [[Friedrich Bonte]]. The fleet was laden with soldiers belonging to the [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|''3. Gebirgs-Division'']] under the command of [[Eduard Dietl]]. The division was to seize Narvik.  L\u00fctjens briefed his officers aboard ''Gneisenau'' on 6 April in the presence of Raeder. L\u00fctjens had his doubts about the wisdom of the entire operation but he showed no sign of his feelings to his subordinates. L\u00fctjens hoped for bad weather to shield the fleet from Allied aircraft. The skies were clear and the ships were twice attacked by [[RAF Coastal Command]] bombers without result. The British airmen reported their position and surprise was now gone. Nevertheless, L\u00fctjens remained on schedule and delivered the force to Narvik. On two occasions a sailor was swept overboard but L\u00fctjens' operations officer, Heinrich Gerlach, noted: \"No rescue attempts were made. On no account was there to be any interruption of the time schedule.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' mission then was to draw British units away from Narvik and facilitate the landings there and prevent the [[Royal Navy]] from attacking the destroyers and landing craft. During the landing phase, his forces were approached by a Royal Navy task-force led by the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}. The British ship engaged at 05:05 and L\u00fctjens was forced to fight [[Action off Lofoten|an inconclusive battle]] with ''Renown''. L\u00fctjens succeeded in extracting the German vessels without incurring major battle damage. He viewed his operation as a success.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\">Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>O'Hara 2004. pp. 20\u201327.</ref> L\u00fctjens nearly changed his mind during the battle, believing a pitched fight may bring relief to the German destroyer force at Narvik\u2014a force which he had effectively been forced to abandon in the face of enemy sea superiority. But the prospect of running into {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}}, now known by German naval intelligence to be in the vicinity, was too much of a risk. In the resultant [[Battles of Narvik]] 10 German destroyers were sunk and the campaign for the port lasted until June. Bonte was killed when his command ship,  ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'' exploded.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIt may have been possible for him to turn on and sink ''Renown'' by attacking from different directions, using ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', but the accompanying British destroyers were well placed to join the fight had he done so. His Commander-in-Chief, Raeder, endorsed his actions which would have placed him against a clear eastern horizon as opposed to an enemy that was positioned against a darkened western horizon. Action at that time would have given the enemy a clearer silhouette to aim at while obscuring the British ships somewhat. Moreover, if either German ship had been immobilised by ''Renown'' they would have been vulnerable to a torpedo attack by the British destroyers. Under those circumstances, Raeder felt the British would have had a tactical advantage. L\u00fctjens later rendezvoused with the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} and reached [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 12 April, having avoided a major fleet action.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\"/>\n\nL\u00fctjens was indirectly involved in another battle. The Trondheim force was led by the heavy cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' who detached the German destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z11 Bernd von Arnim||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z18 Hans L\u00fcdemann||2}} to search for a man that had been washed over board. In the heavy fog they ran into {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}. ''Glowworm'' outmatched the lighter German vessels and they disengaged and called for help. L\u00fctjens ordered ''Hipper'' to assist. The heavy cruiser sank the ''Glowworm'', but not before the British ship had rammed her larger assailant and caused her considerable damage.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> When L\u00fctjens stepped ashore at Wilhelmshaven, his decision to abandon Bonte's destroyer group at Narvik weighed heavily on his mind.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\">Garrett 1978, p. 44.</ref> In the wake of L\u00fctjens return, he learned Marschall had recovered to assume command.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\"/>\n\n===Commander of the fleet===\nIn June and July 1940, he became Commander of Battleships and the third ''Flottenchef'' (Fleet Commander) of the ''Kriegsmarine'', a position comparable to the British Commander-in-Chief of the [[Home Fleet]]. His predecessor\u2014''Vizeadmiral'' Wilhelm Marschall\u2014had had repeated differences with Raeder over the extent the ''Flottenchef'' should be bound by orders while operating at sea. Marschall led ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' to intercept Allied naval forces withdrawing from [[Norway]] against orders. On 8 June 1940 he engaged and sank the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glorious||2}} and her escorting [[destroyer]]s {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}. During the battle ''Scharnhorst'' was heavily damaged by a torpedo. Marschall was dismissed by Raeder because the Commander-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' deemed the episode unacceptable.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\">Garrett 1978, p. 53.</ref> Raeder viewed the sinkings as \"target practice\" and the damage to ''Scharnhorst'', and consequently ''Gneisenau'', offset this victory in his view.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\nTen days later L\u00fctjens was given command of the fleet on a temporary basis. Raeder regarded L\u00fctjens as a sound tactician, excellent staff officer and a leader with all-important operational and battle experience. After the war Raeder was candid about his decision to elevate L\u00fctjens through the chain of command. Raeder said of his progression, \"He had also experience in staff work, and as my Chief of Personnel he had won by special confidence in years of close association.\"<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 353.</ref> Raeder expressed his confidence that L\u00fctjens displayed wise judgment and was unlikely to act rashly. When at sea, he allowed him to take command of the situation and make operational decisions at his own discretion.<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 357.</ref> Although described as reserved and unapproachable toward subordinates, he was held to be \"of manifest integrity and reliability.\"<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 130.</ref> Hitler expressed his gratitude to L\u00fctjens for \"preparing and leading the Navy into action\", and awarded him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 14 June 1940.<ref>Groves 2012, p. 53.</ref>\n\n''Scharnhorst'' had been forced to make for Trondheim in the aftermath of the action for emergency repairs. Flying his flag in ''Gneisenau'', L\u00fctjens took command of his first voyage as ''Flottenchef'' aboard a capital ship. On 20 June 1940 he sailed in company with ''Admiral Hipper'', toward the North Sea in the hope of diverting attention from ''Scharnhorst'' while it made the perilous trek from Norway to Germany. The operation succeeded, but ''Gneisenau'' was torpedoed by the submarine {{HMS|Clyde|N12|6}} and severely damaged.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\n[[File:OperationSealion.svg|thumb|left|Battle plan for Operation Sea Lion.]]\nIn July 1940 Hitler ordered the preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the invasion of the United Kingdom after the victory [[Battle of France|in France]]. While the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' engaged the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in what became known as the [[Battle of Britain]] to clear the skies the German naval command began planning for an assault in southern England. L\u00fctjens, as fleet commander, was responsible for carrying out sea operations based upon the strategies devised by his superior Saalw\u00e4chter, who commanded Naval Group West. Saalw\u00e4chter answered to the commander-in-chief, Raeder.\n\nL\u00fctjens was to be heavily involved in the planning of the sea landings. The navy wished to land on a narrow front because of its limited resources and L\u00fctjens planned accordingly. He established himself in the fashionable market-town of [[Trouville, Seine-Maritime|Trouville]] near [[Le Havre]]. The enormous logistical effort that required the navy to move personnel command structures and personnel to France meant that his command post did not become fully operational until August 1940. [[Friedrich Ruge]] was appointed to the mine command by L\u00fctjens with the task of clearing British naval minefields and laying German mine zones to impede the operations of the Royal Navy. Meanwhile, L\u00fctjens scoured the continent for the 1,800 river barges, 500 tugs, 150 steamships and 1,200 motor boats deemed necessary for the operation. Some 24,000 men were seconded from other services and trained as landing craft crewman.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was handicapped by the lack of firepower in the German navy. He authorised Ruge to organise the landings. The Advanced Detachments (''Vorausabteilungen'') were to storm the beach in [[battalion]]-strength. The following craft would clear mines allowing for artillery coasters and tugs carrying the [[Panzer]] units to follow unhindered. The smaller motor boats would unload engineers to clear obstacles and act as shuttle boats between the larger vessels and the beach. They would rush to and fro delivering army units to land in order to expand the beachhead and allow the flotilla to land its full complement. L\u00fctjens recommended using the old battleships ''Schlesien'' and {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}} as fire support to protect the crossing. L\u00fctjens favoured beaching the ships on the [[Varne Bank]] to act as a gun-fire platform. He thought they could best act as strong points to deny passage through the [[Strait of Dover]] to the British. Raeder agreed but the plan was rubbished by technical experts who argued the old ships were too prone to capsizing and their stationary posture was too vulnerable and their armament too weak to do the job effectively.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens continued planning preparations as the Battle of Britain raged. By September he had completed plans to land the entire [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 16th Army]] under [[Ernst Busch (field marshal)|Ernst Busch]] between [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and [[Hastings]]\u2014the site of the [[Battle of Hastings|last successful invasion of England in 1066]]\u2014and the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] between Hastings and [[Worthing]] to the west. L\u00fctjens' opinion on the chances of success are not known. The battles in Norway had left him without any major capital ship. In the event, L\u00fctjens was never tested. The air battle over Britain was lost and by the end of 1940 plans for an invasion were postponed as Hitler turned eastward for a campaign against the [[Soviet Union]]. German naval strategy now turned to thoughts of [[siege]] and destroying Britain's shipping lanes which supplied the country from the overseas and in particularly [[North America]].<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 241\u2013243, 299\u2013302.</ref>\n\n===Operation Berlin===\n''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were readied for action again by the winter. Their task now was to engage Allied [[merchant vessel]]s bringing war materials to Britain. As fleet commander, it would be L\u00fctjens' first operation in the Battle of the Atlantic. It was named [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']]. On 28 December 1940, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on which Admiral L\u00fctjens had raised his flag\u2014left Germany for an Atlantic raid. However, due to weather, L\u00fctjens ordered a return to port: ''Gneisenau'' to Kiel and ''Scharnhorst'' to Gdynia. While repairs were carried out Navy Group West emphasised to him that his primary targets were enemy merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens reiterated his standing orders to his captains: \"our job is to put as many as possible under the water\".<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 1941, the renewed mission was delayed for several days owing to the sighting of British ships near the Norwegian coast and the inability of submarine chasers and destroyers to escort them to the [[Arctic Ocean]].<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, pp. 56\u201358.</ref> L\u00fctjens chose to pass between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Unbeknownst to L\u00fctjens, his ships had been spotted sailing past [[Zealand]], Denmark, by British agents. British Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, Admiral [[John Tovey]] was alerted and dispatched three battleships, eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers to hunt for the German ships accordingly, hoping to intercept the Germans off southern Iceland. The cruiser {{HMS|Naiad|93|2}} briefly sighted the German ships on 28 January as L\u00fctjens prepared to break through the Iceland-Faroe gap, and reported their position. The German admiral quickly decided to retire northbound with the intention of passing through the [[Denmark Strait]]. On 30 January L\u00fctjens decided to refuel from the tanker ''Thorn'' off [[Jan Mayen]] island before attempting this breakout route. After refueling, L\u00fctjens sailed, and on 4 February, slipped into the Atlantic. Fortunately for L\u00fctjens, Tovey dismissed the sighting by ''Naiad'' as an [[Mirage|illusion]], and returned to port.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\n====Free in the Atlantic====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1123-500, Kurt-C\u00e4sar Hoffmann.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain Hoffmann. A former pupil and companion to L\u00fctjens on ''Berlin''.]]\nL\u00fctjens now had the operational initiative. He had a choice of two potential killing-grounds. To the north lay the HX and SC convoys which sailed between Britain and [[Canada]]. To the south the SL and OG convoys which operated between Britain, [[Gibraltar]] and [[Freetown]]. He decided to opt for operations in the north. He used ''Admiral Hipper'', at that moment also loose in the Atlantic, to create a diversion by ordering her to the south. In retrospect it was an error of judgment. L\u00fctjens' orders were to avoid combat on equal terms. He had not realised\u2014and was not to know\u2014that southern convoys were virtually undefended at this point in the war, but on orders of the British [[Admiralty]], all northern convoys had an escort of at least one [[Capital Ship]].<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 56.</ref> German intelligence had warned him that {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}} and {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}} were based at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He estimated that they could escort convoys only 1,000 miles east of their base, and so began he search for targets with this in mind.<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 8 February, [[B-Dienst]] alerted the German warships of [[convoy HX 106]] which sailed from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] on 31 January. L\u00fctjens planned a pincer movement converging from the north and south. The convoy was escorted by ''Ramillies'' armed with eight [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch]] guns. When the battleship was sighted L\u00fctjens strictly followed the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]]''{{'}}s directive not to engage enemy capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 57.</ref>\n\n[[Kurt-Caesar Hoffmann]], captain of ''Scharnhorst'', attempted to draw off the British battleship, so that ''Gneisenau'' could sink the merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens, however, did not understand Hoffmann's intentions which the ''Scharnhorst'' captain was not able to communicate in detail in such short-order. A heated radio conversation followed in which L\u00fctjens accused him of disobeying orders because he did not turn away immediately. The enemy ship did not leave the convoy and now L\u00fctjens complained the British would be alerted to their position and as a consequence, successful attacks would now be more difficult to execute. In fact, L\u00fctjens' fears were unfounded and luck was once again on his side. The British had sighted only one German ship. Since ''Hipper'' was known to be at sea, it was assumed she was the German vessel lurking around the convoy. Tovey's dismissal of the ''Naiad'' report masked the German ships' presence. Tovey still believed they were still in German ports.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 58.</ref> The disagreement did not adversely damage the two men's good relations.{{efn| Richard Garrett, a naval researcher, interviewed Hoffmann in 1976. Hoffmann stated he respected L\u00fctjens, who had been his gunnery instructor as a sea cadet in 1912.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 57\u201358.</ref>}}\n\nThe ships rendezvoused between Iceland and Canada with the tankers ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' on 15 February. On 22 February, after seven days of fruitless searching some 500 nautical miles east of [[Newfoundland]], German radar picked up five cargo-empty ships from a westbound convoy sailing without escort towards [[United States|American]] ports. The convoy identified the German ships and soon the radio waves were busy with signals sent from the frantic British merchantmen, which tried to disperse. The battleships quickly closed and sank four. A further ship, the 5,500-ton ''Harlesden'', carried a powerful [[wireless]] set but temporarily evaded them. Intent on silencing it, L\u00fctjens dispatched his [[Arado Ar 196]] to locate it. Upon his return, the Arado pilot reported to have found it and claimed to have destroyed the aerial, but took damage from return fire. Its position now known, the German ships closed in and sank ''Harlesden'' at 23:00. The day's haul amounted to around 25,000&nbsp;tons. On a negative note, the chase and action occurred at long range and the expenditure of ammunition was expensive. L\u00fctjens used his radio for the first time since 8 February and commanded the supply ships ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' to meet him near the Azores so he could replenish stocks.<ref>Garratt 1978, p. 60.</ref> On 26 February he unloaded 180 [[prisoners of war]] onto the tankers ''Ermland'' and ''Friedrich Breme''. In the action of 22 February, only 11 Allied sailors had become casualties.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 61.</ref>\n\nDisappointed with the lack of targets in the north, L\u00fctjens' ships then sailed to the coast of [[West Africa]]. On 3 March 1941 they reached the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. On 5 March he attempted to dispatch his aircraft to find enemy shipping but found it four hours later, the machine having run out of fuel. L\u00fctjens' persistence paid off. At 23:00 on 5 March, he received a wireless message from Germany informing him {{GS|U-124|1940|2}} had spotted two large ships close to their position. The Arado had flown over the submarine, which had been alerted to the possibility German commerce raiders might be in the area. On 7 March, the convoy SL-67, escorted by {{HMS|Malaya}}, was sighted. Once again, L\u00fctjens obeyed his orders and not his instinct. He withdrew, but shadowed the convoy, directing ''U-124'' and {{GS|U-105|1940|2}} onto the enemy. The former sank five and the latter one ship. L\u00fctjens ran into the convoy again as darkness fell, but the Germans turned away to meet with their supply ships, narrowly avoiding a battle with ''Malaya''. On the way the [[Greece|Greek]] ship ''Marathon'' (7,926 tons) was sunk. It was carrying [[coal]] to [[Alexandria]].<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 62\u201365.</ref>\n\n====Escape to France====\nOn 11 March he received a message from Group West. {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and ''Hipper'' were to operate in the north, and German intelligence were alerted to the possibility of a British force consisting of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] were on a westerly course from [[Gibraltar]]. L\u00fctjens was required to create a diversion to allow ''Scheer'' safe passage through the Denmark Strait. He decided that the best way to attract British attention was to head for [[Brest, France]], via the HX convoy route. L\u00fctjens decided to employ his entire force, supply ships too, in a search for victims. Stationed 30 miles abreast, they sailed between 39\u00b0N and 46\u00b0W. L\u00fctjens intercepted the Norwegian tanker ''Bianca'' (5,688 tons), the ''Polykarb'' (6,500 tons) and British ''San Casimiro'' (8,000 tons). He managed to capture the ships and his prize crews were ordered to [[Bordeaux]]. Only ''Polykarb'' made it. The others were scuttled by their German crews when approached by HMS ''Renown''. Three more were sunk by the German battleships.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n\nSupply ships ''Uckermark'' and ''Ermland'' signalled they had sighted another convoy. They acted as shepherds as they rushed at the startled merchantmen and drove them toward the German battleships. On 15 March L\u00fctjens began his attack. ''Empire of Industry'' (formerly German), ''Mangkai'' (formerly the German ''Scheer''), ''Silverfix'', ''Demerton'', ''Grandi'', ''Royal Crown'', ''Sardinian Prince'' and the French ''Myson'' were sunk. Among the company was ''Chilean Reefer''. Only 1,800 tons, the ship made smoke and returned ''Gniesenau''{{'}}s fire. Believing it possibly disguised as an enemy cruiser, or a scout, the Germans withdrew to a safe distance and sank it with the main batteries. It was a small target which took 73 rounds to destroy. HMS ''Rodney'' appeared 15 minutes later and flashed a challenge. In L\u00fctjens' mind, it confirmed his suspicions of the vessel as a scout. L\u00fctjens identified ''Gneisenau'' as \"HMS Emerald\", buying time as he worked up to escape. It worked, and ''Rodney'' stayed to pick up the survivors from the ''Chilean Reefer''.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> After transferring 200 prisoners, he set course for Brest, France. Sighted by an aircraft from {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} on 20 March, Admiral L\u00fctjens managed to evade British warships, and reached Brest at 07:00 on 22 March. The journey of {{convert|17800|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} in 59 days was a record for German capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 71.</ref>\n\nRaeder was pleased with L\u00fctjens. He described his operation in the Atlantic as \"beyond reproach. He invariably judged the situation accurately and he met with deserved success.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 68.</ref> Raeder's glowing endorsement was likely caused by L\u00fctjens' rigid adherence to his commander-in-chief's instructions. The ''Seekriegsleitung'' was more critical. It acknowledged the restrictions placed upon L\u00fctjens but thought L\u00fctjens could have asked for greater freedom of action after the encounter with ''Ramillies''. The staff officers believed Hoffman's tactical assessment of the situation had been correct.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\n===Operation Rhein\u00fcbung===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-01-4-25, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|right|''Bismarck''{{'}}s aft upper deck, behind turret \"Caesar\". This is where the living and working quarters of the admiral's staff were located.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 378.</ref>]]\n\nPlans were then made for L\u00fctjens to command [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']], taking all four modern German battleships and battlecruisers\u2014''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on a raid into the Atlantic. For various reasons, ''Tirpitz'' and the two battlecruisers could not be made ready for the operation, so it proceeded with only ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, under the command of [[Helmuth Brinkmann]]. The preparation and operational directives had been prepared by ''Marinegruppenkommando West'', under the command of ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' Saalw\u00e4chter and ''Marinegruppenkommando Ost'', under the command of ''Generaladmiral'' [[Rolf Carls]]. On 8 April 1941, L\u00fctjens met with Admiral D\u00f6nitz in [[Paris]]. D\u00f6nitz made the following assessment of the plan:\n<blockquote>I met Admiral L\u00fctjens, the Admiral commanding the fleet, in Paris. I knew L\u00fctjens well and held him in high esteem. During the same years we had been in command of the cruisers ''Karlsruhe'' and ''Emden'' respectively. At the end of our overseas tours of duty we had returned to Germany in company. In the years immediately before the war, while I was senior Officer, submarines, L\u00fctjens had been officer commanding Torpedo Boats. We were often together, both socially and on duty, we held the same views on naval matters and saw eye to eye in most things. At our conference in Paris we defined the support to be given to the ''Bismarck'' by [[U-Boat]]s in the following terms:<br/>\n1. The U-Boats would carry on as usual in their normal positions<br/>\n2. If while the surface ships were at sea any opportunity arose for joint action with U-Boats, every effort should be made to exploit it to the full. For this purpose an experienced U-Boat Officer would be appointed for duty to the ''Bismarck''.<br/>\n3. On the radio frequency used by the U-Boats, the Admiral commanding the fleet would be kept constantly informed of the dispositions of the boats and the intentions of the U-Boat Command.<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1958 (1997), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref></blockquote>\n\n====L\u00fctjens' view====\nRaeder was anxious to begin the operation during the [[new moon]] on 26 April. His wishes were frustrated by a series of mishaps. ''Prinz Eugen'' was repeatedly delayed from becoming fully operational. [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombing, a practice torpedo, and a mine detonation delayed her from mid-April until mid-May.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> Raeder used this time to consult with his fleet commander. L\u00fctjens travelled to [[Berlin]] on 26 April 1941 to meet with him. For a time, L\u00fctjens tried without success to change Raeder's mind, and to wait until ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were ready. He argued that the German fleet should not be fed \"[[teaspoon]] by teaspoon\" into battle with the enemy.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was, however, encouraged by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin as soon as possible to prevent the enemy's gaining any respite.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf & Wegner 2001, pp. 131\u2013132.</ref> He accepted that the current situation meant that German capital ships must be present in the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Although Raeder insisted on the operation, he advised L\u00fctjens to act thoughtfully and carefully without taking too high a risk.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 385\u2013386.</ref> Raeder did, however, admonish his subordinate to one end: if he were brought to battle despite his best efforts, it should be conducted with full force, to the end. He gave L\u00fctjens full [[Mission-type tactics|freedom of action]], since only he was in a position to judge the immediate situation while at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Raeder later wrote, \"It does L\u00fctjens great credit that he did not hesitate to express this view to me so frankly. I then sought to convince him of the cogency of my arguments....Although L\u00fctjens was perhaps not entirely convinced by my views, our discussion ended in complete understanding.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 78.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens sought advice from several colleagues and friends. First, he spoke with [[Kurt Fricke]], Raeder's chief of operations. When Fricke inquired as to what he would do if approached by overwhelming force: L\u00fctjens replied he would run for home. As far as the Naval Command was concerned, this was his policy. He sought out his friend, Patzig, who had commanded {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}, and a man he had known since 1907. Patzig argued he should remain in port. He remarked that it was folly to risk the chief of the fleet in a limited operation with a single capital ship. L\u00fctjens agreed, but feared being labelled a coward if he turned down the command.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50.</ref> His parting words to Patzig were fatalistic:\n<blockquote>Given the uneven relation of forces I am of the opinion that I should have to sacrifice myself sooner or later. I have closed out my private life and am determined to carry out the assignment given to me honourably, one way or another.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing this meeting, L\u00fctjens confided to ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Hans-Erich Voss]], then working at Raeder's headquarters, that \"survival was improbable\", and bade him farewell.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" />{{efn|full quote: \"I want to say goodbye, I will not come back. Given the superiority of the British survival is unlikely\"\u2014''Ich m\u00f6chte mich verabschieden, ich werde nicht wiederkommen. Bei der \u00dcberlegenheit der Briten ist ein \u00dcberleben unwahrscheinlich.''<ref name=\"\u00dcebersch\u00e4r p407\"/>}}\n\nLastly he met with his former commanding officer in Norway, Marschall. He advised L\u00fctjens not to follow Raeder's orders too closely since the situation in the Atlantic could change at any moment. L\u00fctjens would not hear of it. He refused to diverge from his standing orders.

L\u00fctjens had informed Lindemann and Brinkmann on 18 May that he intended to sail for the arctic and refuel at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62.</ref> Three days later, in Norwegian waters, L\u00fctjens ordered a fuel stop in a [[Grimstadfjord]] near [[Bergen]]. He did not inform either Lindemann or Brinkmann about the decision to drop anchor and refuel. As was his custom, he offered no explanation for changing his mind.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 70.</ref>\n\nWhile ''Prinz Eugen'' was refuelled, L\u00fctjens declined to top up the ''Bismarck''. A rupture in one of the fuel lines had allowed only an initial influx of 6,000 tons. A further 2,000 tons was to be accepted at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/> The ship had left the Baltic 200 tons short, and had since burned 1,000 tons reaching Norway. L\u00fctjens knew that the German tanker ''Weissenberg'' was waiting for him in the Arctic, only an additional day's sailing away, but farther from prying British eyes.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> It was perhaps his intention to replenish there. In the event he did not refuel during the operation.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/>\n\nThe following day, on 22 May, he received a report that four British battleships, perhaps an [[aircraft carrier]], and a strong escort of destroyers were still anchored at [[Scapa Flow]]. Although mistaken, it appears to have influenced L\u00fctjens' decision not to loiter and wait for events to unfold, but to proceed with a breakout immediately which would not permit time for refueling prior to reaching the Atlantic.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 133.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> This faulty intelligence report likely dispelled any doubts L\u00fctjens had about his chosen route.<ref>Ballard 1990, p.. 69.</ref> The move would bring about the first of several disagreements with Captain Lindemann. Lindemann preferred the route south of Iceland, but once again L\u00fctjens and his terse style had prevailed.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 66.</ref>\n\nHe also declined ''Generaladmiral'' Carls' desire for a breakout through the more southerly Faroe Islands-Iceland gap. As usual, he gave no explanation for any change in operational direction. While the ice-flooded regions of northern Iceland and the [[Denmark Strait]] could be easily patrolled by the enemy, as believed by Carls, it offered lower-visibility conditions, giving him much needed cover. Nevertheless, he continued to frustrate his junior officers. Meteorologist Heinz Externbrink suggested increasing speed to keep up with the fast-moving cloud affording him cover. L\u00fctjens declined without comment, and Externbrink vented his anger to [[:de:Burkard Freiherr von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|Burkard von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg]], the most senior officer to survive the operation. Despite his intentions, the British were alerted to the task force's operation by the [[Sweden|Swedes]], [[Norwegian Resistance]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]].<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 132.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201375.</ref>\n\nLindemann remained on edge. As captain, he was privy to the B-Dienst naval intelligence now reaching him on enemy movements. A large contingent of enemy capital ships was congregating at Scapa Flow. His senior medical officer, Dr. Otto Schneider, observed that Lindemann fully understood the dangers his ship faced. But Admiral L\u00fctjens alone could call off the operation. He showed no desire to discuss his intentions with either Captain Lindemann or Brinkmann, which put both of them on edge. L\u00fctjens offered no hint of intentions either to his destroyer escort, which he dismissed near [[Trondheim]], or to ''Generaladmiral'' Carls. Carls openly displayed his displeasure at the lack of communication, believing L\u00fctjens to be hesitant. Not until the evening of 22 May did he share his intention to breach the Denmark Strait with his captains; perhaps encouraged in the knowledge that the British [[Force H]] would now be engaged in the beginning [[Battle of Crete]]. The foul weather gave him the cover he needed. Foregoing the chance of a refuel, he headed due west, north of Iceland.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201378</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens remained unaware that the British were tracking him until 23 May, when his ships encountered heavy cruisers {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} and {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}, amidst the [[Greenland]] ice pack. L\u00fctjens received the identity of the first ship as the latter vessel. He gave the code JOTDORA: permission to fire. Although shots were fired, no serious damage resulted to either side, and the outgunned British cruisers quickly withdrew, though they remained within radar range and continued to shadow the German ships. The shock from the firing of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s heavy guns disabled her search radar, so L\u00fctjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to take the lead. As they passed each other ''Bismarck''{{'}}s electric push-button wheel jammed and it veered toward the German cruiser. The quick thinking of Brinkmann avoided a collision. During a raining squall L\u00fctjens attempted a 180-degree turn to surprise his attackers, but the British radar detected the manoeuvre and withdrew. L\u00fctjens could not shake his pursuers. He believed they possessed a new type of radar as yet unknown to the Germans.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 71\u201372.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 125\u2013133.</ref>\n\n====Tactical command in battle====\n[[File:Absetzman\u00f6ver Bismarck.png|thumb|right|300px|''Bismarck''{{'}}s {{frac|3|4}} clockwise turn on 25 May. L\u00fctjens' tactic was highly successful, shaking free of his pursuers.]]\nIn the early hours of 24 May 1941, ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s hydrophones detected two large ships approaching. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]] in his flagship battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} were heading towards them. It began the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. L\u00fctjens was soon informed that the two ships were enemy heavy units by the size of their superstructure, but remained unaware of their identity until they adjusted their attitude. Confronted with enemy combat vessels, L\u00fctjens turned away, to gain time to think and plan a response to his opponents who were clearly attempting to engage him.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 144.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' first instinct was to attempt to outrun the British ships, scrupulously obeying his orders. He became even more reluctant to accept battle once the lead enemy vessel was identified as ''Hood''. Even after ''Hood'' began to fire on the two ships and it became obvious that an engagement was inevitable, L\u00fctjens was reluctant to return fire. He ordered his chief [[yeoman]] to signal to ''Prinz Eugen'' to open fire on the lead enemy ship, but not ''Bismarck'', much to the exasperation of Captain Lindemann, who had the prospect of suffering another disagreement with the Admiral.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.</ref>\n\nFirst Gunnery Officer [[Adalbert Schneider]], made multiple inquiries to return fire; methodically reporting enemy salvos and asking permission to fire. L\u00fctjens, himself an artillery specialist, waited until the range fell. Moreover, the position of the British placed them at the outer limit of traverse for his main batteries, which were now inclined astern of the ship. L\u00fctjens was also wary of using up heavy shells which were required for raiding operations and a possible future engagement. He could not afford to use up ammunition to register his guns, instead, preferring a closer-range battle. He waited for the optimum moment to fire back.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nSome witnesses testify Captain Lindeman muttered, \"I will not allow my ship to be shot out from under my arse. Open fire!\".<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 78.</ref> Finally L\u00fctjens gave the order to return fire. L\u00fctjens then ordered a turn to port, and [[Crossing the T|crossed Holland's T]], as his opponent turned to bring all the British guns to bear. Shortly before firing, ''Bismarck'' was hit in the forecastle, though ''Prinz Eugen'' had registered hits on ''Hood'' which had started a large series of fires making it easier for the Germans to home in on her position. ''Bismarck'' then targeted ''Hood''.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nL\u00fctjens did not observe the German tactical regulations of the time, to place his weaker cruiser to his battleship's unengaged side and out of range. Instead, he kept her in the line to maximise his firepower even though both German ships were now firing salvos across each other's line-of-fire.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.</ref> Once the odds were reduced, he then ordered her to drop back and use her radar to keep a vigil on the British cruisers, still chasing the German force.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /> Schneider observed the fifth salvo strike ''Hood'' from a range of 17,500 [[yard]]s.<ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\">Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Two splashes were seen. Apparently one or more shells \"bit into\" ''Hood'', seemingly without effect, leading the gunnery officers to believe it was a dud. Moments later ''Hood'' blew up, which caused much excitement on the German ships. L\u00fctjens remained unmoved. The Germans then turned their fire to ''Prince of Wales'', causing seven damaging hits and Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] to retreat to a safe distance.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /><ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\" /><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 85.</ref>\n\nLindemann, guided by the tactical situation, wanted to destroy the damaged ship. He estimated a two- to three-hour chase would be enough.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref> L\u00fctjens, mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary fighting with enemy capital ships, rejected his protests without discussion. L\u00fctjens was suspicious of the intelligence he was receiving, which days earlier had told him ''Hood'' was standing off the coast of [[West Africa]].<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2001, p. 172.</ref> He could no longer be sure of how many more enemy capital ships could be in the area. A time-consuming battle with ''Prince of Wales'' was out of the question, and he proceeded into the vast expanses of the Atlantic, where he could lose his pursuers and have the necessary room to manoeuvre.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\" /><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 145, 150, 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' tactics proved useful in two respects. After the ''Hood'' battle, he steamed directly at his pursuers, forcing them away, while his heavy cruiser escaped out of radar range. On 25 May, his 52nd birthday, despite constant action and exhaustion, he ordered a clever manoeuvre. He ordered full speed and then a three-quarter clockwise turn once his pursuers had reached the extremis of their radar range. The British cruisers had been performing zigzags to avoid German U-boats they believed to be in the vicinity. At the outer edge of their port turn, they would be at the limit of their radar's range. This allowed him to escape the enemy radar, steam in the opposite direction, and then once behind them steam across their wake and avoid enemy attempts to regain contact.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 236\u2013239.</ref>\n\nThe move worked and he evaded the British for a short time. L\u00fctjens then broke radio silence, allowing the British a rough idea of his [[latitude]] but not his [[longitude]]. He continued to believe he was being tracked. Naval Group West informed him to send only tactical radio signals and not risk broadcasting long radio messages to [[Paris]] since they were sure he had broken contact. L\u00fctjens, already distrustful of B-Dienst, disregarded the warnings. Fortunately, not until late evening on 25 May, did the British realise he was heading for [[France]]. By this time L\u00fctjens was well ahead of his pursuers. It proved, however, to be a grave error. Although the British made a number of mistakes in locating her, the intercepted message allowed them to send to air strikes against the ship over the next two days.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 236.</ref><ref>Jackson 2002, p. 90.</ref>\n\n====Leadership in crisis====\nL\u00fctjens radioed [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Berlin]] and all the naval commands concerning the sinking of ''Hood'' continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard ''Prinz Eugen'' Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that L\u00fctjens' insistence on radioing every change of course to the shore commands; then confirmed by a final \"Execute!\" order, was unnecessary and risky. In the morning of the 25 May, his 52nd birthday, L\u00fctjens persisted by sending a long message on the ''Hood'' action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message could do no harm since his position was known to the enemy.<ref>Winklareth 1998. p. 130.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 167.</ref>\n\nThe enemy, Brinkmann thought, could and would glean important intelligence from the most seemingly innocuous messages and consequently his fleet commander was foolish to issue them. At 08:01, once again without consulting Lindemann or Brinkmann, he radioed the Naval High Command his intent to sail to [[St. Nazaire]] and detach his heavy cruiser for commerce operations. No mention of the extent of the damage incurred by ''Bismarck'' was relayed to Germany. The ship was down by the bow, having been hit. The shell had severed the fuel lines to forward fuel tanks by allowing sea water to pour in through the hole located just above the waterline. In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue L\u00fctjens with any orders since they had no information on the state of the task force.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 167\u2013169.</ref>\n[[File:Funknachricht L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|L\u00fctjens' final message, informing the German command of his intention to fight to the last against the enemy.]]\nMeanwhile, L\u00fctjens took stock of his predicament. Firstly, he believed that he was shadowed by a force of ships with superior radar. Secondly, the element of surprise had been lost. Thirdly, the battleship was running low of fuel; his decision not to refuel in Norway or the [[Norwegian Sea]] now became relevant. Fourthly, he thought the force was led by the efficient battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, which he thought was leading him into a trap with an enemy fleet alerted to ''Hood''{{'}}s fate. Fifthly, sea water had slowed him by two knots. His ship had lost some electrical power and salt water was threatening to enter fuel lines and shut down two boilers.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 86.</ref> Lindemann argued for a return via the Denmark Strait to Norway. In his view the ship was too fine a vessel to be risked in another unequal struggle. L\u00fctjens rejected his suggestion. It would take him too close to the [[British Isles]] and expose him to the greatest concentration of enemy sea, air and coastal forces. According to survivors, the animosity between Lindemann and L\u00fctjens was now beginning to extend to their respective staffs.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe reasons for L\u00fctjens' decision to make for France instead of making the shorter journey to Norway remain unknown. It can be surmised he thought the ship would be repaired quickly and a French port was closer to his hunting ground which also precluded another tricky break out via the Denmark Strait. Furthermore, he had asked for a concentration of U-boats south of [[Greenland]] to attack his shadowers. The vast ocean also offered an opportunity to lose his pursuers. However, the perilous fuel situation forced him to abandon the U-Boat option and steam directly for France.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, p. 235.</ref> In light of these developments, L\u00fctjens addressed the crew as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Seamen of the battleship ''Bismarck''! You have covered yourself with glory! The sinking of the battle cruiser ''Hood'' has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of [[UK|Great Britain]]. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released ''Prinz Eugen'' at noon yesterday so that she could conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 104.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSurviving crewmembers of ''Bismarck'' state that they received this message in shock. Rather than harden the resolve of the German crew, the tone of L\u00fctjens' speech implied the ship was in some difficulty and that they may not reach a friendly port. It depressed the mood about the battleship and created uncertainty among all ranks. They interpreted L\u00fctjens' words to mean the ''Admiral'' did not believe they would survive. Lindemann recognised the damage it caused and tried to present a more optimistic view of the situation. He spoke of the U-boats and ''Luftwaffe'' that were gathering to help them home. The speech, an hour later, only partially succeeded in restoring morale. That afternoon L\u00fctjens received messages of best wishes from Hitler and Raeder. The former was short and curt. L\u00fctjens purportedly stuffed the paper into his pocket without comment.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 106.</ref>\n\nA British reconnaissance aircraft sighted ''Bismarck'' in the early morning hours of 26 May by following its [[oil slick]]. At dusk on 26 May, [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo aircraft from HMS ''Ark Royal'' attacked. Although much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders and steering gear. Lindemann was sure the damage could be repaired, but L\u00fctjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage L\u00fctjens compiled a note to the German command and people just 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer ''Bismarck'' somewhat by adjusting the revolution speed of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to {{convert|7|kn|km/h mph|lk=in|abbr=on}} and effectively left it circling in the water.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 116.</ref>\n\nThroughout the night, she was the target of incessant torpedo attacks by {{HMS|Cossack|F03|6}}, {{HMS|Sikh|F82|2}}, {{HMS|Maori|F24|2}}, {{HMS|Zulu|F18|2}}, and {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}} designed to wear down the crew. At this point, the Home Fleet and ''Norfolk'' following from the north were joined by HMS ''Rodney'', while Force H and heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} approached from the south, and light cruiser {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}} from the west. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s low speed and southeasterly heading away from its known pursuers made it very easy for the force to the south to catch up.\n\n==Death==\nL\u00fctjens recognised the gravity of the situation. At 23:58 on 26 May, L\u00fctjens transmitted to ''Group West'', the Naval HQ \"To the ''F\u00fchrer'' of the German ''Reich'', Adolf Hitler. We will fight to the end thinking of you confident as in a rock in the victory of Germany\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\">Jackson 2002, p. 91.</ref> Hitler replied at 01:53 on 27 May: \"I thank you in the name of the whole German nation \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\" Later another message was sent, \"To the crew of the battleship ''Bismarck'': all Germany is with you. What can be done will be done. Your devotion to your duty will strengthen our people in the struggle for their existence \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\"/>\n\nThe mood aboard ''Bismarck'' was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was off duty for some fresh air. He climbed up to the bridge for as long as nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the atmosphere pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of [[Adalbert Schneider]] for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of ''Hood''. L\u00fctjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg's salute. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg also met L\u00fctjens as the Admiral made his way to the bridge. L\u00fctjens returned his salute as he brushed past but said nothing. To M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for ''Bismarck'' had retreated into their own private worlds.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 121\u2013124.</ref> That morning, on the 27 May 1941, L\u00fctjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, L\u00fctjens included: \"Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the ''F\u00fchrer''\".<ref>Jackson 2002, p. 49.</ref> L\u00fctjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard ''Bismarck'' was doomed.<ref>Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 276.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens had been open to criticism for his sycophantic messages to Hitler and his vow to fight to the last against hopeless odds. The authors of the [[Germany and the Second World War|German official history]] have commented it would be unjust to criticise him for being sympathetic to the National Socialist cause or to mark him as an Admiral who saw operations through to the end regardless of the outcome. L\u00fctjens had remained notably aloof from the regime. This aside, he was also steeped in the German officer traditions in which it was inconceivable to abandon a fully battle-ready ship. After the scuttling of the ''[[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Graf Spee]]'', Raeder had ordered all capital ships to fight to the last round if crippled. His messages, according to these historians, should be seen in the context of L\u00fctjens fulfilling his duty. It is unknown whether he or Lindemann considered scuttling the ship to save the crew before the last battle.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, Wegner 2001, pp. 137, 139, 230.</ref>\n\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s alarm sounded for the last time at 08:00 on the morning of 27 May 1941. ''Norfolk'' sighted the ''Bismarck'' at 08:15, and the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire at 08:48. ''Bismarck'' began [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her last stand]] and returned fire at 08:49 against ''Rodney''. {{HMS|King George V|41|2}} fired at ''Bismarck'' soon after and the cruisers ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' engaged with their main armament. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward command position was hit at 08:53, and both forward gun turrets were put out of action at 09:02, killing Adalbert Schneider in the main gun director. The after command position was destroyed at 09:18 and turret ''Dora'' was disabled at 09:24. ''Bismarck'' received further heavy hits at 09:40, resulting in a fire amidships, and turret ''Caesar'' went out of action after a hit at 09:50. Some secondary positions and weapons survived and battled on. All weapons fell silent at 10:00. Short of fuel, ''Rodney'' and ''King George V'' had to disengage prior to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking.\n\n{{location map|North Atlantic| label=''Bismarck'' sunk |position=bottom\n|width=150\n|long=-16.12\n|lat=48.10\n|caption=\n}}\nThe Germans were preparing to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] ''Bismarck'' when three torpedoes fired by ''Dorsetshire'' hit the ship's side armour. ''Bismarck'' sank at 10:36 at position {{Coord|48|10|N|16|12|W}}, roughly {{convert|300|nmi|km mi|abbr=on}} west of Ouessant ([[Ushant]]). The cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' saved 85 men, and the British destroyer ''Maori'' saved another 25. Five sailors were saved by {{GS|U-74|1940|6}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat]], and the weather observation ship {{ship|German weather ship|Sachsenwald||2}}. The ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (U-boat Commander-in-Chief) D\u00f6nitz had ordered {{GS|U-556||2}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Herbert Wohlfarth]], to pick up ''Bismarck''{{'}}s [[war diary]]. Out of torpedoes and low on fuel, Wohlfarth requested that the mission be transferred to ''U-74''. ''U-74'' failed to reach Bismarck in time, and the war diary was never retrieved.<ref>Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr and Steinmetz 1990, volume 2 p. 81.</ref> L\u00fctjens was among those who lost their lives \u2013 probably killed when a {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} salvo fired by ''Rodney'' destroyed the bridge, killing many senior officers.\n\n==Personal life==\nL\u00fctjens married Margarete Backenk\u00f6hler, daughter of the ''[[Geheimrat|Geheimen]] Sanit\u00e4tsrat'' (\"Privy Counselor on Hygiene\", honorary title given to a distinguished doctor) Dr. Gerhard Backenk\u00f6hler, in the summer of 1929.<ref name=\"Uebersch\u00e4r 2011, p. 408\"/> She was 27 at the time of the wedding and the sister of Otto Backenk\u00f6hler. Admiral Otto Backenk\u00f6hler was L\u00fctjens' chief of staff at the Fleet-Command (24 October 1939 \u2013 31 July 1940). A year later, their first son, Gerhard, was born on 31 August 1930 in [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie|Swinem\u00fcnde]]. The marriage produced a second son, named G\u00fcnther after his father, on 28 August 1932 in Berlin. Their daughter Annemarie was born on 27 August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Less than a month after L\u00fctjens' death, his wife gave birth to their fourth child, Peter.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 380\u2013392.</ref><ref name=\"Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392\"/><ref>Rigg and Nicolai 2003, p. 120.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1960 film, ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'', L\u00fctjens (played by [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]]) is portrayed as a stereotypical [[Nazi]], committed to Nazism and crazed in his undaunted belief that the ''Bismarck'' is unsinkable. In reality, L\u00fctjens did not agree with Nazi policies; along with two other navy commanders, he had publicly protested against the brutality of anti-Semitic crimes during [[Kristallnacht]]. He was one of the few officers who refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler visited ''Bismarck'' before its first and final mission, deliberately using instead the traditional naval salute.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 32</ref> He was pessimistic of the chances of success of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s mission and realised that it would be a daunting task.<ref>Asmussen, John.

Retrieved: 1 December 2013.</ref>\n\n==Commemoration==\n[[File:D185 L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|right|''L\u00fctjens'' (D185).]]\n\nThe ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (navy of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]) named the [[guided missile destroyer]] {{ship|German destroyer|L\u00fctjens||2}} after G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens. The ship was christened by Gerda L\u00fctjens, wife of L\u00fctjen's oldest son Gerhard, in [[Bath, Maine]] on 11 August 1967, and was decommissioned in 2003.<ref name=\"bismarck-class.dk\">[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/bismarck/men_involved/luetjens.html Bismarck: A portrait of the Men Involved]</ref> In his christening speech the then [[secretary of state]] at the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Karl Carstens]], stated that L\u00fctjens had set an example of \"unwavering sense of responsibility and devout faithfulness to duty\".<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\">{{Cite web|work=Der Spiegel 35/1967 |title=Mumm haben|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46211719.html| accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nChoosing the name \"L\u00fctjens\" for the newly commissioned destroyer was not without controversy, but the Minister of Defence [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (CDU)|Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] wanted to break the taboo surrounding the heroes of World War II who were not Nazis but who were not associated with the [[20 July plot]], the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler. The former Inspector of the Navy Ruge had feared that L\u00fctjens was not known well enough and had suggested the names ''Adenauer'', ''Berlin'' and ''Rommel'' instead. Schr\u00f6der however wanted to bridge the gap to former traditions and wanted to name the destroyers after former heroes of the three branches of the [[Wehrmacht]] (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'', ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe'').<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/> L\u00fctjens' name had previously been cleared by the [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office]] (''Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt'' or MGFA), formerly in Freiburg im Breisgau. Schr\u00f6der concluded with the words \"We must have the courage like any other people, to honour men who have served their country bravely and faithfully.\"<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/>\n\nFollowing the christening an American worker at the [[Bath Iron Works]] approached and asked the attending German journalists \"do you only have Nazi heroes back home in Germany?\" US newspapers had introduced the namesake as a former Nazi sea hero. Present at the christening was a Bundeswehr helicopter which had been used to shuttle the official German government visitors around, and it bore the insignia of the Bundeswehr, a variant of the Iron Cross. When US radio reporters caught sight of the helicopter they mistakenly referred to the Iron Cross insignia as a [[swastika]] in their reports, thus further adding to the controversy.<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/>\n\n''L\u00fctjens'' was the first of three {{sclass-|L\u00fctjens|destroyer|2}}s. The other two were {{ship|German destroyer|M\u00f6lders||2}}, named after the ''Luftwaffe'' World War II fighter pilot [[Werner M\u00f6lders]], and {{ship|German destroyer|Rommel||2}}, named after the Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]].<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/>\n\n<!-- unsourced\n==Relevant commands==\n* 16 September 1934 \u2013 23 September 1935: Commander of the light cruiser ''Karlsruhe''.\n* 24 September 1935 \u2013 15 March 1936: Chief of Staff Naval Group North in Wilhelmshaven.\n* 16 March 1936 \u2013 7 October 1937: Chief of the officer Personnel Branch at Naval Headquarters (Marinepersonalamt.

L\u00fctjens is best known for his actions during [[World War II]] and his command of the [[battleship]] {{Ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} during its foray into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1941. In its aftermath, the episode entered into naval legend.\n\nBorn in 1889, he entered into the German Imperial Navy ({{Lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}}) in 1907. A diligent and intelligent [[cadet]] he progressed to [[Officer (armed forces)|officer rank]] before the outbreak of war, when he was assigned to a [[Torpedo boat]] Squadron. During [[World War I]] L\u00fctjens operated in the [[North Sea]] and [[English Channel]] and fought several actions with the British [[Royal Navy]]. He ended the conflict as a ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain lieutenant) with the [[Iron Cross]] 1st and 2nd class (1914) to his credit. After the war he remained in the service of the navy, now renamed the ''[[Reichsmarine]]''. He continued to serve in torpedo boat squadrons eventually becoming a [[Commanding Officer]] in 1925. In the [[Weimar Republic]] era, L\u00fctjens built a reputation as an excellent staff officer.\n\nIn 1935, after the [[Nazi Party]] came to power under [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933, the navy was remodelled again and renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. L\u00fctjens soon became acquainted with [[Erich Raeder]] and [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]; the two Commanders-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in World War II. His capability and friendship led to his promotion to ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) and a sea command at the helm of the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}. In the six years of peace he had risen to the rank of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral), a promotion conferred upon him October 1937.\n\nIn September 1939, World War II began with the [[German invasion of Poland]]. L\u00fctjens received the [[Clasp to the Iron Cross]] 2nd Class (1939) three days later. His command of [[destroyer]] operations in the North Sea over the winter, 1939\u201340, earned him the Clasp to the Iron Cross 1st Class. On 1 January 1940, he was promoted to  ''Vizeadmiral'' (Vice Admiral). In April 1940 he was given temporary command of the entire German surface fleet during the initial landing phase of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasions of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. His actions earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the campaign he was appointed the [[Fleet commander (Kriegsmarine)|fleet commander]] of the German Navy and promoted to Admiral on 1 September 1940. He was involved in the tentative planning for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the planned invasion of the [[United Kingdom]], but the plans were shelved after the [[Battle of Britain]]. German intentions turned to blockade and L\u00fctjens made the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} the centerpiece of his battle fleet; using the latter vessel as his [[flagship]]. In January 1941 he planned and executed [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']], an Atlantic raid to support [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] by attacking British merchant shipping lanes. The operation was a [[Tactical victory|tactical]] and [[propaganda]] victory. It came to a close in March 1941 when the ships docked in [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German-occupied France]] after sailing some 18,000 miles; a record for a German battle group at the time. His success led him to being chosen for further operations.\n\nIn May 1941, L\u00fctjens commanded a German task force, consisting of the battleship ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, during [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. In a repetition of ''Berlin'', L\u00fctjens was required to break out of their naval base in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]], sail via [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]], and attack merchant shipping. The operation went awry and the task force was soon spotted and engaged near [[Iceland]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} was sunk and three other British warships were forced to retreat. The two German ships then separated. Three days later, on 27 May, L\u00fctjens and most of the ship's crew lost their lives when ''Bismarck'' [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|was caught]] and sunk.\n\nIn 1955 the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was remilitarised and entered [[NATO]]. The ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was established the following year. In 1967 this organisation recognised L\u00fctjens and his service by naming the destroyer {{ship|German destroyer|L\u00fctjens|D185|2}} after him.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life==\nJohann G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens was born in [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Hesse-Nassau]], a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], on 25 May 1889.

L\u00fctjens's dedication to his officer principles meant he did not marry until he was 40, adhering to a code that an officer would marry only when he was able to support a wife.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 36.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War II]], L\u00fctjens was Commander of Scouting Forces\u2014''Befehlshaber der Aufkl\u00e4rungsstreitkr\u00e4fte'' (B.d.A.)\u2014made up of German destroyers, torpedo boats and cruisers.<ref>Haarr 2013, p. 38.</ref> On 1 September 1939 [[Polish Campaign|Germany invaded Poland]] and two days later, L\u00fctjens sailing aboard his flagship, Z1 ''Leberecht Maass'' and [[German destroyer Z9 Wolfgang Zenker|Z9 ''Wolfgang Zenker'']] took part in an attack on the Polish ships {{ship|ORP|Gryf|1936|2}} and {{ship|ORP|Wicher|1928|2}} in [[Gdynia]] harbour. L\u00fctjens attacked from a range of 14,000 yards south-east of the harbour. The Poles replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive manoeuvres and to lay a [[smoke screen]] to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit in the superstructure by a {{convert|152|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} shell from the [[Coastal artillery|coast defence]] [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] at [[Hel, Poland|Hel]] that killed four crewmen and wounded another four men. L\u00fctjens ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective. L\u00fctjens ordered the group to [[Pillau]] to refuel and the ''Leberecht Maas'' sailed to Swinem\u00fcnde for repairs.<ref>O'Hara 2004, p. 4.</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1939 L\u00fctjens led a raiding sortie into the [[North Sea]]. On board his flagship [[German destroyer Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp|Z21 ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'']], he led six destroyers laden with naval mines. His own ship did not carry any mines and acted as cover. They reached the [[Humber Estuary]] undetected and departed unseen. Within days shipping losses began occurring among British transports in the area. L\u00fctjens did not repeat the operation. He was promoted to Vice Admiral and moved with his staff to the [[German cruiser N\u00fcrnberg|cruiser ''N\u00fcrnberg'']].<ref>Haarr 2013, p. 282.</ref>\n\n===Operation Weser\u00fcbung===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-0434-05A, G\u00fcnter L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vice Admiral L\u00fctjens in April, 1940]]\nIn April 1940, during the invasion of Denmark and Norway ([[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]), he served as ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral), commanding the distant cover forces in the North Sea\u2014which consisted of {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}. His superior, ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Wilhelm Marschall]], had fallen ill just before the operation, so he assumed command of the [[Narvik]] and [[Trondheim]] landings.<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was to lead ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', with his flag in the latter, on escort operation for a force of 10 destroyers commanded by ''F\u00fchrer der Zerst\u00f6rer'' (Leader of Destroyers) [[Friedrich Bonte]]. The fleet was laden with soldiers belonging to the [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|''3. Gebirgs-Division'']] under the command of [[Eduard Dietl]]. The division was to seize Narvik.  L\u00fctjens briefed his officers aboard ''Gneisenau'' on 6 April in the presence of Raeder. L\u00fctjens had his doubts about the wisdom of the entire operation but he showed no sign of his feelings to his subordinates. L\u00fctjens hoped for bad weather to shield the fleet from Allied aircraft. The skies were clear and the ships were twice attacked by [[RAF Coastal Command]] bombers without result. The British airmen reported their position and surprise was now gone. Nevertheless, L\u00fctjens remained on schedule and delivered the force to Narvik. On two occasions a sailor was swept overboard but L\u00fctjens' operations officer, Heinrich Gerlach, noted: \"No rescue attempts were made. On no account was there to be any interruption of the time schedule.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' mission then was to draw British units away from Narvik and facilitate the landings there and prevent the [[Royal Navy]] from attacking the destroyers and landing craft. During the landing phase, his forces were approached by a Royal Navy task-force led by the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}. The British ship engaged at 05:05 and L\u00fctjens was forced to fight [[Action off Lofoten|an inconclusive battle]] with ''Renown''. L\u00fctjens succeeded in extracting the German vessels without incurring major battle damage. He viewed his operation as a success.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\">Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>O'Hara 2004. pp. 20\u201327.</ref> L\u00fctjens nearly changed his mind during the battle, believing a pitched fight may bring relief to the German destroyer force at Narvik\u2014a force which he had effectively been forced to abandon in the face of enemy sea superiority. But the prospect of running into {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}}, now known by German naval intelligence to be in the vicinity, was too much of a risk. In the resultant [[Battles of Narvik]] 10 German destroyers were sunk and the campaign for the port lasted until June. Bonte was killed when his command ship,  ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'' exploded.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIt may have been possible for him to turn on and sink ''Renown'' by attacking from different directions, using ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', but the accompanying British destroyers were well placed to join the fight had he done so. His Commander-in-Chief, Raeder, endorsed his actions which would have placed him against a clear eastern horizon as opposed to an enemy that was positioned against a darkened western horizon. Action at that time would have given the enemy a clearer silhouette to aim at while obscuring the British ships somewhat. Moreover, if either German ship had been immobilised by ''Renown'' they would have been vulnerable to a torpedo attack by the British destroyers. Under those circumstances, Raeder felt the British would have had a tactical advantage. L\u00fctjens later rendezvoused with the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} and reached [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 12 April, having avoided a major fleet action.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\"/>\n\nL\u00fctjens was indirectly involved in another battle. The Trondheim force was led by the heavy cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' who detached the German destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z11 Bernd von Arnim||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z18 Hans L\u00fcdemann||2}} to search for a man that had been washed over board. In the heavy fog they ran into {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}. ''Glowworm'' outmatched the lighter German vessels and they disengaged and called for help. L\u00fctjens ordered ''Hipper'' to assist. The heavy cruiser sank the ''Glowworm'', but not before the British ship had rammed her larger assailant and caused her considerable damage.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> When L\u00fctjens stepped ashore at Wilhelmshaven, his decision to abandon Bonte's destroyer group at Narvik weighed heavily on his mind.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\">Garrett 1978, p. 44.</ref> In the wake of L\u00fctjens return, he learned Marschall had recovered to assume command.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\"/>\n\n===Commander of the fleet===\nIn June and July 1940, he became Commander of Battleships and the third ''Flottenchef'' (Fleet Commander) of the ''Kriegsmarine'', a position comparable to the British Commander-in-Chief of the [[Home Fleet]]. His predecessor\u2014''Vizeadmiral'' Wilhelm Marschall\u2014had had repeated differences with Raeder over the extent the ''Flottenchef'' should be bound by orders while operating at sea. Marschall led ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' to intercept Allied naval forces withdrawing from [[Norway]] against orders. On 8 June 1940 he engaged and sank the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glorious||2}} and her escorting [[destroyer]]s {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}. During the battle ''Scharnhorst'' was heavily damaged by a torpedo. Marschall was dismissed by Raeder because the Commander-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' deemed the episode unacceptable.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\">Garrett 1978, p. 53.</ref> Raeder viewed the sinkings as \"target practice\" and the damage to ''Scharnhorst'', and consequently ''Gneisenau'', offset this victory in his view.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\nTen days later L\u00fctjens was given command of the fleet on a temporary basis. Raeder regarded L\u00fctjens as a sound tactician, excellent staff officer and a leader with all-important operational and battle experience. After the war Raeder was candid about his decision to elevate L\u00fctjens through the chain of command. Raeder said of his progression, \"He had also experience in staff work, and as my Chief of Personnel he had won by special confidence in years of close association.\"<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 353.</ref> Raeder expressed his confidence that L\u00fctjens displayed wise judgment and was unlikely to act rashly. When at sea, he allowed him to take command of the situation and make operational decisions at his own discretion.<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 357.</ref> Although described as reserved and unapproachable toward subordinates, he was held to be \"of manifest integrity and reliability.\"<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 130.</ref> Hitler expressed his gratitude to L\u00fctjens for \"preparing and leading the Navy into action\", and awarded him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 14 June 1940.<ref>Groves 2012, p. 53.</ref>\n\n''Scharnhorst'' had been forced to make for Trondheim in the aftermath of the action for emergency repairs. Flying his flag in ''Gneisenau'', L\u00fctjens took command of his first voyage as ''Flottenchef'' aboard a capital ship. On 20 June 1940 he sailed in company with ''Admiral Hipper'', toward the North Sea in the hope of diverting attention from ''Scharnhorst'' while it made the perilous trek from Norway to Germany. The operation succeeded, but ''Gneisenau'' was torpedoed by the submarine {{HMS|Clyde|N12|6}} and severely damaged.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\n[[File:OperationSealion.svg|thumb|left|Battle plan for Operation Sea Lion.]]\nIn July 1940 Hitler ordered the preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the invasion of the United Kingdom after the victory [[Battle of France|in France]]. While the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' engaged the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in what became known as the [[Battle of Britain]] to clear the skies the German naval command began planning for an assault in southern England. L\u00fctjens, as fleet commander, was responsible for carrying out sea operations based upon the strategies devised by his superior Saalw\u00e4chter, who commanded Naval Group West. Saalw\u00e4chter answered to the commander-in-chief, Raeder.\n\nL\u00fctjens was to be heavily involved in the planning of the sea landings. The navy wished to land on a narrow front because of its limited resources and L\u00fctjens planned accordingly. He established himself in the fashionable market-town of [[Trouville, Seine-Maritime|Trouville]] near [[Le Havre]]. The enormous logistical effort that required the navy to move personnel command structures and personnel to France meant that his command post did not become fully operational until August 1940. [[Friedrich Ruge]] was appointed to the mine command by L\u00fctjens with the task of clearing British naval minefields and laying German mine zones to impede the operations of the Royal Navy. Meanwhile, L\u00fctjens scoured the continent for the 1,800 river barges, 500 tugs, 150 steamships and 1,200 motor boats deemed necessary for the operation. Some 24,000 men were seconded from other services and trained as landing craft crewman.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was handicapped by the lack of firepower in the German navy. He authorised Ruge to organise the landings. The Advanced Detachments (''Vorausabteilungen'') were to storm the beach in [[battalion]]-strength. The following craft would clear mines allowing for artillery coasters and tugs carrying the [[Panzer]] units to follow unhindered. The smaller motor boats would unload engineers to clear obstacles and act as shuttle boats between the larger vessels and the beach. They would rush to and fro delivering army units to land in order to expand the beachhead and allow the flotilla to land its full complement. L\u00fctjens recommended using the old battleships ''Schlesien'' and {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}} as fire support to protect the crossing. L\u00fctjens favoured beaching the ships on the [[Varne Bank]] to act as a gun-fire platform. He thought they could best act as strong points to deny passage through the [[Strait of Dover]] to the British. Raeder agreed but the plan was rubbished by technical experts who argued the old ships were too prone to capsizing and their stationary posture was too vulnerable and their armament too weak to do the job effectively.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens continued planning preparations as the Battle of Britain raged. By September he had completed plans to land the entire [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 16th Army]] under [[Ernst Busch (field marshal)|Ernst Busch]] between [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and [[Hastings]]\u2014the site of the [[Battle of Hastings|last successful invasion of England in 1066]]\u2014and the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] between Hastings and [[Worthing]] to the west. L\u00fctjens' opinion on the chances of success are not known. The battles in Norway had left him without any major capital ship. In the event, L\u00fctjens was never tested. The air battle over Britain was lost and by the end of 1940 plans for an invasion were postponed as Hitler turned eastward for a campaign against the [[Soviet Union]]. German naval strategy now turned to thoughts of [[siege]] and destroying Britain's shipping lanes which supplied the country from the overseas and in particularly [[North America]].<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 241\u2013243, 299\u2013302.</ref>\n\n===Operation Berlin===\n''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were readied for action again by the winter. Their task now was to engage Allied [[merchant vessel]]s bringing war materials to Britain. As fleet commander, it would be L\u00fctjens' first operation in the Battle of the Atlantic. It was named [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']]. On 28 December 1940, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on which Admiral L\u00fctjens had raised his flag\u2014left Germany for an Atlantic raid. However, due to weather, L\u00fctjens ordered a return to port: ''Gneisenau'' to Kiel and ''Scharnhorst'' to Gdynia. While repairs were carried out Navy Group West emphasised to him that his primary targets were enemy merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens reiterated his standing orders to his captains: \"our job is to put as many as possible under the water\".<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 1941, the renewed mission was delayed for several days owing to the sighting of British ships near the Norwegian coast and the inability of submarine chasers and destroyers to escort them to the [[Arctic Ocean]].<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, pp. 56\u201358.</ref> L\u00fctjens chose to pass between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Unbeknownst to L\u00fctjens, his ships had been spotted sailing past [[Zealand]], Denmark, by British agents. British Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, Admiral [[John Tovey]] was alerted and dispatched three battleships, eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers to hunt for the German ships accordingly, hoping to intercept the Germans off southern Iceland. The cruiser {{HMS|Naiad|93|2}} briefly sighted the German ships on 28 January as L\u00fctjens prepared to break through the Iceland-Faroe gap, and reported their position. The German admiral quickly decided to retire northbound with the intention of passing through the [[Denmark Strait]]. On 30 January L\u00fctjens decided to refuel from the tanker ''Thorn'' off [[Jan Mayen]] island before attempting this breakout route. After refueling, L\u00fctjens sailed, and on 4 February, slipped into the Atlantic. Fortunately for L\u00fctjens, Tovey dismissed the sighting by ''Naiad'' as an [[Mirage|illusion]], and returned to port.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\n====Free in the Atlantic====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1123-500, Kurt-C\u00e4sar Hoffmann.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain Hoffmann. A former pupil and companion to L\u00fctjens on ''Berlin''.]]\nL\u00fctjens now had the operational initiative. He had a choice of two potential killing-grounds. To the north lay the HX and SC convoys which sailed between Britain and [[Canada]]. To the south the SL and OG convoys which operated between Britain, [[Gibraltar]] and [[Freetown]]. He decided to opt for operations in the north. He used ''Admiral Hipper'', at that moment also loose in the Atlantic, to create a diversion by ordering her to the south. In retrospect it was an error of judgment. L\u00fctjens' orders were to avoid combat on equal terms. He had not realised\u2014and was not to know\u2014that southern convoys were virtually undefended at this point in the war, but on orders of the British [[Admiralty]], all northern convoys had an escort of at least one [[Capital Ship]].<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 56.</ref> German intelligence had warned him that {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}} and {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}} were based at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He estimated that they could escort convoys only 1,000 miles east of their base, and so began he search for targets with this in mind.<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 8 February, [[B-Dienst]] alerted the German warships of [[convoy HX 106]] which sailed from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] on 31 January. L\u00fctjens planned a pincer movement converging from the north and south. The convoy was escorted by ''Ramillies'' armed with eight [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch]] guns. When the battleship was sighted L\u00fctjens strictly followed the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]]''{{'}}s directive not to engage enemy capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 57.</ref>\n\n[[Kurt-Caesar Hoffmann]], captain of ''Scharnhorst'', attempted to draw off the British battleship, so that ''Gneisenau'' could sink the merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens, however, did not understand Hoffmann's intentions which the ''Scharnhorst'' captain was not able to communicate in detail in such short-order. A heated radio conversation followed in which L\u00fctjens accused him of disobeying orders because he did not turn away immediately. The enemy ship did not leave the convoy and now L\u00fctjens complained the British would be alerted to their position and as a consequence, successful attacks would now be more difficult to execute. In fact, L\u00fctjens' fears were unfounded and luck was once again on his side. The British had sighted only one German ship. Since ''Hipper'' was known to be at sea, it was assumed she was the German vessel lurking around the convoy. Tovey's dismissal of the ''Naiad'' report masked the German ships' presence. Tovey still believed they were still in German ports.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 58.</ref> The disagreement did not adversely damage the two men's good relations.{{efn| Richard Garrett, a naval researcher, interviewed Hoffmann in 1976. Hoffmann stated he respected L\u00fctjens, who had been his gunnery instructor as a sea cadet in 1912.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 57\u201358.</ref>}}\n\nThe ships rendezvoused between Iceland and Canada with the tankers ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' on 15 February. On 22 February, after seven days of fruitless searching some 500 nautical miles east of [[Newfoundland]], German radar picked up five cargo-empty ships from a westbound convoy sailing without escort towards [[United States|American]] ports. The convoy identified the German ships and soon the radio waves were busy with signals sent from the frantic British merchantmen, which tried to disperse. The battleships quickly closed and sank four. A further ship, the 5,500-ton ''Harlesden'', carried a powerful [[wireless]] set but temporarily evaded them. Intent on silencing it, L\u00fctjens dispatched his [[Arado Ar 196]] to locate it. Upon his return, the Arado pilot reported to have found it and claimed to have destroyed the aerial, but took damage from return fire. Its position now known, the German ships closed in and sank ''Harlesden'' at 23:00. The day's haul amounted to around 25,000&nbsp;tons. On a negative note, the chase and action occurred at long range and the expenditure of ammunition was expensive. L\u00fctjens used his radio for the first time since 8 February and commanded the supply ships ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' to meet him near the Azores so he could replenish stocks.<ref>Garratt 1978, p. 60.</ref> On 26 February he unloaded 180 [[prisoners of war]] onto the tankers ''Ermland'' and ''Friedrich Breme''. In the action of 22 February, only 11 Allied sailors had become casualties.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 61.</ref>\n\nDisappointed with the lack of targets in the north, L\u00fctjens' ships then sailed to the coast of [[West Africa]]. On 3 March 1941 they reached the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. On 5 March he attempted to dispatch his aircraft to find enemy shipping but found it four hours later, the machine having run out of fuel. L\u00fctjens' persistence paid off. At 23:00 on 5 March, he received a wireless message from Germany informing him {{GS|U-124|1940|2}} had spotted two large ships close to their position. The Arado had flown over the submarine, which had been alerted to the possibility German commerce raiders might be in the area. On 7 March, the convoy SL-67, escorted by {{HMS|Malaya}}, was sighted. Once again, L\u00fctjens obeyed his orders and not his instinct. He withdrew, but shadowed the convoy, directing ''U-124'' and {{GS|U-105|1940|2}} onto the enemy. The former sank five and the latter one ship. L\u00fctjens ran into the convoy again as darkness fell, but the Germans turned away to meet with their supply ships, narrowly avoiding a battle with ''Malaya''. On the way the [[Greece|Greek]] ship ''Marathon'' (7,926 tons) was sunk. It was carrying [[coal]] to [[Alexandria]].<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 62\u201365.</ref>\n\n====Escape to France====\nOn 11 March he received a message from Group West. {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and ''Hipper'' were to operate in the north, and German intelligence were alerted to the possibility of a British force consisting of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] were on a westerly course from [[Gibraltar]]. L\u00fctjens was required to create a diversion to allow ''Scheer'' safe passage through the Denmark Strait. He decided that the best way to attract British attention was to head for [[Brest, France]], via the HX convoy route. L\u00fctjens decided to employ his entire force, supply ships too, in a search for victims. Stationed 30 miles abreast, they sailed between 39\u00b0N and 46\u00b0W. L\u00fctjens intercepted the Norwegian tanker ''Bianca'' (5,688 tons), the ''Polykarb'' (6,500 tons) and British ''San Casimiro'' (8,000 tons). He managed to capture the ships and his prize crews were ordered to [[Bordeaux]]. Only ''Polykarb'' made it. The others were scuttled by their German crews when approached by HMS ''Renown''. Three more were sunk by the German battleships.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n\nSupply ships ''Uckermark'' and ''Ermland'' signalled they had sighted another convoy. They acted as shepherds as they rushed at the startled merchantmen and drove them toward the German battleships. On 15 March L\u00fctjens began his attack. ''Empire of Industry'' (formerly German), ''Mangkai'' (formerly the German ''Scheer''), ''Silverfix'', ''Demerton'', ''Grandi'', ''Royal Crown'', ''Sardinian Prince'' and the French ''Myson'' were sunk. Among the company was ''Chilean Reefer''. Only 1,800 tons, the ship made smoke and returned ''Gniesenau''{{'}}s fire. Believing it possibly disguised as an enemy cruiser, or a scout, the Germans withdrew to a safe distance and sank it with the main batteries. It was a small target which took 73 rounds to destroy. HMS ''Rodney'' appeared 15 minutes later and flashed a challenge. In L\u00fctjens' mind, it confirmed his suspicions of the vessel as a scout. L\u00fctjens identified ''Gneisenau'' as \"HMS Emerald\", buying time as he worked up to escape. It worked, and ''Rodney'' stayed to pick up the survivors from the ''Chilean Reefer''.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> After transferring 200 prisoners, he set course for Brest, France. Sighted by an aircraft from {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} on 20 March, Admiral L\u00fctjens managed to evade British warships, and reached Brest at 07:00 on 22 March. The journey of {{convert|17800|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} in 59 days was a record for German capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 71.</ref>\n\nRaeder was pleased with L\u00fctjens. He described his operation in the Atlantic as \"beyond reproach. He invariably judged the situation accurately and he met with deserved success.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 68.</ref> Raeder's glowing endorsement was likely caused by L\u00fctjens' rigid adherence to his commander-in-chief's instructions. The ''Seekriegsleitung'' was more critical. It acknowledged the restrictions placed upon L\u00fctjens but thought L\u00fctjens could have asked for greater freedom of action after the encounter with ''Ramillies''. The staff officers believed Hoffman's tactical assessment of the situation had been correct.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\n===Operation Rhein\u00fcbung===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-01-4-25, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|right|''Bismarck''{{'}}s aft upper deck, behind turret \"Caesar\". This is where the living and working quarters of the admiral's staff were located.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 378.</ref>]]\n\nPlans were then made for L\u00fctjens to command [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']], taking all four modern German battleships and battlecruisers\u2014''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on a raid into the Atlantic. For various reasons, ''Tirpitz'' and the two battlecruisers could not be made ready for the operation, so it proceeded with only ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, under the command of [[Helmuth Brinkmann]]. The preparation and operational directives had been prepared by ''Marinegruppenkommando West'', under the command of ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' Saalw\u00e4chter and ''Marinegruppenkommando Ost'', under the command of ''Generaladmiral'' [[Rolf Carls]]. On 8 April 1941, L\u00fctjens met with Admiral D\u00f6nitz in [[Paris]]. D\u00f6nitz made the following assessment of the plan:\n<blockquote>I met Admiral L\u00fctjens, the Admiral commanding the fleet, in Paris. I knew L\u00fctjens well and held him in high esteem. During the same years we had been in command of the cruisers ''Karlsruhe'' and ''Emden'' respectively. At the end of our overseas tours of duty we had returned to Germany in company. In the years immediately before the war, while I was senior Officer, submarines, L\u00fctjens had been officer commanding Torpedo Boats. We were often together, both socially and on duty, we held the same views on naval matters and saw eye to eye in most things. At our conference in Paris we defined the support to be given to the ''Bismarck'' by [[U-Boat]]s in the following terms:<br/>\n1. The U-Boats would carry on as usual in their normal positions<br/>\n2. If while the surface ships were at sea any opportunity arose for joint action with U-Boats, every effort should be made to exploit it to the full. For this purpose an experienced U-Boat Officer would be appointed for duty to the ''Bismarck''.<br/>\n3. On the radio frequency used by the U-Boats, the Admiral commanding the fleet would be kept constantly informed of the dispositions of the boats and the intentions of the U-Boat Command.<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1958 (1997), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref></blockquote>\n\n====L\u00fctjens' view====\nRaeder was anxious to begin the operation during the [[new moon]] on 26 April. His wishes were frustrated by a series of mishaps. ''Prinz Eugen'' was repeatedly delayed from becoming fully operational. [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombing, a practice torpedo, and a mine detonation delayed her from mid-April until mid-May.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> Raeder used this time to consult with his fleet commander. L\u00fctjens travelled to [[Berlin]] on 26 April 1941 to meet with him. For a time, L\u00fctjens tried without success to change Raeder's mind, and to wait until ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were ready. He argued that the German fleet should not be fed \"[[teaspoon]] by teaspoon\" into battle with the enemy.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was, however, encouraged by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin as soon as possible to prevent the enemy's gaining any respite.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf & Wegner 2001, pp. 131\u2013132.</ref> He accepted that the current situation meant that German capital ships must be present in the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Although Raeder insisted on the operation, he advised L\u00fctjens to act thoughtfully and carefully without taking too high a risk.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 385\u2013386.</ref> Raeder did, however, admonish his subordinate to one end: if he were brought to battle despite his best efforts, it should be conducted with full force, to the end. He gave L\u00fctjens full [[Mission-type tactics|freedom of action]], since only he was in a position to judge the immediate situation while at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Raeder later wrote, \"It does L\u00fctjens great credit that he did not hesitate to express this view to me so frankly. I then sought to convince him of the cogency of my arguments....Although L\u00fctjens was perhaps not entirely convinced by my views, our discussion ended in complete understanding.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 78.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens sought advice from several colleagues and friends. First, he spoke with [[Kurt Fricke]], Raeder's chief of operations. When Fricke inquired as to what he would do if approached by overwhelming force: L\u00fctjens replied he would run for home. As far as the Naval Command was concerned, this was his policy. He sought out his friend, Patzig, who had commanded {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}, and a man he had known since 1907. Patzig argued he should remain in port. He remarked that it was folly to risk the chief of the fleet in a limited operation with a single capital ship. L\u00fctjens agreed, but feared being labelled a coward if he turned down the command.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50.</ref> His parting words to Patzig were fatalistic:\n<blockquote>Given the uneven relation of forces I am of the opinion that I should have to sacrifice myself sooner or later. I have closed out my private life and am determined to carry out the assignment given to me honourably, one way or another.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing this meeting, L\u00fctjens confided to ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Hans-Erich Voss]], then working at Raeder's headquarters, that \"survival was improbable\", and bade him farewell.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" />{{efn|full quote: \"I want to say goodbye, I will not come back. Given the superiority of the British survival is unlikely\"\u2014''Ich m\u00f6chte mich verabschieden, ich werde nicht wiederkommen. Bei der \u00dcberlegenheit der Briten ist ein \u00dcberleben unwahrscheinlich.''<ref name=\"\u00dcebersch\u00e4r p407\"/>}}\n\nLastly he met with his former commanding officer in Norway, Marschall. He advised L\u00fctjens not to follow Raeder's orders too closely since the situation in the Atlantic could change at any moment. L\u00fctjens would not hear of it. He refused to diverge from his standing orders. He reminded Marschall that two fleet commanders had already been removed from command\u2014Marschall being one of them\u2014and that he would follow the orders given him.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 49\u201350.</ref> What depressed L\u00fctjens's already darkened mood was [[Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck's'' captain, had been told by [[Karl Topp]] of the [[Marineamt]], that several [[Military simulation|war games]] were run to see if ''Tirpitz'' could reach the Atlantic undetected and that at every turn and under every circumstance, the ship was discovered. Lindemann certainly would have passed this information to L\u00fctjens.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 52.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' staff for Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'' was made up of the following officers:<ref name=\"Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392\">Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392.</ref>\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Rank\n!scope=\"col\" | Role\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Harald Netzbandt]]\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See''\n| scope=\"row\" | Chief of Staff\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Emil Melms\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See''\n| scope=\"row\" | 2nd Admiral Staff Officer, Artillery Officer of the Fleet, Personnel Officer\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Dr. Hans-Releff Riege\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Flottenarzt'' (posthumously ''Admiralarzt'')\n| scope=\"row\" | Doctor with the Fleet Commando\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Helmut Marschall\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Hauptregierungsrat'' of the Reserves\n| scope=\"row\" | Meteorologist\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Paul Ascher\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n''\n| scope=\"row\" | 1st Admiral Staff Officer\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Karl Thannemann\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n'' (Ing.)

L\u00fctjens had informed Lindemann and Brinkmann on 18 May that he intended to sail for the arctic and refuel at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62.</ref> Three days later, in Norwegian waters, L\u00fctjens ordered a fuel stop in a [[Grimstadfjord]] near [[Bergen]]. He did not inform either Lindemann or Brinkmann about the decision to drop anchor and refuel. As was his custom, he offered no explanation for changing his mind.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 70.</ref>\n\nWhile ''Prinz Eugen'' was refuelled, L\u00fctjens declined to top up the ''Bismarck''. A rupture in one of the fuel lines had allowed only an initial influx of 6,000 tons. A further 2,000 tons was to be accepted at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/> The ship had left the Baltic 200 tons short, and had since burned 1,000 tons reaching Norway. L\u00fctjens knew that the German tanker ''Weissenberg'' was waiting for him in the Arctic, only an additional day's sailing away, but farther from prying British eyes.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> It was perhaps his intention to replenish there. In the event he did not refuel during the operation.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/>\n\nThe following day, on 22 May, he received a report that four British battleships, perhaps an [[aircraft carrier]], and a strong escort of destroyers were still anchored at [[Scapa Flow]]. Although mistaken, it appears to have influenced L\u00fctjens' decision not to loiter and wait for events to unfold, but to proceed with a breakout immediately which would not permit time for refueling prior to reaching the Atlantic.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 133.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> This faulty intelligence report likely dispelled any doubts L\u00fctjens had about his chosen route.<ref>Ballard 1990, p.. 69.</ref> The move would bring about the first of several disagreements with Captain Lindemann. Lindemann preferred the route south of Iceland, but once again L\u00fctjens and his terse style had prevailed.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 66.</ref>\n\nHe also declined ''Generaladmiral'' Carls' desire for a breakout through the more southerly Faroe Islands-Iceland gap. As usual, he gave no explanation for any change in operational direction. While the ice-flooded regions of northern Iceland and the [[Denmark Strait]] could be easily patrolled by the enemy, as believed by Carls, it offered lower-visibility conditions, giving him much needed cover. Nevertheless, he continued to frustrate his junior officers. Meteorologist Heinz Externbrink suggested increasing speed to keep up with the fast-moving cloud affording him cover. L\u00fctjens declined without comment, and Externbrink vented his anger to [[:de:Burkard Freiherr von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|Burkard von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg]], the most senior officer to survive the operation. Despite his intentions, the British were alerted to the task force's operation by the [[Sweden|Swedes]], [[Norwegian Resistance]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]].<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 132.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201375.</ref>\n\nLindemann remained on edge. As captain, he was privy to the B-Dienst naval intelligence now reaching him on enemy movements. A large contingent of enemy capital ships was congregating at Scapa Flow. His senior medical officer, Dr. Otto Schneider, observed that Lindemann fully understood the dangers his ship faced. But Admiral L\u00fctjens alone could call off the operation. He showed no desire to discuss his intentions with either Captain Lindemann or Brinkmann, which put both of them on edge. L\u00fctjens offered no hint of intentions either to his destroyer escort, which he dismissed near [[Trondheim]], or to ''Generaladmiral'' Carls. Carls openly displayed his displeasure at the lack of communication, believing L\u00fctjens to be hesitant. Not until the evening of 22 May did he share his intention to breach the Denmark Strait with his captains; perhaps encouraged in the knowledge that the British [[Force H]] would now be engaged in the beginning [[Battle of Crete]]. The foul weather gave him the cover he needed. Foregoing the chance of a refuel, he headed due west, north of Iceland.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201378</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens remained unaware that the British were tracking him until 23 May, when his ships encountered heavy cruisers {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} and {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}, amidst the [[Greenland]] ice pack. L\u00fctjens received the identity of the first ship as the latter vessel. He gave the code JOTDORA: permission to fire. Although shots were fired, no serious damage resulted to either side, and the outgunned British cruisers quickly withdrew, though they remained within radar range and continued to shadow the German ships. The shock from the firing of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s heavy guns disabled her search radar, so L\u00fctjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to take the lead. As they passed each other ''Bismarck''{{'}}s electric push-button wheel jammed and it veered toward the German cruiser. The quick thinking of Brinkmann avoided a collision. During a raining squall L\u00fctjens attempted a 180-degree turn to surprise his attackers, but the British radar detected the manoeuvre and withdrew. L\u00fctjens could not shake his pursuers. He believed they possessed a new type of radar as yet unknown to the Germans.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 71\u201372.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 125\u2013133.</ref>\n\n====Tactical command in battle====\n[[File:Absetzman\u00f6ver Bismarck.png|thumb|right|300px|''Bismarck''{{'}}s {{frac|3|4}} clockwise turn on 25 May. L\u00fctjens' tactic was highly successful, shaking free of his pursuers.]]\nIn the early hours of 24 May 1941, ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s hydrophones detected two large ships approaching. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]] in his flagship battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} were heading towards them. It began the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. L\u00fctjens was soon informed that the two ships were enemy heavy units by the size of their superstructure, but remained unaware of their identity until they adjusted their attitude. Confronted with enemy combat vessels, L\u00fctjens turned away, to gain time to think and plan a response to his opponents who were clearly attempting to engage him.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 144.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' first instinct was to attempt to outrun the British ships, scrupulously obeying his orders. He became even more reluctant to accept battle once the lead enemy vessel was identified as ''Hood''. Even after ''Hood'' began to fire on the two ships and it became obvious that an engagement was inevitable, L\u00fctjens was reluctant to return fire. He ordered his chief [[yeoman]] to signal to ''Prinz Eugen'' to open fire on the lead enemy ship, but not ''Bismarck'', much to the exasperation of Captain Lindemann, who had the prospect of suffering another disagreement with the Admiral.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.</ref>\n\nFirst Gunnery Officer [[Adalbert Schneider]], made multiple inquiries to return fire; methodically reporting enemy salvos and asking permission to fire. L\u00fctjens, himself an artillery specialist, waited until the range fell. Moreover, the position of the British placed them at the outer limit of traverse for his main batteries, which were now inclined astern of the ship. L\u00fctjens was also wary of using up heavy shells which were required for raiding operations and a possible future engagement. He could not afford to use up ammunition to register his guns, instead, preferring a closer-range battle. He waited for the optimum moment to fire back.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nSome witnesses testify Captain Lindeman muttered, \"I will not allow my ship to be shot out from under my arse. Open fire!\".<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 78.</ref> Finally L\u00fctjens gave the order to return fire. L\u00fctjens then ordered a turn to port, and [[Crossing the T|crossed Holland's T]], as his opponent turned to bring all the British guns to bear. Shortly before firing, ''Bismarck'' was hit in the forecastle, though ''Prinz Eugen'' had registered hits on ''Hood'' which had started a large series of fires making it easier for the Germans to home in on her position. ''Bismarck'' then targeted ''Hood''.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nL\u00fctjens did not observe the German tactical regulations of the time, to place his weaker cruiser to his battleship's unengaged side and out of range. Instead, he kept her in the line to maximise his firepower even though both German ships were now firing salvos across each other's line-of-fire.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.</ref> Once the odds were reduced, he then ordered her to drop back and use her radar to keep a vigil on the British cruisers, still chasing the German force.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /> Schneider observed the fifth salvo strike ''Hood'' from a range of 17,500 [[yard]]s.<ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\">Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Two splashes were seen. Apparently one or more shells \"bit into\" ''Hood'', seemingly without effect, leading the gunnery officers to believe it was a dud. Moments later ''Hood'' blew up, which caused much excitement on the German ships. L\u00fctjens remained unmoved. The Germans then turned their fire to ''Prince of Wales'', causing seven damaging hits and Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] to retreat to a safe distance.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /><ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\" /><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 85.</ref>\n\nLindemann, guided by the tactical situation, wanted to destroy the damaged ship. He estimated a two- to three-hour chase would be enough.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref> L\u00fctjens, mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary fighting with enemy capital ships, rejected his protests without discussion. L\u00fctjens was suspicious of the intelligence he was receiving, which days earlier had told him ''Hood'' was standing off the coast of [[West Africa]].<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2001, p. 172.</ref> He could no longer be sure of how many more enemy capital ships could be in the area. A time-consuming battle with ''Prince of Wales'' was out of the question, and he proceeded into the vast expanses of the Atlantic, where he could lose his pursuers and have the necessary room to manoeuvre.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\" /><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 145, 150, 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' tactics proved useful in two respects. After the ''Hood'' battle, he steamed directly at his pursuers, forcing them away, while his heavy cruiser escaped out of radar range. On 25 May, his 52nd birthday, despite constant action and exhaustion, he ordered a clever manoeuvre. He ordered full speed and then a three-quarter clockwise turn once his pursuers had reached the extremis of their radar range. The British cruisers had been performing zigzags to avoid German U-boats they believed to be in the vicinity. At the outer edge of their port turn, they would be at the limit of their radar's range. This allowed him to escape the enemy radar, steam in the opposite direction, and then once behind them steam across their wake and avoid enemy attempts to regain contact.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 236\u2013239.</ref>\n\nThe move worked and he evaded the British for a short time. L\u00fctjens then broke radio silence, allowing the British a rough idea of his [[latitude]] but not his [[longitude]]. He continued to believe he was being tracked. Naval Group West informed him to send only tactical radio signals and not risk broadcasting long radio messages to [[Paris]] since they were sure he had broken contact. L\u00fctjens, already distrustful of B-Dienst, disregarded the warnings. Fortunately, not until late evening on 25 May, did the British realise he was heading for [[France]]. By this time L\u00fctjens was well ahead of his pursuers. It proved, however, to be a grave error. Although the British made a number of mistakes in locating her, the intercepted message allowed them to send to air strikes against the ship over the next two days.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 236.</ref><ref>Jackson 2002, p. 90.</ref>\n\n====Leadership in crisis====\nL\u00fctjens radioed [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Berlin]] and all the naval commands concerning the sinking of ''Hood'' continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard ''Prinz Eugen'' Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that L\u00fctjens' insistence on radioing every change of course to the shore commands; then confirmed by a final \"Execute!\" order, was unnecessary and risky. In the morning of the 25 May, his 52nd birthday, L\u00fctjens persisted by sending a long message on the ''Hood'' action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message could do no harm since his position was known to the enemy.<ref>Winklareth 1998. p. 130.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 167.</ref>\n\nThe enemy, Brinkmann thought, could and would glean important intelligence from the most seemingly innocuous messages and consequently his fleet commander was foolish to issue them. At 08:01, once again without consulting Lindemann or Brinkmann, he radioed the Naval High Command his intent to sail to [[St. Nazaire]] and detach his heavy cruiser for commerce operations. No mention of the extent of the damage incurred by ''Bismarck'' was relayed to Germany. The ship was down by the bow, having been hit. The shell had severed the fuel lines to forward fuel tanks by allowing sea water to pour in through the hole located just above the waterline. In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue L\u00fctjens with any orders since they had no information on the state of the task force.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 167\u2013169.</ref>\n[[File:Funknachricht L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|L\u00fctjens' final message, informing the German command of his intention to fight to the last against the enemy.]]\nMeanwhile, L\u00fctjens took stock of his predicament. Firstly, he believed that he was shadowed by a force of ships with superior radar. Secondly, the element of surprise had been lost. Thirdly, the battleship was running low of fuel; his decision not to refuel in Norway or the [[Norwegian Sea]] now became relevant. Fourthly, he thought the force was led by the efficient battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, which he thought was leading him into a trap with an enemy fleet alerted to ''Hood''{{'}}s fate. Fifthly, sea water had slowed him by two knots. His ship had lost some electrical power and salt water was threatening to enter fuel lines and shut down two boilers.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 86.</ref> Lindemann argued for a return via the Denmark Strait to Norway. In his view the ship was too fine a vessel to be risked in another unequal struggle. L\u00fctjens rejected his suggestion. It would take him too close to the [[British Isles]] and expose him to the greatest concentration of enemy sea, air and coastal forces. According to survivors, the animosity between Lindemann and L\u00fctjens was now beginning to extend to their respective staffs.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe reasons for L\u00fctjens' decision to make for France instead of making the shorter journey to Norway remain unknown. It can be surmised he thought the ship would be repaired quickly and a French port was closer to his hunting ground which also precluded another tricky break out via the Denmark Strait. Furthermore, he had asked for a concentration of U-boats south of [[Greenland]] to attack his shadowers. The vast ocean also offered an opportunity to lose his pursuers. However, the perilous fuel situation forced him to abandon the U-Boat option and steam directly for France.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, p. 235.</ref> In light of these developments, L\u00fctjens addressed the crew as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Seamen of the battleship ''Bismarck''! You have covered yourself with glory! The sinking of the battle cruiser ''Hood'' has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of [[UK|Great Britain]]. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released ''Prinz Eugen'' at noon yesterday so that she could conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 104.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSurviving crewmembers of ''Bismarck'' state that they received this message in shock. Rather than harden the resolve of the German crew, the tone of L\u00fctjens' speech implied the ship was in some difficulty and that they may not reach a friendly port. It depressed the mood about the battleship and created uncertainty among all ranks. They interpreted L\u00fctjens' words to mean the ''Admiral'' did not believe they would survive. Lindemann recognised the damage it caused and tried to present a more optimistic view of the situation. He spoke of the U-boats and ''Luftwaffe'' that were gathering to help them home. The speech, an hour later, only partially succeeded in restoring morale. That afternoon L\u00fctjens received messages of best wishes from Hitler and Raeder. The former was short and curt. L\u00fctjens purportedly stuffed the paper into his pocket without comment.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 106.</ref>\n\nA British reconnaissance aircraft sighted ''Bismarck'' in the early morning hours of 26 May by following its [[oil slick]]. At dusk on 26 May, [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo aircraft from HMS ''Ark Royal'' attacked. Although much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders and steering gear. Lindemann was sure the damage could be repaired, but L\u00fctjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage L\u00fctjens compiled a note to the German command and people just 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer ''Bismarck'' somewhat by adjusting the revolution speed of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to {{convert|7|kn|km/h mph|lk=in|abbr=on}} and effectively left it circling in the water.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 116.</ref>\n\nThroughout the night, she was the target of incessant torpedo attacks by {{HMS|Cossack|F03|6}}, {{HMS|Sikh|F82|2}}, {{HMS|Maori|F24|2}}, {{HMS|Zulu|F18|2}}, and {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}} designed to wear down the crew. At this point, the Home Fleet and ''Norfolk'' following from the north were joined by HMS ''Rodney'', while Force H and heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} approached from the south, and light cruiser {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}} from the west. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s low speed and southeasterly heading away from its known pursuers made it very easy for the force to the south to catch up.\n\n==Death==\nL\u00fctjens recognised the gravity of the situation. At 23:58 on 26 May, L\u00fctjens transmitted to ''Group West'', the Naval HQ \"To the ''F\u00fchrer'' of the German ''Reich'', Adolf Hitler. We will fight to the end thinking of you confident as in a rock in the victory of Germany\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\">Jackson 2002, p. 91.</ref> Hitler replied at 01:53 on 27 May: \"I thank you in the name of the whole German nation \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\" Later another message was sent, \"To the crew of the battleship ''Bismarck'': all Germany is with you. What can be done will be done. Your devotion to your duty will strengthen our people in the struggle for their existence \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\"/>\n\nThe mood aboard ''Bismarck'' was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was off duty for some fresh air. He climbed up to the bridge for as long as nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the atmosphere pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of [[Adalbert Schneider]] for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of ''Hood''. L\u00fctjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg's salute. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg also met L\u00fctjens as the Admiral made his way to the bridge. L\u00fctjens returned his salute as he brushed past but said nothing. To M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for ''Bismarck'' had retreated into their own private worlds.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 121\u2013124.</ref> That morning, on the 27 May 1941, L\u00fctjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, L\u00fctjens included: \"Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the ''F\u00fchrer''\".<ref>Jackson 2002, p. 49.</ref> L\u00fctjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard ''Bismarck'' was doomed.<ref>Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 276.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens had been open to criticism for his sycophantic messages to Hitler and his vow to fight to the last against hopeless odds. The authors of the [[Germany and the Second World War|German official history]] have commented it would be unjust to criticise him for being sympathetic to the National Socialist cause or to mark him as an Admiral who saw operations through to the end regardless of the outcome. L\u00fctjens had remained notably aloof from the regime. This aside, he was also steeped in the German officer traditions in which it was inconceivable to abandon a fully battle-ready ship. After the scuttling of the ''[[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Graf Spee]]'', Raeder had ordered all capital ships to fight to the last round if crippled. His messages, according to these historians, should be seen in the context of L\u00fctjens fulfilling his duty. It is unknown whether he or Lindemann considered scuttling the ship to save the crew before the last battle.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, Wegner 2001, pp. 137, 139, 230.</ref>\n\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s alarm sounded for the last time at 08:00 on the morning of 27 May 1941. ''Norfolk'' sighted the ''Bismarck'' at 08:15, and the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire at 08:48. ''Bismarck'' began [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her last stand]] and returned fire at 08:49 against ''Rodney''. {{HMS|King George V|41|2}} fired at ''Bismarck'' soon after and the cruisers ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' engaged with their main armament. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward command position was hit at 08:53, and both forward gun turrets were put out of action at 09:02, killing Adalbert Schneider in the main gun director. The after command position was destroyed at 09:18 and turret ''Dora'' was disabled at 09:24. ''Bismarck'' received further heavy hits at 09:40, resulting in a fire amidships, and turret ''Caesar'' went out of action after a hit at 09:50. Some secondary positions and weapons survived and battled on. All weapons fell silent at 10:00. Short of fuel, ''Rodney'' and ''King George V'' had to disengage prior to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking.\n\n{{location map|North Atlantic| label=''Bismarck'' sunk |position=bottom\n|width=150\n|long=-16.12\n|lat=48.10\n|caption=\n}}\nThe Germans were preparing to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] ''Bismarck'' when three torpedoes fired by ''Dorsetshire'' hit the ship's side armour. ''Bismarck'' sank at 10:36 at position {{Coord|48|10|N|16|12|W}}, roughly {{convert|300|nmi|km mi|abbr=on}} west of Ouessant ([[Ushant]]). The cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' saved 85 men, and the British destroyer ''Maori'' saved another 25. Five sailors were saved by {{GS|U-74|1940|6}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat]], and the weather observation ship {{ship|German weather ship|Sachsenwald||2}}. The ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (U-boat Commander-in-Chief) D\u00f6nitz had ordered {{GS|U-556||2}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Herbert Wohlfarth]], to pick up ''Bismarck''{{'}}s [[war diary]]. Out of torpedoes and low on fuel, Wohlfarth requested that the mission be transferred to ''U-74''. ''U-74'' failed to reach Bismarck in time, and the war diary was never retrieved.<ref>Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr and Steinmetz 1990, volume 2 p. 81.</ref> L\u00fctjens was among those who lost their lives \u2013 probably killed when a {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} salvo fired by ''Rodney'' destroyed the bridge, killing many senior officers.\n\n==Personal life==\nL\u00fctjens married Margarete Backenk\u00f6hler, daughter of the ''[[Geheimrat|Geheimen]] Sanit\u00e4tsrat'' (\"Privy Counselor on Hygiene\", honorary title given to a distinguished doctor) Dr. Gerhard Backenk\u00f6hler, in the summer of 1929.<ref name=\"Uebersch\u00e4r 2011, p. 408\"/> She was 27 at the time of the wedding and the sister of Otto Backenk\u00f6hler. Admiral Otto Backenk\u00f6hler was L\u00fctjens' chief of staff at the Fleet-Command (24 October 1939 \u2013 31 July 1940). A year later, their first son, Gerhard, was born on 31 August 1930 in [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie|Swinem\u00fcnde]]. The marriage produced a second son, named G\u00fcnther after his father, on 28 August 1932 in Berlin. Their daughter Annemarie was born on 27 August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Less than a month after L\u00fctjens' death, his wife gave birth to their fourth child, Peter.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 380\u2013392.</ref><ref name=\"Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392\"/><ref>Rigg and Nicolai 2003, p. 120.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1960 film, ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'', L\u00fctjens (played by [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]]) is portrayed as a stereotypical [[Nazi]], committed to Nazism and crazed in his undaunted belief that the ''Bismarck'' is unsinkable. In reality, L\u00fctjens did not agree with Nazi policies; along with two other navy commanders, he had publicly protested against the brutality of anti-Semitic crimes during [[Kristallnacht]]. He was one of the few officers who refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler visited ''Bismarck'' before its first and final mission, deliberately using instead the traditional naval salute.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 32</ref> He was pessimistic of the chances of success of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s mission and realised that it would be a daunting task.<ref>Asmussen, John.

The ship was christened by Gerda L\u00fctjen's, wife of L\u00fctjens oldest son Gerhard, in [[Bath, Maine]] on 11 August 1967, and was decommissioned in 2003.<ref name=\"bismarck-class.dk\">[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/bismarck/men_involved/luetjens.html Bismarck: A portrait of the Men Involved]</ref> In his christening speech the then [[secretary of state]] at the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Karl Carstens]], stated that L\u00fctjens had set an example of \"unwavering sense of responsibility and devout faithfulness to duty\".<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\">{{Cite web|work=Der Spiegel 35/1967 |title=Mumm haben|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46211719.html| accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nChoosing the name \"L\u00fctjens\" for the newly commissioned destroyer was not without controversy, but the Minister of Defence [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (CDU)|Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] wanted to break the taboo surrounding the heroes of World War II who were not Nazis but who were not associated with the [[20 July plot]], the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler. The former Inspector of the Navy Ruge had feared that L\u00fctjens was not known well enough and had suggested the names ''Adenauer'', ''Berlin'' and ''Rommel'' instead. Schr\u00f6der however wanted to bridge the gap to former traditions and wanted to name the destroyers after former heroes of the three branches of the [[Wehrmacht]] (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'', ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe'').<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/> L\u00fctjens' name had previously been cleared by the [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office]] (''Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt'' or MGFA), formerly in Freiburg im Breisgau. Schr\u00f6der concluded with the words \"We must have the courage like any other people, to honour men who have served their country bravely and faithfully.\"<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/>\n\nFollowing the christening an American worker at the [[Bath Iron Works]] approached and asked the attending German journalists \"do you only have Nazi heroes back home in Germany?\" US newspapers had introduced the namesake as a former Nazi sea hero. Present at the christening was a Bundeswehr helicopter which had been used to shuttle the official German government visitors around, and it bore the insignia of the Bundeswehr, a variant of the Iron Cross. When US radio reporters caught sight of the helicopter they mistakenly referred to the Iron Cross insignia as a [[swastika]] in their reports, thus further adding to the controversy.<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/>\n\n''L\u00fctjens'' was the first of three {{sclass-|L\u00fctjens|destroyer|2}}s. The other two were {{ship|German destroyer|M\u00f6lders||2}}, named after the ''Luftwaffe'' World War II fighter pilot [[Werner M\u00f6lders]], and {{ship|German destroyer|Rommel||2}}, named after the Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]].<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/>\n\n<!-- unsourced\n==Relevant commands==\n* 16 September 1934 \u2013 23 September 1935: Commander of the light cruiser ''Karlsruhe''.\n* 24 September 1935 \u2013 15 March 1936: Chief of Staff Naval Group North in Wilhelmshaven.\n* 16 March 1936 \u2013 7 October 1937: Chief of the officer Personnel Branch at Naval Headquarters (Marinepersonalamt.

It was created by [[Simon Wheeler]] and stars [[Stephen Fry]] as Peter Kingdom, a [[Norfolk]] [[solicitor]] who is coping with family, colleagues, and the strange locals who come to him for legal assistance. The series also starred [[Hermione Norris]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Karl Davies]], [[Phyllida Law]] and [[Tony Slattery]].\n\nThe first series of six one-hour episodes was aired in 2007 and averaged six million viewers per week. Despite a mid-series ratings dip, the executive chairman of ITV praised the programme and ordered a second series, which was filmed in 2007 and broadcast in January and February 2008. Filming on the third series ran from July to September 2008 for broadcast from 7 June 2009.\n\nStephen Fry announced in October 2009 that ITV was cancelling the series, a fact later confirmed by the channel, which said that given tighter budgets, more expensive productions were being cut.<ref>{{cite news|author= Steve Busfield|title= ITV axes Stephen Fry's Kingdom|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/09/stephen-fry-kingdom-itv|work= The Guardian|date= 2009-10-09|accessdate= 2009-10-09 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Series synopses==\n{{see also|List of Kingdom (British TV series) episodes}}\n\nThe series follows Peter Kingdom, a small-town solicitor whose work revolves around cases brought by the eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out before the hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed [[suicide]]. Each week there are further indications that he did not die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman who become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.\n\nSimon returns in the second series and is charged with faking his own death. He is released from custody after Lyle uses Simon's own money to bail him, after Simon reveals he was actually attempting suicide. Beatrice learns that she is pregnant and she leaves Market Shipborough, until the baby is born in the last episode of the series. Lyle threatens to leave Kingdom & Kingdom when his mentor Peter begins to neglect him, but he changes his mind when Peter makes him a partner. In the final episode, a torrential storm hits Market Shipborough, flooding much of the town. While searching for his brother, who drove off the previous night, Peter encounters something unseen by the audience, which is revealed to be Simon's dead body in Series 3.\n\nSeries 3 focuses more on Peter's life, Beatrice and her new baby (Petra), Lyle, and Gloria, the receptionist. Toward the end of the series Peter begins to suffer from small blackouts. He has some minor tests done to find out the cause of the problem. It is revealed in the last episode that Peter has Type 2 diabetes. When Peter asks the doctor whether he should tell Beatrice and Petra to get checked out, the doctor revealed that diabetes isn't the only thing they discovered. In the final scenes Peter reveals that he has found out that he has no blood relation to Beatrice or Simon, and that therefore \"their\" father was not in fact ''his'' father.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Sidney Snell.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Slattery (right) as Sidney Snell during filming of the second series in 2007. To emphasise the character's unkempt nature, his costume is rarely changed.]]\nThe characters are described by Wheeler as \"three families\"; Peter's relations, his colleagues, and the populace of Market Shipborough.<ref name=\"dsannouncement\"/>\n* '''Peter Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Stephen Fry]]''') is [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]-educated  solicitor and one half of Kingdom & Kingdom, a law firm he ran with his father. Peter is respected and regarded as compassionate by the local community. Fry describes him as \"kind and empathetic\", \"on the side of the ordinary people\"<ref name=\"homeandfry\"/> and as being \"lonely and isolated\" and not revealing his true emotions.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Phyllida Law describes Peter as \"into the community like one of those old French village priests\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Tony |last=Padman |title=Phyllida enjoys home comforts in her West Hampstead kingdom |url=http://woodandvale.london24.net/woodandvale/whatson/story.aspx?brand=NorthLondon24&category=whatsonfeatures&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=whatson&itemid=WeED30%20May%202007%2014%3A38%3A33%3A030 |work=Ham and High: Wood and Vale edition |date=2007-05-30 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010031250/http://woodandvale.london24.net/woodandvale/whatson/story.aspx?brand=NorthLondon24&category=whatsonfeatures&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=whatson&itemid=WeED30%20May%202007%2014%3A38%3A33%3A030 |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}</ref>\n* '''Beatrice Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Hermione Norris]]''') is Peter's half-sister, who arrives in the first episode after leaving rehabilitation. She is described by Wheeler as intended to be the \"ultimate annoying little sister\".<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> By series two, she is successfully controlling her mental illness with medication and has become more responsible and reliable. Norris's second pregnancy (with her daughter, Hero) was worked into the series storyline; Beatrice is portrayed as promiscuous in the first series and takes several pregnancy tests in the second series, which all come up positive. Beatrice goes into labour in episode five of the second series and asks Simon to be present at the birth. The identity of Petra's father is initially not known, and Simon tells Peter he \"will totally flip\" when he finds out. It is later revealed her father is a local philandering judge.  Petra is played by twin girls in the third series. Their mother answered a casting call for young twins in a local newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|author= Staff|title= Norfolk twins star in Kingdom TV show|url= http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=NOED19%20Sep%202008%2008%3A15%3A02%3A000|work= Eastern Daily Press|date= 2008-09-19|accessdate= 2008-10-14|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081023140525/http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=NOED19%20Sep%202008%2008%3A15%3A02%3A000|archivedate= 23 October 2008|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Lyle Anderson''' (played by '''[[Karl Davies]]''') is a trainee solicitor at Kingdom & Kingdom during the first series. At the end of the second series, he qualifies, and is offered and accepts a partnership in the practice. Lyle is a somewhat comic character often having bad luck, whether he misses out on a potential relationship or gets hit by a golf ball. The writers created a running joke for the character, where he gets wet in almost every episode, from falling in swimming pools to landing in dikes.\n* '''Gloria Millington''' (played by '''[[Celia Imrie]]''') is a legal secretary who is recovering from the death of her husband a year before the first series.<ref name=\"localhero\">{{cite news |last= McClure|first= Richard|title= Local hero|work= [[What's on TV]]|date= 21\u201327 April 2007|page= 13 }}</ref> She has a young son (played by [[Angus Imrie]], the actress's son) and is \"the sister he (Peter) deserved\" but never had.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Gloria is antagonised by Beatrice during the first series, but the two become friends after a day out together.\n* '''Sidney Snell''' (played by '''[[Tony Slattery]]''') is a smelly local and a frequent client of Peter who often finds ways to sue the local council. Slattery described Snell as an \"everyman anti-hero\", with Wheeler calling him an \"unlikely guardian of Market Shipborough\" on account of his numerous attempts to stop building work.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Snell develops a close friendship with the recently widowed Gloria in the first series. To emphasise his unwashed state, the wardrobe department rotated Snell's costume only once in the first series.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/>\n* '''Aunt Auriel''' (played by '''[[Phyllida Law]]''') is Peter's aunt and confidante. She lives in a retirement home on a large country estate.\n* '''Nigel Pearson''' (played by '''[[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]]''') is introduced in the second series as the captain of Market Shipborough's cricket team. Peter investigates Nigel after discovering he has not honoured sponsorship contracts made with several local businesses. Nigel confides in Peter that his marriage is breaking down - his wife (played by Rachel Fielding) is having an affair with Simon, and he returns the money owed. Nigel returns as a regular cast member in the third series, now working as a relationship counsellor.<ref name=\"s3 start\">{{cite news|title=Stephen Fry returns to his Kingdom |url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3570 |work=[[What's on TV]] |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2008-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001084619/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3570 |archivedate=1 October 2011 }}</ref>\n* '''Simon Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Dominic Mafham]]''') was an unseen character (with the exception of some photographs) in the first series, with the final episode revealing that he had fled to [[Dublin]], apparently to escape large debts. In the second series, he returns to Market Shipborough with his baby son, Daniel, and is charged with faking his own death. Simon has a reputation as a ne'er-do-well, and usually behaves in a self-centered and womanising manner. At the end of the second series, he disappears after fleeing from a Mafia-type gang during a storm. It is revealed at the start of series three that he now really is dead, with the opening scene showing Peter, Beatrice and Auriel standing at his grave.\n\n[[Tom Fisher (actor)|Thomas Fisher]] plays Ted, a local yokel who is the landlord of the local pub and a friend of Sidney Snell. [[Gerard Horan]] plays DC Yelland, who is in charge of prosecuting the Simon Kingdom case but also sometimes appears on other matters. Both Ted and Yelland's roles are expanded in the second series. In the first series, Maryann Turner plays a recurring minor character referred to only as \"Mrs Thing\", whom Peter is constantly trying to avoid. Simon's pregnant partner, Honor O'Sullivan (played by [[Kelly Campbell (actress)|Kelly Campbell]]), is introduced in the final episode of the first series. By the second series she has given birth to baby Daniel and is living with Beatrice and Peter, where she develops an attraction to Lyle. She leaves after Simon returns.\n\nGuest appearances in the first series are made by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] (as Peter's old university tutor in episode four), [[Robert Bathurst]] (as a cross-dressing husband in episode five), [[Lynsey De Paul]] as Sheila Larsen, who drowns in her own swimming pool, [[Joss Ackland]] (as an [[Auschwitz]] survivor in episode six), and [[Rory Bremner]] (as a vicar, also in episode six).<ref name=\"dsseriestwo\"/> Bremner, known more for satire than acting, has joked that he played the vicar \"as\" [[Michael Howard]] and [[Rowan Williams]] and that his character's name was \"Jane\", due to an error in the script.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Wilson returned for the second series, which also includes roles by [[Lucy Benjamin]] and [[Richard Briers]], and [[Diana Quick]].

It was created by [[Simon Wheeler]] and stars [[Stephen Fry]] as Peter Kingdom, a [[Norfolk]] [[solicitor]] who is coping with family, colleagues, and the strange locals who come to him for legal assistance. The series also starred [[Hermione Norris]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Karl Davies]], [[Phyllida Law]] and [[Tony Slattery]].\n\nThe first series of six one-hour episodes was aired in 2007 and averaged six million viewers per week. Despite a mid-series ratings dip, the executive chairman of ITV praised the programme and ordered a second series, which was filmed in 2007 and broadcast in January and February 2008. Filming on the third series ran from July to September 2008 for broadcast from 7 June 2009.\n\nStephen Fry announced in October 2009 that ITV was cancelling the series, a fact later confirmed by the channel, which said that given tighter budgets, more expensive productions were being cut.<ref>{{cite news|author= Steve Busfield|title= ITV axes Stephen Fry's Kingdom|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/09/stephen-fry-kingdom-itv|work= The Guardian|date= 2009-10-09|accessdate= 2009-10-09 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Series synopses==\n{{see also|List of Kingdom (British TV series) episodes}}\n\nThe series follows Peter Kingdom, a small-town solicitor whose work revolves around cases brought by the eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out before the hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed [[suicide]]. Each week there are further indications that he did not die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman who become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.\n\nSimon returns in the second series with his son Daniel, and is charged with faking his own death. He is released from custody after Lyle uses Simon's own money to bail him, and when Simon reveals he was actually attempting suicide. Beatrice learns that she is pregnant, so she leaves Market Shipborough until the baby is born in the last episode of the series. Lyle threatens to leave Kingdom & Kingdom when his mentor Peter begins to neglect him, but he changes his mind when Peter makes him a partner. In the final episode, a torrential storm hits Market Shipborough, flooding much of the town. While searching for his brother, who drove off the previous night, Peter encounters something unseen by the audience, which is revealed to be Simon's dead body in Series 3.\n\nSeries 3 largely steps away from Simon as we are now aware that he has died. Instead, this series focuses more on Peter's life, Beatrice and her new baby (Petra), Lyle, and Gloria, the receptionist. Toward the end of the series Peter begins to suffer from small blackouts. He has some minor tests done to find out the cause of the problem. It is revealed in the last episode that Peter has Type 2 diabetes. When Peter asks the doctor whether he should tell Beatrice and Petra to get checked out, the doctor revealed that diabetes isn't the only thing they discovered. In the final scenes Peter reveals that he has found out that he has no blood relation to Beatrice or Simon, and that therefore \"their\" father was not in fact ''his'' father.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Sidney Snell.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Slattery (right) as Sidney Snell during filming of the second series in 2007.

In the first series, Maryann Turner plays a recurring minor character referred to only as \"Mrs Thing\", whom Peter is constantly trying to avoid. Simon's pregnant partner, Honor O'Sullivan (played by [[Kelly Campbell (actress)|Kelly Campbell]]), is introduced in the final episode of the first series.

He was elected to the Fellowship's executive in 1962.<ref name=cow/> His writings in support of the FFM's perspective included an article on \"The Supply of Doctors\" in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 1961 and another in 1964 in that journal on the rate of medical emigration from Britain and Ireland.<ref>Seale, John R.

Much of the migration from Britain was of [[general practitioner]]s in what was seen in the 1960s as a crisis in general practice. In 1962 he appeared on an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television programme ''[[Questions in the House]]'' with fellow FFM member and member of Parliament Dr [[Donald McIntosh Johnson]] to discuss medical migration.<ref name=cow/>\n\nIn 1962 he undertook a speaking tour of the United States, funded by the [[American Medical Association]], as part of efforts to undermine the [[Kennedy administration]]'s proposed [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] bill. In a speech in New York on 21 May 1962, [[President Kennedy]] criticised Seale's arguments. After seeing this reported in London's ''Evening Standard'', Seale obtained a copy of the speech from the White House and sued the newspaper's publishers for misrepresenting the President's words.<ref name=cow/>\n\nSeale later became influential in health matters with the free-market supporting [[Institute for Economic Affairs]], contributing to their publications such as their occasional paper ''Towards a Welfare Society'' in 1967.<ref name=cow>[https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/26/3/424/2451908 \"Duncan Tanner Essay Prize Winner 2014: Against the 'Sacred Cow': NHS Opposition and the Fellowship for Freedom in Medicine, 1948\u201372\"] Andrew Seaton, ''[[Twentieth Century British History]]'', Vol. 26, No. 3, 1 September 2015, pp. 424\u2013449. doi:10.1093/tcbh/hwv011</ref>\n\n===Views on HIV and AIDS===\nIn the 1980s, Seale advocated the now-discredited theory that [[HIV]], which causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], might have been created in a germ-warfare laboratory by gene-editing and released either deliberately or by accident.<ref name=LATimes/>\n\nIn mid 1985, worried by the implications of the spread of the virus, Seale argued that it had national security implication for the west by potentially diminishing the effectiveness of NATO forces to such an extent that the Soviet Union would not need to use nuclear or chemical weapons to win a war, but he continued to believe that the virus had a natural origin in monkeys.<ref name=disin>Geissler, Erhard, and Robert Hunt Sprinkle.

Drozdov, \"AIDS: Panic Continues\", published in the non-scientific ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'' in Russia in October and December 1985  respectively. Zapevalov argued that the virus might have been produced by scientists working for the U.S. military at [[Fort Detrick]] in Maryland or at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in Atlanta, while Drozdov said that the virus was \"apparently taken out from the deepest regions of Central Africa\" thus raising the possibility that it was deliberately collected.

He was elected to the Fellowship's executive in 1962.<ref name=cow/> His writings in support of the FFM's perspective included an article on \"The Supply of Doctors\" in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 1961 and another in 1964 in that journal on the rate of medical emigration from Britain and Ireland.<ref>Seale, John R. [https://www.bmj.com/content/1/5391/1173 \"Medical Emigration from Great Britain and Ireland\"],  ''British Medical Journal'', 1964, No. 1, pp. 1173\u201378.</ref> He identified migration of British doctors to countries such as Canada due to poor employment conditions in the NHS and migration to Britain of doctors from Asia whose training and English language skills he questioned, adding a racial component to the class-based and economic opposition of some British doctors to the imposition of the NHS system on them by the British government. Much of the migration from Britain was of [[general practitioner]]s in what was seen in the 1960s as a crisis in general practice. In 1962 he appeared on an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television programme ''[[Questions in the House]]'' with fellow FFM member and member of Parliament Dr [[Donald McIntosh Johnson]] to discuss medical migration.<ref name=cow/>\n\nIn 1962 he undertook a speaking tour of the United States, funded by the [[American Medical Association]], as part of efforts to undermine the [[Kennedy administration]]'s proposed [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] bill. In a speech in New York on 21 May 1962, [[President Kennedy]] criticised Seale's arguments. After seeing this reported in London's ''Evening Standard'', Seale obtained a copy of the speech from the White House and sued the newspaper's publishers for misrepresenting the President's words.<ref name=cow/>\n\nSeale later became influential in health matters with the free-market supporting [[Institute for Economic Affairs]], contributing to their publications such as their occasional paper ''Towards a Welfare Society'' in 1967.<ref name=cow>[https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/26/3/424/2451908 \"Duncan Tanner Essay Prize Winner 2014: Against the 'Sacred Cow': NHS Opposition and the Fellowship for Freedom in Medicine, 1948\u201372\"] Andrew Seaton, ''[[Twentieth Century British History]]'', Vol. 26, No. 3, 1 September 2015, pp. 424\u2013449. doi:10.1093/tcbh/hwv011</ref>\n\n===Views on HIV and AIDS===\nIn the 1980s, Seale advocated the now-discredited theory that [[HIV]], which causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], might have been created in a germ-warfare laboratory by gene-editing and released either deliberately or by accident.<ref name=LATimes/>\n\nIn mid 1985, worried by the implications of the spread of the virus, Seale argued that it had national security implication for the west by potentially diminishing the effectiveness of NATO forces to such an extent that the Soviet Union would not need to use nuclear or chemical weapons to win a war, but he continued to believe that the virus had a natural origin in monkeys.<ref name=disin>Geissler, Erhard, and Robert Hunt Sprinkle.

Drozdov, \"AIDS: Panic Continues\", published in the non-scientific ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'' in Russia in October and December 1985  respectively. Zapevalov argued that the virus might have been produced by scientists working for the U.S. military at [[Fort Detrick]] in Maryland or at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in Atlanta, while Drozdov said that the virus was \"apparently taken out from the deepest regions of Central Africa\" thus raising the possibility that it was deliberately collected.
