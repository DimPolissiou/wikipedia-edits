After a brilliant university career in the city, he began in 1828 to contribute to the ''[[Journal des D\u00e9bats]]'', on the staff of which he remained for nearly half a century. After the [[July Revolution]] and the accession of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] as ''[[List of French monarchs|King of the French]]'' (the [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberal]] ''[[July Monarchy]]''), he was appointed professor of history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and ''master of requests'' in the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]. Soon afterwards he exchanged his chair of history for one of poetry, continuing to contribute political articles to the ''Journal des D\u00e9bats'', and sitting as deputy in the Chamber from 1835 to 1848.\n\nIn 1833, he was charged with a mission to study [[German Confederation|German]] [[Education in Germany|methods of education]], and issued a report advocating the necessity of newer methods and of technical instruction.

The author examined dramatic passions, discussing the mode in which they are treated in ancient and modern drama, poetry and romance.

Poor eyesight was an obstacle to his pursuit of a career within the navy but after a spiritual conversion experience he entered the Faculty for Theology in Paris and in 1905 was ordained a pastor of the Reformed Church of France. After having been a Protestant [[pastor]] in a rural parish in Aouste-sur-Sye in [[Dr\u00f4me]], in 1911 he became professor of theology at the House of the Missions of Paris, and in 1918 went on to the Parish of Poissy-Annonciation where he remained until 1952. In 1928, he inaugurated the sermons of Protestant Lent on the radio, which contributed to his notoriety. There he preached on the [[oikoumene|unity of Christians]]. In 1929, he became the first president of the [[Protestant Federation of France]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration protestante de France''), a position he held until 1961. In 1938 he became the first president of the national council of the [[Reformed Church of France]] (''l'\u00c9glise r\u00e9form\u00e9e de France''), a post he held until 1950. He was on two occasions the professor at the Academy of International Law at The Hague. Between 1938 and 1948 he was president of the administrative committee of the provisional [[World Council of Churches]] in formation. After the council had been formed he became one of its co-presidents, a post he held until 1954.\n\nBoegner actively worked, during the occupation, in an open way as well as clandestinely, to try to improve the lot of the Jews, and even defended and saved a number of them. His compassion extended also to many political refugees. He intervened with Pierre Laval, in vain, to ask him to give up including Jewish children younger than 16 years in the deportation convoys. In 1943, he condemned the forced sending of workers to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under the [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]]. Against violence and the armed struggle, he let his faith and conscience choose against joining the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] in an early stage. His action to help the Jews during the war made him be awarded the [[Righteous among the Nations]] in [[Yad Vashem]] in 1988.\n\nHaving met six times, in the middle of his resistance work, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], he was decorated with the [[Order of the Francisque]] and was named a member of the National Council of [[Vichy France|Vichy]]. He remained, at the time of his questioning in the Allied lawsuit against the old leader, on 30 July 1945, to testify for the good intentions and the goodwill expressed by P\u00e9tain in the difficult circumstances of France - a lenient idea of P\u00e9tain's actions, today contradicted by authors and some historians.\n\nAfter the war, he continued his fight for unity while taking part in the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]] (''mouvement \u0153cum\u00e9nique''). He was also a Protestant observer during the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965) during which he staged a public dialogue with [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Bea]] in Geneva. He also met [[Pope Paul V1]]. The ecumenical movement is the subject of his last book published in 1968 (''The Long Road to Unity'', Eng. trans. 1970).\n\nBoegner died in Paris.\n\n==Works==\n*''Les Cat\u00e9chismes de Calvin, \u00e9tude d'histoire et de cat\u00e9ch\u00e9tique'', th\u00e8se de doctorat soutenue devant la facult\u00e9 de th\u00e9ologie protestante en 1905\n*''The Unity of the Church'' (1914)\n*''La Vie et la pens\u00e9e de T.

Poor eyesight was an obstacle to his pursuit of a career within the navy but after a spiritual conversion experience he entered the Faculty for Theology in Paris and in 1905 was ordained a pastor of the Reformed Church of France. After having been a Protestant [[pastor]] in a rural parish in Aouste-sur-Sye in [[Dr\u00f4me]], in 1911 he became professor of theology at the House of the Missions of Paris, and in 1918 went on to the Parish of Poissy-Annonciation where he remained until 1952. In 1928, he inaugurated the sermons of Protestant Lent on the radio, which contributed to his notoriety. There he preached on the [[oikoumene|unity of Christians]]. In 1929, he became the first president of the [[Protestant Federation of France]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration protestante de France''), a position he held until 1961. In 1938 he became the first president of the national council of the [[Reformed Church of France]] (''l'\u00c9glise r\u00e9form\u00e9e de France''), a post he held until 1950. He was on two occasions the professor at the Academy of International Law at The Hague. Between 1938 and 1948 he was president of the administrative committee of the provisional [[World Council of Churches]] in formation. After the council had been formed he became one of its co-presidents, a post he held until 1954.\n\nBoegner actively worked, during the occupation, in an open way as well as clandestinely, to try to improve the lot of the Jews, and even defended and saved a number of them. His compassion extended also to many political refugees. He intervened with Pierre Laval, in vain, to ask him to give up including Jewish children younger than 16 years in the deportation convoys. In 1943, he condemned the forced sending of workers to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under the [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]]. Against violence and the armed struggle, he let his faith and conscience choose against joining the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] in an early stage. His action to help the Jews during the war made him be awarded the [[Righteous among the Nations]] in [[Yad Vashem]] in 1988.\n\nHaving met six times, in the middle of his resistance work, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], he was decorated with the [[Order of the Francisque]] and was named a member of the National Council of [[Vichy France|Vichy]]. He remained, at the time of his questioning in the Allied lawsuit against the old leader, on 30 July 1945, to testify for the good intentions and the goodwill expressed by P\u00e9tain in the difficult circumstances of France - a lenient idea of P\u00e9tain's actions, today contradicted by authors and some historians.\n\nAfter the war, he continued his fight for unity while taking part in the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]] (''mouvement \u0153cum\u00e9nique''). He was also a Protestant observer during the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965) during which he staged a public dialogue with [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Bea]] in Geneva. He also met [[Pope Paul V1]]. The ecumenical movement is the subject of his last book published in 1968 (''The Long Road to Unity'', Eng. trans. 1970).\n\nBoegner died in Paris.\n\n==Works==\n*''Les Cat\u00e9chismes de Calvin, \u00e9tude d'histoire et de cat\u00e9ch\u00e9tique'', th\u00e8se de doctorat soutenue devant la facult\u00e9 de th\u00e9ologie protestante en 1905\n*''The Unity of the Church'' (1914)\n*''La Vie et la pens\u00e9e de T.

He authored numerous books and articles advancing a [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory]].\n\nL\u00e9on de Poncins' explanation for most of the major [[revolutionary movements|revolutionary political upheavals]] of [[modernity]] was the influence of certain [[secret societies]] with an [[anti-Christian]] agenda \u2014 as well as a \"occult war\" waged by those possessing a diabolical kind of \"faith\".\n\n==Biography==\nBorn Gabriel L\u00e9on Marie Pierre de Montaigne de Poncins in [[Civens]], [[Loire (department)|Loire]]. He was descended of an aristocratic family [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1696.\n\nHis writings enjoyed some prominence in the 1930s (many of his works were translated into [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). L\u00e9on de Poncins contributed to many newspapers like ''[[Le Jour]]'', ''[[Le Figaro]]'', ''[[L'Ami du peuple]]'', and ''[[Le Nouvelliste (Valais)|Le Nouvelliste]]''; he also directed the journal ''[[Contre-R\u00e9volution]]'' (''Counter-Revolution'') from 1937 to 1939.\n\nL\u00e9on de Poncins was a devout [[Catholic]] and [[counter-revolutionary]]. His writings show [[anti-Jewish]], [[anti-Communist]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]], and [[anti-progressive]] views. Until his death, in [[Toulon]], he denounced the occult forces and organizations that ruled the world and sought to poison Christianity.\n\n==Views==\n\n===Influence of secret societies===\nIn his writings, he denounced [[Masonic conspiracies]] (pointing out the relationship between [[History of Freemasonry in France#Revolution|Freemasonry and the French Revolution]], the [[League of Nations]], etc.), and the Jewish influence in Catholic affairs.\n\nHis work was seen as a continuation of the ''[[Revue Internationale des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Secr\u00e8tes]]'' ([''International Review of Secret Societies'']), whose primary editor was [[Mgr.]] [[Ernest Jouin]] (1844\u20131932).\n\nL\u00e9on de Poncins was a friend of [[Emmanuel Malynski]] (died 1938)\u2014 with whom he wrote ''La Guerre occulte'' (''The Occult War'')<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Edouard|title=Emmanuel Malynski, m\u00e9taphysicien de la Guerre occulte|journal=R\u00e9fl\u00e9chir et Agir|date=Autumn 2004|issue=18|pages=48\u201349}}</ref>\u2014 and [[Jean Vaqui\u00e9]] (1911\u20131992), with whom he wrote in the journals ''Lectures fran\u00e7aises'' and ''Lecture et Tradition'', and for the [[Chir\u00e9-en-Montreuil]]-based publishing house [[\u00c9ditions de Chir\u00e9]].

In 1916\u2014 at a time when [[Germany]] triumphed on all fronts and the [[United Kingdom|British]] planned to sign an [[armistice]] then advanced by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]]\u2014 Zionists secured a promise of Palestine (then under the domination of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) as a Jewish settlement  from the government of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in exchange for the [[United States]]' entry into the war alongside the [[Triple Entente]]. To corroborate his thesis, L\u00e9on de Poncins cited ''Great Britain, The Jews and Palestine'', a 1936 book by pro-Zionist author, [[Samuel Landman]].\n\n===On Vatican II===\nDuring the [[Second Vatican Council]], following the vote on 20 November 1964, at the third session of the provisional scheme dealing with [[Relations between Catholicism and Judaism|the Church's attitude towards Judaism]], L\u00e9on de Poncins wrote a pamphlet, ''Le Probl\u00e8me juif face au Concile'' ([''The Jewish Question Facing the Council'']),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Held|first1=George F.|title=L\u00e9on de Poncins: The Problem with the Jews at the Council, Part I|url=http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/07/leon-de-poncins-the-problem-with-the-jews-at-the-council-part-i/|website=[[The Occidental Observer]]|accessdate=2 March 2016|date=23 July 2013}} [http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/07/leon-de-poncins-the-problem-with-the-jews-at-the-council-part-ii/ Part II], [http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/08/leon-de-poncins-the-problem-with-the-jews-at-the-council-part-iii/ Part III], and [http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/08/20262/ Part IV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307113027/http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/08/20262/ |date=2016-03-07 }}</ref> which was distributed to the [[bishops]] before the fourth and final session.

He authored numerous books and articles advancing a [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory]].\n\nL\u00e9on de Poncins' explanation for most of the major [[revolutionary movements|revolutionary political upheavals]] of [[modernity]] was the influence of certain [[secret societies]] with an [[anti-Christian]] agenda \u2014 as well as a \"occult war\" waged by those possessing a diabolical kind of \"faith\".\n\n==Biography==\nBorn Gabriel L\u00e9on Marie Pierre de Montaigne de Poncins in [[Civens]], [[Loire (department)|Loire]]. He was descended of an aristocratic family [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1696.\n\nHis writings enjoyed some prominence in the 1930s (many of his works were translated into [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). L\u00e9on de Poncins contributed to many newspapers like ''[[Le Jour]]'', ''[[Le Figaro]]'', ''[[L'Ami du peuple]]'', and ''[[Le Nouvelliste (Valais)|Le Nouvelliste]]''; he also directed the journal ''[[Contre-R\u00e9volution]]'' (''Counter-Revolution'') from 1937 to 1939.\n\nL\u00e9on de Poncins was a devout [[Catholic]] and [[counter-revolutionary]]. His writings show [[anti-Jewish]], [[anti-Communist]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]], and [[anti-progressive]] views. Until his death, in [[Toulon]], he denounced the occult forces and organizations that ruled the world and sought to poison Christianity.\n\n==Views==\n\n===Influence of secret societies===\nIn his writings, he denounced [[Masonic conspiracies]] (pointing out the relationship between [[History of Freemasonry in France#Revolution|Freemasonry and the French Revolution]], the [[League of Nations]], etc.), and the Jewish influence in Catholic affairs.\n\nHis work was seen as a continuation of the ''[[Revue Internationale des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Secr\u00e8tes]]'' ([''International Review of Secret Societies'']), whose primary editor was [[Mgr.]] [[Ernest Jouin]] (1844\u20131932).\n\nL\u00e9on de Poncins was a friend of [[Emmanuel Malynski]] (died 1938)\u2014 with whom he wrote ''La Guerre occulte'' (''The Occult War'')<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Edouard|title=Emmanuel Malynski, m\u00e9taphysicien de la Guerre occulte|journal=R\u00e9fl\u00e9chir et Agir|date=Autumn 2004|issue=18|pages=48\u201349}}</ref>\u2014 and [[Jean Vaqui\u00e9]] (1911\u20131992), with whom he wrote in the journals ''Lectures fran\u00e7aises'' and ''Lecture et Tradition'', and for the [[Chir\u00e9-en-Montreuil]]-based publishing house [[\u00c9ditions de Chir\u00e9]]. L\u00e9on de Poncins wrote the preface to Vaqui\u00e9's ''La R\u00e9volution Liturgique'' ([''The Liturgical Revolution'']).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vaqui\u00e9|first1=Jean|title=La r\u00e9volution liturgique|date=1971|publisher=Diffusion de la Pens\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise|location=[[Chir\u00e9-en-Montreuil]]|url=http://www.a-c-r-f.com/documents/VAQUIE-Revolution_liturgique.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2016|language=French}}</ref>\n\n[[Julius Evola]] translated ''La Guerre occulte'' into [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Malinsky|first1=Emmanuel|author2=L\u00e9on de Poncins|title=La guerra occulta: armi e fasi dell'attacco ebraico-massonico alla tradizione europea|date=1939|publisher=U.

In 1916\u2014 at a time when [[Germany]] triumphed on all fronts and the [[United Kingdom|British]] planned to sign an [[armistice]] then advanced by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]]\u2014 Zionists secured a promise of Palestine (then under the domination of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) as a Jewish settlement  from the government of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in exchange for the [[United States]]' entry into the war alongside the [[Triple Entente]]. To corroborate his thesis, L\u00e9on de Poncins cited ''Great Britain, The Jews and Palestine'', a 1936 book by pro-Zionist author, [[Samuel Landman]].\n\n===On Vatican II===\nDuring the [[Second Vatican Council]], following the vote on 20 November 1964, at the third session of the provisional scheme dealing with [[Relations between Catholicism and Judaism|the Church's attitude towards Judaism]], L\u00e9on de Poncins wrote a pamphlet, ''Le Probl\u00e8me juif face au Concile'' ([''The Jewish Question Facing the Council'']),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Held|first1=George F.|title=L\u00e9on de Poncins: The Problem with the Jews at the Council, Part I|url=http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/07/leon-de-poncins-the-problem-with-the-jews-at-the-council-part-i/|website=[[The Occidental Observer]]|accessdate=2 March 2016|date=23 July 2013}} [http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/07/leon-de-poncins-the-problem-with-the-jews-at-the-council-part-ii/ Part II], [http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/08/leon-de-poncins-the-problem-with-the-jews-at-the-council-part-iii/ Part III], and [http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/08/20262/ Part IV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307113027/http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/08/20262/ |date=2016-03-07 }}</ref> which was distributed to the [[bishops]] before the fourth and final session. The author noted \"by the Council Fathers a profound misunderstanding of what constitutes the essence of Judaism.\" L\u00e9on de Poncins' advice had a significant effect on the drafting of ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', adopted on 28 October 1965.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laurigan|first1=Michel|title=Vatican II : Du \" mythe de la substitution \" \u00e0 la religion noachide|journal=Sel de la terre|date=Autumn 2003|issue=46|url=http://www.nostra-aetate.org/Bibliotheque/2003-10_SDT_Michel-LAURIGAN_Vatican%20II_Du-Mythe-de-la-substitution-a-la-religion-noachide_12p.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He is known as an exponent of [[fascism]] and virulent [[antisemitism|antisemite]] but also as the author of ''Les Deux \u00e9tendards'', regarded by some as one of the greatest novels of the post-war era.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRebatet was born and died in [[Moras-en-Valloire]], [[Dr\u00f4me]].  As a young man, Rebatet was educated in [[Saint-Chamond, Loire]]. From 1923 to 1927 he studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], after which he became an insurance agent. It was only in 1929 that he began his career as a writer, becoming a music and film critic (the latter under the pseudonym '''Fran\u00e7ois Vinneuil''') for the [[far right]] [[Integralism|integralist]] ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' newspaper. In 1932 Rebatet became a contributor to the right-wing newspaper ''[[Je suis partout]]'', for which he wrote until the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] liberation in 1944. In 1938 he became head of information for Action Fran\u00e7aise and worked closely with the movement's founder, [[Charles Maurras]].\n\nLong before the outbreak of war between France and [[Nazi Germany]], Rebatet expressed sympathy for [[Nazism|National Socialism]], notably in his articles for ''Je suis partout'' (\"I Am Everywhere\"), in which he accused [[Jews]] of fomenting a war to topple [[Adolf Hitler]]\u2019s r\u00e9gime. In 1940 he was drafted into the [[French Army]] and, although he served, openly hoped for a \"''short and disastrous war for France''\".\n\n===Collaboration===\nAfter the [[fall of France]] he became a radio reporter for the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. He soon left this post, as well as Action Fran\u00e7aise, to join [[Jacques Doriot]]'s newspaper ''[[Cri Du Peuple]]'', and to continue his writings for ''Je suis partout''.\n\nIn 1942 Rebatet published a lengthy [[pamphlet]] entitled ''[[Les D\u00e9combres]]'' (\"The Ruins\"), in which he traced the forces he believed to have led France to its fall. He firmly accused [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]] politicians and its military leadership, as well as French Jews - who he claimed were the prime cause of France's political and military woes. ''Les D\u00e9combres'' is the clearest expression of Rebatet's fascism, as well as his most virulently antisemitic work. The same year, he began writing ''[[Les Deux \u00e9tendards]]'' (\"The Two Standards\"), his first novel.\n\nIn August 1944 Rebatet fled France for Germany, travelling to the [[Sigmaringen enclave]] (place of refuge for Vichy authorities as well as the more famous French writer, [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]]). It was in Sigmaringen that Rebatet completed ''Les Deux \u00e9tendards'', which would be published in 1952 by [[Gallimard]]. He was arrested in Austria in 1945.\n\n===After the war===\nRebatet was sent back to France and, in 1946, received a [[death sentence]], which was commuted to [[Penal labour|forced labor]] the next year. Released from prison in 1952, he returned to journalism in 1953, becoming the director of the literary section of ''[[Dimanche Matin]]''. In 1954, Gallimard published Rebatet's second novel, ''[[Les Epis M\u00fbrs]]'' (\"The Ripe Grains\"). His final work was a history of music which he began writing in 1965, and which was published by [[Laffont]] in 1969.\n\nAlthough Rebatet continued to proclaim his adherence to fascism until his death, his antisemitism became less pronounced after the war{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, showing even admiration for the state of Israel.<ref>http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2014/07/28/01002-20140728ARTFIG00036--l-extreme-droite-etait-pro-israelienne-jusqu-a-la-guerre-du-kippour.php</ref>\n\nDespite his controversial biography, there are those, such as [[George Steiner]], who claim that Lucien Rebatet was a great writer, and that ''Les Deux \u00e9tendards'' in particular deserves to be considered an important novel in French literary history.\n\n==Cultural references==\n*Rebatet is depicted in [[Jonathan Littell]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Les Bienveillantes]]'', where he is a friend of the main character Maximilian Aue.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rebatet, Lucien}}\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:1972 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Dr\u00f4me]]\n[[Category:French art critics]]\n[[Category:French collaborators with Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:French fascists]]\n[[Category:French journalists]]\n[[Category:French literary critics]]\n[[Category:French political writers]]\n[[Category:People affiliated with Action Fran\u00e7aise]]\n[[Category:French military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:French anti-communists]]\n[[Category:20th-century French novelists]]\n[[Category:French male essayists]]\n[[Category:French male novelists]]\n[[Category:French prisoners sentenced to death]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by France]]\n[[Category:20th-century French essayists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name    =Lucien Rebatet\n| other_names =\n| image    =Rebatet librairie.jpg\n| image_size  = 225px\n| caption   =\n|birth_date       = 15 November 1903\n|birth_place      = [[Moras-en-Valloire]], France\n|death_date       = {{death date and age|df=yes|1972|08|24|1903|11|15}}\n|death_place      = Moras-en-Valloire, France\n| death_cause =\n| known    =\n| occupation = journalist, author\n| religion  =\n| spouse   =\n| partner   =\n| children  =\n| relations  =\n| influences =\n| influenced =\n}}\n\n{{French literature sidebar}}\n\n'''Lucien Rebatet''' (15 November 1903 \u2013 24 August 1972) was a French author, journalist, and intellectual.
