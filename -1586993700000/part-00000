Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC).

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B.

Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R.

The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ...

In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n!

The genre would go on to become one of the most popular genres of [[electronic dance music]], becoming international and spawning multiple different derivatives and subgenres.\n\n==Beginnings in the UK==\nDrum and bass began as a musical [[paradigm shift]] of the United Kingdom [[breakbeat hardcore]] and [[rave]] scene of the mid 1990s; and over the first decade and a half of its existence there have been many permutations in its style, incorporating elements from [[dancehall]], [[Electro music|electro]], [[funk]], [[hip hop]], [[House music|house]], [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]]-created fusion of hardcore, house and [[techno]] (also including [[new beat]]). This scene existed briefly from approximately 1989-1993, a period of cross-pollination in the UK hardcore sound. This sound did survive in various forms in its mother countries - primarily Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany - beyond 1992, but by then the general scenes in these countries had moved forwards to trance, [[industrial techno]] or [[Gabber|gabba]] (with [[happy hardcore]]/[[hard house]] being the equivalent 'Belgian Techno' - derivative sounds in the UK). London and Bristol are the two cities which are most associated with Drum and Bass.\n\nReturning to the UK, drum and bass (as jungle) has its direct origins in the breakbeat hardcore part of the UK acid house rave scene. Hardcore DJs typically played their records at fast tempos, and breakbeat hardcore emphasised breakbeats over the [[Four to the floor|4-to-the-floor]] beat structure common to house music. [[Breakbeat hardcore]] records such as [[The Prodigy]]'s \"Experience\" (1992) [[Top Buzz]] 'Jungle Techno!' (1991), [[A Guy Called Gerald]]'s 'Anything' (1991), [[Shut Up and Dance (band)|Shut Up and Dance]]'s \"\u00a310 to get in\" / \"\u00a320 to get in\" (both 1989), the [[Ragga Twins]]' \"Spliffhead\" (1990) & '18&nbsp;Inch Speaker' (1991), [[Rebel MC]]'s 'Wickedest Sound' (1990), 'Coming On Strong' (1990), 'Tribal Bass' (1991) & 'African' (1991) [[Nightmares on Wax]]'s 'Aftermath' & 'In Two Minds' (1990), [[Genaside II]]'s \"Sirens of Acre Lane\" (1990), [[DJ Dextrous]]' \"Ruffneck Biznizz\" (1992), [[Noise Factory]]'s 'Be Free' (1992), [[Demon Boyz]] 'Jungle Dett' (1992) and [[LTJ Bukem]]'s \"Demon's Theme\" (1992) are generally credited as being among the first to have a recognizable drum and bass sound.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/Top-Buzz-Top-Buzz-EP/release/223969 | title = \"Top Buzz - Jungle Techno!\". listing on Discogs\"| accessdate = April 5, 2010 }}</ref><ref>http://junglistnetwork.com/interview-with-mad-p-by-kaspa/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/genaside-ii-mn0000192323</ref>\n<ref>https://techno-dads.com/2011/10/12/dad-trax-genaside-ii-narra-mine/</ref>\n<ref>https://herecomethedrums.com/2015/02/10/straight-from-the-bedroom/comment-page-1/</ref>\n<ref>http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com/2016/12/jungle-techno.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.popmatters.com/nightmares-on-wax-now-isthetime-2495648705.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/history%20of%20jungle%20drum%20and%20bass.htm</ref> \n<ref>http://www.brainwashed.com/mbm/</ref> \n<ref>https://thequietus.com/articles/05135-jack-dangers-interview-meat-beat-manifesto</ref><ref>http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.12.98/meatbeatman-9845.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.insomniac.com/music/meat-beat-manifesto-helter-skelter/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.clashmusic.com/features/hackney-soldiers-the-birth-of-jungle</ref> \n<ref>https://jungleunity.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/legends-in-the-dance-ragga-twins-interview/</ref>\n<ref>http://welovejungle.com/interviews/we-love-jungle-presents-an-interview-with-ragga-twins/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/04/congo-natty-jungle-revolution-rebel-mc</ref><ref>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ae8nw8/a-guy-called-gerald-interview</ref>\n<ref>http://welovejungle.com/interviews/an-interview-with-paul-ibiza-on-the-birth-of-jungle/</ref>\n\nSome hardcore tracks at the time were extremely light and upbeat; the most extreme examples of this were the so-called \"toy-town\" tracks such as [[Smart E's]]' \"Sesame's Treat\" which features the children's show \"[[Sesame Street]]\" theme song. A style of hardcore with light and upbeat sounds and a predominant kick drum, with less emphasis on breakbeats, would many years later be known as [[happy hardcore]]. These were particularly prominent in the summer of 1992 when hardcore crossed over commercially in the UK and its charts.\n\nIn response to these lighter tracks, some producers started focusing on darker, more aggressive sounds; this style became known as darkside hardcore, or [[Darkcore]]. Strange noises and effects, syncopated rhythms made from rearranged funk [[Break (music)|breaks]] and loud bass lines defined the genre. Examples of darkcore include [[Goldie]]'s \"Terminator\" (1992), [[Doc Scott]]'s \"Here Come The Drumz\", and [[Top Buzz]]'s \"Living In Darkness\" (1992). These took their cue from the darker sounds of 'Belgian Techno', as found in tracks such as Beltram's \"Mentasm\" and \"Energy Flash\" (1991), as well as the dark breaks of [[4 Hero]]'s \"Mr Kirks Nightmare\" (1990) among others. These tracks were not widely called jungle or drum and bass by the mainstream media at their time of creation (although the terms \"hardcore jungle\" and \"jungle techno\" were in common use in the rave scene by then, with \"drum & bass\" appearing here and there on particular mixes of several vinyl releases), but they can nevertheless be found on later jungle and drum and bass compilations. The first major round-up of these tracks which was to use the term 'drum & bass' was probably \"The Dark Side - Hardcore Drum & Bass Style\": a compilation on React Records, released March 1993, which featured both \"Here Comes The Drumz\" and \"Terminator\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/29177 | title = Discogs information - Euphoreal - The Jungle Tekno EP| accessdate = May 2, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/84349 | title = Discogs information - Noise Factory - Loving You / Jungle Techno| accessdate = May 3, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/1186 | title = Discogs information - Manix - Hardcore Junglism| accessdate = May 3, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/39946 | title = Discogs information - Various - Jungle Tekno Volume One| accessdate = May 2, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/26193 | title = Discogs information The Prodigy - Charly (trip into drum & bass version)| accessdate = May 7, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"Fabio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=273 |title=Red Bull Academy Interview Fabio - The Root To The Shoot |accessdate=September 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217174942/http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=273 |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"Popular\">{{cite web | url = http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/missingham.html | title = \"Popular Musicology On Line Article \"Big Tings Ah Gwan\": Junglist Music Takes Centre Stage, An Introduction to Jungle Music And An Enquiry Into Its Impact On The London Jazz Scene\" | accessdate = September 4, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120216142603/http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/missingham.html | archive-date = February 16, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThis darker, more aggressive sound appealed to many in the dancehall and reggae communities. A shared emphasis on rhythm and bass, and the tempos were well suited to be mixed together. Soon many elements of dancehall reggae were being incorporated into the hardcore sound, and a precursor to what would become known as simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] was sometimes dubbed [[hardcore jungle]]. The Jamaican sound-system culture began to influence the emerging sound through the use of basslines and remixing techniques derived from [[Dub music|dub]] and reggae music, alongside the fast breakbeats and samples derived from urban musics such as hip hop, funk, jazz, and r&b alongside many production techniques borrowed from early electronic music such as house, and techno.\n\nAs the yet unnamed genre evolved, the use of sampled funk breakbeats became increasingly complex. Most notable and widely spread is the [[Amen break]] taken from a b-side funk track \"Amen, Brother\" by the Winston Brothers ([[The Winstons]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac |title=Video explanation of the Amen Break on youtube |accessdate=September 6, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QUHKCCXv?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac |archivedate=July 21, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> During this time producers began cutting apart loops and using the component drum sounds to create new rhythms. To match the complex drum lines, basslines which had less in common with the patterns of house and techno music than with the phrasings of dub and hip hop began to be used. As the beat-per-minute range rose above 165, the emerging drum and bass sound became incompatible for straightforward DJ mixing with house and techno, which typically range dozens of beats-per-minute less (making it impossible to play the tracks at the same speed on club equipment). This sonic identity became highly distinctive for both the depth of its bass and the increasingly complex, rapid-fire breakbeat percussion. Vastly different rhythmic patterns were distinctively being used, as well as new types of sampling, synthesis and effects processing techniques, resulting in a greater focus on the intricacies of sampling/synthesis production and rhythm. This notably included early use of the [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching]] effect which was often used on percussion or vocal samples. As the influences of reggae and dub became more prominent, the sound of drum and bass began to take on an urban sound which was heavily influenced by ragga and dancehall music as well as hip hop, often incorporating the distinctive vocal styles of these musical genres. This reggae/dancehall influenced sound is most commonly associated with the term jungle.\n{{Listen\n|filename=A Guy Called Gerald 28 Gun Bad Boy.ogg\n|title=A Guy Called Gerald \"28 Gun Bad Boy\" (1992)\n|description=30&nbsp;second sample illustrating the combination of basslines, broken beats, rave melody and aesthetics.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nParticular tracks from the 1992 - 1993 period that demonstrated some of the beat and sampling progression within drum and bass include: [[A Guy Called Gerald]]'s \"[[28 Gun Bad Boy]]\", Bizzy B \"{{sic|hide=y|Ecs|tacy}} is a Science\" (1993) and Danny Breaks / Droppin Science \"Droppin Science vol 1\" (1993).

References to 'jungle', 'junglists' and 'jungle music' can be found throughout dub, reggae and dancehall genres from that era up until today. It has been suggested that the term 'junglist' was a reference to a person either from a section of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Trenchtown]] also known as 'the Concrete Jungle' or from a different area, 'the Gardens', which was a leafy area colloquially referred to as 'the Jungle'. The first documented use of the term in drum and bass is within a song featuring jungle producer and lyricist Rebel MC - \"Rebel got this chant alla the junglists\".\n\n===Junglists===\n{{main|Junglist}}\n\nThe appearance of jungle also resulted in the appearance of the [[junglist]] subculture, which, while not nearly as distinctive, alienated, ideological or obvious as other youth subcultures, and having many similarities with hip hop styles and behaviour, does function distinctively within the drum and bass listening community. Many drum and bass listeners would and do refer to themselves as junglists, regardless of their attitude on whether jungle differs from drum and bass (see below).<ref name=\"Popular\"/>\n\n==Jungle to drum and bass==\nThe phrase \"drum and bass\" was sometimes used in the seventies to name dub versions of reggae songs. With titles on b-sides of 7 inches, like 'Drum and bass by King Tubby's'. Also you can hear the phrase in reggae songs from artists like Jah Tomas with the often sampled phrase 'strictly drum and bass make you wind up your waist'. Or in album titles, like 'Show Case (In a Roots Radics Drum and Bass)' from Tristan Palmer.\nThe phrase \"drum and bass\" had also been used for years previously in the London soul and funk pirate radio scenes and was even a bit of a catchphrase for UK [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Trevor Nelson]] in his pirate days, who used it to describe the deeper, rougher funk and \"rare groove\" sound that was popular in London at the time. A station ID jingle used on London pirate [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]] from the late 1980s would proclaim \"drum and bass style on Kiss\".\n{{Listen\n|filename=McConrad1994DrumAndBass.ogg\n|title=LTJ Bukem with MC Conrad at Dreamscape\n|description=Shortly after midnight on New Years Day, 1994, MC Conrad referred to the style of music [[LTJ Bukem]] was playing as both \"[[Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore]]\" and \"drum and bass\", but neglected to describe it as jungle.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nHowever, as the early nineties saw drum and bass break out from its underground roots and begin to win popularity with the general British public, many producers attempted to expand the influences of the music beyond the domination of ragga-based sounds. By 1995, a counter movement to the ragga style was emerging.\n\nSince the term jungle was so closely related to the ragga {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} influenced sound, DJs and producers who did not incorporate reggae elements began to adopt the term \"drum and bass\" to differentiate themselves and their musical styles. This reflected a change in the musical style which incorporated increased drum break editing. Sometimes this was referred to as \"intelligence\", though this later came to refer to the more relaxing style of drum and bass associated with producers such as [[LTJ Bukem]]. Perhaps the first track to explicitly use the term \"drum and bass\" to refer to itself was released in 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Invisible+Man,+The\n| title = The Invisible Man Discography| accessdate = August 2, 2010}}</ref> The producer The Invisible Man described it:\n\n\"A well edited [[Amen Break]] alongside an 808 sub kick and some simple atmospherics just sounded so amazing all on its own, thus the speech sample \"strictly drum and bass\". A whole new world of possibilities was opening up for the drum programming... It wasn't long before the amen break was being used by practically every producer within the scene, and as time progressed the Belgian style techno stabs and noises disappeared, and the edits and studio trickery got more and more complex. People were at last beginning to call the music Drum and Bass instead of hardcore. This Amen formula certainly helped cement the sound for many of the tracks I went on to produce for Gwange, [[Q-Project]] and Spinback on Legend Records. After a while, tracks using the Amen break virtually had a genre all of their own. Foul Play, [[Peshay]], Bukem, [[DJ Dextrous]] and DJ Crystl among others were all solid amen addicts back then too.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hardcorewillneverdie.com/invisible10.html | title = The Invisible Man - Top Ten Selection| accessdate = August 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTowards late 1994 and especially in 1995 there was a definite distinction between the reggae and ragga sounding jungle and the tracks with heavily edited breaks, such as the artists Remarc, DJ Dextrous and The Dream Team on Suburban Bass Records. Ironically, one compilation which brought the term to the wider awareness of those outside the scene, 'Drum & Bass Selection vol 1' (1994), featured a large amount of ragga influenced tracks, and the first big track to use the term in its title (Remarc's 'Drum & Bass Wize', 1994) was also ragga-influenced.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/Various-Drum-Bass-Selection-1/master/5215 | title = Various - Drum & Bass Selection 1| accessdate = Aug 2, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Dream Team consisted of Bizzy B and Pugwash; Bizzy B did however have a history of complex breakbreat tracks released before any real notion of a change in genre name. This also coincided with an increase of the use of the \n[[Kevin Saunderson#The Reese Bassline|Reese bassline]] (Reese Project, [[Kevin Saunderson]]), as first featured on \"Just Want Another Chance\" by Kevin Saunderson (also famous for the group Inner City) released in 1988. Mid-1995 saw the coincidentally named [[Alex Reece]]'s \"Pulp Fiction\" which featured a distorted Reese bassline with a two-step break, slightly slower in tempo, which has been credited as an influence in the new tech-step style which would emerge from Emotif and No U-Turn Records.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction was (and still is) a seriously badass tune{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, it was highly original at the time, and of course it will remain in the classic oldskool bag for many years to come. It was also the track that spawned hundreds of imitators of its \"2-Step\" style which unfortunately also lasted for many years to come.... hmmm... oh, and because the 2-step groove generally sounds slower, DnB then began to speed up way beyond 160bpm... say no more.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hardcorewillneverdie.com/invisible10.html | title = The Invisible Man - Top Ten Selection| accessdate = June 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThis has also led to the confusion of equating the \"tech-step\" subgenre with drum and bass, as distinct from jungle, but \"drum and bass\" as a style and as a name for the whole genre already existed in 1995 before the release of DJ Trace's remix of [[T-Power]]'s \"Mutant Jazz\" which appeared on S.O.U.R. Recordings in 1995 (co-produced by [[Ed Rush]] and Nico). Also note that DJ Trace, Ed Rush and Nico already had a history of producing jungle/drum & bass and hardcore in a variety of styles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Trace?anv=Trace | title = Trace Discography| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ed+Rush | title =Ed Rush Discography| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Nico+%284%29 | title =Nico Discography| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe media may have also emphasised a difference in styles. This was especially the case in the subgenre dubbed \"[[intelligent drum and bass|intelligent]]\" drum and bass by the music press, and its ambassador was [[LTJ Bukem]] and his Good Looking label alongside [[Moving Shadow]] artists such as Foul Play, [[Omni Trio]] and Cloud 9.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/>\n\nSome say that the move to drum and bass was a conscious and concerted reaction by top DJs and producers against a culture that was becoming tinged with gangster types and violent elements, and stereotyped with the recognizable production techniques of ragga-influenced producers. The release of [[General Levy]]'s \"Incredible\" record in 1994 is taken by many as being the key-point in the transformation. This ragga influenced track contains a statement by General Levy claiming to be the \"original junglist\" at a time in which he was proclaiming publicly that \"I run jungle\" which in turn angered the most powerful and influential drum and bass producers, resulting in a blacklisting of General Levy and possibly a conscious step away from the ragga sound.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,408024,00.html | title = Garage wars article at guardian.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1063&ReviewID=1678&PageNumber=1&arcMagID=1062 | title = Is D&B Locked Down? article at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"The whole tag jungle took on a real sinister... It just got so smashed in the press. We were like: \"If we\u2019re going to carry on we\u2019re gonna have to change the name here, cos we\u2019re getting slaughtered here.\" - Fabio.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/></blockquote>\n\nIntelligent drum and bass maintained the uptempo breakbeat percussion, but focused on more atmospheric sounds and warm, deep basslines over vocals or samples which often originated from soul and jazz music. However, alongside other key producers in the scene, [[LTJ Bukem]], arguably the single most influential figure behind the style, is especially noted for disliking the term, owing to the implication that other forms of drum and bass are not intelligent. From this period on, drum and bass would maintain the unity of a relatively small musical culture, but one characterised by a competing group of stylistic influences. Although many DJs have specialised in distinctive subgenres within jungle and drum and bass, the majority of artists within the genre were and remain connected via record labels, events and radio shows. It is extremely important to note that many producers make tracks in more than one subgenre of drum and bass.\n\nAround 1995-1996 there was a general splintering of the drum and bass scene. Subgenres could be referred to by their names as opposed to either jungle or drum and bass, though all subgenres were usually grouped by the new umbrella term ''drum and bass''. This continues today.\n{{Listen\n|filename=Adam F Circles.ogg\n|title=Adam F's \"Circles\" (1995)\n|description=30&nbsp;second sample. Notice the subtle usage of drums and melodic elements, as contrasted to previous music samples. It still contains a fast broken beat but the beat is less audible.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[Roni Size]], [[Krust]] and Dj Die might be considered the people that made Drum and Bass more mainstream.\n\nConfusion is increased by the term [[Jump-Up (electronic music)|jump-up]] which initially referred to tracks which had a change in style at the drop, encouraging people to dance. Initially these would usually be breakbeat-heavy drops in this new drum and bass style, but producers of around the same time were creating tracks with hip-hop style basslines at the drop. This would become a new subgenre \"jump-up\", though many of the early jump-up tracks included edited amens at the drop. Influential artists include [[DJ Zinc]], [[DJ Hype]], [[Dillinja]] and [[Aphrodite (artist)|Aphrodite]] amongst many others. The Dream Team would also produce jump-up tracks, usually under the name Dynamic Duo on Joker Records, in a style with similarities and differences to their [[Suburban Bass]] releases. Notice also the early use of the term \"jump up jungle\" rather than \"jump up drum and bass\". The pigeon-holes for genres changed so quickly that jump-up was quickly also called drum and bass even as a subgenre.\n\nAround this time, drum and bass also sealed its popularity by winning a Friday night slot on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]], the BBC's flagship radio station, the legendary \"One in the jungle\" show. Initially presented by a revolving groups of jungle luminaries, hosted by MC Navigator, the station eventually secured the presenting services of Fabio and Grooverider, two of the oldest and most-respected DJs in the scene. Many DJs made a sudden shift from pirate radio to legal radio at this time.\n\nUp to this point, [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] was the only radio source of jungle music and in particular [[Kool FM]], and [[Don FM]]'s contribution to the development of this sound should not be overlooked or denied.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/> It is doubtful whether jungle would have gained popularity without pirate radio stations. The transition in name from \"jungle\" to \"drum and bass\" occurs at the same time as its legal appearance on airwaves.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web | url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=242 | title = Red Bull Academy Interview Zinc - Hardware Bingo| accessdate = September 4, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radiox.de/history/radiovisionen/KOOL.html | title = KOOL FM feature on radiox.de | accessdate = September 6, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060220201014/http://www.radiox.de/history/radiovisionen/KOOL.html | archivedate = February 20, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nAnother aspect to note in the evolution of drum and bass is that the advent of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] specifically aimed at stopping illegal [[Rave party|raves]] prompted the move of jungle (and other electronic music genres) into legal (mostly) nightclubs.\n\n===Jungle vs. drum and bass===\nNowadays the difference between jungle (or [[oldschool jungle]]) and drum and bass is a common debate within the junglist community. There is no universally accepted semantic distinction between the terms \"jungle\" and \"drum and bass\". Some associate \"jungle\" with older material from the first half of the 1990s (sometimes referred to as \"jungle techno\"), and see drum and bass as essentially succeeding jungle. Others use jungle as a shorthand for ragga jungle, a specific subgenre within the broader realm of drum and bass. Probably the widest held viewpoint within the scene in London is that the terms are simply synonymous and interchangeable: drum and bass is jungle, and jungle is drum and bass.\n\n==The birth of techstep==\nAs a lighter sound of drum and bass began to win over the musical mainstream, many Producers continued to work on the other end of the spectrum, resulting in a series of releases which highlighted a dark, techy sound which drew more influence from Techno and the soundscapes of science fiction and films. <!-- Removed [[Anime]]: Anime sound tracks are not necessarily prevalent in drum and bass thus caters to only a small group. Films in general would suffice as soundtracks from Anime films may refer to a similar yet different genre altogether. An example of this would be Jpop and Jrock. Though they are Pop and Rock, these genres are not necessarily related to their Japanese counterparts. Drum and Bass' presence within movies and television (among other media) is seemingly apparent, but to specify (or promote, rather) 'only' Anime films is entirely subjective and should be fixed. If Anime truly plays a big role in drum and bass, CITE IT and prove me wrong you anime crusaders! -->This style was championed by the labels Emotif and No U-Turn, and by artists like Trace, [[Ed Rush]], [[Optical (artist)|Optical]], and [[Dom & Roland]]. It is commonly referred to as techstep, which in turn gave birth to the [[neurofunk]] subgenre. Techstep focused intensely on studio production and applied new techniques of sound generation and processing to older Jungle approaches. Self-consciously underground, and lacking the accessible influences of much other drum and bass, techstep is deeply atmospheric, often characterized by sinister or science-fiction themes (including samples from cult films), cold and complex percussion, and dark, distorted basslines. The sound was a conscious move back towards the darker sounds of Belgian Techno and Darkside Hardcore (again the already mentioned darkcore), albeit with a greater electro / techno emphasis than darkcore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/music/int/1999/09/28/everything/print.html |title=Being Everything But The Girl article, Salon Magazine, September 28, 1998 |accessdate=January 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111114512/http://www.salon.com/ent/music/int/1999/09/28/everything/print.html |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe sound also marked a period when drum and bass became more insular and began to draw inspiration from itself rather than other musical genres. The sampler at this time became less important with home computer equipment and generated beats and sounds becoming capable of creating an entire drum and bass track from scratch.\n\nAs the 1990s drew to a close, drum and bass withdrew from mainstream popularity and concentrated on the new more ominous sounds which were popular in clubs, rather than on mainstream radio. Techstep came to dominate the drum and bass genre, with artists like [[Konflict]] and [[Bad Company (drum and bass group)|Bad Company]] amongst the most visible. As time went on, techstep became more minimal, and increasingly dark in tone, and the funky, commercial appeal represented by Roni Size back in 1997 waned. A characteristic of this was the increasing disproportion of male to female club goers and a generally more aggressive and dark atmosphere at clubs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=7&csid1=3760 | title = Point of View: Drum & Bass About Face by Martin Turenne at exclaim.ca | accessdate = September 6, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009014003/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=7&csid1=3760 | archivedate = October 9, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.descendingangel.com/nou-turn/intrview/int_srey.html | title = Web link reference| accessdate = September 6, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061016001810/http://www.descendingangel.com/nou-turn/intrview/int_srey.html |archivedate = October 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe withdrawal of drum and bass from the mainstream was not only a result of its growing fascination with its own (progressively darker) sound, but also resulted from the explosive birth and growing popularity of [[UK garage]] (2 step and 4x4 garage, aka speed garage), a musical genre heavily influenced by jungle, with similar beats, vocal and basslines but slower speeds and more friendly (or at least radio-friendly) beats.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.garagemusic.co.uk/2step.html | title = Adult Hardcore written by Simon Reynolds (originally published in ''The Wire'') on garagemusic.co.uk | accessdate = September 6, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030822103100/http://garagemusic.co.uk/2step.html | archive-date = August 22, 2003 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>2-Steps closer to America, a new dance mausic crosses the Atlantic to the beat of MJ Cole, Artful Dodge and others article, Boston Globe, July 6, 2001</ref> Drum and bass suddenly found itself losing popularity and established drum and bass producers expressed shock at its sudden alienation and abandonment by the general public.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.techno.de/mixmag/98.12/drum.1.html | title = Liquid Funk feature on techno.de| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref> This turn fuelled the harder sound of [[techstep]].<ref name=\"Fabio\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\"And then garage came along: the death knell for drum and Bass.

Although slow to catch on at first, the style grew massively in popularity around 2002-2004, and by 2004 it was established as one of the biggest-selling subgenres in drum and bass, with labels like [[Hospital Records]], State of the Art Recordings and Soul: R and artists including [[High Contrast]], [[Calibre (artist)|Calibre]], [[DJ Dextrous|Solid State]], [[Nu:Tone]], [[London Elektricity]] and [[Logistics (artist)|Logistics]] among its main proponents. [[Alex Reece]] and [[LTJ Bukem]] were amongst the first producers to experiment fully with deep smooth drum and bass, and as such could be considered the forerunners of liquid funk.\n{{Listen\n|filename=Aphrodite Ganja Man.ogg\n|title=Aphrodite \"Ganja Man\" (2002)\n|description=30&nbsp;second sample. A modern jump-up track with simple beats, a Lauryn Hill sample and vocal throwbacks to the ragga era of jungle\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nThe decade also saw the revival of [[Jump-Up (electronic music)|jump-up]]. Referred to as \"nu jump up\", or pejoratively as clownstep, this kept the sense of fun and the simplistic, bouncing basslines from the first generation of jump up, but with tougher and more edgey production values, including increased sound compression. Notable artists are [[DJ Hazard (musician)|DJ Hazard]], DJ Clipz and Taxman.\n\nThis modern period has also seen the development of the style known as \"dubwise\", which returns drum and bass to its reggae-influenced roots and combines them with modern production techniques which had advanced immeasurably since the early days of jungle. Although the dub-influenced sound was not new, having long been championed by artists like Digital and Spirit, 2003\u20132004 saw a significant increase in its popularity and visibility.\n\nSimilarly, whilst there had long been a niche dedicated almost entirely to detailed drum programming and manipulation, championed by the likes of [[Paradox (artist)|Paradox]], the first half of this decade saw a revival and expansion in the subgenre known variously as [[drumfunk]], \"edits\", or \"choppage\". Major labels include Inperspective and Synaptic Plastic and the new wave of artists in this style include ASC, Fanu, Breakage, Fracture and Neptune, 0=0 and Equinox.\n\n[[File:Goldiednbravechina2.gif|thumb|160px|left|Ravers & Goldie.]] The new millennium also saw a fresh wave of live drum and bass bands. The likes of Reprazent and Red Snapper had performed live drum and bass during the 1990s, but the re-creation of London Elektricity as a live band focussed renewed interest on the idea, with acts like The Bays, Keiretsu, Southampton based Gojira, [[Step 13]], Deadsilence Syndicate, and U.V Ray (feat. Yuval Gabay) as well as Birmingham's PCM, pursuing this avenue. In addition the popular [[Breakbeat Kaos]] label has begun to focus more and more on bringing a live sound into drum and bass, both in the records they release and in the live band (music played on live acoustic instruments, including guitar) night the previously signed group [[Pendulum (drum and bass group)|Pendulum]] have hosted in London (e.g. October 2006 at the Fabric club).\n\nIn 2003, [[Metalheadz]] signees Dylan and Robyn Chaos (aka Faith In Chaos) pushed the harder sound of drum and bass by founding the [[Freak Recordings]] label and sublabels Obscene and Tech Freak, together with artists like Technical Itch, [[Limewax]], [[Counterstrike (drum and bass group)|Counterstrike]], SPL, Current Value, and many others, leading to the creation of the Therapy Sessions drum and bass festivals in London. The Therapy Sessions franchise quickly expanded worldwide with greater repercussion on Eastern Europe with an attendance of more than 10.000 fans in cities like St. Petesburg.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Harry |last=Sword |url=http://www.datatransmission.co.uk/Features/609 |title=Data Transmission : EXTREME SUB-GENRE [sic] TOP 10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921091908/http://www.datatransmission.co.uk/Features/609 |archivedate=September 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNear the late 2000s, a genre known referred to as minimal drum & bass, also known as \"autonomic\" or \"microfunk\", emerged. This subgenre is identified primarily by its overall minimalistic song structure as well as its use of intricate percussion, deep sub-bass and subdued melodies.<ref name=\"RYM\">http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Minimal+Drum+and+Bass/</ref> Notable artists include ASC, Consequence, [[dBridge]], Instra:mental, Synkro, Oak and Bop (among many others). With popular labels that promote the sound being Exit Records (Owned by dBridge himself), Med School, Critical Music, Shogun Audio, Nonplus+ Records (Also Co-owned between dBridge and Instra:mental), Auxiliary (Owned by ASC) as well as the record label Autonomic. \"The Autonomic Podcast\" is a podcast that is released for free by those in Club Autonomic. 'Minimal' drum & bass has crossed over into a more dance-floor oriented sound through artists like Rockwell, Enei and Icicle who take inspiration from genres including neurofunk and industrial techno.\n\n==Drum 'n' bass and jazz fusion==\nAmerican Grammy Award-winning record producer, jazz fusion pioneer, and [[bassist]] [[Bill Laswell]] touched on [[drum and bass]] in the \u201890s with his ''Oscillations'' releases and the compilation Submerged: Tetragramaton. Laswell stepped up his work in drum 'n' bass starting with ''Brutal Calling'' (2004), an eight-track hard drum 'n' bass album with Ohm Resistance label owner [[Submerged (DJ)]]/producer Kurt Gluck followed by a series of releases and live dates. Laswell\u2019s newest project in this vein is Method of Defiance. The first release focused on the core of Laswell and Submerged once again, with contributions from [[Toshinori Kondo]] and Guy Licata.\n\nThe second release under the Method of Defiance moniker was a compilation style project focusing on drum 'n' bass. ''Inamorata'' stretched the concept out, pairing Laswell\u2019s bass with a different combination of respected jazz and world musicians and drum 'n' bass producers on each track. Artists including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[John Zorn]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Nils Petter Molvaer]], [[Toshinori Kondo]] and [[Buckethead]] were paired with drum 'n' bass producers including [[Amit Kamboj|Amit]], [[Paradox (artist)|Paradox]], [[Submerged (DJ)|Submerged]], [[Evol Intent]], Fanu and [[Corrupt Souls]]. He also released a full-on collaboration with Finnish drum 'n' bass maestro Fanu on Ohm Resistance (US) and [[Karl Records]] (Europe), entitled ''Lodge'', which includes contributions from Molvaer and Bernie Worrell amongst others. The concept of the group has once again morphed into a full band concept. In 2009, RareNoiseRecords released ''Live in Nihon'', which showcased this new direction/grouping. The group now consisted of Laswell, Guy Licata, Dr. Israel, [[Toshinori Kondo]] and [[Bernie Worrell]].\n\n==North America beginnings and scene==\nThe rave scenes in the US (New York) and in Canada (Toronto) embraced the transition of hardcore to jungle around 1994. America's longest running party, Konkrete Jungle also born in NYC, discovered the first US drum and bass MC's Blaise (Naughty Ride), Panic and Johnny Z. Outside of NYC. [[1.8.7]] and Dieselboy in Pittsburgh, Karl K and Method One in Philadelphia and DJ Slant and DJ Stress from the 2Tuff Crew in D.C. along with Krazy Josifer and Mark Wease from the Life of Leisure Crew in Washington DC. This small handful of US East Coast pioneers spent years in the underground playing back rooms before the sound caught on throughout America. A seminal moment in the breakthrough of the sound was the first large scale all Jungle/Drum 'n' Bass event in the US called Jungle Warfare which took place in Pittsburgh in 1996 which people from all over the East Coast attended. As a result of its success as well as the attendance of several influential rave promoters, many events in the US began to feature the sound in the main room or on the main stage.\n\nPerhaps most responsible for the extensive introduction of drum and bass to the U.S. during the mid-1990s was Bassquake, a prime time Drum And Bass radio programme created by DJ [[Michele Sainte]] (previously known for playing Breakbeat and Techno at raves and venues throughout North America) that aired each week on 103.3FM [[WPRB]] which is a commercial radio station at [[Princeton University]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] with audiences in both New York and Philadelphia. Also partly responsible was Bassrush, headed by Raymond Frances, whose innovation was to present House, Techno, and Drum & Bass in separate rooms\u2014making Drum & Bass, for the first time, a major feature at U.S. rave parties. The Bassrush DJ Agency also introduced many major UK DJs to the American scene, including Shy FX, Kenny Ken, and DJ Randall.\n\nWhile New York and Toronto thrived in this culture in the early '90s, new scenes were rapidly gaining recognition in the mid '90s to late '90s in: Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Orlando, Denver, Seattle, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Producers and DJs such as [[AK1200]] (ORL), [[DJ Dara]] (NY), Danny the Wildchild (CHI), Krazy Josifer (DC), and in particular [[Dieselboy]] (PIT) who helped push the genre darker and further by producing, promoting, releasing compilations available for the public, and performing at raves. Following the growing commercial and crossover success of another Pittsburgh native, [[1.8.7]] (whose early studio Dieselboy learned about production in) Dieselboy also became one of the first US producers and DJs to break out on the international scene. [[Evol Intent]], [[Gridlok]], Ewun and SPL have followed suit.\n\nThese artists have had a profound effect on the surrounding areas movements, causing drum and bass to spread in the majority of the United States. Clubs such as Buzz (DC), Breakdown (DEN), Elements (BOS), Seminar (CHI), Spy (CLE), Firestone (ORL), Platinum (PHI), Eklektic (SF), Science (LA), Respect (LA), Masquerade (ATL) and Baltic Room (SEA) helped generate a scene outside of the then prosperous rave scene.\n\nIn 2000 [[Dieselboy]] joined forces with [[AK1200]] and [[DJ Dara]] to create an annual tour, the [[Planet of the Drums]]. Since 2001 [[Messinian]] (James Fiorella, Philadelphia, PA) has been the MC. At ten consecutive years (2009), it is the longest-running annual tour in electronic dance music history.\n\nIn 2009, Dieselboy created The Monsters of Jungle, a tour concept featuring artists on his label, [[Human Imprint]]. The aesthetic is '80s metal meets drum and bass. It launched at the 11th Annual Starscape Festival in Baltimore, Maryland, in June 2009 as a multi-media stage production including custom visuals, and new music and spoken word audio prepared especially for the show. The first Monsters of Jungle tour featured Dieselboy, the Upbeats (New Zealand), Evol Intent, Ewun, Demo, Infiltrata, Joe Way, Mayhem, SPKTRM, MC Messinian, and MC Dino.\n\n==South America==\nBrazil's fusion of Drum & Bass and Bossa Nova or Samba gave birth to the term Sambass which was pushed by [[DJ Marky]] together with [[DJ Patife]], [[XRS]] and [[Drumagick]], and shortly after the sound conquered the UK scene due to the global popularity that Marky achieved, supported by a residency at [[The End (club)|The End]] club and his work for [[BBC Radio 1]]. In Venezuela, DJ Alex (Venezuela's first Drum & Bass DJ and founder of the Simpl3 crew), also known as Modovisual for his graphic design, has created several designs for international events and also merchandising for Dogsonacid.com.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111128132118/http://www.dogsonacid.com/system/shop/product-detail.php?productID=342 DOA MODO VISUAL HOODY]</ref> Venezuelan producer and DJ [[Zardonic]] has been leading the harder sound of Drum & Bass by headlining the first Therapy Sessions events taking place in [[Ecuador]] and [[Argentina]], as well as pushing the country even further on the map due to his signing to Dieselboy's [[Human Imprint]] label.<ref>[http://humanimprint.com/?p=279 ZARDONIC - South Of Human EP Available Now HUMAN / subHUMAN]</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n* ''All Crews: Journeys Through Jungle / Drum and Bass Culture'' by Brian Belle-Fortune ({{ISBN|978-0-9548897-0-8}}), nonfiction\n* ''Knowledge Magazine Article on the history of drum & bass radio pirates'' by Sarah Bentley<ref>[http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1058&ReviewID=1682&PageNumber=1 knowledgemag.co.uk]</ref>\n* ''Roots 'n Future'' by Simon Reynolds ({{ISBN|978-0-330-35056-3}}), nonfiction\n* ''Rumble in the Jungle: The Invisible History of Drum and Bass'' by Steven Quinn, Transformations, No 3 (2002), nonfiction ({{ISSN|1444-3775}}) [http://transformations.cqu.edu.au/journal/issue_03/pdf/quinn.pdf PDF file]\n* ''State of bass, jungle: the story so far'' by Martin James, Boxtree ({{ISBN|978-0-7522-2323-0}}), nonfiction\n* ''The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass'' by [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] and Alexix Maryon ({{ISBN|978-1-85828-433-0}}), nonfiction\n* ''King Rat'' by China Melville ({{ISBN|978-0-330-37098-1}}), fiction\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090630054801/http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoID=2016083719 \"London Something Dis\", a 1994 documentary on the history of drum & bass]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160209225339/http://www.dubechoes.com/ \"Dub Echoes\", a documentary about dub's influence on the birth of drum n bass, electronic music and hip hop]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/events/xtrabass06/interact/timeline.shtml?id=1 \"History of drum & bass\", a BBC timeline on the history of drum & bass with track listings, quotes and samples]\n\n{{Drum and bass-footer}}\n{{Electronica}}\n{{Breakbeat-footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Drum And Bass}}\n[[Category:Drum and bass| ]]\n[[Category:Electronic music genres]]\n[[Category:Music in London]]\n[[Category:Breakbeat]]\n", "text_old": "{{main|Drum and bass}}\n<!-- ==============================({{Jungle vs Dnb}})============================== -->\n<!-- There is an appropriate note in the article over the controversy over the term -->\n<!-- This article covers the entirety of jungle/d&b history and musicology -->\n<!-- There is a separate oldschool jungle article which deals with jungle history separately-->\n<!-- Please do not edit this section to remove or distort references to jungle -->\n<!-- ============================================================================= -->\n\n'''Drum and bass''' (commonly abbreviated to '''DnB''', '''D&B''', '''Drum n Bass''' and '''Drum & Bass''') is an [[electronic music]] [[genre]] that originated in the UK [[rave]] scene having developed from [[breakbeat hardcore]] (and its derivatives of [[darkcore]], and [[hardcore jungle]]). The genre would go on to become one of the most popular genres of [[electronic dance music]], becoming international and spawning multiple different derivatives and subgenres.\n\n==Beginnings in the UK==\nDrum and bass began as a musical [[paradigm shift]] of the United Kingdom [[breakbeat hardcore]] and [[rave]] scene of the mid 1990s; and over the first decade and a half of its existence there have been many permutations in its style, incorporating elements from [[dancehall]], [[Electro music|electro]], [[funk]], [[hip hop]], [[House music|house]], [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]]-created fusion of hardcore, house and [[techno]] (also including [[new beat]]). This scene existed briefly from approximately 1989-1993, a period of cross-pollination in the UK hardcore sound. This sound did survive in various forms in its mother countries - primarily Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany - beyond 1992, but by then the general scenes in these countries had moved forwards to trance, [[industrial techno]] or [[Gabber|gabba]] (with [[happy hardcore]]/[[hard house]] being the equivalent 'Belgian Techno' - derivative sounds in the UK). London and Bristol are the two cities which are most associated with Drum and Bass.\n\nReturning to the UK, drum and bass (as jungle) has its direct origins in the breakbeat hardcore part of the UK acid house rave scene. Hardcore DJs typically played their records at fast tempos, and breakbeat hardcore emphasised breakbeats over the [[Four to the floor|4-to-the-floor]] beat structure common to house music. [[Breakbeat hardcore]] records such as [[The Prodigy]]'s \"Experience\" (1992) [[Top Buzz]] 'Jungle Techno!' (1991), [[A Guy Called Gerald]]'s 'Anything' (1991), [[Shut Up and Dance (band)|Shut Up and Dance]]'s \"\u00a310 to get in\" / \"\u00a320 to get in\" (both 1989), the [[Ragga Twins]]' \"Spliffhead\" (1990) & '18&nbsp;Inch Speaker' (1991), [[Rebel MC]]'s 'Wickedest Sound' (1990), 'Coming On Strong' (1990), 'Tribal Bass' (1991) & 'African' (1991) [[Nightmares on Wax]]'s 'Aftermath' & 'In Two Minds' (1990), [[Genaside II]]'s \"Sirens of Acre Lane\" (1990), [[DJ Dextrous]]' \"Ruffneck Biznizz\" (1992), [[Noise Factory]]'s 'Be Free' (1992), [[Demon Boyz]] 'Jungle Dett' (1992) and [[LTJ Bukem]]'s \"Demon's Theme\" (1992) are generally credited as being among the first to have a recognizable drum and bass sound.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/Top-Buzz-Top-Buzz-EP/release/223969 | title = \"Top Buzz - Jungle Techno!\". listing on Discogs\"| accessdate = April 5, 2010 }}</ref> <ref>http://junglistnetwork.com/interview-with-mad-p-by-kaspa/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/genaside-ii-mn0000192323</ref>\n<ref>https://techno-dads.com/2011/10/12/dad-trax-genaside-ii-narra-mine/</ref>\n<ref>https://herecomethedrums.com/2015/02/10/straight-from-the-bedroom/comment-page-1/</ref>\n<ref>http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com/2016/12/jungle-techno.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.popmatters.com/nightmares-on-wax-now-isthetime-2495648705.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.globaldarkness.com/articles/history%20of%20jungle%20drum%20and%20bass.htm</ref> \n<ref>http://www.brainwashed.com/mbm/</ref> \n<ref>https://thequietus.com/articles/05135-jack-dangers-interview-meat-beat-manifesto</ref> <ref>http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.12.98/meatbeatman-9845.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.insomniac.com/music/meat-beat-manifesto-helter-skelter/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.clashmusic.com/features/hackney-soldiers-the-birth-of-jungle</ref> \n<ref>https://jungleunity.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/legends-in-the-dance-ragga-twins-interview/</ref>\n<ref>http://welovejungle.com/interviews/we-love-jungle-presents-an-interview-with-ragga-twins/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/04/congo-natty-jungle-revolution-rebel-mc</ref> <ref>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ae8nw8/a-guy-called-gerald-interview</ref>\n<ref>http://welovejungle.com/interviews/an-interview-with-paul-ibiza-on-the-birth-of-jungle/</ref>\n\nSome hardcore tracks at the time were extremely light and upbeat; the most extreme examples of this were the so-called \"toy-town\" tracks such as [[Smart E's]]' \"Sesame's Treat\" which features the children's show \"[[Sesame Street]]\" theme song. A style of hardcore with light and upbeat sounds and a predominant kick drum, with less emphasis on breakbeats, would many years later be known as [[happy hardcore]]. These were particularly prominent in the summer of 1992 when hardcore crossed over commercially in the UK and its charts.\n\nIn response to these lighter tracks, some producers started focusing on darker, more aggressive sounds; this style became known as darkside hardcore, or [[Darkcore]]. Strange noises and effects, syncopated rhythms made from rearranged funk [[Break (music)|breaks]] and loud bass lines defined the genre. Examples of darkcore include [[Goldie]]'s \"Terminator\" (1992), [[Doc Scott]]'s \"Here Come The Drumz\", and [[Top Buzz]]'s \"Living In Darkness\" (1992). These took their cue from the darker sounds of 'Belgian Techno', as found in tracks such as Beltram's \"Mentasm\" and \"Energy Flash\" (1991), as well as the dark breaks of [[4 Hero]]'s \"Mr Kirks Nightmare\" (1990) among others. These tracks were not widely called jungle or drum and bass by the mainstream media at their time of creation (although the terms \"hardcore jungle\" and \"jungle techno\" were in common use in the rave scene by then, with \"drum & bass\" appearing here and there on particular mixes of several vinyl releases), but they can nevertheless be found on later jungle and drum and bass compilations. The first major round-up of these tracks which was to use the term 'drum & bass' was probably \"The Dark Side - Hardcore Drum & Bass Style\": a compilation on React Records, released March 1993, which featured both \"Here Comes The Drumz\" and \"Terminator\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/29177 | title = Discogs information - Euphoreal - The Jungle Tekno EP| accessdate = May 2, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/84349 | title = Discogs information - Noise Factory - Loving You / Jungle Techno| accessdate = May 3, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/1186 | title = Discogs information - Manix - Hardcore Junglism| accessdate = May 3, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/39946 | title = Discogs information - Various - Jungle Tekno Volume One| accessdate = May 2, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/release/26193 | title = Discogs information The Prodigy - Charly (trip into drum & bass version)| accessdate = May 7, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"Fabio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=273 |title=Red Bull Academy Interview Fabio - The Root To The Shoot |accessdate=September 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217174942/http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=273 |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"Popular\">{{cite web | url = http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/missingham.html | title = \"Popular Musicology On Line Article \"Big Tings Ah Gwan\": Junglist Music Takes Centre Stage, An Introduction to Jungle Music And An Enquiry Into Its Impact On The London Jazz Scene\" | accessdate = September 4, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120216142603/http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/missingham.html | archive-date = February 16, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThis darker, more aggressive sound appealed to many in the dancehall and reggae communities. A shared emphasis on rhythm and bass, and the tempos were well suited to be mixed together. Soon many elements of dancehall reggae were being incorporated into the hardcore sound, and a precursor to what would become known as simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] was sometimes dubbed [[hardcore jungle]]. The Jamaican sound-system culture began to influence the emerging sound through the use of basslines and remixing techniques derived from [[Dub music|dub]] and reggae music, alongside the fast breakbeats and samples derived from urban musics such as hip hop, funk, jazz, and r&b alongside many production techniques borrowed from early electronic music such as house, and techno.\n\nAs the yet unnamed genre evolved, the use of sampled funk breakbeats became increasingly complex. Most notable and widely spread is the [[Amen break]] taken from a b-side funk track \"Amen, Brother\" by the Winston Brothers ([[The Winstons]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac |title=Video explanation of the Amen Break on youtube |accessdate=September 6, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QUHKCCXv?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac |archivedate=July 21, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> During this time producers began cutting apart loops and using the component drum sounds to create new rhythms. To match the complex drum lines, basslines which had less in common with the patterns of house and techno music than with the phrasings of dub and hip hop began to be used. As the beat-per-minute range rose above 165, the emerging drum and bass sound became incompatible for straightforward DJ mixing with house and techno, which typically range dozens of beats-per-minute less (making it impossible to play the tracks at the same speed on club equipment). This sonic identity became highly distinctive for both the depth of its bass and the increasingly complex, rapid-fire breakbeat percussion. Vastly different rhythmic patterns were distinctively being used, as well as new types of sampling, synthesis and effects processing techniques, resulting in a greater focus on the intricacies of sampling/synthesis production and rhythm. This notably included early use of the [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching]] effect which was often used on percussion or vocal samples. As the influences of reggae and dub became more prominent, the sound of drum and bass began to take on an urban sound which was heavily influenced by ragga and dancehall music as well as hip hop, often incorporating the distinctive vocal styles of these musical genres.

References to 'jungle', 'junglists' and 'jungle music' can be found throughout dub, reggae and dancehall genres from that era up until today. It has been suggested that the term 'junglist' was a reference to a person either from a section of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Trenchtown]] also known as 'the Concrete Jungle' or from a different area, 'the Gardens', which was a leafy area colloquially referred to as 'the Jungle'. The first documented use of the term in drum and bass is within a song featuring jungle producer and lyricist Rebel MC - \"Rebel got this chant alla the junglists\".\n\n===Junglists===\n{{main|Junglist}}\n\nThe appearance of jungle also resulted in the appearance of the [[junglist]] subculture, which, while not nearly as distinctive, alienated, ideological or obvious as other youth subcultures, and having many similarities with hip hop styles and behaviour, does function distinctively within the drum and bass listening community. Many drum and bass listeners would and do refer to themselves as junglists, regardless of their attitude on whether jungle differs from drum and bass (see below).<ref name=\"Popular\"/>\n\n==Jungle to drum and bass==\nThe phrase \"drum and bass\" was sometimes used in the seventies to name dub versions of reggae songs. With titles on b-sides of 7 inches, like 'Drum and bass by King Tubby's'. Also you can hear the phrase in reggae songs from artists like Jah Tomas with the often sampled phrase 'strictly drum and bass make you wind up your waist'. Or in album titles, like 'Show Case (In a Roots Radics Drum and Bass)' from Tristan Palmer.\nThe phrase \"drum and bass\" had also been used for years previously in the London soul and funk pirate radio scenes and was even a bit of a catchphrase for UK [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Trevor Nelson]] in his pirate days, who used it to describe the deeper, rougher funk and \"rare groove\" sound that was popular in London at the time. A station ID jingle used on London pirate [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]] from the late 1980s would proclaim \"drum and bass style on Kiss\".\n{{Listen\n|filename=McConrad1994DrumAndBass.ogg\n|title=LTJ Bukem with MC Conrad at Dreamscape\n|description=Shortly after midnight on New Years Day, 1994, MC Conrad referred to the style of music [[LTJ Bukem]] was playing as both \"[[Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore]]\" and \"drum and bass\", but neglected to describe it as jungle.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nHowever, as the early nineties saw drum and bass break out from its underground roots and begin to win popularity with the general British public, many producers attempted to expand the influences of the music beyond the domination of ragga-based sounds. By 1995, a counter movement to the ragga style was emerging.\n\nSince the term jungle was so closely related to the ragga {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} influenced sound, DJs and producers who did not incorporate reggae elements began to adopt the term \"drum and bass\" to differentiate themselves and their musical styles. This reflected a change in the musical style which incorporated increased drum break editing. Sometimes this was referred to as \"intelligence\", though this later came to refer to the more relaxing style of drum and bass associated with producers such as [[LTJ Bukem]]. Perhaps the first track to explicitly use the term \"drum and bass\" to refer to itself was released in 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Invisible+Man,+The\n| title = The Invisible Man Discography| accessdate = August 2, 2010}}</ref> The producer The Invisible Man described it:\n\n\"A well edited [[Amen Break]] alongside an 808 sub kick and some simple atmospherics just sounded so amazing all on its own, thus the speech sample \"strictly drum and bass\". A whole new world of possibilities was opening up for the drum programming... It wasn't long before the amen break was being used by practically every producer within the scene, and as time progressed the Belgian style techno stabs and noises disappeared, and the edits and studio trickery got more and more complex. People were at last beginning to call the music Drum and Bass instead of hardcore. This Amen formula certainly helped cement the sound for many of the tracks I went on to produce for Gwange, [[Q-Project]] and Spinback on Legend Records. After a while, tracks using the Amen break virtually had a genre all of their own. Foul Play, [[Peshay]], Bukem, [[DJ Dextrous]] and DJ Crystl among others were all solid amen addicts back then too.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hardcorewillneverdie.com/invisible10.html | title = The Invisible Man - Top Ten Selection| accessdate = August 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTowards late 1994 and especially in 1995 there was a definite distinction between the reggae and ragga sounding jungle and the tracks with heavily edited breaks, such as the artists Remarc, DJ Dextrous and The Dream Team on Suburban Bass Records. Ironically, one compilation which brought the term to the wider awareness of those outside the scene, 'Drum & Bass Selection vol 1' (1994), featured a large amount of ragga influenced tracks, and the first big track to use the term in its title (Remarc's 'Drum & Bass Wize', 1994) was also ragga-influenced.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/Various-Drum-Bass-Selection-1/master/5215 | title = Various - Drum & Bass Selection 1| accessdate = Aug 2, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Dream Team consisted of Bizzy B and Pugwash; Bizzy B did however have a history of complex breakbreat tracks released before any real notion of a change in genre name. This also coincided with an increase of the use of the \n[[Kevin Saunderson#The Reese Bassline|Reese bassline]] (Reese Project, [[Kevin Saunderson]]), as first featured on \"Just Want Another Chance\" by Kevin Saunderson (also famous for the group Inner City) released in 1988. Mid-1995 saw the coincidentally named [[Alex Reece]]'s \"Pulp Fiction\" which featured a distorted Reese bassline with a two-step break, slightly slower in tempo, which has been credited as an influence in the new tech-step style which would emerge from Emotif and No U-Turn Records.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction was (and still is) a seriously badass tune{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, it was highly original at the time, and of course it will remain in the classic oldskool bag for many years to come. It was also the track that spawned hundreds of imitators of its \"2-Step\" style which unfortunately also lasted for many years to come.... hmmm... oh, and because the 2-step groove generally sounds slower, DnB then began to speed up way beyond 160bpm... say no more.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hardcorewillneverdie.com/invisible10.html | title = The Invisible Man - Top Ten Selection| accessdate = June 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThis has also led to the confusion of equating the \"tech-step\" subgenre with drum and bass, as distinct from jungle, but \"drum and bass\" as a style and as a name for the whole genre already existed in 1995 before the release of DJ Trace's remix of [[T-Power]]'s \"Mutant Jazz\" which appeared on S.O.U.R. Recordings in 1995 (co-produced by [[Ed Rush]] and Nico). Also note that DJ Trace, Ed Rush and Nico already had a history of producing jungle/drum & bass and hardcore in a variety of styles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Trace?anv=Trace | title = Trace Discography| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ed+Rush | title =Ed Rush Discography| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Nico+%284%29 | title =Nico Discography| accessdate = August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe media may have also emphasised a difference in styles. This was especially the case in the subgenre dubbed \"[[intelligent drum and bass|intelligent]]\" drum and bass by the music press, and its ambassador was [[LTJ Bukem]] and his Good Looking label alongside [[Moving Shadow]] artists such as Foul Play, [[Omni Trio]] and Cloud 9.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/>\n\nSome say that the move to drum and bass was a conscious and concerted reaction by top DJs and producers against a culture that was becoming tinged with gangster types and violent elements, and stereotyped with the recognizable production techniques of ragga-influenced producers. The release of [[General Levy]]'s \"Incredible\" record in 1994 is taken by many as being the key-point in the transformation. This ragga influenced track contains a statement by General Levy claiming to be the \"original junglist\" at a time in which he was proclaiming publicly that \"I run jungle\" which in turn angered the most powerful and influential drum and bass producers, resulting in a blacklisting of General Levy and possibly a conscious step away from the ragga sound.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,408024,00.html | title = Garage wars article at guardian.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1063&ReviewID=1678&PageNumber=1&arcMagID=1062 | title = Is D&B Locked Down? article at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = September 6, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"The whole tag jungle took on a real sinister... It just got so smashed in the press. We were like: \"If we\u2019re going to carry on we\u2019re gonna have to change the name here, cos we\u2019re getting slaughtered here.\" - Fabio.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/></blockquote>\n\nIntelligent drum and bass maintained the uptempo breakbeat percussion, but focused on more atmospheric sounds and warm, deep basslines over vocals or samples which often originated from soul and jazz music. However, alongside other key producers in the scene, [[LTJ Bukem]], arguably the single most influential figure behind the style, is especially noted for disliking the term, owing to the implication that other forms of drum and bass are not intelligent. From this period on, drum and bass would maintain the unity of a relatively small musical culture, but one characterised by a competing group of stylistic influences. Although many DJs have specialised in distinctive subgenres within jungle and drum and bass, the majority of artists within the genre were and remain connected via record labels, events and radio shows. It is extremely important to note that many producers make tracks in more than one subgenre of drum and bass.\n\nAround 1995-1996 there was a general splintering of the drum and bass scene. Subgenres could be referred to by their names as opposed to either jungle or drum and bass, though all subgenres were usually grouped by the new umbrella term ''drum and bass''. This continues today.\n{{Listen\n|filename=Adam F Circles.ogg\n|title=Adam F's \"Circles\" (1995)\n|description=30&nbsp;second sample. Notice the subtle usage of drums and melodic elements, as contrasted to previous music samples. It still contains a fast broken beat but the beat is less audible.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[Roni Size]], [[Krust]] and Dj Die might be considered the people that made Drum and Bass more mainstream.\n\nConfusion is increased by the term [[Jump-Up (electronic music)|jump-up]] which initially referred to tracks which had a change in style at the drop, encouraging people to dance. Initially these would usually be breakbeat-heavy drops in this new drum and bass style, but producers of around the same time were creating tracks with hip-hop style basslines at the drop. This would become a new subgenre \"jump-up\", though many of the early jump-up tracks included edited amens at the drop. Influential artists include [[DJ Zinc]], [[DJ Hype]], [[Dillinja]] and [[Aphrodite (artist)|Aphrodite]] amongst many others. The Dream Team would also produce jump-up tracks, usually under the name Dynamic Duo on Joker Records, in a style with similarities and differences to their [[Suburban Bass]] releases. Notice also the early use of the term \"jump up jungle\" rather than \"jump up drum and bass\". The pigeon-holes for genres changed so quickly that jump-up was quickly also called drum and bass even as a subgenre.\n\nAround this time, drum and bass also sealed its popularity by winning a Friday night slot on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]], the BBC's flagship radio station, the legendary \"One in the jungle\" show. Initially presented by a revolving groups of jungle luminaries, hosted by MC Navigator, the station eventually secured the presenting services of Fabio and Grooverider, two of the oldest and most-respected DJs in the scene. Many DJs made a sudden shift from pirate radio to legal radio at this time.\n\nUp to this point, [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] was the only radio source of jungle music and in particular [[Kool FM]], and [[Don FM]]'s contribution to the development of this sound should not be overlooked or denied.<ref name=\"Fabio\"/> It is doubtful whether jungle would have gained popularity without pirate radio stations. The transition in name from \"jungle\" to \"drum and bass\" occurs at the same time as its legal appearance on airwaves.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web | url = http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/TUTORS.9.0.html?act_session=242 | title = Red Bull Academy Interview Zinc - Hardware Bingo| accessdate = September 4, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radiox.de/history/radiovisionen/KOOL.html | title = KOOL FM feature on radiox.de | accessdate = September 6, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060220201014/http://www.radiox.de/history/radiovisionen/KOOL.html | archivedate = February 20, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nAnother aspect to note in the evolution of drum and bass is that the advent of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] specifically aimed at stopping illegal [[Rave party|raves]] prompted the move of jungle (and other electronic music genres) into legal (mostly) nightclubs.\n\n===Jungle vs. drum and bass===\nNowadays the difference between jungle (or [[oldschool jungle]]) and drum and bass is a common debate within the junglist community. There is no universally accepted semantic distinction between the terms \"jungle\" and \"drum and bass\". Some associate \"jungle\" with older material from the first half of the 1990s (sometimes referred to as \"jungle techno\"), and see drum and bass as essentially succeeding jungle. Others use jungle as a shorthand for ragga jungle, a specific subgenre within the broader realm of drum and bass. Probably the widest held viewpoint within the scene in London is that the terms are simply synonymous and interchangeable: drum and bass is jungle, and jungle is drum and bass.\n\n==The birth of techstep==\nAs a lighter sound of drum and bass began to win over the musical mainstream, many Producers continued to work on the other end of the spectrum, resulting in a series of releases which highlighted a dark, techy sound which drew more influence from Techno and the soundscapes of science fiction and films. <!-- Removed [[Anime]]: Anime sound tracks are not necessarily prevalent in drum and bass thus caters to only a small group. Films in general would suffice as soundtracks from Anime films may refer to a similar yet different genre altogether. An example of this would be Jpop and Jrock. Though they are Pop and Rock, these genres are not necessarily related to their Japanese counterparts. Drum and Bass' presence within movies and television (among other media) is seemingly apparent, but to specify (or promote, rather) 'only' Anime films is entirely subjective and should be fixed. If Anime truly plays a big role in drum and bass, CITE IT and prove me wrong you anime crusaders! -->This style was championed by the labels Emotif and No U-Turn, and by artists like Trace, [[Ed Rush]], [[Optical (artist)|Optical]], and [[Dom & Roland]]. It is commonly referred to as techstep, which in turn gave birth to the [[neurofunk]] subgenre. Techstep focused intensely on studio production and applied new techniques of sound generation and processing to older Jungle approaches. Self-consciously underground, and lacking the accessible influences of much other drum and bass, techstep is deeply atmospheric, often characterized by sinister or science-fiction themes (including samples from cult films), cold and complex percussion, and dark, distorted basslines. The sound was a conscious move back towards the darker sounds of Belgian Techno and Darkside Hardcore (again the already mentioned darkcore), albeit with a greater electro / techno emphasis than darkcore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/music/int/1999/09/28/everything/print.html |title=Being Everything But The Girl article, Salon Magazine, September 28, 1998 |accessdate=January 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111114512/http://www.salon.com/ent/music/int/1999/09/28/everything/print.html |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe sound also marked a period when drum and bass became more insular and began to draw inspiration from itself rather than other musical genres. The sampler at this time became less important with home computer equipment and generated beats and sounds becoming capable of creating an entire drum and bass track from scratch.\n\nAs the 1990s drew to a close, drum and bass withdrew from mainstream popularity and concentrated on the new more ominous sounds which were popular in clubs, rather than on mainstream radio. Techstep came to dominate the drum and bass genre, with artists like [[Konflict]] and [[Bad Company (drum and bass group)|Bad Company]] amongst the most visible. As time went on, techstep became more minimal, and increasingly dark in tone, and the funky, commercial appeal represented by Roni Size back in 1997 waned. A characteristic of this was the increasing disproportion of male to female club goers and a generally more aggressive and dark atmosphere at clubs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=7&csid1=3760 | title = Point of View: Drum & Bass About Face by Martin Turenne at exclaim.ca | accessdate = September 6, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009014003/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=7&csid1=3760 | archivedate = October 9, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.descendingangel.com/nou-turn/intrview/int_srey.html | title = Web link reference| accessdate = September 6, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061016001810/http://www.descendingangel.com/nou-turn/intrview/int_srey.html |archivedate = October 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe withdrawal of drum and bass from the mainstream was not only a result of its growing fascination with its own (progressively darker) sound, but also resulted from the explosive birth and growing popularity of [[UK garage]] (2 step and 4x4 garage, aka speed garage), a musical genre heavily influenced by jungle, with similar beats, vocal and basslines but slower speeds and more friendly (or at least radio-friendly) beats.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.garagemusic.co.uk/2step.html | title = Adult Hardcore written by Simon Reynolds (originally published in ''The Wire'') on garagemusic.co.uk | accessdate = September 6, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030822103100/http://garagemusic.co.uk/2step.html | archive-date = August 22, 2003 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>2-Steps closer to America, a new dance mausic crosses the Atlantic to the beat of MJ Cole, Artful Dodge and others article, Boston Globe, July 6, 2001</ref> Drum and bass suddenly found itself losing popularity and established drum and bass producers expressed shock at its sudden alienation and abandonment by the general public.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.techno.de/mixmag/98.12/drum.1.html | title = Liquid Funk feature on techno.de| accessdate = September 6, 2006}}</ref> This turn fuelled the harder sound of [[techstep]].<ref name=\"Fabio\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\"And then garage came along: the death knell for drum and Bass.

Notable artists are [[DJ Hazard (musician)|DJ Hazard]], DJ Clipz and Taxman.\n\nThis modern period has also seen the development of the style known as \"dubwise\", which returns drum and bass to its reggae-influenced roots and combines them with modern production techniques which had advanced immeasurably since the early days of jungle. Although the dub-influenced sound was not new, having long been championed by artists like Digital and Spirit, 2003\u20132004 saw a significant increase in its popularity and visibility.\n\nSimilarly, whilst there had long been a niche dedicated almost entirely to detailed drum programming and manipulation, championed by the likes of [[Paradox (artist)|Paradox]], the first half of this decade saw a revival and expansion in the subgenre known variously as [[drumfunk]], \"edits\", or \"choppage\". Major labels include Inperspective and Synaptic Plastic and the new wave of artists in this style include ASC, Fanu, Breakage, Fracture and Neptune, 0=0 and Equinox.\n\n[[File:Goldiednbravechina2.gif|thumb|160px|left|Ravers & Goldie.]] The new millennium also saw a fresh wave of live drum and bass bands. The likes of Reprazent and Red Snapper had performed live drum and bass during the 1990s, but the re-creation of London Elektricity as a live band focussed renewed interest on the idea, with acts like The Bays, Keiretsu, Southampton based Gojira, [[Step 13]], Deadsilence Syndicate, and U.V Ray (feat. Yuval Gabay) as well as Birmingham's PCM, pursuing this avenue. In addition the popular [[Breakbeat Kaos]] label has begun to focus more and more on bringing a live sound into drum and bass, both in the records they release and in the live band (music played on live acoustic instruments, including guitar) night the previously signed group [[Pendulum (drum and bass group)|Pendulum]] have hosted in London (e.g. October 2006 at the Fabric club).\n\nIn 2003, [[Metalheadz]] signees Dylan and Robyn Chaos (aka Faith In Chaos) pushed the harder sound of drum and bass by founding the [[Freak Recordings]] label and sublabels Obscene and Tech Freak, together with artists like Technical Itch, [[Limewax]], [[Counterstrike (drum and bass group)|Counterstrike]], SPL, Current Value, and many others, leading to the creation of the Therapy Sessions drum and bass festivals in London. The Therapy Sessions franchise quickly expanded worldwide with greater repercussion on Eastern Europe with an attendance of more than 10.000 fans in cities like St. Petesburg.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Harry |last=Sword |url=http://www.datatransmission.co.uk/Features/609 |title=Data Transmission : EXTREME SUB-GENRE [sic] TOP 10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921091908/http://www.datatransmission.co.uk/Features/609 |archivedate=September 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNear the late 2000s, a genre known referred to as minimal drum & bass, also known as \"autonomic\" or \"microfunk\", emerged. This subgenre is identified primarily by its overall minimalistic song structure as well as its use of intricate percussion, deep sub-bass and subdued melodies.<ref name=\"RYM\">http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Minimal+Drum+and+Bass/</ref> Notable artists include ASC, Consequence, [[dBridge]], Instra:mental, Synkro, Oak and Bop (among many others). With popular labels that promote the sound being Exit Records (Owned by dBridge himself), Med School, Critical Music, Shogun Audio, Nonplus+ Records (Also Co-owned between dBridge and Instra:mental), Auxiliary (Owned by ASC) as well as the record label Autonomic. \"The Autonomic Podcast\" is a podcast that is released for free by those in Club Autonomic. 'Minimal' drum & bass has crossed over into a more dance-floor oriented sound through artists like Rockwell, Enei and Icicle who take inspiration from genres including neurofunk and industrial techno.\n\n==Drum 'n' bass and jazz fusion==\nAmerican Grammy Award-winning record producer, jazz fusion pioneer, and [[bassist]] [[Bill Laswell]] touched on [[drum and bass]] in the \u201890s with his ''Oscillations'' releases and the compilation Submerged: Tetragramaton. Laswell stepped up his work in drum 'n' bass starting with ''Brutal Calling'' (2004), an eight-track hard drum 'n' bass album with Ohm Resistance label owner [[Submerged (DJ)]]/producer Kurt Gluck followed by a series of releases and live dates. Laswell\u2019s newest project in this vein is Method of Defiance. The first release focused on the core of Laswell and Submerged once again, with contributions from [[Toshinori Kondo]] and Guy Licata.\n\nThe second release under the Method of Defiance moniker was a compilation style project focusing on drum 'n' bass. ''Inamorata'' stretched the concept out, pairing Laswell\u2019s bass with a different combination of respected jazz and world musicians and drum 'n' bass producers on each track. Artists including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[John Zorn]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Nils Petter Molvaer]], [[Toshinori Kondo]] and [[Buckethead]] were paired with drum 'n' bass producers including [[Amit Kamboj|Amit]], [[Paradox (artist)|Paradox]], [[Submerged (DJ)|Submerged]], [[Evol Intent]], Fanu and [[Corrupt Souls]]. He also released a full-on collaboration with Finnish drum 'n' bass maestro Fanu on Ohm Resistance (US) and [[Karl Records]] (Europe), entitled ''Lodge'', which includes contributions from Molvaer and Bernie Worrell amongst others. The concept of the group has once again morphed into a full band concept. In 2009, RareNoiseRecords released ''Live in Nihon'', which showcased this new direction/grouping. The group now consisted of Laswell, Guy Licata, Dr. Israel, [[Toshinori Kondo]] and [[Bernie Worrell]].\n\n==North America beginnings and scene==\nThe rave scenes in the US (New York) and in Canada (Toronto) embraced the transition of hardcore to jungle around 1994. America's longest running party, Konkrete Jungle also born in NYC, discovered the first US drum and bass MC's Blaise (Naughty Ride), Panic and Johnny Z. Outside of NYC. [[1.8.7]] and Dieselboy in Pittsburgh, Karl K and Method One in Philadelphia and DJ Slant and DJ Stress from the 2Tuff Crew in D.C. along with Krazy Josifer and Mark Wease from the Life of Leisure Crew in Washington DC. This small handful of US East Coast pioneers spent years in the underground playing back rooms before the sound caught on throughout America. A seminal moment in the breakthrough of the sound was the first large scale all Jungle/Drum 'n' Bass event in the US called Jungle Warfare which took place in Pittsburgh in 1996 which people from all over the East Coast attended. As a result of its success as well as the attendance of several influential rave promoters, many events in the US began to feature the sound in the main room or on the main stage.\n\nPerhaps most responsible for the extensive introduction of drum and bass to the U.S. during the mid-1990s was Bassquake, a prime time Drum And Bass radio programme created by DJ [[Michele Sainte]] (previously known for playing Breakbeat and Techno at raves and venues throughout North America) that aired each week on 103.3FM [[WPRB]] which is a commercial radio station at [[Princeton University]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] with audiences in both New York and Philadelphia. Also partly responsible was Bassrush, headed by Raymond Frances, whose innovation was to present House, Techno, and Drum & Bass in separate rooms\u2014making Drum & Bass, for the first time, a major feature at U.S. rave parties. The Bassrush DJ Agency also introduced many major UK DJs to the American scene, including Shy FX, Kenny Ken, and DJ Randall.\n\nWhile New York and Toronto thrived in this culture in the early '90s, new scenes were rapidly gaining recognition in the mid '90s to late '90s in: Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Orlando, Denver, Seattle, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Producers and DJs such as [[AK1200]] (ORL), [[DJ Dara]] (NY), Danny the Wildchild (CHI), Krazy Josifer (DC), and in particular [[Dieselboy]] (PIT) who helped push the genre darker and further by producing, promoting, releasing compilations available for the public, and performing at raves. Following the growing commercial and crossover success of another Pittsburgh native, [[1.8.7]] (whose early studio Dieselboy learned about production in) Dieselboy also became one of the first US producers and DJs to break out on the international scene. [[Evol Intent]], [[Gridlok]], Ewun and SPL have followed suit.\n\nThese artists have had a profound effect on the surrounding areas movements, causing drum and bass to spread in the majority of the United States. Clubs such as Buzz (DC), Breakdown (DEN),Elements (BOS), Seminar (CHI), Spy (CLE), Firestone (ORL), Platinum (PHI), Eklektic (SF), Science (LA), Respect (LA), Masquerade (ATL) and Baltic Room (SEA) helped generate a scene outside of the then prosperous rave scene.\n\nIn 2000 [[Dieselboy]] joined forces with [[AK1200]] and [[DJ Dara]] to create an annual tour, the [[Planet of the Drums]]. Since 2001 [[Messinian]] (James Fiorella, Philadelphia, PA) has been the MC. At ten consecutive years (2009), it is the longest-running annual tour in electronic dance music history.\n\nIn 2009, Dieselboy created The Monsters of Jungle, a tour concept featuring artists on his label, [[Human Imprint]]. The aesthetic is '80s metal meets drum and bass. It launched at the 11th Annual Starscape Festival in Baltimore, Maryland, in June 2009 as a multi-media stage production including custom visuals, and new music and spoken word audio prepared especially for the show. The first Monsters of Jungle tour featured Dieselboy, the Upbeats (New Zealand), Evol Intent, Ewun, Demo, Infiltrata, Joe Way, Mayhem, SPKTRM, MC Messinian, and MC Dino.\n\n==South America==\nBrazil's fusion of Drum & Bass and Bossa Nova or Samba gave birth to the term Sambass which was pushed by [[DJ Marky]] together with [[DJ Patife]], [[XRS]] and [[Drumagick]], and shortly after the sound conquered the UK scene due to the global popularity that Marky achieved, supported by a residency at [[The End (club)|The End]] club and his work for [[BBC Radio 1]]. In Venezuela, DJ Alex (Venezuela's first Drum & Bass DJ and founder of the Simpl3 crew), also known as Modovisual for his graphic design, has created several designs for international events and also merchandising for Dogsonacid.com.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111128132118/http://www.dogsonacid.com/system/shop/product-detail.php?productID=342 DOA MODO VISUAL HOODY]</ref> Venezuelan producer and DJ [[Zardonic]] has been leading the harder sound of Drum & Bass by headlining the first Therapy Sessions events taking place in [[Ecuador]] and [[Argentina]], as well as pushing the country even further on the map due to his signing to Dieselboy's [[Human Imprint]] label.<ref>[http://humanimprint.com/?p=279 ZARDONIC - South Of Human EP Available Now HUMAN / subHUMAN]</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n* ''All Crews: Journeys Through Jungle / Drum and Bass Culture'' by Brian Belle-Fortune ({{ISBN|978-0-9548897-0-8}}), nonfiction\n* ''Knowledge Magazine Article on the history of drum & bass radio pirates'' by Sarah Bentley<ref>[http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1058&ReviewID=1682&PageNumber=1 knowledgemag.co.uk]</ref>\n* ''Roots 'n Future'' by Simon Reynolds ({{ISBN|978-0-330-35056-3}}), nonfiction\n* ''Rumble in the Jungle: The Invisible History of Drum and Bass'' by Steven Quinn, Transformations, No 3 (2002), nonfiction ({{ISSN|1444-3775}}) [http://transformations.cqu.edu.au/journal/issue_03/pdf/quinn.pdf PDF file]\n* ''State of bass, jungle: the story so far'' by Martin James, Boxtree ({{ISBN|978-0-7522-2323-0}}), nonfiction\n* ''The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass'' by [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] and Alexix Maryon ({{ISBN|978-1-85828-433-0}}), nonfiction\n* ''King Rat'' by China Melville ({{ISBN|978-0-330-37098-1}}), fiction\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090630054801/http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoID=2016083719 \"London Something Dis\", a 1994 documentary on the history of drum & bass]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160209225339/http://www.dubechoes.com/ \"Dub Echoes\", a documentary about dub's influence on the birth of drum n bass, electronic music and hip hop]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/events/xtrabass06/interact/timeline.shtml?id=1 \"History of drum & bass\", a BBC timeline on the history of drum & bass with track listings, quotes and samples]\n\n{{Drum and bass-footer}}\n{{Electronica}}\n{{Breakbeat-footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Drum And Bass}}\n[[Category:Drum and bass| ]]\n[[Category:Electronic music genres]]\n[[Category:Music in London]]\n[[Category:Breakbeat]]\n", "name_user": "Danielt998", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: ,E \u2192 , E", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_drum_and_bass"}

It is located near the confluence of the [[Winisk River|Winisk]] and [[Shamattawa River|Shamattawa]] rivers, about 35&nbsp;km from the Winisk River's end in [[Hudson Bay]]. Its population is 237.<ref name=\"cp2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3560091&Geo2=CD&Code2=3560&Data=Count&SearchText=p&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=35&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Peawanuck census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIts population used to live in the community of [[Winisk 90|Winisk]] ({{coord|55|16|N|85|11|W}}), near the mouth of the Winisk River.

The community was relocated thirty kilometers up-river on higher ground. The new settlement was renamed Peawanuck, meaning \"flintstone\" in the [[Cree language]]. It only took seven months for the community to be rebuilt in Peawanuck, with much credit going to the community members who were determined to have their new homes ready by the winter.

The community was relocated thirty kilometers up-river on higher ground. The new settlement was renamed Peawanuck, meaning \"flintstone\" in the [[Cree language]].

{"title_page": "Metric prefix", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nA '''metric prefix''' is a [[unit prefix]] that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of the unit. While all metric prefixes in common use today are [[decimal|decadic]], historically there have been a number of [[binary number|binary]] metric prefixes as well.<ref name=\"fr\"/> Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix ''[[kilo-]]'', for example, may be added to ''gram'' to indicate ''multiplication'' by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix ''[[milli-]]'', likewise, may be added to ''metre'' to indicate ''division'' by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.\n\nDecimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the [[metric system]], with six of these dating back to the system's introduction in the 1790s. Metric prefixes have also been used with some non-metric units. The '''SI prefixes''' are metric prefixes that were standardized for use in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/prefixes.html |title=Four Resolutions |publisher=Bipm.org |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> Since 2009, they have formed part of the [[International System of Quantities]]. They are also used in the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]] (UCUM)\n\n==List of SI prefixes==\nThe BIPM specifies twenty prefixes for the International System of Units (SI).\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\nEach prefix name has a symbol that is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure. For example, the symbol for ''kilo-'' is k, and is used to produce km, kg, and kW, which are the SI symbols for kilometre, kilogram, and kilowatt, respectively. Except for the early prefixes of ''kilo-'', ''hecto-'', and ''deca-'', the symbols for the multiplicative prefixes are uppercase letters, and those for the fractional prefixes are lowercase letters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/metric-prefixes-and-si-units/all |title=Metric Prefixes and SI Units |website=learn.sparkfun.com |access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> There is a [[Unicode]] symbol for micro ''\u00b5'' for use if the Greek letter ''\u03bc'' is unavailable. When both are unavailable, the visually similar lowercase Latin letter ''u'' is commonly used instead. SI unit symbols are never in italics.\n\nPrefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred. Hence 100&nbsp;m is preferred over 1&nbsp;hm (hectometre) or 10&nbsp;dam (decametres). The prefixes ''hecto-'', ''deca-'', ''deci-'', and ''centi-'' are commonly used for everyday purposes, and the centimetre (cm) is especially common. However, some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre, because \"use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215115519/http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |title=METRIC DESIGN GUIDE (PBS-PQ260) |author=Public Buildings Service, U.S. General Services Administration |date=September 1995 |website=National Institute of Building Sciences |accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPrefixes may not be used in combination. This also applies to [[mass]], for which the [[SI base unit]] (kilogram) already contains a prefix. For example, milligram (mg) is used instead of microkilogram (\u03bckg).\n\nIn the arithmetic of measurements having units, the units are treated as multiplicative factors to values. If they have prefixes, all but one of the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier, except when combining values with identical units. Hence:\n* {{val|5|u=mV}} \u00d7 {{val|5|u=mA}} = {{val|5|e=-3|u=V}} \u00d7 {{val|5|e=-3|u=A}} = {{val|25|e=-6|u=V\u22c5A}} = {{val|25|u=uW}}.\n* {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|10|u=uV}} = {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|0.01|u=mV}} = {{val|5.01|u=mV}}.\n\nWhen [[Exponentiation|powers]] of units occur, for example, squared or cubed, the multiplicative prefix must be considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation:\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one [[square kilometre]], or the [[area]] of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] of {{val|1000|u=m}} by {{val|1000|u=m}} and not {{val|1000}} [[square metre]]s.\n* 2&nbsp;Mm<sup>3</sup> means two cubic [[megametre]]s, or the [[volume]] of two [[cube]]s of {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} or {{val|2|e=18|u=m3}}, and not {{val|2000000}} [[cubic metre]]s ({{val|2|e=6|u=m3}}).\n\n;Examples\n* {{val|5|u=cm}} =&nbsp;{{val|5|e=-2|u=m}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|5 \u00d7 0.01 m}} =&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;m.\n* {{val|9|u=km2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup> m)<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 m<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{val|9|e=6|u=m2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 {{val|1000000|u=m2}}}} =&nbsp;{{val|9000000|u=m2}}.\n* 3&nbsp;MW =&nbsp;{{val|3|e=6|u=W}} =&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{val|1000000|u=W}} = {{val|3000000|u=W}}.\n\n== Application to units of measurement ==\nThe use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, long before the 1960 introduction of the SI. The prefixes, including those introduced after 1960, are used with any metric unit, whether officially included in the SI or not (e.g., millidynes and milligauss). Metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units.\n\nThe choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use. Unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used.\n\n=== Metric units ===\n\n==== Mass ====\nThe units [[kilogram]], [[gram]], [[milligram]], microgram, and smaller are commonly used for measurement of [[mass]]. However, megagram, gigagram, and larger are rarely used; [[tonne]]s (and kilotonnes, megatonnes, etc.) or [[scientific notation]] are used instead. Megagram and teragram are occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from other units with the name 'ton'.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe kilogram is the only base unit of the [[International System of Units]] that includes a metric prefix.\n\n====Volume====\nThe [[litre]] (equal to a cubic decimetre), millilitre (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, and smaller are common. In Europe, the centilitre is often used for packaged products such as wine and the decilitre is used less frequently.\n\nLarger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres, megalitres or gigalitres, or else in cubic metres (1 cubic metre = 1 kilolitre) or cubic kilometres (1 cubic kilometre = 1 teralitre). For scientific purposes, the cubic metre is usually used.\n\n====Length====\nThe kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, and smaller are common. (However, the decimetre is rarely used.) The micrometre is often referred to by the non-SI term ''[[Micrometre#SI standardization|micron]]''. In some fields, such as [[chemistry]], the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (equal to 0.1&nbsp;nm) historically competed with the nanometre. The [[femtometre]], used mainly in particle physics, is sometimes called a [[fermi (unit)|fermi]]. For large scales, megametre, gigametre, and larger are rarely used. Instead, non-metric units are used, such as the [[solar radius]], [[astronomical unit]]s, [[light year]]s, and [[parsec]]s; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non-SI unit.\n\n====Time====\n{{see also|Metric time|Orders of magnitude (time)}}\nPrefixes for the SI standard unit [[second]] are most commonly encountered for quantities less than one second. For larger quantities, the system of [[minute]]s (60 seconds), [[hour]]s (60 minutes) and [[day]]s (24 hours) is [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|accepted for use with the SI]] and more commonly used. When speaking of spans of time, the length of the day is usually standardized to 86,400 seconds so as not to create issues with the irregular [[leap second]]. \n\nLarger multiples of the second such as kiloseconds and megaseconds are occasionally encountered in scientific contexts, but are seldom used in common parlance. For long-scale scientific work, particularly in [[astronomy]], the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] or ''annum'' is a standardized variant of the [[year]], equal to exactly 31,557,600 SI seconds (365 days, 6 hours). The unit is so named because it was the average length of a year in the  [[Julian calendar]]. Long time periods are then expressed by using metric prefixes with the annum, such as megaannum or gigaannum.\n\n====Angle====\nThe SI unit of angle is the [[radian]], but degrees, minutes, seconds and more rarely tierces see some scientific use.\n\n====Temperature====\nOfficial policy also varies from common practice for the degree Celsius (\u00b0C). NIST states:<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\"/> 'Prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol \u00b0C and prefix names may be used with the unit name ''degree Celsius''. For example, 12&nbsp;m\u00b0C (12 millidegrees Celsius) is acceptable.' In practice, it is more common for prefixes to be used with the [[kelvin]] when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences. Thus, temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of MK (megakelvins), and molecular cooling may be described in mK (millikelvins).\n\n====Energy====\nIn use the [[joule]] and kilojoule are common, with larger multiples seen in limited contexts. In addition, the [[kilowatt hour]], a composite unit formed from the [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] and hour, is often used for electrical energy; other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt (e.g. terawatt hour).\n\nThere exist a number of definitions for the non-SI unit, the [[calorie]]. There are gram calories and kilogram calories. One kilogram calorie, which equals one thousand gram calories, often appears capitalized and without a prefix (i.e. ''Cal'') when referring to '[[Calorie|dietary calories]]' in food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html|title=Remarkable Calorie|last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> It is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie, but not to the kilogram calorie: thus, 1&nbsp;kcal = 1,000&nbsp;cal = 1&nbsp;Cal.\n\n===Non-metric units===\nMetric prefixes are widely used outside the system of [[metric system|metric units]]. Common examples include the [[megabyte]] and the [[decibel]]. Metric prefixes rarely appear with [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US]] units except in some special cases (e.g., microinch, kilofoot, [[kilopound]]). They are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g., [[megaelectronvolt]], [[gigaparsec]], [[millibarn]]). They are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g., gigadollar), mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In astronomy, geology, and paleontology, the [[Year#Symbols|year]], with symbol a (from the Latin ''annus''), is commonly used with metric prefixes: [[Kiloannus|ka]], Ma, and Ga.\n\nOfficial policies about the use of SI prefixes with non-SI units vary slightly between the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). For instance, the NIST advises that 'to avoid confusion, prefix symbols (and prefix names) are not used with the time-related unit symbols (names) min (minute), h (hour), d (day); nor with the angle-related symbols (names) \u00b0&nbsp;(degree), \u2032&nbsp;(minute), and \u2033&nbsp;(second)',<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\">{{Citation|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec06.html|title=Special Publication 811|edition=2008|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|date=March 2008|work=NIST|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> whereas the BIPM adds information about the use of prefixes with the symbol ''as'' for arcsecond when they state: 'However astronomers use milliarcsecond, which they denote mas, and microarcsecond, \u03bcas, which they use as units for measuring very small angles.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html |title=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) |publisher= International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n\n===Pronunciation===\nWhen a metric prefix is affixed to a root word, the prefix carries the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} For example, ''[[kilobyte]]'' is {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u1d7b|l|\u0252|b|a\u026a|t}}, with stress on the first syllable. However, units in common use outside the scientific community may be stressed [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncratic_property|idiosyncratically]]. In English-speaking countries, ''kilometre'' is the most conspicuous example. It is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u1d7b|\u02c8|l|\u0252|m|\u1d7b|t|\u0259r}}, with [[reduced vowel]]s on both syllables of ''metre''. This stress is not applied to other multiples or sub-multiples of metre, or to other units prefixed with ''kilo-''.\n\nThe prefix ''giga'' is usually pronounced in English as {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with hard \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''get'', but sometimes {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with soft \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''gin''.\n\n===Typesetting===\nThe [[LaTeX]] typesetting system features an ''SIunitx'' package in which the units of measurement are spelled out, for example, <code>\\SI{3}{\\tera\\hertz}</code> formats as ''3 THz''.\n\n==Non-standard prefixes==\n[[File:Myriameterstein36R\u00fcdesheimRhein.JPG|thumb|Distance marker on the [[Rhine]]: 36 (XXXVI) myriametres from [[Basel]].

While all metric prefixes in common use today are [[decimal|decadic]], historically there have been a number of [[binary number|binary]] metric prefixes as well.<ref name=\"fr\"/> Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix ''[[kilo-]]'', for example, may be added to ''gram'' to indicate ''multiplication'' by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix ''[[milli-]]'', likewise, may be added to ''metre'' to indicate ''division'' by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.\n\nDecimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the [[metric system]], with six of these dating back to the system's introduction in the 1790s. Metric prefixes have also been used with some non-metric units. The '''SI prefixes''' are metric prefixes that were standardized for use in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/prefixes.html |title=Four Resolutions |publisher=Bipm.org |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> Since 2009, they have formed part of the [[International System of Quantities]]. They are also used in the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]] (UCUM)\n\n==List of SI prefixes==\nThe BIPM specifies twenty prefixes for the International System of Units (SI).\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\nEach prefix name has a symbol that is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure. For example, the symbol for ''kilo-'' is k, and is used to produce km, kg, and kW, which are the SI symbols for kilometre, kilogram, and kilowatt, respectively. Except for the early prefixes of ''kilo-'', ''hecto-'', and ''deca-'', the symbols for the multiplicative prefixes are uppercase letters, and those for the fractional prefixes are lowercase letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/metric-prefixes-and-si-units/all|title=Metric Prefixes and SI Units - learn.sparkfun.com|website=learn.sparkfun.com|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> There is a [[Unicode]] symbol for micro ''\u00b5'' for use if the Greek letter ''\u03bc'' is unavailable. When both are unavailable, the visually similar lowercase Latin letter ''u'' is commonly used instead. SI unit symbols are never in italics.\n\nPrefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred. Hence 100&nbsp;m is preferred over 1&nbsp;hm (hectometre) or 10&nbsp;dam (decametres). The prefixes ''hecto-'', ''deca-'', ''deci-'', and ''centi-'' are commonly used for everyday purposes, and the centimetre (cm) is especially common. However, some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre, because 'use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215115519/http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=15 December 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPrefixes may not be used in combination. This also applies to [[mass]], for which the [[SI base unit]] (kilogram) already contains a prefix. For example, milligram (mg) is used instead of microkilogram (\u03bckg).\n\nIn the arithmetic of measurements having units, the units are treated as multiplicative factors to values. If they have prefixes, all but one of the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier, except when combining values with identical units. Hence,\n* {{val|5|u=mV}} \u00d7 {{val|5|u=mA}} = {{val|5|e=-3|u=V}} \u00d7 {{val|5|e=-3|u=A}} = {{val|25|e=-6|u=V\u22c5A}} = {{val|25|u=uW}}\n* {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|10|u=uV}} = {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|0.01|u=mV}} = {{val|5.01|u=mV}}\n\nWhen [[Exponentiation|powers]] of units occur, for example, squared or cubed, the multiplicative prefix must be considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation.\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one [[square kilometre]], or the [[area]] of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] of {{val|1000|u=m}} by {{val|1000|u=m}} and not {{val|1000}} [[square metre]]s.\n* 2&nbsp;Mm<sup>3</sup> means two cubic [[megametre]]s, or the [[volume]] of two [[cube]]s of {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} or {{val|2|e=18|u=m3}}, and not {{val|2000000}} [[cubic metre]]s ({{val|2|e=6|u=m3}}).\n\n;Examples\n* {{val|5|u=cm}} =&nbsp;{{val|5|e=-2|u=m}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|5 \u00d7 0.01 m}} =&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;m\n* {{val|9|u=km2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup> m)<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 m<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{val|9|e=6|u=m2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 {{val|1000000|u=m2}}}} =&nbsp;{{val|9000000|u=m2}}\n* 3&nbsp;MW =&nbsp;{{val|3|e=6|u=W}} =&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{val|1000000|u=W}} = {{val|3000000|u=W}}\n\n== Application to units of measurement ==\nThe use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, long before the 1960 introduction of the SI. The prefixes, including those introduced after 1960, are used with any metric unit, whether officially included in the SI or not (e.g., millidynes and milligauss). Metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units.\n\nThe choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use. Unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used.\n\n=== Metric units ===\n\n==== Mass ====\nThe units [[kilogram]], [[gram]], [[milligram]], microgram, and smaller are commonly used for measurement of [[mass]]. However, megagram, gigagram, and larger are rarely used; [[tonne]]s (and kilotonnes, megatonnes, etc.) or [[scientific notation]] are used instead. Megagram and teragram are occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from other units with the name 'ton'.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe kilogram is the only base unit of the [[International System of Units]] that includes a metric prefix.\n\n====Volume====\nThe [[litre]] (equal to a cubic decimetre), millilitre (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, and smaller are common. In Europe, the centilitre is often used for packaged products such as wine and the decilitre is used less frequently.\n\nLarger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres, megalitres or gigalitres, or else in cubic metres (1 cubic metre = 1 kilolitre) or cubic kilometres (1 cubic kilometre = 1 teralitre). For scientific purposes, the cubic metre is usually used.\n\n====Length====\nThe kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, and smaller are common. (However, the decimetre is rarely used.) The micrometre is often referred to by the non-SI term ''[[Micrometre#SI standardization|micron]]''. In some fields, such as [[chemistry]], the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (equal to 0.1&nbsp;nm) historically competed with the nanometre. The [[femtometre]], used mainly in particle physics, is sometimes called a [[fermi (unit)|fermi]]. For large scales, megametre, gigametre, and larger are rarely used. Instead, non-metric units are used, such as the [[solar radius]], [[astronomical unit]]s, [[light year]]s, and [[parsec]]s; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non-SI unit.\n\n====Time====\n{{see also|Metric time|Orders of magnitude (time)}}\nPrefixes for the SI standard unit [[second]] are most commonly encountered for quantities less than one second. For larger quantities, the system of [[minute]]s (60 seconds), [[hour]]s (60 minutes) and [[day]]s (24 hours) is [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|accepted for use with the SI]] and more commonly used. When speaking of spans of time, the length of the day is usually standardized to 86,400 seconds so as not to create issues with the irregular [[leap second]]. \n\nLarger multiples of the second such as kiloseconds and megaseconds are occasionally encountered in scientific contexts, but are seldom used in common parlance. For long-scale scientific work, particularly in [[astronomy]], the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] or ''annum'' is a standardized variant of the [[year]], equal to exactly 31,557,600 SI seconds (365 days, 6 hours). The unit is so named because it was the average length of a year in the  [[Julian calendar]]. Long time periods are then expressed by using metric prefixes with the annum, such as megaannum or gigaannum.\n\n====Angle====\nThe SI unit of angle is the [[radian]], but degrees, minutes, seconds and more rarely tierces see some scientific use.\n\n====Temperature====\nOfficial policy also varies from common practice for the degree Celsius (\u00b0C). NIST states:<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\"/> 'Prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol \u00b0C and prefix names may be used with the unit name ''degree Celsius''. For example, 12&nbsp;m\u00b0C (12 millidegrees Celsius) is acceptable.' In practice, it is more common for prefixes to be used with the [[kelvin]] when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences. Thus, temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of MK (megakelvins), and molecular cooling may be described in mK (millikelvins).\n\n====Energy====\nIn use the [[joule]] and kilojoule are common, with larger multiples seen in limited contexts. In addition, the [[kilowatt hour]], a composite unit formed from the [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] and hour, is often used for electrical energy; other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt (e.g. terawatt hour).\n\nThere exist a number of definitions for the non-SI unit, the [[calorie]]. There are gram calories and kilogram calories. One kilogram calorie, which equals one thousand gram calories, often appears capitalized and without a prefix (i.e. ''Cal'') when referring to '[[Calorie|dietary calories]]' in food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html|title=Remarkable Calorie|last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> It is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie, but not to the kilogram calorie: thus, 1&nbsp;kcal = 1,000&nbsp;cal = 1&nbsp;Cal.\n\n===Non-metric units===\nMetric prefixes are widely used outside the system of [[metric system|metric units]]. Common examples include the [[megabyte]] and the [[decibel]]. Metric prefixes rarely appear with [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US]] units except in some special cases (e.g., microinch, kilofoot, [[kilopound]]). They are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g., [[megaelectronvolt]], [[gigaparsec]], [[millibarn]]). They are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g., gigadollar), mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In astronomy, geology, and paleontology, the [[Year#Symbols|year]], with symbol a (from the Latin ''annus''), is commonly used with metric prefixes: [[Kiloannus|ka]], Ma, and Ga.\n\nOfficial policies about the use of SI prefixes with non-SI units vary slightly between the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). For instance, the NIST advises that 'to avoid confusion, prefix symbols (and prefix names) are not used with the time-related unit symbols (names) min (minute), h (hour), d (day); nor with the angle-related symbols (names) \u00b0&nbsp;(degree), \u2032&nbsp;(minute), and \u2033&nbsp;(second)',<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\">{{Citation|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec06.html|title=Special Publication 811|edition=2008|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|date=March 2008|work=NIST|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> whereas the BIPM adds information about the use of prefixes with the symbol ''as'' for arcsecond when they state: 'However astronomers use milliarcsecond, which they denote mas, and microarcsecond, \u03bcas, which they use as units for measuring very small angles.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html |title=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) |publisher= International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n\n===Pronunciation===\nWhen a metric prefix is affixed to a root word, the prefix carries the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} For example, ''[[kilobyte]]'' is {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u1d7b|l|\u0252|b|a\u026a|t}}, with stress on the first syllable. However, units in common use outside the scientific community may be stressed [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncratic_property|idiosyncratically]]. In English-speaking countries, ''kilometre'' is the most conspicuous example. It is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u1d7b|\u02c8|l|\u0252|m|\u1d7b|t|\u0259r}}, with [[reduced vowel]]s on both syllables of ''metre''. This stress is not applied to other multiples or sub-multiples of metre, or to other units prefixed with ''kilo-''.\n\nThe prefix ''giga'' is usually pronounced in English as {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with hard \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''get'', but sometimes {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with soft \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''gin''.\n\n===Typesetting===\nThe [[LaTeX]] typesetting system features an ''SIunitx'' package in which the units of measurement are spelled out, for example, <code>\\SI{3}{\\tera\\hertz}</code> formats as ''3 THz''.\n\n==Non-standard prefixes==\n[[File:Myriameterstein36R\u00fcdesheimRhein.JPG|thumb|Distance marker on the [[Rhine]]: 36 (XXXVI) myriametres from [[Basel]].

In these cases, an uppercase K is often used with an implied unit (although it could then be confused with the symbol for the kelvin temperature unit if the context is unclear).
