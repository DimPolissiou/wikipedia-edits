It is believed to be the oldest surviving martial art in India. It also is considered to be among the oldest martial arts still in existence, with its origin in the [[martial arts timeline]] dating back to at least the 3rd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|last=Deleury|first=Guy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIDuAAAAIAAJ|title=India: The Rebel Continent|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=1403924880|page=89}}</ref> \n\nKalaripayattu is also mentioned in the [[Vadakkan Pattukal]] ballads written about the [[Chekavar]] from the Malabar region of Kerala.

Practitioners of Kalaripayattu possess intricate knowledge of pressure points on the human body and healing techniques that incorporate the knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga. Students are taught the martial art as a way of life, with a sense of compassion, discipline, and respect toward the master, fellow-students, parents and the community. Particular emphasis is placed on avoiding confrontational situations and using the martial art only as a means of protection, when no other alternative is available.\n\nUnlike other parts of India, warriors in Kerala belonged to all castes.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1992\">{{cite journal|author=Zarrilli, Phillip B.|first=|date=|year=1992|title=To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots (Marmmam/Varmam) in Two South Indian Martial Traditions Part I: Focus on Kerala's Kalarippayattu|url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/healharm.html|journal=[[Journal of Asian Martial Arts]]|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> Women in Keralite society also underwent training in Kalaripayattu, and still do so to this day.

They are the Northern style, or ''Vadakkan Kalari'', and the Southern style, or ''Thekkan Kalari.''<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nA newer style of Kalaripayattu called the Central style, or ''Madhya Kalari'', which claims to combine elements of the Northern and Southern styles of Kalaripayattu is also being taught in Kerala. The legitimacy of this style is controversial due to its recent development and the lack of consensus of its existence amongst Kalaripayattu practitioners.<ref name=\"Luijendijk 08\" /> \n\nA smaller, regional style of Kalaripayattu called ''Tulunadan Kalari,'' is referenced in texts such as the [[Vadakkan Pattukal]], but it is largely restricted to the [[Tulu Nadu]] region in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka.\n\nOther smaller, regional styles are also said to exist in isolated regions of Kerala, but these styles are becoming increasingly rare, and difficult to find. \n\n== History ==\nThe word, \u201c''Kalaripayattu'',\u201d is said to be derived from the from the name of [[Hindu]] deity ''Khaloorika [[Bhagavati|Bhagavathy]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ia802801.us.archive.org/27/items/ahandbookonkalaipayattuorg/A%20Handbook%20on%20Kalaipayattu%20Org.pdf%3C/ref%3E|title=A Handbook on Kalaripayattu|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The word Kalari is also found in [[Sangam literature]]. The ''[[Akananuru]]'' and ''[[Purananuru]]'' describe the use of spears, swords, shields, bows and [[silambam]] in the Sangam era. The word ''kalari'' also appears in the ''Puram'' (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and ''Akam'' (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word ''kalari tatt'' denoted a martial feat, while ''kalari kozhai'' meant a coward in war. Each warrior in the Sangam era received regular military training<ref name=\"Subramanian, N. 1966\">Subramanian, N. (1966). ''[[iarchive:in.ernet.dli.2015.111129|Sangam polity]]''.

In that period and during later periods, the word used for military and military service was ''chevam''. The warriors or soldiers in military service were was called [[Chekavar]]. They specialized in one or more of the important weapons of the period including the spear (''vel''), sword (''val''), shield (''kedaham''), and bow and arrow (''vil ambu'').

Northern Kalaripayattu, or \"Vadakkan Kalari\" is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions, jumps and weapons training, while the southern \"Thekkan Kalari\" style specializes in hard, impact based techniques with priority on hand-to-hand combat and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts. Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor, as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor. Some of the methods used to enhance flexibility in Kalaripayattu are also utilized in Keralite dance forms such as Kathakali.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\" /> Dancers in Kerala who had experience with Kalaripayattu were noted to be markedly better than the other performers. Some traditional Indian dance schools still incorporate Kalaripayattu as part of their training regimen.\n\n== Techniques and teaching==\n[[File:JasmineSimhalan-kalaripayatt-silambam.gif|right|[[Jasmine Simhalan]] performing steps and postures<br />|frame]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu Vidhyarambham.jpg|thumb|Ritualistic ceremony by which a Guru welcomes a new child by the to the Kalari on [[Vidy\u0101ra\u1e43bha\u1e43]].]]\n[[File:Kalari Poothara Pooja.jpg|thumb|Kalari Poothara Pooja is a ritualistic act performed in every kalari during [[Navaratri]] festival in every kalari to honour the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]].]]\n\nTraditions and methods of teaching of Kalaripayattu varied between different regions of Kerala. Kalaripayattu is taught in a specialized training ground known as a ''Kalari.'' Each kalari is built in accordance to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] architectural treatises such as the [[Vastu shastra|Vastu Shastras]] and [[Shilpa Shastras]], along with various religious traditions and customs native to [[Kerala]]. The presiding deity of Kalaripayattu is said to be [[Shiva]] as well as [[Bhadrakali]]. Before every training session in the Kalari, salutations are provides to the presiding deities in the form of a [[mantra]], or prayer.\n\nKalari Salutation Mantra\u00a0:\n\n\u00a0\n\"\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d23\u0d3f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d17\u0d3e\u0d2f\u0d38\u0d2e\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d25\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d36\u0d3f\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2f \u0d17\u0d41\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d35 \u0d28\u0d2e\u0d03\u201d\n\n(Sarva Thantra Swaroopaya\n\nSarva Thantra Swaroopini\n\nSarvagaya Samasthaya\n\nShivaya Guruve Namath)\n\nHistorically, all Keralites of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] community, men and women alike, would undergo mandatory training in Kalaripayattu beginning at the age of 7 or 9 and lasting until the end of their education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvnkalari.in/training.html|title=....#CVN KALARI#....|website=cvnkalari.in|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  Warriors, soldiers and others who wanted to pursue a martial career would continue their training for the rest of their lives. Generally, two styles of Kalaripayattu are acknowledged among Kalari practitioners: the Northern Style and the Southern Style.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://kalaripayattuclass.com/about-kalaripayattu/|title=About Kalaripayattu|website=Kalaripayattu Class|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  These two systems are quite similar, but their training methods begin to diverge to specialize in either weapons or hand-to-hand combat. The styles are variations that various masters have adapted and modified according to their understanding of the art. Development and mastery of Kalaripayattu comes from the tradition of constantly learning, adapting and improving the techniques by observing what techniques are practical and effective. There is a great amount of respect and observation of tradition which allows the preservation of the art. The knowledge and experience gained by the practitioners is improved upon by subsequent masters who utilize keen observation, research of various techniques and variations to update the knowledge. The adaptability of Kalaripayattu is largely due to Kalaripayattu being designed for use in warfare and combat. A Kalari practitioner might encounter new fighting techniques from an enemy combatant. The Kalari practitioner would need to learn how to anticipate, adapt to and neutralize these new techniques. This is especially seen in the Southern style of Kalaripayattu, which is believed to have been adapted and modified during wars with [[Tamils|Tamil]] kingdoms to counter martial arts like [[Silambam]], which was one of the main martial art forms practiced by Tamil soldiers at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://silambam.org.in/|title=Indian Traditional Arts|last=Association (WSA)|first=World Silambam|date=2019-06-05|website=World Silambam Association (WSA)|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Kalaripayattu is ultimately taught not just as a martial art, but as a way of life that epitomizes respect, compassion and duty over all else.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://karmagroup.com/blog/kalaripayattu-original-martial-art/|title=Kalaripayattu: Original Martial Art from Kerala, India|date=2018-03-21|website=Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Northern style ===\nThe Northern style is also known as, ''Vadakkan Kalari'', and is generally regarded as the \"original,\" form of Kalaripayattu. This system places more emphasis on physical flexibility exercises and strength training rooted on the slogan ''Meyy kanavanam'', meaning, \"make the body an eye.\" These exercises are done individually, as well as in combinations. After that ''meypayattu'' (a concept similar to [[kata]] in Karate) is taught. These are a combination of flexibility exercises with offensive and defensive techniques, however, the actual techniques are taught very much later. Traditionally, the number of ''meypayattu'' may differ as per the teaching methods of the Guru. After the student learns meypayattu, stick fighting is taught. Generally, the majority of the ''Kalaris'' (schools that teach Kalaripayattu) start training with weapons within 3 to 6 months. Some Kalaris only allow one weapon to be learned per year. After long stick and small stick fighting, iron weapons are introduced. Training begins with the dagger, sword and then the spear. Not all modern schools use specialized weapons. Traditionally, bows and arrows were commonly used in Kerala and students were trained in these techniques, but is rarely taught today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerala.me/specialities/art-and-culture/kalaripayattu|title=Kalaripayattu {{!}} Art & Culture of Kerala {{!}} Kerala {{!}} Kerala|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu has three forms, which are distinguished by their attacking and defensive patterns. They are ''Arappa Kayy'', ''Pilla Thangi'', and ''Vatten Thiripp''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onlinestore.dcbooks.com/authors/valappil-karunan-gurukkal|title=Kalarippayattile Kanakkukal Kalariprayogaprakaram|last=Karunan|first=Valappil|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Southern style ===\nThe Southern style is also known as ''Thekkan Kalari''. The origin of Thekkan Kalari is a subject of much debate and controversy. It is a style of Kalaripayattu that is said to have been altered and influenced by Sage Agastya. It may have been altered from the Northern style of Kalaripayattu to fight combatants trained in Adi Murai and [[Silambam]] from Tamil Nadu during various wars and skirmishes with Tamil kingdoms. It is essentially a style which combines Kalaripayattu with certain elements of Adi Murai and Silambam. Other sources suggest that martial arts such as Varma Kalai and Adi Thadi may also have influenced the Southern style. While the Southern style is less commonly practiced in Kerala compared to the Northern style, it is revered in Kerala as a combination of the teachings of both Parashurama and Agastya. It is predominantly practiced in some regions of the southern parts of Kerala, particularly in areas near [[Kanyakumari]]. While many of the exercises of the Southern style are identical to the Northern Style, it places heavy emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and hard impact techniques, and places less emphasis on weapons and combinations. It starts with the training in ''Chuvadus'': a system of various combinations of fighting techniques similar to [[Muay Thai]] and shadow boxing. Immediately after that, sparring with a partner is introduced as part of the training.  These pre-determined techniques are repeatedly trained. After a basic proficiency in unarmed combat is established, weapons training begins with a small stick. Small stick training is usually done with two combatants, armed with a stick or dagger. These are primarily defensive techniques. Fighting techniques with two combatants having the same weapons include sparring with long stick, sword, etc. During the duration of this training, the refining of un-armed combat also progresses. As the student gains more experience, a small amount of knowledge pertaining to the ''Marma'' points (pressure points) is also taught to the student if deemed appropriate by the Gurukkal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agasthyakalari.org/html/kalari-kerala.htm|title=Agasthya Kalari - for Siddha Treatments, Kalari Marma Treatments and offers training in Kalari strictly based on ancient scripts - located in Cochin, Kerala, India|website=agasthyakalari.org|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu techniques are a combination of steps (''Chuvadu'') and postures (''Vadivu''). ''Chuvadu'' literally means 'steps', the basic steps of the martial arts. ''Vadivu'' literally means 'postures' or stances which are the foundations of Kalaripayattu training. They are named after animals, and are usually presented in eight forms. Styles differ considerably from one tradition to another. Not only do the names of poses differ, but their utilization and interpretation vary depending on the Gurukkal's preference, and the traditions of the Kalari. Each stance has its own style, combination, and function. These techniques vary from one style to another.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[File:Kalaripayattuartist.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu artist passing through the double ring of fire.]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 3.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 2.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance|222x222px]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 1.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 4.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Kalariartist.jpg|thumb|A Kalaripayattu artist swishing his sword on fire.]]\n\n== Marmashastram and massage ==\n{{Main|Marmam}}\n[[File:Chavittithirumal.jpg|thumb|Chavittithirumal/massage]]\n\nIt is claimed that experienced Kalari warriors could disable or kill their opponents by merely striking the correct ''marmam'' (vital point) on their opponent's body. This technique is taught only to the most promising and level-headed students so as to discourage misuse of the technique. ''Marmashastram'' stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (''marmachikitsa''). This system of marma treatment originated from [[Ayurveda]], as well as [[Siddha medicine]]. Critics of Kalaripayattu have pointed out that the application of marmam techniques against neutral outsiders has not always produced verifiable results.\n \nThe earliest mention of marmam is found in the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', where [[Indra]] is said to have defeated [[Vritra]] by attacking his ''marmam'' with a [[vajra]].<ref>Mariana Fedorova (1990).

''Natural Healing Through Ayurveda'' (p. 161). Passage Press. Utah USA.</ref> With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that India's early martial artists knew about and practiced attacking or defending vital points.<ref name=Zarrilli1/> [[Sushruta]] (c. 6th century BC) identified and defined 107 vital points of the human body in his ''Sushruta Samhita''.<ref>G. D. Singhal, L. V. Guru (1973). ''Anatomical and Obstetrical Considerations in Ancient Indian Surgery Based on Sarira-Sthana of Susruta Samhita''.</ref> Of these 107 points, 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick.<ref name=\"Svinth\"/> Sushruta's work formed the basis of the medical discipline [[Ayurveda]], which was taught alongside various [[Indian martial arts]] that had an emphasis on vital points, such as [[Varma Kalai|Varma kalai]] and Marma adi.<ref name=Svinth/>\n\nAs a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial artists became knowledgeable in the fields of traditional medicine and massage. Kalaripayattu teachers often provide massages (''uzhichil'') with medicinal oils to their students in order to increase their physical flexibility or to treat muscle injuries encountered during practice. Such massages are generally termed ''thirumal'' and the unique massage given to increase flexibility is known as ''katcha thirumal''. It is said to be as sophisticated as the ''uzhichil'' treatment of Ayurveda. Kalaripayattu has borrowed extensively from [[Ayurveda]] and equally lends to it.\n\n== Documentaries ==\n* Among the earliest known [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmt0WTZfKI0 documentaries on Kalaripayattu] is a BBC documentary titled ''[[The Way of the Warrior (TV series)|The Way of the Warrior]]''.\n* Kalaripayattu was also documented in [[Fight Quest#Season 2|Season 2 of Fight Quest]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{See|List of Kalarippayattu films}}\n\nThe resurgence of public interest in Kalaripayattu began in the 1920s in [[Thalassery]], as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout southern [[India]]<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/> and continued through the 1970s surge of general worldwide interest in martial arts.<ref name=\"Zarilli 92\">Zarrilli 1992</ref> It has featured in international and [[cinema of India|Indian films]] such as:\n#''[[Thacholi Othenan (film)]]'' (1964),\n#''[[Aromalunni]]''  (1972)\n#''[[Ondanondu Kaladalli]]'' ([[Kannada]]) (1978)\n#''[[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]]''  (1989)\n#''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]'' (2001)\n#''[[The Myth (film)|The Myth]]'' (2005)\n#''[[The Last Legion]]'' (2007)\n#''[[Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (film)]]'' (2009)\n#''[[Manasara]]'' (2010)\n# ''[[Urumi (film)]]'' (2011)\n# ''[[Commando (2013 film)|Commando]]'' (2013)\n# ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015)\n# ''[[Baaghi (2016 film)|Baaghi]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Veeram (2016 film)|Veeram]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Padmaavat]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Kayamkulam Kochunni (2018 film)|Kayamkulam Kochunni]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Junglee (2019 film)|Junglee]]'' (2019)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India|Society|Martial arts}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Angampora]]\n*[[Banshay]]\n*[[Bataireacht]]\n*[[B\u014djutsu]]\n*[[Gatka]]\n*[[Adimurai]]\n*[[Indian martial arts]]\n*[[Kendo]]\n*[[Krabi\u2013krabong]]\n*[[Kuttu Varisai]]\n*[[Mardani khel]]\n*[[Silambam]]\n*[[Tahtib]]\n*[[Thang-ta]]\n*[[Varma kalai]]\n*[[Ankam]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu films]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu stick fighting]]\n*[[Malayali]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Balakrsnan, Pi (1995) ''Kalarippayattu: The ancient martial art of Kerala'', C.V.

Practitioners of Kalaripayattu possess intricate knowledge of pressure points on the human body and healing techniques that incorporate the knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga. Students are taught the martial art as a way of life, with a sense of compassion, discipline, and respect toward the master, fellow-students, parents and the community. Particular emphasis is placed on avoiding confrontational situations and using the martial art only as a means of protection, when no other alternative is available.\n\nUnlike other parts of India, warriors in Kerala belonged to all castes.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1992\">{{cite journal|author=Zarrilli, Phillip B.|first=|date=|year=1992|title=To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots (Marmmam/Varmam) in Two South Indian Martial Traditions Part I: Focus on Kerala's Kalarippayattu|url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/healharm.html|journal=[[Journal of Asian Martial Arts]]|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> Women in Keralite society also underwent training in Kalaripayattu, and still do so to this day.

The word ''kalari'' also appears in the ''Puram'' (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and ''Akam'' (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word ''kalari tatt'' denoted a martial feat, while ''kalari kozhai'' meant a coward in war.

Northern Kalaripayattu, or \"Vadakkan Kalari\" is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions, jumps and weapons training, while the southern \"Thekkan Kalari\" style specializes in hard, impact based techniques with priority on hand-to-hand combat and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts. Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor, as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor. Some of the methods used to enhance flexibility in Kalaripayattu are also utilized in Keralite dance forms such as Kathakali.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\" /> Dancers in Kerala who had experience with Kalaripayattu were noted to be markedly better than the other performers.

Kalaripayattu is taught in a specialized training ground known as a ''Kalari.'' Each kalari is built in accordance to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] architectural treatises such as the [[Vastu shastra|Vastu Shastras]] and [[Shilpa Shastras]], along with various religious traditions and customs native to [[Kerala]]. The presiding deity of Kalaripayattu is said to be [[Shiva]] as well as [[Bhadrakali]]. Before every training session in the Kalari, salutations are provides to the presiding deities in the form of a [[mantra]], or prayer.\n\nKalari Salutation Mantra\u00a0:\n\n\u00a0\n\"\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d23\u0d3f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d17\u0d3e\u0d2f\u0d38\u0d2e\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d25\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d36\u0d3f\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2f \u0d17\u0d41\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d35 \u0d28\u0d2e\u0d03\u201d\n\n(Sarva Thantra Swaroopaya\n\nSarva Thantra Swaroopini\n\nSarvagaya Samasthaya\n\nShivaya Guruve Namath)\n\nHistorically, all Keralites of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] community, men and women alike, would undergo mandatory training in Kalaripayattu beginning at the age of 7 or 9 and lasting until the end of their education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvnkalari.in/training.html|title=....#CVN KALARI#....|website=cvnkalari.in|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  Warriors, soldiers and others who wanted to pursue a martial career would continue their training for the rest of their lives. Generally, two styles of Kalaripayattu are acknowledged among Kalari practitioners: the Northern Style and the Southern Style.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://kalaripayattuclass.com/about-kalaripayattu/|title=About Kalaripayattu|website=Kalaripayattu Class|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  These two systems are quite similar, but their training methods begin to diverge to specialize in either weapons or hand-to-hand combat. The styles are variations that various masters have adapted and modified according to their understanding of the art. Development and mastery of Kalaripayattu comes from the tradition of constantly learning, adapting and improving the techniques by observing what techniques are practical and effective. There is a great amount of respect and observation of tradition which allows the preservation of the art. The knowledge and experience gained by the practitioners is improved upon by subsequent masters who utilize keen observation, research of various techniques and variations to update the knowledge. The adaptability of Kalaripayattu is largely due to Kalaripayattu being designed for use in warfare and combat. A Kalari practitioner might encounter new fighting techniques from an enemy combatant. The Kalari practitioner would need to learn how to anticipate, adapt to and neutralize these new techniques. This is especially seen in the Southern style of Kalaripayattu, which is believed to have been adapted and modified during wars with [[Tamils|Tamil]] kingdoms to counter martial arts like [[Silambam]], which was one of the main martial art forms practiced by Tamil soldiers at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://silambam.org.in/|title=Indian Traditional Arts|last=Association (WSA)|first=World Silambam|date=2019-06-05|website=World Silambam Association (WSA)|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Kalaripayattu is ultimately taught not just as a martial art, but as a way of life that epitomizes respect, compassion and duty over all else.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://karmagroup.com/blog/kalaripayattu-original-martial-art/|title=Kalaripayattu: Original Martial Art from Kerala, India|date=2018-03-21|website=Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Northern style ===\nThe Northern style is also known as, ''Vadakkan Kalari'', and is generally regarded as the \"original,\" form of Kalaripayattu. This system places more emphasis on physical flexibility exercises and strength training rooted on the slogan ''Meyy kanavanam'', meaning, \"make the body an eye.\" These exercises are done individually, as well as in combinations. After that ''meypayattu'' (a concept similar to [[kata]] in Karate) is taught. These are a combination of flexibility exercises with offensive and defensive techniques, however, the actual techniques are taught very much later. Traditionally, the number of ''meypayattu'' may differ as per the teaching methods of the Guru. After the student learns meypayattu, stick fighting is taught. Generally, the majority of the ''Kalaris'' (schools that teach Kalaripayattu) start training with weapons within 3 to 6 months. Some Kalaris only allow one weapon to be learned per year. After long stick and small stick fighting, iron weapons are introduced. Training begins with the dagger, sword and then the spear. Not all modern schools use specialized weapons. Traditionally, bows and arrows were commonly used in Kerala and students were trained in these techniques, but is rarely taught today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerala.me/specialities/art-and-culture/kalaripayattu|title=Kalaripayattu {{!}} Art & Culture of Kerala {{!}} Kerala {{!}} Kerala|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu has three forms, which are distinguished by their attacking and defensive patterns. They are ''Arappa Kayy'', ''Pilla Thangi'', and ''Vatten Thiripp''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onlinestore.dcbooks.com/authors/valappil-karunan-gurukkal|title=Kalarippayattile Kanakkukal Kalariprayogaprakaram|last=Karunan|first=Valappil|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Southern style ===\nThe Southern style is also known as ''Thekkan Kalari''. The origin of Thekkan Kalari is a subject of much debate and controversy. It is a style of Kalaripayattu that is said to have been altered and influenced by Sage Agastya. It may have been altered from the Northern style of Kalaripayattu to fight combatants trained in Adi Murai and [[Silambam]] from Tamil Nadu during various wars and skirmishes with Tamil kingdoms. It is essentially a style which combines Kalaripayattu with certain elements of Adi Murai and Silambam. Other sources suggest that martial arts such as Varma Kalai and Adi Thadi may also have influenced the Southern style. While the Southern style is less commonly practiced in Kerala compared to the Northern style, it is revered in Kerala as a combination of the teachings of both Parashurama and Agastya. It is predominantly practiced in some regions of the southern parts of Kerala, particularly in areas near [[Kanyakumari]]. While many of the exercises of the Southern style are identical to the Northern Style, it places heavy emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and hard impact techniques, and places less emphasis on weapons and combinations. It starts with the training in ''Chuvadus'': a system of various combinations of fighting techniques similar to [[Muay Thai]] and shadow boxing. Immediately after that, sparring with a partner is introduced as part of the training.  These pre-determined techniques are repeatedly trained. After a basic proficiency in unarmed combat is established, weapons training begins with a small stick. Small stick training is usually done with two combatants, armed with a stick or dagger. These are primarily defensive techniques. Fighting techniques with two combatants having the same weapons include sparring with long stick, sword, etc. During the duration of this training, the refining of un-armed combat also progresses. As the student gains more experience, a small amount of knowledge pertaining to the ''Marma'' points (pressure points) is also taught to the student if deemed appropriate by the Gurukkal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agasthyakalari.org/html/kalari-kerala.htm|title=Agasthya Kalari - for Siddha Treatments, Kalari Marma Treatments and offers training in Kalari strictly based on ancient scripts - located in Cochin, Kerala, India|website=agasthyakalari.org|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu techniques are a combination of steps (''Chuvadu'') and postures (''Vadivu''). ''Chuvadu'' literally means 'steps', the basic steps of the martial arts. ''Vadivu'' literally means 'postures' or stances which are the foundations of Kalaripayattu training. They are named after animals, and are usually presented in eight forms. Styles differ considerably from one tradition to another. Not only do the names of poses differ, but their utilization and interpretation vary depending on the Gurukkal's preference, and the traditions of the Kalari. Each stance has its own style, combination, and function. These techniques vary from one style to another.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[File:Kalaripayattuartist.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu artist passing through the double ring of fire.]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 3.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 2.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance|222x222px]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 1.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 4.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Kalariartist.jpg|thumb|A Kalaripayattu artist swishing his sword on fire.]]\n\n== Marmashastram and massage ==\n{{Main|Marmam}}\n[[File:Chavittithirumal.jpg|thumb|Chavittithirumal/massage]]\n\nIt is claimed that experienced Kalari warriors could disable or kill their opponents by merely striking the correct ''marmam'' (vital point) on their opponent's body. This technique is taught only to the most promising and level-headed students so as to discourage misuse of the technique. ''Marmashastram'' stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (''marmachikitsa''). This system of marma treatment originated from [[Ayurveda]], as well as [[Siddha medicine]]. Critics of Kalaripayattu have pointed out that the application of marmam techniques against neutral outsiders has not always produced verifiable results.\n \nThe earliest mention of marmam is found in the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', where [[Indra]] is said to have defeated [[Vritra]] by attacking his ''marmam'' with a [[vajra]].<ref>Mariana Fedorova (1990).

Utah USA.</ref> With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that India's early martial artists knew about and practiced attacking or defending vital points.<ref name=Zarrilli1/> [[Sushruta]] (c. 6th century BC) identified and defined 107 vital points of the human body in his ''Sushruta Samhita''.<ref>G. D. Singhal, L. V. Guru (1973). ''Anatomical and Obstetrical Considerations in Ancient Indian Surgery Based on Sarira-Sthana of Susruta Samhita''.</ref> Of these 107 points, 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick.<ref name=\"Svinth\"/> Sushruta's work formed the basis of the medical discipline [[Ayurveda]], which was taught alongside various [[Indian martial arts]] that had an emphasis on vital points, such as [[Varma Kalai|Varma kalai]] and Marma adi.<ref name=Svinth/>\n\nAs a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial artists became knowledgeable in the fields of traditional medicine and massage. Kalaripayattu teachers often provide massages (''uzhichil'') with medicinal oils to their students in order to increase their physical flexibility or to treat muscle injuries encountered during practice. Such massages are generally termed ''thirumal'' and the unique massage given to increase flexibility is known as ''katcha thirumal''. It is said to be as sophisticated as the ''uzhichil'' treatment of Ayurveda. Kalaripayattu has borrowed extensively from [[Ayurveda]] and equally lends to it.\n\n== Documentaries ==\n* Among the earliest known [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmt0WTZfKI0 documentaries on Kalaripayattu] is a BBC documentary titled ''[[The Way of the Warrior (TV series)|The Way of the Warrior]]''.\n* Kalaripayattu was also documented in [[Fight Quest#Season 2|Season 2 of Fight Quest]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{See|List of Kalarippayattu films}}\n\nThe resurgence of public interest in Kalaripayattu began in the 1920s in [[Thalassery]], as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout southern [[India]]<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/> and continued through the 1970s surge of general worldwide interest in martial arts.<ref name=\"Zarilli 92\">Zarrilli 1992</ref> It has featured in international and [[cinema of India|Indian films]] such as:\n#''[[Thacholi Othenan (film)]]'' (1964),\n#''[[Aromalunni]]''  (1972)\n#''[[Ondanondu Kaladalli]]'' ([[Kannada]]) (1978)\n#''[[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]]''  (1989)\n#''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]'' (2001)\n#''[[The Myth (film)|The Myth]]'' (2005)\n#''[[The Last Legion]]'' (2007)\n#''[[Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (film)]]'' (2009)\n#''[[Manasara]]'' (2010)\n# ''[[Urumi (film)]]'' (2011)\n# ''[[Commando (2013 film)|Commando]]'' (2013)\n# ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015)\n# ''[[Baaghi (2016 film)|Baaghi]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Veeram (2016 film)|Veeram]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Padmaavat]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Kayamkulam Kochunni (2018 film)|Kayamkulam Kochunni]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Junglee (2019 film)|Junglee]]'' (2019)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India|Society|Martial arts}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Angampora]]\n*[[Banshay]]\n*[[Bataireacht]]\n*[[B\u014djutsu]]\n*[[Gatka]]\n*[[Adimurai]]\n*[[Indian martial arts]]\n*[[Kendo]]\n*[[Krabi\u2013krabong]]\n*[[Kuttu Varisai]]\n*[[Mardani khel]]\n*[[Silambam]]\n*[[Tahtib]]\n*[[Thang-ta]]\n*[[Varma kalai]]\n*[[Ankam]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu films]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu stick fighting]]\n*[[Malayali]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Balakrsnan, Pi (1995) ''Kalarippayattu: The ancient martial art of Kerala'', C.V.

Bibby helped lead the Bruins through the first 47 games of an 88-game winning streak and was named an All-American his senior year. He was one of only four players to have started on three NCAA championship teams; the others all played for Wooden at UCLA: [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]], [[Curtis Rowe]] and [[Lynn Shackelford]].\n\nIn the [[1972 NBA draft]], Bibby was drafted in the fourth round by the [[New York Knicks]] and in the second round of the [[1972 ABA Draft]] by the [[Carolina Cougars]]. Bibby opted to play for the Knicks and was with the team for two-and-a-half seasons, which included an [[NBA Finals|NBA title]] in 1973.\n\nBibby spent nine seasons in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and was a part of the 1977 and 1980 [[Philadelphia 76ers]] teams that made the [[NBA Finals]] but lost both times.\n\n== Coaching career ==\nBibby started his coaching career in the [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA) and won two championships in 1982 and 1989.  He coached the [[Winnipeg Thunder]].\n\nIn 1996, he was named coach of the men's [[basketball]] team at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), and kept that position for nine seasons. Bibby had an overall won-loss record of 131-111 at USC. He led his 1997, 2001 and 2002 teams to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] tournament, including an \"[[Elite Eight]]\" appearance in 2001. He was fired four games into his ninth season.\n\nIn April 2005, he was named head coach of the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). After 28 games, he was replaced by his assistant coach, [[Joe Bryant]].\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Bibby was hired by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] as an assistant coach on [[Maurice Cheeks]]' staff and remained there until the end of the 2007\u20132008 season, when his contract was not renewed. In February 2009 he was hired by the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] as an assistant coach. He remained with the team until 2013, when he joined the [[Detroit Pistons]]' coaching staff.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/detroit-pistons-finalize-coaching-staff Detroit Pistons Finalize Coaching Staff]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBibby is the brother of [[Jim Bibby]], a former Major League Baseball [[pitcher]], and father of [[Mike Bibby]], who played in the NBA.

Bibby helped lead the Bruins through the first 47 games of an 88-game winning streak and was named an All-American his senior year. He was one of only four players to have started on three NCAA championship teams; the others all played for Wooden at UCLA: [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]], [[Curtis Rowe]] and [[Lynn Shackelford]].\n\nIn the [[1972 NBA draft]], Bibby was drafted in the fourth round by the [[New York Knicks]] and in the second round of the [[1972 ABA Draft]] by the [[Carolina Cougars]]. Bibby opted to play for the Knicks and was with the team for two-and-a-half seasons, which included an [[NBA Finals|NBA title]] in 1973.\n\nBibby spent nine seasons in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and was a part of the 1977 and 1980 [[Philadelphia 76ers]] teams that made the [[NBA Finals]] but lost both times.\n\n== Coaching career ==\nBibby started his coaching career in the [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA) and won two championships in 1982 and 1989.  He coached the [[Winnipeg Thunder]].\n\nIn 1996, he was named coach of the men's [[basketball]] team at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), and kept that position for nine seasons. Bibby had an overall won-loss record of 131-111 at USC. He led his 1997, 2001 and 2002 teams to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] tournament, including an \"[[Elite Eight]]\" appearance in 2001. He was fired four games into his ninth season.\n\nIn April 2005, he was named head coach of the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). After 28 games, he was replaced by his assistant coach, [[Joe Bryant]].\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Bibby was hired by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] as an assistant coach on [[Maurice Cheeks]]' staff and remained there until the end of the 2007\u20132008 season, when his contract was not renewed. In February 2009 he was hired by the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] as an assistant coach. He remained with the team until 2013, when he joined the [[Detroit Pistons]]' coaching staff.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/detroit-pistons-finalize-coaching-staff Detroit Pistons Finalize Coaching Staff]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBibby is the brother of [[Jim Bibby]], a former Major League Baseball [[pitcher]], and father of [[Mike Bibby]], who played in the NBA.  Bibby and  his son are one of four father-son duos to each win an NCAA basketball championship.<ref group=note>The others are [[Marques Johnson|Marques]] and [[Kris Johnson (basketball)|Kris

After the war those photos were used by the Commission for War Crimes in SFR Yugoslavia.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gaon|2001|p=}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduation in 1946, Altaras worked as an assistant professor of radiology at the \"Vojna Bolnica Zagreb\" (''Military Hospital'') under Prof. Milan Smokvina. From 1950s he was a [[Chief Physician|Head Physician]] of the \"Centre for radiology and nuclear medicine\" at \"Vojna Bolnica Zagreb\". At the same time he owned the private practice in Zagreb. In the 1958 he received his master's degree and started to teach medicine at the University of Zagreb. In the meantime Altaras started to explore the true causes of the death of his brother Silvio Altaras, who was killed by the communist regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|PR Yugoslavia]] in early 1945. Because of that, in 1964, [[League of Communists of Croatia]] started to political persecute Altaras in a mounted court case. He was forced to leave Croatia and moved to [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]. There he worked at the [[University Hospital Zurich]] from 1964 to 1966. In 1966 Altaras moved to Giessen, [[Germany]] and started to work at the [[University hospital Giessen und Marburg]]. In 1992 he published his principal professional work: A new atlas of large and small intestine - the integration of diagnostic methods.<ref name=\"Altaras\">Altaras, Jakob (1992).

With political skill, his charismatic personality and genuine interest in the fate of the \"little people\", he also served as the president of the Jewish community in Giessen. Under his leadership the new Beith-Jaakov Synagogue of Giessen was built in the 1995.

STS inhibition in the human was probably the mechanism for very long lasting high [E2MATE]- and EMATE concentrations in erythrocytes compared to shorter initial peak values of [estrone] and [estradiol] in the plasma.\"<ref name=\"pmid27449818\" /> As such, E2MATE and EMATE are not effective as estrogens in humans, and the researchers have subsequently developed new C17\u03b2 [[sulfonamide]] ester prodrugs of estradiol, such as [[EC508]], that cannot be transformed into the corresponding estrone equivalents and are not STS inhibitors.<ref name=\"pmid27449818\" />\n\nSTS is an [[enzyme]] that is responsible for the [[biotransformation|transformation]] of hormonally inactive [[steroid sulfate]]s into their hormonally active forms, for instance hydrolysis of [[estrone sulfate]] into estrone (which can then be transformed into the more potent estradiol).<ref name=\"pmid25843211\" /> Inhibition of STS is the basis for the clinical development of E2MATE for endometriosis, as STS is expressed in the [[endometrium]], and the severity of endometriosis has been found to correlate with STS expression.<ref name=\"pmid25843211\" /> In a clinical study, E2MATE was found to inhibit endometrial STS activity by 91% in [[premenopausal]] women, while circulating levels of estradiol were not affected, indicating that E2MATE may have [[tissue selectivity|tissue-selective]] [[antiestrogen]]ic effects in the endometrium.<ref name=\"pmid25843211\" />\n\nE2MATE is rapidly and almost completely transformed, by approximately 90%, into EMATE in the [[intestine]]s during the first pass with oral administration in women.<ref name=\"pmid24604234\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pohl O, Bestel E, Gotteland JP | title = Synergistic effects of E2MATE and norethindrone acetate on steroid sulfatase inhibition: a randomized phase I proof-of-principle clinical study in women of reproductive age | journal = Reprod Sci | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 1256\u201365 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 24604234 | doi = 10.1177/1933719114522526 | url = }}</ref> EMATE and E2MATE are almost completely sequestered into erythrocytes from the hepatic portal vein during the first pass with oral administration, thereby bypassing the liver.<ref name=\"pmid24604234\" /> Treatment with 4&nbsp;mg oral E2MATE once per week has been found to result in very high maximal levels of E2MATE of 152.1&nbsp;ng/mL (152,100&nbsp;pg/mL) and of EMATE of 2,395&nbsp;ng/mL (2,395,000&nbsp;pg/mL) in women.<ref name=\"pmid24604234\" /> Maximal levels of E2MATE and EMATE occur about 3.5 to 5.5&nbsp;days after a dose of E2MATE.<ref name=\"pmid24604234\" /> There is a 4.0-fold accumulation of E2MATE and a 3.3-fold [[drug accumulation ratio|accumulation]] of EMATE with continuous administration of E2MATE relative to a single dose.<ref name=\"pmid24604234\" /> The [[biological half-life]] of E2MATE with continuous administration has been found to be about 18&nbsp;days and of EMATE about 16&nbsp;days in women.<ref name=\"pmid24604234\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of estrogen esters#Estradiol esters|List of estrogen esters \u00a7 Estradiol esters]]\n* [[List of investigational hormonal agents#Estrogenics|List of investigational hormonal agents \u00a7 Estrogenics]]\n* [[Steroid sulfatase#Inhibitors|Steroid sulfatase \u00a7 Inhibitors]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800026648 Estradiol sulfamate - AdisInsight]\n* [https://www.google.com/patents/US7119081 Oestrogen-17-sulphamates as inhibitors of steroid sulphatase (patent)]\n\n\n{{Estrogen receptor modulators}}\n\n[[Category:Diols]]\n[[Category:Estradiol esters]]\n[[Category:Prodrugs]]\n[[Category:Steroid sulfatase inhibitors]]\n[[Category:Sulfamate esters]]\n", "name_user": "Davemck", "label": "safe", "comment": "rmv duplicate parm", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol_sulfamate"}
