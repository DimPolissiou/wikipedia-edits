These nicknames reference a particular orange colour form that is prized in the hobby for its beauty and confrontational personality. It is also known as the '''Mombasa golden starburst tarantula'''.\n\nThis species is incredibly cute and, as with most old world tarantulas, should not be held. The bite of this species, while not serious, is extremely painful. Moreover, the species is more than willing to inflict such a bite before presenting the typical threat display. Caution when dealing with this species is advised.\n\n==Description==\nFemale ''P. murinus'' can grow to 4\u20136&nbsp;inches (10-15cm) in size (measured from the tip of the front left leg, to the tip of the rear right leg), while males typically range from 3\u20134&nbsp;inches (7.5-10cm). The spider's abdomen, carapace, and legs have the same basic coloration, though the legs typically have brightly colored rings. The carapace has a star-shaped pattern, with a fishbone pattern present on the abdomen. The eyes are clustered together on a raised part of the carapace (in common with all [[tarantulas]]). The body is covered with short hairs, with longer hair present on the legs. [[Urticating hairs]] are not present.\n\nThere are currently 5 known colour variants of ''Pterinochilus murinus'': and also localities of those as listed after the color form names.\n\n* '''BCF''' - Brown Colour Form - Tete, Mozambique\n* '''DCF''' - Dark Colour Form - Botswana/Zimbabwe, Kenya, Kigoma, Mikumi\n* '''OCF''' - Orange Colour Form - Usambara Mountains Region (used to be called UMW before RCF was found)\n* '''RCF''' - Red Colour Form - Usambara Mountains Region\n* '''TCF''' - Typical Colour Form - Kenya, Mozambique\n\nThese colour variants are found in different geographical locations, and the colouration is thought to be related to the type of soil present where each variant lives.\n\n==Distribution==\nPternochilus murinus is found in different parts of Africa and has also been recorded on the island of [[Zanzibar]].\n\n==Behavior==\n\nThe orange baboon tarantula is very defensive, and will bite immediately if provoked. Consequently, it is not recommended that hobbyists keep this species without extensive prior experience handling venomous spiders.\n\nThe female excavates a [[burrow]], or colonizes an existing burrow that has been abandoned.\n\n==As pets==\nThese spiders are not common in pet stores but are very popular in the pet trade. These spiders build a tunnel shaped web and as adults should be provided around 20&nbsp;cm of substrate. They are commonly fed crickets, cockroaches, and grasshoppers. Though they can kill small vertebrates ([[mice]], small [[lizards]], [[birds]], [[snakes]]), these feeder animals are not commonly used in captive care. \n\nThese spiders can be very defensive and are believed to have a very painful bite. Although their venom is not known to be lethal to humans, it is considered medically significant and thus it is advised to avoid handling this species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=N.|last2=Pinkham|first2=M.|last3=Warrell|first3=D.A.|date=2009-09-23|title=Symptom in search of a toxin: muscle spasms following bites by Old World tarantula spiders (Lampropelma nigerrimum, Pterinochilus murinus, Poecilotheria regalis) with review|journal=QJM|language=en|volume=102|issue=12|pages=851\u2013857|doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcp128|pmid=19776152|issn=1460-2725}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=WSC_s37862>{{cite web |title=Taxon details ''Pterinochilus murinus'' (Pocock, 1897) |work=World Spider Catalog |publisher=Natural History Museum Bern |url=http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/species/37862 |accessdate=2018-08-06 }}</ref>\n}}{{Commons|Pterinochilus murinus}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q135011}}\n\n[[Category:Theraphosidae]]\n[[Category:Spiders of Africa]]\n[[Category:Spiders described in 1897]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=June 2013}}\n{{Speciesbox\n|taxon = Pterinochilus murinus\n|image = Pterinochilus.jpg\n|image_caption = \n|authority = ([[Reginald Innes Pocock|Pocock]], 1897)<ref name=WSC_s37862/>\n|synonyms =\n  {{Specieslist\n  |Harpactira elevata|Karsch, 1878\n  |Pterinochilus mamillatus|Strand, 1906\n  |Pterinochilus hindei|Hirst, 1907\n  |Pterinochilus vosseleri|Strand, 1907\n  |Pterinochilus leetzi|Schmidt, 2002\n  }}\n|synonyms_ref = <ref name=WSC_s37862/>\n}}\n'''''Pterinochilus murinus''''', is an old-world [[tarantula]] that was first described in 1897 by [[Reginald Innes Pocock]].<ref name=WSC_s37862/>  This species is found on the [[Africa]]n continent, in [[Angola]], as well as central, eastern, and southern Africa.
