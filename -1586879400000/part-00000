It passes through the heart of [[Boston|Boston's]] [[MetroWest]] region, through towns on the eastern edge of [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and western edge of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], crossing the border between the two counties four times. Throughout its entire distance, Route 85 runs parallel to I-495, never passing more than two miles from it.\n\n==Route description==\nRoute 85 begins in the town of [[Milford, Massachusetts|Milford]] at [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], just west of the downtown area.  It passes east of Milford Pond before meeting [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] at Exit 20.  From there, Route 85 heads northward into [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]], passing the eastern side of Echo Lake.  It intersects [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] at the center of town, less than a quarter mile west of the start line of the [[Boston Marathon]].

It then crosses the [[Sudbury Reservoir]] before meeting [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] at the center of town.  From there, Route 85 continues northward into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]], meeting [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]] in the downtown area. It then crosses the far western edge of the Fort Meadow Reservoir before crossing into [[Hudson, Massachusetts|Hudson]].  \n\nShortly after entering Hudson, Route 85 meets Hudson Street, the [[super two]] connector road between Route 85 and the junction of [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] and I-495 at I-495's Exit 25 and I-290's terminus, Exit 26.  From there Route 85 heads north, crossing the [[Assabet River]] before meeting [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]], passing concurrently with that route through Wood Square before Route 85 continues northward.  After passing into [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]], the route passes between Little Pond and West Pond before ending at [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]], less than a half mile east of I-495's exit 27.\n\n=== Route 85 Connector ===\nMA&nbsp;85 Connector is a road that goes from the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate&nbsp;290]] (I-290) to a wye with MA&nbsp;85, {{convert|0.9|mi|km|adj=on}} away in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]].<ref name=\"ma85connector\">{{google maps|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/42.3637771,-71.5837487/42.3712321,-71.5691026/@42.3691474,-71.5811337,14.75z|title=Route 85 Connector|accessdate=August 10, 2015|date=August 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Future==\n{{update|section|date=March 2018}}\n===Improvements to Route 85 in Hudson===\nIn 2011 a $10.8 million project to reconstruct 7,700 feet (1.5 miles) from School Street/Park Street to the Marlborough City Line will begin. The project will consist of {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=on}} travel lanes and {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} bike shoulders with {{convert|5.5|ft|m|adj=on}} concrete sidewalks throughout the project corridor. The Walmart Driveway will be reconstructed with bicycle accommodation, ADA compliance, and a new traffic signal. At the intersection of the Route 85 Connector and Technology Drive, the intersection will be reconstructed. A new northbound left turn lane will be constructed, new through lane constructed on Technology Drive, new through lane on Route 85 Connector and a new wire traffic signal. The section between Route 85 Connector and Broad Street will consist of four lanes (two in each direction) with a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} raised concrete median. At the intersection of Broad Street, the existing signal will be replaced with a two-lane roundabout. The roadway will be widened to four lanes (two in each direction)from Houghton Street to Broad Street. A new traffic signal will be installed at R.K Town Centre Drive with a new turn lane. A new traffic signal will be installed at Giasson Street. A new northbound left turn lane with a new traffic signal will be installed at Brigham Street.

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region.

[[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co \u2013 Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891.

It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907.

Comics]]. Simply titled ''Halloween'', it was intended to be a [[One-shot (comics)|one-issue special]], but eventually two sequels spawned: ''Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes'' and ''Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes''. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands\u2014writer for ''Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers''\u2014assisting on the first issue, and David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film ''Halloween H20''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/Comic_Maniac.htm|title=Halloween&nbsp;\u2014 Michael Myers comic book titles|publisher=Movie Maniacs Comic Books|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for ''Halloween: Resurrection''. He had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to ''Halloween H20''. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and his relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, who has taken over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in ''Halloween: Resurrection'', they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible. Although the studio did not follow up on his pitch, Farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form.<ref name=\"Farrands\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_Dan.htm|title=Daniel Farrands interview|publisher=Icons of Fright|year=2005|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref>\n\n''One Good Scare'' written by Stefan Hutchinson, and illustrated by Peter Fielding, was released in 2003. The main character in this comic is Lindsey Wallace, the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film. Hutchinson wanted to bring the character back to his roots, and away from the \"lumbering [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]]-clone\" the film sequels had made him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=455|title=The Arrow interviews Stefan Hutchinson|publisher=Arrow in the Head|date=2003-11-28|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> ''One Good Scare'' came about because Hutchinson wanted to produce a comic book to celebrate the series' twenty-fifth anniversary, to be sold as a collectible at a ''Halloween'' convention in South Pasadena. Due to the positive reception to ''One Good Scare'', Hutchinson hoped to use the comic as a \"demo\" for getting a distribution deal, but was unable to do so, due to rights issues.<ref name=FearNet>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b13005_exclusive_we_stalk_latest_halloween.html|title=Exclusive!

Together, they developed ideas for possible ''Halloween'' stories that would be \"connected into a larger tale, so the idea was that it would use the serial aspect of comic books to create different storylines than would be possible in the films.\"<ref name=FearNet/> On July 25, 2006, as an insert inside the DVD release of ''Halloween: 25 Years of Terror'', Hutchinson released ''Halloween: Autopsis''. Written by Hutchinson, and artwork by Marcus Smith and Nick Dismas, the story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of Michael Myers. As the photographer, Carter, follows Dr. Loomis he begins to take on Loomis's obsession himself, until finally meeting Michael Myers in person, which results in his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/6765 |title=Halloween: Autopsis |publisher=Bloody Disgusting |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226022015/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/6765 |archivedate=2008-02-26 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:32em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\"A lot of readers found in the comic books what they had been missing from the films in the later sequels.

This comic book one-shot is a collection of short stories inspired by John Carpenter's original. \"Trick or Treat\" features the MacKenzies, [[unseen character]]s from the first film who Tommy and Lindsey run to for help. \"P.O.V.\" shows a murder from the [[point of view shot|point of view]] of both Michael and his victim, \"Visiting Hours\" sees Laurie Strode reflecting on how her life could have been had her brother never found her in 1978, while \"Tommy and the Boogeyman\" reveals that Tommy Doyle grew up to write comic books featuring Michael Myers. In the final story, \"Repetition Compulsion\", Dr. Loomis tries to predict where Michael will strike next on Halloween 1989. Writer Hutchinson explains that ''H30'' came about because, unlike previous decades, there was no ''Halloween'' film coming out in 2008 to acknowledge the occasion.<ref name=H30>{{comic book reference|writer=Stephen Hutchinson|penciller=Daniel Zezelj, Jim Daly, Brett Weldele, Jeffrey Zornow, Lee Ferguson, Tim Seeley|inker=Nick Bell, Rob Buffalo, Jeffrey Zornow, Elizabeth John|title=Halloween: 30 Years of Terror| date=August, 2007|publisher=Devil's Due Publishing}}</ref><ref name=H30Interview>{{cite news|author=Steve Ekstrom|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080605-Halloween30th.html|title=Celebrating 30 Years of Halloween|publisher=Newsarama|date=2008-05-06|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref>\n\nDevil's Due released the three-issue miniseries ''Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode'' in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, the story bridges the gap between ''Halloween II'' and ''Halloween H20'' by focusing on Laurie Strode in the aftermath of the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is \"trying to get better and trying to repair, but where do you even start after going through such horror? How do you even try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?\" Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the \"bloodline plot of the middle sequels\", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that \"it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister\". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, \"it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it's the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential.\"<ref name=LaurieNews>{{cite news|author=Steve Ekstrom|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080818-HalloweenLS.html|title=Hutchinson on Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode|publisher=Newsarama|date=2008-08-18|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Online stories ===\nAll of Stefan Hutchinson's ''Halloween'' comic books take place in the ''Halloween H20'' timeline, which retconned ''Halloween 4''\u2013''6'' from continuity. Hutchinson comments that, while the retcon was unpopular with \"a lot of fans\" for ignoring previous movies, he preferred the \"simplicity of this storyline, over the needlessly convoluted mythology that the last three films had created\". However, he admits that one of the downsides of the ''H20'' timeline is that fans do not know exactly what happened to Dr. Sam Loomis after ''Halloween II''. To remedy this, Hutchinson pitched ''Halloween: Sam'' as a way of paying tribute to the character.<ref name=FearNet/> Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from ''Autopsis''{{'}} Marcus Smith, ''Sam'' is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website HalloweenComics.com. It explores the life of Dr. Loomis, including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington, a journalist he met during [[World War II]]. In 1995, Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in a hospital and murders Elizabeth in front of him. Loomis attempts to stop him, but dies of a coronary failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweencomics.com/titles/sam.htm |title=Halloween: Sam |publisher=HalloweenComics |format=PDF |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026015054/http://www.halloweencomics.com/titles/sam.htm |archivedate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Merchandise ==\nIn 1983, [[Wizard Video]], who had also released a [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (video game)|video game version]] of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', released a ''[[Halloween (video game)|Halloween]]'' game for the [[Atari 2600]].

The films primarily focuses on [[serial killer]] [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] who was committed to a sanitarium as a child for the murder of his sister, [[Judith Myers]]. Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of the fictional town of Haddonfield, [[Illinois]]. Michael's killings occur on the holiday of [[Halloween]], on which all of the films primarily take place. The original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', released in 1978, was written by [[John Carpenter]] and [[Debra Hill]], and directed by Carpenter.

Michael Myers is the antagonist in all of the films except ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'', the story of which has no direct connection to any other film in the series. In 2007, writer-director [[Rob Zombie]] made a [[Halloween (2007 film)|remake]] of the 1978 film. A [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] to the 2007 remake was released two years later.

On Halloween, Michael murders a school bully, his older sister and her boyfriend, as well as his mother's boyfriend. Committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, Michael closes himself off from everyone. Michael's mother ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]) commits suicide out of guilt.

Michael finds his sister living with the Strode family, and going by the name Laurie. After killing nearly all of her friends and family, Michael then kidnaps Laurie and attempts to explain to her that he is her brother through the use of a picture that he has kept of himself and her as an infant.

Comics]]. Simply titled ''Halloween'', it was intended to be a [[One-shot (comics)|one-issue special]], but eventually two sequels spawned: ''Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes'' and ''Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes''. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands\u2014writer for ''Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers''\u2014assisting on the first issue, and David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film ''Halloween H20''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/Comic_Maniac.htm|title=Halloween&nbsp;\u2014 Michael Myers comic book titles|publisher=Movie Maniacs Comic Books|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for ''Halloween: Resurrection''. He had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to ''Halloween H20''. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and his relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, who has taken over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in ''Halloween: Resurrection'', they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible.

The main character in this comic is Lindsey Wallace, the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film. Hutchinson wanted to bring the character back to his roots, and away from the \"lumbering [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]]-clone\" the film sequels had made him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=455|title=The Arrow interviews Stefan Hutchinson|publisher=Arrow in the Head|date=2003-11-28|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> ''One Good Scare'' came about because Hutchinson wanted to produce a comic book to celebrate the series' twenty-fifth anniversary, to be sold as a collectible at a ''Halloween'' convention in South Pasadena. Due to the positive reception to ''One Good Scare'', Hutchinson hoped to use the comic as a \"demo\" for getting a distribution deal, but was unable to do so, due to rights issues.<ref name=FearNet>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b13005_exclusive_we_stalk_latest_halloween.html|title=Exclusive!

Together, they developed ideas for possible ''Halloween'' stories that would be \"connected into a larger tale, so the idea was that it would use the serial aspect of comic books to create different storylines than would be possible in the films.\"<ref name=FearNet/> On July 25, 2006, as an insert inside the DVD release of ''Halloween: 25 Years of Terror'', Hutchinson released ''Halloween: Autopsis''. Written by Hutchinson, and artwork by Marcus Smith and Nick Dismas, the story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of Michael Myers. As the photographer, Carter, follows Dr. Loomis he begins to take on Loomis's obsession himself, until finally meeting Michael Myers in person, which results in his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/6765 |title=Halloween: Autopsis |publisher=Bloody Disgusting |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226022015/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/6765 |archivedate=2008-02-26 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:32em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\"A lot of readers found in the comic books what they had been missing from the films in the later sequels.

Michael becomes inexplicably fixated on Lisa, just as he did with Laurie in the original ''Halloween'', before the sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her.<ref name=\"HalloweenFeb\">{{cite news|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=145520 |title=Halloween in February: Hutchinson and Seeley on ''Halloween: Nightdance'' |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211201608/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=145520 |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> The aim was to once again establish Michael Myers as a \"credible and dangerous force\".<ref name=FearNet/>\n\nAugust 2008 saw the release of Devil's Due's ''Halloween: 30 Years of Terror'' to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of ''Halloween''. This comic book one-shot is a collection of short stories inspired by John Carpenter's original. \"Trick or Treat\" features the MacKenzies, [[unseen character]]s from the first film who Tommy and Lindsey run to for help. \"P.O.V.\" shows a murder from the [[point of view shot|point of view]] of both Michael and his victim, \"Visiting Hours\" sees Laurie Strode reflecting on how her life could have been had her brother never found her in 1978, while \"Tommy and the Boogeyman\" reveals that Tommy Doyle grew up to write comic books featuring Michael Myers. In the final story, \"Repetition Compulsion\", Dr. Loomis tries to predict where Michael will strike next on Halloween 1989. Writer Hutchinson explains that ''H30'' came about because, unlike previous decades, there was no ''Halloween'' film coming out in 2008 to acknowledge the occasion.<ref name=H30>{{comic book reference|writer=Stephen Hutchinson|penciller=Daniel Zezelj, Jim Daly, Brett Weldele, Jeffrey Zornow, Lee Ferguson, Tim Seeley|inker=Nick Bell, Rob Buffalo, Jeffrey Zornow, Elizabeth John|title=Halloween: 30 Years of Terror| date=August, 2007|publisher=Devil's Due Publishing}}</ref><ref name=H30Interview>{{cite news|author=Steve Ekstrom|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080605-Halloween30th.html|title=Celebrating 30 Years of Halloween|publisher=Newsarama|date=2008-05-06|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref>\n\nDevil's Due released the three-issue miniseries ''Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode'' in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, the story bridges the gap between ''Halloween II'' and ''Halloween H20'' by focusing on Laurie Strode in the aftermath of the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is \"trying to get better and trying to repair, but where do you even start after going through such horror? How do you even try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?\" Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the \"bloodline plot of the middle sequels\", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that \"it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister\". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, \"it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it's the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential.\"<ref name=LaurieNews>{{cite news|author=Steve Ekstrom|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080818-HalloweenLS.html|title=Hutchinson on Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode|publisher=Newsarama|date=2008-08-18|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Online stories ===\nAll of Stefan Hutchinson's ''Halloween'' comic books take place in the ''Halloween H20'' timeline, which retconned ''Halloween 4''\u2013''6'' from continuity. Hutchinson comments that, while the retcon was unpopular with \"a lot of fans\" for ignoring previous movies, he preferred the \"simplicity of this storyline, over the needlessly convoluted mythology that the last three films had created\". However, he admits that one of the downsides of the ''H20'' timeline is that fans do not know exactly what happened to Dr. Sam Loomis after ''Halloween II''. To remedy this, Hutchinson pitched ''Halloween: Sam'' as a way of paying tribute to the character.<ref name=FearNet/> Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from ''Autopsis''{{'}} Marcus Smith, ''Sam'' is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website HalloweenComics.com. It explores the life of Dr. Loomis, including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington, a journalist he met during [[World War II]]. In 1995, Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in a hospital and murders Elizabeth in front of him. Loomis attempts to stop him, but dies of a coronary failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweencomics.com/titles/sam.htm |title=Halloween: Sam |publisher=HalloweenComics |format=PDF |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026015054/http://www.halloweencomics.com/titles/sam.htm |archivedate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Merchandise ==\nIn 1983, [[Wizard Video]], who had also released a [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (video game)|video game version]] of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', released a ''[[Halloween (video game)|Halloween]]'' game for the [[Atari 2600]]. In the game, the player is a babysitter who has to protect her children from Michael Myers, who has managed to get inside the house.

Ford]] Presidential Library and Museum\u2014as well as numerous ongoing professional partnerships\u2014e.g., [[H. W. Brands]], [[Richard Norton Smith]], William Barker, and [[George H. Nash|George Nash]].\n\n==Other fields==\nIn addition to his public work, Whitney is a scholar who writes and lectures nationally on a variety of historical topics.  He is author or editor of fifteen books including most recently (with [[Mark Rozell]]) \"[[Religion and the American Presidency, 3rd ed.]]\" and \"[[Religion and the Bush Presidency.]]\"  Other books include \"[[American Presidents: Farewell Addresses to the Nation, 1796-2001;]]\" \"[[John Engler]]: The Man, the Leader & the Legacy;\" and 6 volumes of Messages of the [[Governors]] of [[Michigan]].\n\n==Selected works==\n*Testing the Limits: George W.

In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun's light. The Iranian festivals such as [[Mehrgan]] ([[autumnal equinox]]), [[Tirgan]], and the eve of [[Yalda|Chelle ye Zemestan]] ([[winter solstice]]) also had an origin in the Sun god ([[Surya]]). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six [[Gahambars|Gahambar]] festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]].

In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun's light. The Iranian festivals such as [[Mehrgan]] ([[autumnal equinox]]), [[Tirgan]], and the eve of [[Yalda|Chelle ye Zemestan]] ([[winter solstice]]) also had an origin in the Sun god ([[Surya]]). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six [[Gahambars|Gahambar]] festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]]. According to [[Mary Boyce]],<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Festivals: Zoroastrian\" Boyce, Mary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074500/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i |date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref> \"It seems a reasonable surmise that Nowruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by [[Zoroaster]] himself\"; although there is no clear date of origin.<ref>Boyce, M.

Under the Sassanid emperors, Nowruz was celebrated as the most important day of the year.

Other celebrations such as the [[Gahambars]] and [[Mehrgan]] were eventually side-lined or only observed by [[Zoroastrians]]. Nowruz became the main royal holiday during the [[Abbasid]] period. Much like their predecessors in the Sasanian period, [[Dehqan|Dehqans]] would offer gifts to the caliphs and local rulers at the Nowruz and Mehragan festivals.<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dehqan DEHQ\u0100N] iranicaonline.org</ref>\n\nFollowing the demise of the caliphate and the subsequent re-emergence of Iranian dynasties such as the [[Samanids]] and [[Buyids]], Nowruz became an even more important event. The Buyids revived the ancient traditions of Sassanian times and restored many smaller celebrations that had been eliminated by the caliphate. The Iranian [[Buyid]] ruler [['Adud al-Dawla]] (r. 949\u2013983) customarily welcomed Nowruz in a majestic hall, decked with gold and silver plates and vases full of fruit and colorful flowers.<ref name=\"IranicaShahbazi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nowruz-ii |title=A.

''www.bcdb.com'',  May 13, 2012</ref> and aired two seasons of 60 episodes through April 17, 2012.\n\n==Premise==\nEach episode begins with Special Agent Oso in the midst of a training exercise, which he usually fails on his first try, causing him to say \"It's all part of the plan more or less\" and Paw Pilot, his computerized assistant, which gives him a special alert by saying \"Special Alert, Special Alert\". Invariably, during the exercise, at least one child is confronted with a simple task which they have trouble completing, an event which a Shutterbug drone notices. Oso is always assigned to the case, and Paw Pilot, along with the unseen Mr. Dos, illustrate his client's plight and assign him a mission to help the child complete the task. To do so, Paw Pilot provides Oso with three special steps, a simplified step-by-step guide to completing the task. Oso is transported to the child's location and attempts to follow the steps as the three special steps are, in and of themselves, usually too vague to complete the task properly, the Paw Pilot also gives further elaborations, including at least one helpful trick. On the third and final step, the Paw Pilot senses the time limit on the task between 3 and 19 seconds and begins counting down when the time limit is near. Oso and the child usually complete the task just as the time is up. Then Paw Pilot says \"[Special] Assignment Complete\".\n\nReturning from the assignment, the helpful trick given during the assignment always turns out to be the same trick Oso needed to complete the interrupted training exercise, which he likewise completes and passes, getting a medal for both the training exercise and the special assignment.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Special Agent Oso episodes}}\n{{:List of Special Agent Oso episodes}}\nThe show has 60 episodes; 24 in the first season and 36 in the second. The episode names are usually references to the names of ''[[James Bond]]'' films from [[Eon Productions|Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions LTD]], such as ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''. The first two seasons contain at least one episode title that parodies all 22 of the existing Bond films at the time as ''[[Skyfall]]'' was released after Season 2 originally concluded, same with ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' and ''[[No Time to Die]]''. Some episode titles also parody the [[Carly Simon]] song [[Nobody Does it Better]] which is the popular theme song to ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]].'' One episode references the non-Eon film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.\n\n===Components===\nEach episode is composed of four components:\n* The 3 Special Steps are the steps that Paw Pilot gives Oso to follow when he is on his special assignments. Oso has a matter of time to finish the 3 special steps. The third step is usually timed between 3 & 19 seconds.\n* The training exercises are Oso's training task assigned by Wolfie, Dotty or Buffo. Oso usually messes up on his first try, but in the course of doing the special assignments he refers to the mistake he made in his training exercise, thanks to the person he is helping. He then returns to his training exercise and does it right, then earns a \"Digi-Medal\".\n* The special assignments are missions that Oso is requested to complete by the mysterious Mr. Dos, in order to help a child in need. Sometimes, Oso asks the audience to help him on his special assignments if it gets tricky and he needs some help. Oso tries to complete the Three Special Steps that Paw Pilot gives him. Then he earns a \"Digi-Medal\".\n* Audience participation or interaction with Oso. Sometimes, Oso will ask the audience to help him find something hidden or missing on the screen. Other times, Oso will ask the audience to try something physically demanding that he is doing.\n\n===Three Healthy Steps===\n''Special Agent Oso: Three Healthy Steps'' is a short series that airs in the [[United States]] during the [[Disney Junior]] programming block. It encourages children to use \"three healthy steps\" regarding eating, being healthy and exercising.\n\nThis series combined both animated characters and real life actors.

''www.bcdb.com'',  May 13, 2012</ref> and aired two seasons of 60 episodes through April 17, 2012.\n\n==Premise==\nEach episode begins with Special Agent Oso in the midst of a training exercise, which he usually fails on his first try, causing him to say \"It's all part of the plan more or less\" and Paw Pilot, his computerized assistant, which gives him a special alert by saying \"Special Alert, Special Alert\". Invariably, during the exercise, at least one child is confronted with a simple task which they have trouble completing, an event which a Shutterbug drone notices. Oso is always assigned to the case, and Paw Pilot, along with the unseen Mr. Dos, illustrate his client's plight and assign him a mission to help the child complete the task. To do so, Paw Pilot provides Oso with three special steps, a simplified step-by-step guide to completing the task. Oso is transported to the child's location and attempts to follow the steps as the three special steps are, in and of themselves, usually too vague to complete the task properly, the Paw Pilot also gives further elaborations, including at least one helpful trick. On the third and final step, the Paw Pilot senses the time limit on the task between 3 and 19 seconds and begins counting down when the time limit is near. Oso and the child usually complete the task just as the time is up. Then Paw Pilot says \"[Special] Assignment Complete\".\n\nReturning from the assignment, the helpful trick given during the assignment always turns out to be the same trick Oso needed to complete the interrupted training exercise, which he likewise completes and passes, getting a medal for both the training exercise and the special assignment.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Special Agent Oso episodes}}\n{{:List of Special Agent Oso episodes}}\nThe show has 60 episodes; 24 in the first season and 36 in the second. The episode names are usually references to the names of ''[[James Bond]]'' films from [[Eon Productions|Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions LTD]], such as ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''. The first two seasons contain at least one episode title that parodies all 22 of the existing Bond films at the time as ''[[Skyfall]]'' was released after Season 2 originally concluded, same with ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' and ''[[No Time to Die]]''. Some episode titles also parody the [[Carly Simon]] song [[Nobody Does it Better]] which is the popular theme song to ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]].'' One episode references the non-Eon film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.\n\n===Components===\nEach episode is composed of four components:\n* The 3 Special Steps are the steps that Paw Pilot gives Oso to follow when he is on his special assignments. Oso has a matter of time to finish the 3 special steps. The third step is usually timed between 3 & 19 seconds.\n* The training exercises are Oso's training task assigned by Wolfie, Dotty or Buffo. Oso usually messes up on his first try, but in the course of doing the special assignments he refers to the mistake he made in his training exercise, thanks to the person he is helping. He then returns to his training exercise and does it right, then earns a \"Digi-Medal\".\n* The special assignments are missions that Oso is requested to complete by the mysterious Mr. Dos, in order to help a child in need. Sometimes, Oso asks the audience to help him on his special assignments if it gets tricky and he needs some help. Oso tries to complete the Three Special Steps that Paw Pilot gives him. Then he earns a \"Digi-Medal\".\n* Audience participation or interaction with Oso. Sometimes, Oso will ask the audience to help him find something hidden or missing on the screen. Other times, Oso will ask the audience to try something physically demanding that he is doing.\n\n===Three Healthy Steps===\n''Special Agent Oso: Three Healthy Steps'' is a short series that airs in the [[United States]] during the [[Disney Junior]] programming block. It encourages children to use \"three healthy steps\" regarding eating, being healthy and exercising.\n\nThis series combined both animated characters and real life actors.

SABRA advocated the idea of transforming South Africa into a commonwealth, where population groups would develop parallel to each other.<ref name=voorgrondjul11/> May 1984 saw the establishment of the ''Afrikaner Volkswag'', an organisation founded by [[Carel Boshoff]], a right-wing academic, to put the ideas of the SABRA into practice.<ref name=voorgrondjul11/> Boshoff regarded contemporary plans of the white-minority government to retain control through limited reforms as doomed to fail.<ref name=\"latimes86\"/> Believing that black-majority rule could not be avoided, he supported the

Boshoff founded the ''Afrikaner-Vryheidstigting'' (Afrikaner Freedom Foundation) or Avstig.<ref name=voorgrondjul11/> At the time, mainstream right-wingers supported the [[bantustan]] policy, which allocated 13% of South Africa's land area for black South Africans, while leaving the remaining 87% to whites.{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=39}} The founding principles of the Avstig were based on the belief that since black majority rule was unavoidable, and white minority rule morally unjustifiable, Afrikaners would have to form their own nation, or ''[[volkstaat]]'', in a smaller part of South Africa.{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} Orania was intended to be the basis of the ''volkstaat'', which would come into existence once a large number of Afrikaners moved to Orania and other such 'growth points',{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} and would eventually include the towns of [[Prieska]], [[Britstown]], [[Carnarvon, Northern Cape|Carnarvon]], [[Williston, Northern Cape|Williston]] and [[Calvinia]], reaching the west coast.<ref name=whitegreen/>\n\nBoshoff's plans excluded the area of traditional [[Boer republics]] in the Transvaal and the Free State, which encompass the economic heartland of South Africa and much of its natural resources, instead focusing on an economically underdeveloped and semi-desert area in the north-western Cape.{{sfn|Burgt|2016|p=43-44}}{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} This desert state, ''Orande\u00eb'', because of its very inhospitableness would not be feared or coveted by the South African government.{{sfn|Christopher|2002|p=101}} Even proponents of the idea conceded that this model would demand significant economic sacrifices from Afrikaners who moved to the ''volkstaat''.{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} The model is based on the principle of 'own labour', requiring that all work in the ''volkstaat'' be performed by its citizens, including ploughing fields, collecting garbage and tending gardens, which is traditionally performed by blacks in the rest of South Africa.{{sfn|Burgt|2016|p=58-62}}{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=45}}\n\nThe town's original objective was to create an Afrikaner majority in the northwestern Cape, by encouraging the construction of other such towns, with the eventual goal of an Afrikaner majority in the area and an independent Afrikaner state between Orania and the west coast. {{sfn|Burgt|2016|p=43-44}} Boshoff had originally envisaged a population of 60,000 after 15 years.<ref name=mg>{{cite

SABRA advocated the idea of transforming South Africa into a commonwealth, where population groups would develop parallel to each other.<ref name=voorgrondjul11/> May 1984 saw the establishment of the ''Afrikaner Volkswag'', an organisation founded by [[Carel Boshoff]], a right-wing academic, to put the ideas of the SABRA into practice.<ref name=voorgrondjul11/> Boshoff regarded contemporary plans of the white-minority government to retain control through limited reforms as doomed to fail.<ref name=\"latimes86\"/> Believing that black-majority rule could not be avoided, he supported the

Boshoff founded the ''Afrikaner-Vryheidstigting'' (Afrikaner Freedom Foundation) or Avstig.<ref name=voorgrondjul11/> At the time, mainstream right-wingers supported the [[bantustan]] policy, which allocated 13% of South Africa's land area for black South Africans, while leaving the remaining 87% to whites.{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=39}} The founding principles of the Avstig were based on the belief that since black majority rule was unavoidable, and white minority rule morally unjustifiable, Afrikaners would have to form their own nation, or ''[[volkstaat]]'', in a smaller part of South Africa.{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} Orania was intended to be the basis of the ''volkstaat'', which would come into existence once a large number of Afrikaners moved to Orania and other such 'growth points',{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} and would eventually include the towns of [[Prieska]], [[Britstown]], [[Carnarvon, Northern Cape|Carnarvon]], [[Williston, Northern Cape|Williston]] and [[Calvinia]], reaching the west coast.<ref name=whitegreen/>\n\nBoshoff's plans excluded the area of traditional [[Boer republics]] in the Transvaal and the Free State, which encompass the economic heartland of South Africa and much of its natural resources, instead focusing on an economically underdeveloped and semi-desert area in the north-western Cape.{{sfn|Burgt|2016|p=43-44}}{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} This desert state, ''Orande\u00eb'', because of its very inhospitableness would not be feared or coveted by the South African government.{{sfn|Christopher|2002|p=101}} Even proponents of the idea conceded that this model would demand significant economic sacrifices from Afrikaners who moved to the ''volkstaat''.{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=44}} The model is based on the principle of 'own labour', requiring that all work in the ''volkstaat'' be performed by its citizens, including ploughing fields, collecting garbage and tending gardens, which is traditionally performed by blacks in the rest of South Africa.{{sfn|Burgt|2016|p=58-62}}{{sfn|Schonteich|Boshoff|2003|p=45}}\n\nThe town's original objective was to create an Afrikaner majority in the northwestern Cape, by encouraging the construction of other such towns, with the eventual goal of an Afrikaner majority in the area and an independent Afrikaner state between Orania and the west coast. {{sfn|Burgt|2016|p=43-44}} Boshoff had originally envisaged a population of 60,000 after 15 years.<ref name=mg>{{cite

The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming. \n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas vanishes shortly after the defeat of Corypheus; ''Inquisition's'' post-credit scene reveals his true identity. ''Trespasser'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC pack]] released for ''Inquisition'', provides further insight into his backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas. \n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. He is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world. He claimed that he mastered his magic without the help of tutors, spending years exploring the spirit realm of the Fade and coming to a rare understanding of its denizens. Although his skills are beyond doubt, it has been thus far impossible to verify the rest of his history as told.\"\n| source = \u2014Character Guide<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas presents himself as a self-taught hedge mage who wields powers developed outside of conventional teaching and who has no affiliation with the Chantry-sanctioned Circle of Magi or any Dalish clan. He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist. Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nHe's also a rare species of egg. He's dangerous because his kind carries diseases. \nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind.<ref name=\"PAX\"/> This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''.

The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/> \n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination.

After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head.

It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result. \n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. \n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan. \n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> \n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/> In her opinion piece published in response to Jackson's article about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe \"inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that nowhere is \"this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/> \n\nAlison Bell from ''Videogamer.com'' believed that the potential romantic relationship between Solas and the Inquisitor is the best written romance in a video game so far, although she compared it to that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]]: \"histrionic, ruinous, and, in the long term, one or both of you is probably going to die.\"<ref name=\"Shakespeare\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Since then, the character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Everything\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/> \n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.

The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming. \n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas vanishes shortly after the defeat of Corypheus; ''Inquisition's'' post-credit scene reveals his true identity. ''Trespasser'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC pack]] released for ''Inquisition'', provides further insight into his backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas. \n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. He is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world.

He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist.

He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result. \n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. \n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan. \n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> \n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/> In her opinion piece published in response to Jackson's article about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe \"inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that nowhere is \"this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/> \n\nAlison Bell from ''Videogamer.com'' believed that the potential romantic relationship between Solas and the Inquisitor is the best written romance in a video game so far, although she compared it to that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]]: \"histrionic, ruinous, and, in the long term, one or both of you is probably going to die.\"<ref name=\"Shakespeare\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Since then, the character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Everything\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/> \n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.
