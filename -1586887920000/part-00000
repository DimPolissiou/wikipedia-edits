In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it is defined as the ''[[actus reus]]'' (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with ''[[mens rea]]'' (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to [[inchoate offense]]s.\n\n==Background concepts==\nLegal systems more or less try to uphold the notions of [[Equity (law)|fairness]] and [[justice]]. If a [[State (polity)|state]] is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according to the idea that those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of [[strict liability]], in which the ''[[mens rea]]'' is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.\n\nEven the youngest children quickly learn that, with varying degrees of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability to the extent that the extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.\n\n===Relationship between causation and liability===\nCausation of an event alone is insufficient to create legal liability.\n\nSometimes causation is one part of a multi-stage test for legal liability. For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the tort of negligence, the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a [[duty of care]], breached that duty, by so doing caused [[Property damage|damage]] to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. Causation is just one component of the tort.\n\nOn other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of [[product liability]], the courts have come to apply to principle of ''strict liability'' : the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent.\n\nOn still other occasions, causation is irrelevant to legal liability altogether. For example, under a contract of [[Indemnity|indemnity insurance]], the [[Insurance|insurer]] agrees to indemnify the [[Victimology|victim]] for harm not caused by the insurer, but by other parties.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in establishing causation, it is one area of the law where the case law overlaps significantly with general doctrines of [[analytic philosophy]] to do with causation. The two subjects have long been intermingled.\n\n== Establishing causation ==\nWhere establishing causation is required to establish legal liability, it usually involves a two-stage inquiry, firstly establishing 'factual' causation, then 'legal' causation.\n\n\u2018Factual\u2019 causation must be established before inquiring into legal causation, perhaps by assessing if the defendant acted in the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\n\nDetermining \u2018legal\u2019 causation often involves a question of public policy regarding the sort of situation in which, despite the outcome of the factual enquiry,  the defendant might nevertheless be released from liability, or impose liability.\n\n==Establishing factual causation==\nThe usual method of establishing factual causation is the ''but-for test''. The but for test inquires \u2018But for the defendant\u2019s act, would the harm have occurred?\u2019 A shoots and wounds B. We ask \u2018But for A's act, would B have been wounded?\u2019 The answer is \u2018No.\u2019 So we conclude that A caused the harm to B. The but for test is a test of necessity. It asks was it \u2018necessary\u2019 for the defendant\u2019s act to have occurred for the harm to have occurred. In New South Wales, this requirement exists in s 5D of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW),<ref name=\"CLA 5D\">{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5D}} General principles.</ref> reinforcing established common law principles.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |date=10 November 2009 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nOne weakness in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally in such a case would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death.\n\nThe courts have generally accepted the but for test notwithstanding these weaknesses, qualifying it by saying that causation is to be understood \u201cas the man in the street\u201d would,<ref>''[[Yorkshire Dale Steamship Co v Minister of War Transport]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|1942||AC|691|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}.</ref>, or by supplementing it with \u201ccommon sense\u201d.<ref name=\"March v Stramare\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1993|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=24 April 1991}}.</ref>\n\nThis dilemma was handled in the [[United States]] in ''[[State v. Tally]]'', {{West|S|15||722|Ala.|1894|738}}, where the court ruled that: \u201cThe assistance given ... need not contribute to criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it.\u201d Using this logic, A and B are liable in that no matter who was responsible for the fatal shot, the other \"facilitated\" the criminal act even though his shot was not necessary to deliver the fatal blow.\n\nHowever, legal scholars have attempted to make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Tony Honor\u00e9]], and later [[Richard W. Wright (Professor, Chicago-Kent College of Law)|Richard Wright]], have said that something is a cause if it is a \u2018necessary element of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the result\u2019. This is known as the [[NESS test]]. In the case of the [[Summers v. Tice|two hunters]], the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being in the right place at the right time, gravity, etc. In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense.\n\nHart and Honore, in their famous work ''Causation in the Law'', also tackle the problem of 'too many causes'. For them, there are degrees of causal contribution.  A member of the NESS set is a \"causally relevant condition\". This is elevated into a \"cause\" where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. So, returning to our [[Hunting|hunter]] example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a \"cause\". On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated to the status of \"cause\". An intermediate position can be occupied by those who \"occasion\" harm, such as accomplices. Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal to the scene of the crime. Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a \"cause\" (on the but for or NESS test). So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. However, the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. They consider that once something is a \"but for\" (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy.\n\n==Establishing legal causation==\nNotwithstanding the fact that causation may be established in the above situations, the law often intervenes and says that it will nevertheless not hold the defendant liable because in the circumstances the defendant is not to be understood, in a legal sense, as having caused the loss. In the United States, this is known as the doctrine of [[proximate cause]]. The most important doctrine is that of ''novus actus interveniens'', which means a \u2018new intervening act\u2019 which may \u2018cut the chain of causation\u2019.\n\n===Proximate cause===\n{{Main|Proximate cause}}\nThe but-for test is factual causation and often gives us the right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. Two difficulties are immediately obvious. The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant tortious conduct would not have occurred. But for the victim of a crime missing the [[bus]], he or she would not have been at the site of the crime and hence the crime would not have occurred.  Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm. This often does not matter in the case where cause is only one element of liability, as the remote actor will most likely not have committed the other elements of the test. The legally liable cause is the one closest to or most proximate to the injury. This is known as the Proximate Cause rule. However, this situation can arise in strict liability situations.\n\n===Intervening cause===\nImagine the following. A critically injures B. As B is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning. She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, A caused B's whole injury on the \u2018but for\u2019 or NESS test.<ref name=\"CLA 5D\"/><ref name=\"March v Stramare\"/> However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning.\n\nThe effect of the principle may be stated simply:\n:if the new event, whether through human agency or natural causes, does not break the chain, the original actor is liable for all the consequences flowing naturally from the initial circumstances. But if the new act breaks the chain, the liability of the initial actor stops at that point, and the new actor, if human, will be liable for all that flows from his or her contribution.\n\nNote, however, that this does not apply if the [[Eggshell skull]] rule is used.<ref>''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'' (1985) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 501.</ref><ref name=\"Kavanagh v Akhtar\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite=(1998) 45 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 588 |courtname=auto |date=23 December 1998}}.</ref> For details, see article on the Eggshell Skull doctrine.<ref>[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/camplr24&div=6&g_sent=1&collection=journals# J. Stanley McQuade, The Eggshell Skull Rule and Related Problems in Recovery for Mental Harm in the Law of Torts, 24 Campbell L. Rev. 1, 46 (2001)]</ref>\nactus interveniens\n\n===Independent sufficient causes===\nWhen two or more negligent parties, where the consequence of their negligence joins together to cause damages, in a circumstance where either one of them alone would have caused it anyway, each is deemed to be an \"Independent Sufficient Cause,\" because each could be deemed a \"substantial factor,\"  and both are held legally responsible for the damages. For example, where negligent firestarter A's fire joins with negligent firestarter B's fire to burn down House C, both A and B are held responsible. (e.g., ''Anderson v. Minneapolis, St: P. & S. St. R.R. Co''., 146 Minn. 430, 179 N.W. 45 (1920).)  This is an element of Legal Cause.\n\n===''Summers v. Tice'' Rule===\n\nThe other problem is that of overdetermination.  Imagine two hunters, A and B, who each negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye.  Each shot on its own would have been sufficient to cause the damage.  But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out?  Yes.  The same answer follows in relation to B's shot.  But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held that in order to prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See ''[[Summers v. Tice]]'', 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948).  This is known, simply, as the ''Summers v. Tice'' Rule.\n\n===Concurrent actual causes===\nSuppose that two actors' negligent acts combine to produce one set of damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have occurred at all.  This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes.  These are \"concurrent actual causes\".  In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their negligent acts. Example:  A leaves truck parked in the middle of the road at night with its lights off.  B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles.  Both parties were negligent. (''Hill v. Edmonds'', 26 A.D.2d 554, 270 N.Y.S.2d 1020 (1966).)\n\n===Foreseeability===\n\nLegal Causation is usually expressed as a question of 'foreseeability'.  An actor is liable for the foreseeable, but not the unforeseeable, consequences of his or her act.  For example, it is foreseeable that if I shoot someone on a beach and they are immobilized, they may drown in a rising tide rather than from the trauma of the gunshot wound or from loss of blood.  However it is not (generally speaking) foreseeable that they will be struck by lightning and killed by that event.\n\nThis type of causal foreseeability is to be distinguished from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which is a question of remoteness of damage, not causation.  For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, it would be hard to construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage.  There is no ''novus actus interveniens''.  However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence.<ref name= \"PC\">{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd]] (Wagon Mound No. 1) |year=1961 |court=UKPC |num=2 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1961] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 388; [1961] 1 [[All England Law Reports |All ER]] 404 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=18 January 1961}}.</ref>  That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.{{or|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Example==\nAn example of how foreseeability does not apply to the extent of an injury is the [[eggshell skull rule]].  If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will need to go to the hospital for.  However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw is disclocated by my punch, then the medical bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment.  Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.\n\n== Other relevant considerations ==\nBecause causation in the law is a complex amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk.  Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.\n\n===Foreseeability tests===\nSome aspects of the physical world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to [[imputation (law)|impute]] knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any [[reasonable person]] would consider safe but a [[storm surge]] caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a ''novus actus''. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a [[flash flood]], an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a ''novus actus''.\n\nThe question of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B is only slightly injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say that he ''ought'' to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.\n\nSimilarly, in the quantification of damages generally and/or the partitioning of damages between two or more defendants, the extent of the liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.\n\n===Risk===\nSometimes the reverse situation to a ''novus actus'' occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved but the court nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable.  In ''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories'', {{West|P|607|2|924|Cal.|1980|}} the plaintiff's mother consumed [[diethylstilbestrol]] as a miscarriage preventative.<ref name=\"Sindell5945\">''Sindell'', at 594-95.{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref> The medicine, later recalled from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture.<ref name=\"Sindell5945\"/> However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market.  The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.<ref>''Sindell'', at 596.{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  The court held that the defendant was liable in proportion to its market share.<ref name=\"Sindell6112\">''Sindell'', at 611-12.{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a \u2018risk based\u2019 approach to liability.  The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm.<ref name=\"Sindell6112\"/>  Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.  However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In ''R v Miller'' {{Oscola|NEUT|1982|||6|UKHL|}}, the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.\n\n===Evidence proving causation===\nTo be acceptable, any rule of law must be capable of being applied consistently, thus a definition of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B on the road and by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a [[Autopsy|post mortem]] to determine the initial degree of injury and the extent to which B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a ''novus actus'' breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a ''novus actus'' and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.\n\nRoads are, by their nature, used by vehicles and it is clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is at risk of being further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more [[proximate cause]]. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] objectively.\n\n== The future? ==\nA difficult issue that has arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor increases the risk of its occurrence.  In ''[[Chester v Afshar]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|2004|4|All ER|587|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}, a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically [[cauda equina syndrome]].<ref name=\"Chester5\">''Chester'' [5].{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury.<ref name=\"Chester5\"/>  It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time.<ref>''Chester'' [7].{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  The risk of the injury would be the same at both times.  Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way).  Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable.  Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.\n\n==English criminal case law examples==\n\n===''[[Breaking the chain|Novus actus interveniens]]''===\n*'''Victim's contribution''' ''R v Dear'' (1996) CLR 595. Believing that the victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because he had failed to take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a ''novus actus interveniens''). It was held that the real question was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death.\n*'''Third party's inadvertent contribution''' ''[[R v Smith]]'' (1959) 2 QB 35 the defendant stabbed his victim twice in a barrack room brawl. Another soldier carried him to the medical centre but dropped him twice. The medical captain was very busy and failed to recognise the extent of the injuries. If the soldier had received proper treatment, he would have had a good chance of a complete recovery. Smith was convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] because the wound was the \"operating and substantial cause of death\".  In ''R v Cheshire'' (1991) 3 AER 670, the victim was shot in the leg and stomach. In hospital, he suffered pneumonia and respiratory problems in intensive care so had a tracheotomy. After two months, he died. There was some medical negligence because the tracheotomy had caused a thickening of tissue ultimately causing suffocation. In upholding the conviction for [[murder in English law|murder]], [[Roy Beldam|Beldam LJ]] laid down the following test:\n:Even though negligence in the treatment of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death, that they regard the contribution made by his acts as insignificant.\n*'''Third party's deliberate intervention''' ''R v Malcherek'' (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The victim was placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that the doctors had broken the chain of causation  by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and substantial cause of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold the effect of the injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In ''R v Pagett'' (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in [[self-defence in English law|self-defence]] could not be regarded as a ''novus actus interveniens'' because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.\n\n===Foreseeability===\n*'''Victim's conscious actions''' ''[[R v. Blaue]]''<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Blaue |year=1975 |court=EWCA |division=Crim |num=3 |date=16 July 1975 |courtname=auto}}</ref> is a criminal law application of the \"[[thin skull rule]]\" in [[criminal law]]. The defendant visited the home of a Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act, namely [[grievous bodily harm|wounding with intent]]. \"But for\" his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=causation-law |title=Causation in the Law |last=Honor\u00e9 |first=Anthony |author-link=Tony Honor\u00e9 }}\n\n{{English criminal law navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Causality]]\n[[Category:Criminal law]]\n[[Category:Elements of crime]]\n[[Category:Judicial remedies]]\n[[Category:Legal concepts]]\n[[Category:Tort law]]\n[[Category:Delict]]\n[[Category:Legal reasoning]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|the causal relationship between conduct and result }}\n{{Redirect|Legal cause}}\n{{About|legal causation|causation in other contexts|Causation (disambiguation)|date=September 2011}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}\n{{Criminal law}}\n'''Causation''' is the \"causal relationship between the defendant's conduct and end result\". In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it is defined as the ''[[actus reus]]'' (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with ''[[mens rea]]'' (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to [[inchoate offense]]s.\n\n==Background concepts==\nLegal systems more or less try to uphold the notions of [[Equity (law)|fairness]] and [[justice]]. If a [[State (polity)|state]] is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according to the idea that those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of [[strict liability]], in which the ''[[mens rea]]'' is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.\n\nEven the youngest children quickly learn that, with varying degrees of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability to the extent that the extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.\n\n===Relationship between causation and liability===\nCausation of an event alone is insufficient to create legal liability.\n\nSometimes causation is one part of a multi-stage test for legal liability. For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the tort of negligence, the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a [[duty of care]], breached that duty, by so doing caused [[Property damage|damage]] to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. Causation is just one component of the tort.\n\nOn other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of [[product liability]], the courts have come to apply to principle of ''strict liability'' : the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent.\n\nOn still other occasions, causation is irrelevant to legal liability altogether. For example, under a contract of [[Indemnity|indemnity insurance]], the [[Insurance|insurer]] agrees to indemnify the [[Victimology|victim]] for harm not caused by the insurer, but by other parties.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in establishing causation, it is one area of the law where the case law overlaps significantly with general doctrines of analytic philosophy to do with causation. The two subjects have long been intermingled.\n\n== Establishing causation ==\nWhere establishing causation is required to establish legal liability, it usually involves a two-stage inquiry, firstly establishing 'factual' causation, then 'legal' causation.\n\n\u2018Factual\u2019 causation must be established before inquiring into legal causation, perhaps by assessing if the defendant acted in the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\n\nDetermining \u2018legal\u2019 causation often involves a question of public policy regarding the sort of situation in which, despite the outcome of the factual enquiry,  the defendant might nevertheless be released from liability, or impose liability.\n\n==Establishing factual causation==\nThe usual method of establishing factual causation is the ''but-for test''. The but for test inquires \u2018But for the defendant\u2019s act, would the harm have occurred?\u2019 A shoots and wounds B. We ask \u2018But for A's act, would B have been wounded?\u2019 The answer is \u2018No.\u2019 So we conclude that A caused the harm to B. The but for test is a test of necessity. It asks was it \u2018necessary\u2019 for the defendant\u2019s act to have occurred for the harm to have occurred. In New South Wales, this requirement exists in s 5D of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW),<ref name=\"CLA 5D\">{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5D}} General principles.</ref> reinforcing established common law principles.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |date=10 November 2009 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nOne weakness in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally in such a case would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death.\n\nThe courts have generally accepted the but for test notwithstanding these weaknesses, qualifying it by saying that causation is to be understood \u201cas the man in the street\u201d would,<ref>''[[Yorkshire Dale Steamship Co v Minister of War Transport]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|1942||AC|691|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}.</ref>, or by supplementing it with \u201ccommon sense\u201d.<ref name=\"March v Stramare\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1993|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=24 April 1991}}.</ref>\n\nThis dilemma was handled in the [[United States]] in ''[[State v. Tally]]'', {{West|S|15||722|Ala.|1894|738}}, where the court ruled that: \u201cThe assistance given ... need not contribute to criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it.\u201d Using this logic, A and B are liable in that no matter who was responsible for the fatal shot, the other \"facilitated\" the criminal act even though his shot was not necessary to deliver the fatal blow.\n\nHowever, legal scholars have attempted to make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Tony Honor\u00e9]], and later [[Richard W. Wright (Professor, Chicago-Kent College of Law)|Richard Wright]], have said that something is a cause if it is a \u2018necessary element of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the result\u2019. This is known as the [[NESS test]]. In the case of the [[Summers v. Tice|two hunters]], the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being in the right place at the right time, gravity, etc. In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense.\n\nHart and Honore, in their famous work ''Causation in the Law'', also tackle the problem of 'too many causes'. For them, there are degrees of causal contribution.  A member of the NESS set is a \"causally relevant condition\". This is elevated into a \"cause\" where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. So, returning to our [[Hunting|hunter]] example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a \"cause\". On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated to the status of \"cause\". An intermediate position can be occupied by those who \"occasion\" harm, such as accomplices. Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal to the scene of the crime. Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a \"cause\" (on the but for or NESS test). So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. However, the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. They consider that once something is a \"but for\" (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy.\n\n==Establishing legal causation==\nNotwithstanding the fact that causation may be established in the above situations, the law often intervenes and says that it will nevertheless not hold the defendant liable because in the circumstances the defendant is not to be understood, in a legal sense, as having caused the loss. In the United States, this is known as the doctrine of [[proximate cause]]. The most important doctrine is that of ''novus actus interveniens'', which means a \u2018new intervening act\u2019 which may \u2018cut the chain of causation\u2019.\n\n===Proximate cause===\n{{Main|Proximate cause}}\nThe but-for test is factual causation and often gives us the right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. Two difficulties are immediately obvious. The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant tortious conduct would not have occurred. But for the victim of a crime missing the [[bus]], he or she would not have been at the site of the crime and hence the crime would not have occurred.  Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm. This often does not matter in the case where cause is only one element of liability, as the remote actor will most likely not have committed the other elements of the test. The legally liable cause is the one closest to or most proximate to the injury. This is known as the Proximate Cause rule. However, this situation can arise in strict liability situations.\n\n===Intervening cause===\nImagine the following. A critically injures B. As B is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning. She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, A caused B's whole injury on the \u2018but for\u2019 or NESS test.<ref name=\"CLA 5D\"/><ref name=\"March v Stramare\"/> However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning.\n\nThe effect of the principle may be stated simply:\n:if the new event, whether through human agency or natural causes, does not break the chain, the original actor is liable for all the consequences flowing naturally from the initial circumstances. But if the new act breaks the chain, the liability of the initial actor stops at that point, and the new actor, if human, will be liable for all that flows from his or her contribution.\n\nNote, however, that this does not apply if the [[Eggshell skull]] rule is used.<ref>''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'' (1985) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 501.</ref><ref name=\"Kavanagh v Akhtar\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite=(1998) 45 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 588 |courtname=auto |date=23 December 1998}}.</ref> For details, see article on the Eggshell Skull doctrine.<ref>[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/camplr24&div=6&g_sent=1&collection=journals# J. Stanley McQuade, The Eggshell Skull Rule and Related Problems in Recovery for Mental Harm in the Law of Torts, 24 Campbell L. Rev. 1, 46 (2001)]</ref>\nactus interveniens\n\n===Independent sufficient causes===\nWhen two or more negligent parties, where the consequence of their negligence joins together to cause damages, in a circumstance where either one of them alone would have caused it anyway, each is deemed to be an \"Independent Sufficient Cause,\" because each could be deemed a \"substantial factor,\"  and both are held legally responsible for the damages. For example, where negligent firestarter A's fire joins with negligent firestarter B's fire to burn down House C, both A and B are held responsible. (e.g., ''Anderson v. Minneapolis, St: P. & S. St. R.R. Co''., 146 Minn. 430, 179 N.W. 45 (1920).)  This is an element of Legal Cause.\n\n===''Summers v. Tice'' Rule===\n\nThe other problem is that of overdetermination.  Imagine two hunters, A and B, who each negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye.  Each shot on its own would have been sufficient to cause the damage.  But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out?  Yes.  The same answer follows in relation to B's shot.  But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held that in order to prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See ''[[Summers v. Tice]]'', 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948).  This is known, simply, as the ''Summers v. Tice'' Rule.\n\n===Concurrent actual causes===\nSuppose that two actors' negligent acts combine to produce one set of damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have occurred at all.  This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes.  These are \"concurrent actual causes\".  In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their negligent acts. Example:  A leaves truck parked in the middle of the road at night with its lights off.  B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles.  Both parties were negligent. (''Hill v. Edmonds'', 26 A.D.2d 554, 270 N.Y.S.2d 1020 (1966).)\n\n===Foreseeability===\n\nLegal Causation is usually expressed as a question of 'foreseeability'.  An actor is liable for the foreseeable, but not the unforeseeable, consequences of his or her act.  For example, it is foreseeable that if I shoot someone on a beach and they are immobilized, they may drown in a rising tide rather than from the trauma of the gunshot wound or from loss of blood.  However it is not (generally speaking) foreseeable that they will be struck by lightning and killed by that event.\n\nThis type of causal foreseeability is to be distinguished from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which is a question of remoteness of damage, not causation.  For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, it would be hard to construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage.  There is no ''novus actus interveniens''.  However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence.<ref name= \"PC\">{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd]] (Wagon Mound No. 1) |year=1961 |court=UKPC |num=2 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1961] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 388; [1961] 1 [[All England Law Reports |All ER]] 404 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=18 January 1961}}.</ref>  That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.{{or|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Example==\nAn example of how foreseeability does not apply to the extent of an injury is the [[eggshell skull rule]].  If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will need to go to the hospital for.  However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw is disclocated by my punch, then the medical bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment.  Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.\n\n== Other relevant considerations ==\nBecause causation in the law is a complex amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk.  Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.\n\n===Foreseeability tests===\nSome aspects of the physical world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to [[imputation (law)|impute]] knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any [[reasonable person]] would consider safe but a [[storm surge]] caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a ''novus actus''. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a [[flash flood]], an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a ''novus actus''.\n\nThe question of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B is only slightly injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say that he ''ought'' to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.\n\nSimilarly, in the quantification of damages generally and/or the partitioning of damages between two or more defendants, the extent of the liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.\n\n===Risk===\nSometimes the reverse situation to a ''novus actus'' occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved but the court nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable.  In ''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories'', {{West|P|607|2|924|Cal.|1980|}} the plaintiff's mother consumed [[diethylstilbestrol]] as a miscarriage preventative.<ref name=\"Sindell5945\">''Sindell'', at 594-95.{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref> The medicine, later recalled from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture.<ref name=\"Sindell5945\"/> However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market.  The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.<ref>''Sindell'', at 596.{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  The court held that the defendant was liable in proportion to its market share.<ref name=\"Sindell6112\">''Sindell'', at 611-12.{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a \u2018risk based\u2019 approach to liability.  The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm.<ref name=\"Sindell6112\"/>  Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.  However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In ''R v Miller'' {{Oscola|NEUT|1982|||6|UKHL|}}, the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.\n\n===Evidence proving causation===\nTo be acceptable, any rule of law must be capable of being applied consistently, thus a definition of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B on the road and by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a [[Autopsy|post mortem]] to determine the initial degree of injury and the extent to which B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a ''novus actus'' breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a ''novus actus'' and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.\n\nRoads are, by their nature, used by vehicles and it is clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is at risk of being further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more [[proximate cause]]. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] objectively.\n\n== The future? ==\nA difficult issue that has arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor increases the risk of its occurrence.  In ''[[Chester v Afshar]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|2004|4|All ER|587|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}, a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically [[cauda equina syndrome]].<ref name=\"Chester5\">''Chester'' [5].{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury.<ref name=\"Chester5\"/>  It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time.<ref>''Chester'' [7].{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>  The risk of the injury would be the same at both times.  Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way).  Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable.  Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.\n\n==English criminal case law examples==\n\n===''[[Breaking the chain|Novus actus interveniens]]''===\n*'''Victim's contribution''' ''R v Dear'' (1996) CLR 595. Believing that the victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because he had failed to take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a ''novus actus interveniens''). It was held that the real question was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death.\n*'''Third party's inadvertent contribution''' ''[[R v Smith]]'' (1959) 2 QB 35 the defendant stabbed his victim twice in a barrack room brawl. Another soldier carried him to the medical centre but dropped him twice. The medical captain was very busy and failed to recognise the extent of the injuries. If the soldier had received proper treatment, he would have had a good chance of a complete recovery. Smith was convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] because the wound was the \"operating and substantial cause of death\".  In ''R v Cheshire'' (1991) 3 AER 670, the victim was shot in the leg and stomach. In hospital, he suffered pneumonia and respiratory problems in intensive care so had a tracheotomy. After two months, he died. There was some medical negligence because the tracheotomy had caused a thickening of tissue ultimately causing suffocation. In upholding the conviction for [[murder in English law|murder]], [[Roy Beldam|Beldam LJ]] laid down the following test:\n:Even though negligence in the treatment of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death, that they regard the contribution made by his acts as insignificant.\n*'''Third party's deliberate intervention''' ''R v Malcherek'' (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The victim was placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that the doctors had broken the chain of causation  by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and substantial cause of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold the effect of the injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In ''R v Pagett'' (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in [[self-defence in English law|self-defence]] could not be regarded as a ''novus actus interveniens'' because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.\n\n===Foreseeability===\n*'''Victim's conscious actions''' ''[[R v. Blaue]]''<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Blaue |year=1975 |court=EWCA |division=Crim |num=3 |date=16 July 1975 |courtname=auto}}</ref> is a criminal law application of the \"[[thin skull rule]]\" in [[criminal law]]. The defendant visited the home of a Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act, namely [[grievous bodily harm|wounding with intent]]. \"But for\" his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=causation-law |title=Causation in the Law |last=Honor\u00e9 |first=Anthony |author-link=Tony Honor\u00e9 }}\n\n{{English criminal law navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Causality]]\n[[Category:Criminal law]]\n[[Category:Elements of crime]]\n[[Category:Judicial remedies]]\n[[Category:Legal concepts]]\n[[Category:Tort law]]\n[[Category:Delict]]\n[[Category:Legal reasoning]]\n", "name_user": "Jarble", "label": "safe", "comment": "linking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causation_(law)"}
{"title_page": "Cornelia (gens)", "text_new": "{{short description|Families from Ancient Rome}}\n[[File:Sepolcro degli Scipioni 001 Entrata.jpg|thumb|300px|Entrance to the [[Tomb of the Scipios]] at Rome.]]\nThe '''gens Cornelia''' was one of the greatest [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] houses at Rome.  For more than seven hundred years, from the early decades of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] to the third century AD, the Cornelii produced more eminent statesmen and generals than any other [[gens]].  At least seventy-five [[Roman consul|consuls]] under the Republic were members of this family, beginning with [[Servius Cornelius Maluginensis]] in 485 BC.  Together with the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], [[Manlia (gens)|Manlii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]], the Cornelii were almost certainly numbered among the ''gentes maiores'', the most important and powerful families of Rome, who for centuries dominated the Republican [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]].  All of the major branches of the Cornelian gens were patrician, but there were also [[plebs|plebeian]] Cornelii, at least some of whom were descended from [[freedman|freedmen]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Cornelia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, p. 855 (\"Cornelia Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe origin of the Cornelii is lost to history, but the [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] ''Cornelius'' may be formed from the hypothetical [[cognomen]] ''Corneus'', meaning \"horny\", that is, having thick or callused skin.  The existence of such a cognomen in early times may be inferred from its diminutive, ''Corneolus''.  Such a derivation implies a [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] origin for the Cornelii, and there is no evidence to contradict this, but beyond this no traditions survive relating to the family's beginning.<ref>Chase, p. 124.</ref>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe Cornelii employed a wide variety of [[praenomen|praenomina]], although individual families tended to favor certain names and avoid others.  ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]], [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]], [[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]]'', and ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' were common to most branches, while other names were used by individual ''stirpes''; ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]'' primarily by the Cornelii Maluginenses and the Cethegi, ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]'' by the Cethegi, and ''[[Aulus (praenomen)|Aulus]]'' by the Cossi.  Other names occur infrequently; ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'' appears once amongst the Lentuli, who later revived the old surname ''Cossus'' as a praenomen, while the Cornelii Sullae made use of ''[[Faustus (praenomen)|Faustus]]''.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Cornelian gens included both patricians and plebeians, but all of its major families were patrician.  The surnames ''Arvina, Blasio, Cethegus, Cinna, Cossus, Dolabella, Lentulus, Maluginensis, Mammula, Merenda, Merula, Rufinus, Scapula, Scipio, Sisenna'', and ''Sulla'' belonged to patrician Cornelii, while the plebeian cognomina included ''Balbus'' and ''Gallus''.  Other surnames are known from freedmen, including ''Chrysogonus, Culleolus, Phagita'', and others.  A number of plebeian Cornelii had no cognomen.<ref name=\"DGRBM Cornelia Gens\"/>\n\nThe first of the Cornelii to appear in history bore the surname ''Maluginensis''.  This family seems to have divided into two ''stirpes'' in the 430s, the senior line retaining ''Maluginensis'', while the younger branches assumed ''Cossus''.  From their [[Roman naming conventions#Filiation|filiations]], the first of the Cornelii Cossi would seem to have been younger sons of [[Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis]], a member of the [[Decemviri#Second Decemvirate|Second Decemvirate]] in 450 BC.  Both families produced a number of consuls and [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribunes]] during the fourth and fifth centuries BC.  The Maluginenses disappeared before the period of the [[Samnite Wars]], although the Cornelii Scipiones appear to have been descended from this family, while the surname ''Cossus'' appears as late as the beginning of the third century; members of the latter family also bore the cognomina ''Rutilus'', \"reddish\", and ''Arvina''.  ''Cossus'' itself seems to belong to a class of surnames derived from objects or animals, referring to the larva of certain beetles that burrow under the bark of trees.  The Cornelii Lentuli subsequently revived ''Cossus'' as a surname.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 378 (\"Arvina\"), 865 (\"Cossus\"), vol. II, p. 909 (\"Maluginensis\").</ref><ref name=\"Chase 112\">Chase, pp. 112, 113.</ref>\n\nThe Cornelii Scipiones derived their surname from a legend in which the first of the family served as a staff (''scipio'') for his blind father.  Since the first of the Scipiones seems to have borne the cognomen ''Maluginensis'', he would seem to have been the son of Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, one of the consular tribunes in 404 BC.  The Scipiones produced numerous consuls and several prominent generals, of whom the most celebrated were [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] and [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]].  Members of this family held the highest offices of the Roman state from the beginning of the fourth century BC down to the second century of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], a span of nearly six hundred years.  Its members bore a large number of additional surnames, including ''Barbatus'', \"bearded\", ''Scapula'', \"shoulder blade\", ''Asina'', \"she-ass\", ''Calvus'', \"bald\", ''Hispallus'', \"little Spaniard\", ''Nasica'', \"nosed\", and ''Corculum'', \"little heart\", in addition to those derived from their military exploits: ''Africanus'' and ''Asiaticus''.  The last generations of this great family were originally adopted from the [[Salvidiena (gens)|Salvidieni]], and so bore the additional names of ''Salvidienus Orfitus''.  The Scipiones had a large [[Tomb of the Scipios|family sepulchre]] at Rome, which still exists, having been rediscovered in 1780.<ref>Macrobius, i. 6.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, pp. 739\u2013741 (\"Scipio\").</ref><ref name=\"Chase 109\">Chase, pp. 109, 110 (''Barbatus, Scapula, Nasica, Calvus''), 112, 113 (''Asina, Scipio''), 114 (''Africanus, Hispallus'').</ref>\n\nThe cognomen ''Lentulus'' probably belongs to a class of surnames deriving from the habits or qualities of the persons to whom they were first applied; the adjective ''lentulus'' means \"rather slow\".  An alternative explanation is that the name is a diminutive of ''lens'', a lentil, and so belongs to the same class of surnames as ''Cicero'', a chickpea, and ''Caepio'', an onion.<ref>Chase, pp. 110\u2013113.</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Lentulus\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, pp. 728, 729 (\"Lentulus).</ref>  The Cornelii Lentuli were famed for their pride and haughtiness, so that [[Cicero]] uses ''Lentulitas'', \"Lentulusness\", to describe the most aristocratic of the patricians.<ref>Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Familiares'' iii. 7. \u00a7 5.</ref>  The Lentuli appear in history from the time of the Samnite Wars to the first century of the Empire, a period of about four hundred years.  Their origin is uncertain.  According to Livy, early in the Second Samnite War, [[Lucius Cornelius Lentulus (consul 327 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Lentulus]] described his father as the only man who, during the [[Battle of the Allia#Aftermath, the sack of Rome|Gallic sack of Rome]] in 390 BC, had opposed paying a ransom to ensure the departure of the [[Gauls]] from the city.<ref>Livy, ix. 4.</ref>  The filiations of other early Lentuli suggest that their ancestors used the name ''Gnaeus'', suggesting that they could have been descendants of the Cornelii Cossi.\n\nThe Lentuli used a number of additional surnames, including ''Caudinus,'' apparently referring to the [[Battle of the Caudine Forks]], ''crus'', a leg, or the shin, ''Gaetulicus'', bestowed upon the conqueror of the [[Gaetuli]], ''Lupus'', a wolf, ''Niger'', black, ''Spinther'', a bracelet, and ''Sura'', the calf.  The Lentuli also revived several old cognomina that had belonged to other ''stirpes'' of the Cornelii: ''Maluginensis'', ''Cossus'', ''Rufinus'', and ''Scipio''.  At least two of this family bore surnames derived from other ''gentes''; ''Clodianus'' was borne by a Lentulus who had been adopted from the [[Claudia (gens)|Clodii]], while ''Marcellinus'' belonged to a member of the family who was adopted from the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii Marcelli]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Lentulus\"/><ref>Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Atticum'' i. 19. \u00a7 2.</ref><ref>Pliny the Elder, xviii. 3.</ref>\n\nThe Cornelii Rufini appear in the latter half of the fourth century BC, beginning with [[Publius Cornelius Rufinus]], dictator in 334 BC.  From the surname ''Rufinus'', meaning \"reddish\", one may infer that the first of this family had red hair.<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  A descendant of this family was the first to assume the cognomen ''Sulla'', about the time of the [[Second Punic War]].  The name is probably a diminutive of ''Sura'', a cognomen found in several gentes, including among the Cornelii Lentuli, and probably referred to someone with prominent calves.<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  [[Plutarch]], who erroneously believed that the dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] was the first to bear the name, thought it must have referred to a blotchy, reddish complexion, while [[Macrobius]] derives it from ''Sibylla'', an etymology that is rejected by [[Quintilian]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Sulla\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, pp. 933\u2013944 (\"Sulla\").</ref><ref>Plutarch, \"The Life of Sulla\", 2.</ref><ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', i. 17.</ref><ref>Quintilian, i. 4. \u00a7 25.</ref>  The dictator Sulla adopted the agnomen ''Felix'', meaning \"fortunate\" or \"happy\", and this name was passed on to some of his descendants.<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref>  The Sullae continued in the highest offices of the state well into imperial times.  The last appearing in history fell victim to [[Elagabalus]], early in the third century AD.<ref name=\"DGRBM Sulla\"/>\n\nThe Dolabellae first came to prominence at the beginning of the third century BC, and so remained until the reign of [[Vitellius]].  Several of the Dolabellae achieved high office, and one was ''[[Rex Sacrorum]]'', but many of this family were notorious for their pride, extravagance, and disregard for the law.  Their surname, ''Dolabella'', is a diminutive of ''dolabra'', a mattock or pickaxe, and belongs to a common class of surnames derived from everyday objects.<ref name=\"Chase 112\"/><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. dolabra''.</ref>\n\nSeveral lesser patrician ''stirpes'' flourished during the late Republic and early years of the Empire.  The Cornelii Merendae flourished for about a century, beginning in the early third century BC.  Their cognomen means the midday meal, and is also found among the patrician [[Antonia (gens)|Antonii]].  The Blasiones appeared at the same time and flourished for about 160 years; their surname was originally given to one who stammers.<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  ''Cethegus'' is a cognomen whose original meaning and significance have been lost.  The Cornelii Cethegi first appear in the latter half of the third century BC, and were described by [[Horace|Quintus Horatius Flaccus]] as ''cinctuti Cethegi'', for their old-fashioned practice of wearing their arms bare.  They remained prominent for the next two centuries.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 675, 676 (\"Cethegus\").</ref><ref>Horace, ''Ars Po\u00ebtica'', 50.</ref>  The Cornelii Mammulae held several praetorships, beginning at the time of the Second Punic War, but they never attained the consulship, and disappeared after about fifty years.  Their surname is a diminutive of ''mamma'', a breast.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 913 (\"Mammula\").</ref><ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  ''Merula'' refers to an ouzel, or [[common blackbird|blackbird]].  The family that bore this surname rose from obscurity at the beginning of the second century BC, and continued for the next century.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 1049 (\"Merula\").</ref>  The Cornelii Cinnae were the last patrician family to emerge in the late second century BC; they retained prominence until the early decades of the Empire.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 754, 755 (\"Cornelius Cinna\").</ref>\n\n''Balbus'', which like ''Blasio'' signifies a stammerer,<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/> was not originally a surname of the Cornelia gens, but was adopted by a native of [[Cadiz|Gades]], who was granted [[Roman citizenship]] by [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]], as a reward for military service during the [[Sertorian War|War against Sertorius]].  He probably took the nomen ''Cornelius'' after [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus|Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus]], who ratified the act making Balbus a citizen in 72 BC.  He eventually attained the consulship, but the family, which was plebeian, disappeared from history in the early years of the Empire.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 455\u2013457 (\"Balbus\", V, \"Cornelii Balbi\").</ref>  Another plebeian surname of the Cornelii was ''Gallus'', known from [[Cornelius Gallus|Gaius Cornelius Gallus]], the poet, who came to Rome from [[Fr\u00e9jus|Forum Julii]] as a young man.  His surname signified his Gallic origin.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, pp. 226\u2013227 (\"C. Cornelius Gallus\").</ref><ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref>\n\n==Members==\n[[File:Stelecornelius1.jpg|thumb|Monument of Gaius Cornelius Calvus, and his brother, Lucius.]]\n{{filiation}}\n\n===Cornelii Maluginenses===\n* [[Servius Cornelius Maluginensis|Servius Cornelius P. f.

For more than seven hundred years, from the early decades of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] to the third century AD, the Cornelii produced more eminent statesmen and generals than any other [[gens]].  At least seventy-five [[Roman consul|consuls]] under the Republic were members of this family, beginning with [[Servius Cornelius Maluginensis]] in 485 BC.  Together with the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], [[Manlia (gens)|Manlii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]], the Cornelii were almost certainly numbered among the ''gentes maiores'', the most important and powerful families of Rome, who for centuries dominated the Republican [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]].  All of the major branches of the Cornelian gens were patrician, but there were also [[plebs|plebeian]] Cornelii, at least some of whom were descended from [[freedman|freedmen]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Cornelia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, p. 855 (\"Cornelia Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe origin of the Cornelii is lost to history, but the [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] ''Cornelius'' may be formed from the hypothetical [[cognomen]] ''Corneus'', meaning \"horny\", that is, having thick or callused skin.  The existence of such a cognomen in early times may be inferred from its diminutive, ''Corneolus''.  Such a derivation implies a [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] origin for the Cornelii, and there is no evidence to contradict this, but beyond this no traditions survive relating to the family's beginning.<ref>Chase, p. 124.</ref>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe Cornelii employed a wide variety of [[praenomen|praenomina]], although individual families tended to favor certain names and avoid others.  ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]], [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]], [[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]]'', and ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' were common to most branches, while other names were used by individual ''stirpes''; ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]'' primarily by the Cornelii Maluginenses and the Cethegi, ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]'' by the Cethegi, and ''[[Aulus (praenomen)|Aulus]]'' by the Cossi.  Other names occur infrequently; ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'' appears once amongst the Lentuli, who later revived the old surname ''Cossus'' as a praenomen, while the Cornelii Sullae made use of ''[[Faustus (praenomen)|Faustus]]''.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Cornelian gens included both patricians and plebeians, but all of its major families were patrician.  The surnames ''Arvina, Blasio, Cethegus, Cinna, Cossus, Dolabella, Lentulus, Maluginensis, Mammula, Merenda, Merula, Rufinus, Scapula, Scipio, Sisenna'', and ''Sulla'' belonged to patrician Cornelii, while the plebeian cognomina included ''Balbus'' and ''Gallus''.  Other surnames are known from freedmen, including ''Chrysogonus, Culleolus, Phagita'', and others.  A number of plebeian Cornelii had no cognomen.<ref name=\"DGRBM Cornelia Gens\"/>\n\nThe first of the Cornelii to appear in history bore the surname ''Maluginensis''.  This family seems to have divided into two ''stirpes'' in the 430s, the senior line retaining ''Maluginensis'', while the younger branches assumed ''Cossus''.  From their [[Roman naming conventions#Filiation|filiations]], the first of the Cornelii Cossi would seem to have been younger sons of [[Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis]], a member of the [[Decemviri#Second Decemvirate|Second Decemvirate]] in 450 BC.  Both families produced a number of consuls and [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribunes]] during the fourth and fifth centuries BC.  The Maluginenses disappeared before the period of the [[Samnite Wars]], although the Cornelii Scipiones appear to have been descended from this family, while the surname ''Cossus'' appears as late as the beginning of the third century; members of the latter family also bore the cognomina ''Rutilus'', \"reddish\", and ''Arvina''.  ''Cossus'' itself seems to belong to a class of surnames derived from objects or animals, referring to the larva of certain beetles that burrow under the bark of trees.  The Cornelii Lentuli subsequently revived ''Cossus'' as a surname.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 378 (\"Arvina\"), 865 (\"Cossus\"), vol. II, p. 909 (\"Maluginensis\").</ref><ref name=\"Chase 112\">Chase, pp. 112, 113.</ref>\n\nThe Cornelii Scipiones derived their surname from a legend in which the first of the family served as a staff (''scipio'') for his blind father.  Since the first of the Scipiones seems to have borne the cognomen ''Maluginensis'', he would seem to have been the son of Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, one of the consular tribunes in 404 BC.  The Scipiones produced numerous consuls and several prominent generals, of whom the most celebrated were [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] and [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]].  Members of this family held the highest offices of the Roman state from the beginning of the fourth century BC down to the second century of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], a span of nearly six hundred years.  Its members bore a large number of additional surnames, including ''Barbatus'', \"bearded\", ''Scapula'', \"shoulder blade\", ''Asina'', \"she-ass\", ''Calvus'', \"bald\", ''Hispallus'', \"little Spaniard\", ''Nasica'', \"nosed\", and ''Corculum'', \"little heart\", in addition to those derived from their military exploits: ''Africanus'' and ''Asiaticus''.  The last generations of this great family were originally adopted from the [[Salvidiena (gens)|Salvidieni]], and so bore the additional names of ''Salvidienus Orfitus''.  The Scipiones had a large [[Tomb of the Scipios|family sepulchre]] at Rome, which still exists, having been rediscovered in 1780.<ref>Macrobius, i. 6.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, pp. 739\u2013741 (\"Scipio\").</ref><ref name=\"Chase 109\">Chase, pp. 109, 110 (''Barbatus, Scapula, Nasica, Calvus''), 112, 113 (''Asina, Scipio''), 114 (''Africanus, Hispallus'').</ref>\n\nThe cognomen ''Lentulus'' probably belongs to a class of surnames deriving from the habits or qualities of the persons to whom they were first applied; the adjective ''lentulus'' means \"rather slow\".  An alternative explanation is that the name is a diminutive of ''lens'', a lentil, and so belongs to the same class of surnames as ''Cicero'', a chickpea, and ''Caepio'', an onion.<ref>Chase, pp. 110\u2013113.</ref><ref name=\"DGRBM Lentulus\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, pp. 728, 729 (\"Lentulus).</ref>  The Cornelii Lentuli were famed for their pride and haughtiness, so that [[Cicero]] uses ''Lentulitas'', \"Lentulusness\", to describe the most aristocratic of the patricians.<ref>Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Familiares'' iii. 7. \u00a7 5.</ref>  The Lentuli appear in history from the time of the Samnite Wars to the first century of the Empire, a period of about four hundred years.  Their origin is uncertain.  According to Livy, early in the Second Samnite War, [[Lucius Cornelius Lentulus (consul 327 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Lentulus]] described his father as the only man who, during the [[Battle of the Allia#Aftermath, the sack of Rome|Gallic sack of Rome]] in 390 BC, had opposed paying a ransom to ensure the departure of the [[Gauls]] from the city.<ref>Livy, ix. 4.</ref>  The filiations of other early Lentuli suggest that their ancestors used the name ''Gnaeus'', suggesting that they could have been descendants of the Cornelii Cossi.\n\nThe Lentuli used a number of additional surnames, including ''Caudinus,'' apparently referring to the [[Battle of the Caudine Forks]], ''crus'', a leg, or the shin, ''Gaetulicus'', bestowed upon the conqueror of the [[Gaetuli]], ''Lupus'', a wolf, ''Niger'', black, ''Spinther'', a bracelet, and ''Sura'', the calf.  The Lentuli also revived several old cognomina that had belonged to other ''stirpes'' of the Cornelii: ''Maluginensis'', ''Cossus'', ''Rufinus'', and ''Scipio''.  At least two of this family bore surnames derived from other ''gentes''; ''Clodianus'' was borne by a Lentulus who had been adopted from the [[Claudia (gens)|Clodii]], while ''Marcellinus'' belonged to a member of the family who was adopted from the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii Marcelli]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Lentulus\"/><ref>Cicero, ''Epistulae ad Atticum'' i. 19. \u00a7 2.</ref><ref>Pliny the Elder, xviii. 3.</ref>\n\nThe Cornelii Rufini appear in the latter half of the fourth century BC, beginning with [[Publius Cornelius Rufinus]], dictator in 334 BC.  From the surname ''Rufinus'', meaning \"reddish\", one may infer that the first of this family had red hair.<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  A descendant of this family was the first to assume the cognomen ''Sulla'', about the time of the [[Second Punic War]].  The name is probably a diminutive of ''Sura'', a cognomen found in several gentes, including among the Cornelii Lentuli, and probably referred to someone with prominent calves.<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  [[Plutarch]], who erroneously believed that the dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] was the first to bear the name, thought it must have referred to a blotchy, reddish complexion, while [[Macrobius]] derives it from ''Sibylla'', an etymology that is rejected by [[Quintilian]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Sulla\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, pp. 933\u2013944 (\"Sulla\").</ref><ref>Plutarch, \"The Life of Sulla\", 2.</ref><ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', i. 17.</ref><ref>Quintilian, i. 4. \u00a7 25.</ref>  The dictator Sulla adopted the agnomen ''Felix'', meaning \"fortunate\" or \"happy\", and this name was passed on to some of his descendants.<ref>Chase, p. 111.</ref>  The Sullae continued in the highest offices of the state well into imperial times.  The last appearing in history fell victim to [[Elagabalus]], early in the third century AD.<ref name=\"DGRBM Sulla\"/>\n\nThe Dolabellae first came to prominence at the beginning of the third century BC, and so remained until the reign of [[Vitellius]].  Several of the Dolabellae achieved high office, and one was ''[[Rex Sacrorum]]'', but many of this family were notorious for their pride, extravagance, and disregard for the law.  Their surname, ''Dolabella'', is a diminutive of ''dolabra'', a mattock or pickaxe, and belongs to a common class of surnames derived from everyday objects.<ref name=\"Chase 112\"/><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. dolabra''.</ref>\n\nSeveral lesser patrician ''stirpes'' flourished during the late Republic and early years of the Empire.  The Cornelii Merendae flourished for about a century, beginning in the early third century BC.  Their cognomen means the midday meal, and is also found among the patrician [[Antonia (gens)|Antonii]].  The Blasiones appeared at the same time and flourished for about 160 years; their surname was originally given to one who stammers.<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  ''Cethegus'' is a cognomen whose original meaning and significance have been lost.  The Cornelii Cethegi first appear in the latter half of the third century BC, and were described by [[Horace|Quintus Horatius Flaccus]] as ''cinctuti Cethegi'', for their old-fashioned practice of wearing their arms bare.  They remained prominent for the next two centuries.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol.

Their surname is a diminutive of ''mamma'', a breast.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 913 (\"Mammula\").</ref><ref name=\"Chase 109\"/>  ''Merula'' refers to an ouzel, or [[common blackbird|blackbird]].  The family that bore this surname rose from obscurity at the beginning of the second century BC, and continued for the next century.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol.

I, pp. 754, 755 (\"Cornelius Cinna\").</ref>\n\n''Balbus'', which like ''Blasio'' signifies a stammerer,<ref name=\"Chase 109\"/> was not originally a surname of the Cornelia gens, but was adopted by a native of [[Cadiz|Gades]], who was granted [[Roman citizenship]] by [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]], as a reward for military service during the [[Sertorian War|War against Sertorius]].  He probably took the nomen ''Cornelius'' after [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus|Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus]], who ratified the act making Balbus a citizen in 72 BC.  He eventually attained the consulship, but the family, which was plebeian, disappeared from history in the early years of the Empire.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 455\u2013457 (\"Balbus\", V, \"Cornelii Balbi\").</ref>  Another plebeian surname of the Cornelii was ''Gallus'', known from [[Cornelius Gallus|Gaius Cornelius Gallus]], the poet, who came to Rome from [[Fr\u00e9jus|Forum Julii]] as a young man.  His surname signified his Gallic origin.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, pp. 226\u2013227 (\"C.

The Foreign Legion was deeply rooted in the [[French conquest of Algeria]] and France's colonial expansion. The Legion is distinctive in that all its recruits are volunteers, while other national foreign regiments are conscripts or prisoners of war (although this was not the case for the 1831 Legion).\n\n== Foreign nationals in service of France==\n=== Ancien R\u00e9gime ===\nThe [[List of French monarchs|French monarchy]] had hired foreign soldiers since before the [[Bourbon Restoration]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crowdy|first=Terry|title=French Revolutionary Infantry 1789-1802|publisher=|year=|isbn=1-84176-660-7|location=|pages=13 and 16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1346, [[Philip VI of France]] deployed 15,000 Genovese at the [[Battle of Crecy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The 13th century and 14th century also saw the appearance of [[free company|grand companies of Scots]], Castillans, Savoyards, Swiss, and Dutch soldiers of given chiefs or princes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], the French Army consisted of 20%-30% non-French soldiers.

Afterwards, the National Legislative Assembly, in the decree of July 26, 1792, stated that \"If the Allied Kings deploy numerous Armies against the free peoples, it is important for them to admit into their ranks all the men whom a sublime impulse calls to fight for the sacred cause of Liberty.\" Accordingly, the ''L\u00e9gion Franche Etrang\u00e8re'' was created on August 1. A [[Germanic Legion]], an {{ill|Italian Legion|fr|L\u00e9gion Italique}}, a [[Batavian Legion]], and a [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legion]] were formed.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=12}} During this period of 146,000 available soldiers, 42,000 were not French.{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}}\n\n=== Empire ===\nThe conquests of the [[First French Empire]] led to great demand for foreign troops, with the proportion of non-French national soldiers reaching record proportions.

The Legion became a depository for those who did not conform to the governing agenda. There was also concern over those seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had journeyed in the hopes of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} To the State, they threatened the stability of the kingdom and its economy it became urgent to the group and distance them.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the men in the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}} and the war, deemed very unpopular. Louis Philipe I was a pacifist and did not want to weigh the national and military opinion on a costly conquest which would endanger French lives and thus sought to use foreign troops. However, since the Kingdom was reduced, it was not feasible to recruit contingents in occupied lands such as during Napoleon's era. Accordingly, a new sort of troop was required.\n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831. The ordinance had nine articles.\n{{verse translation|lang=fr|Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 tous pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir salut ;\n\nVu la loi du 9 mars 1831 :\n\nSur le rapport de notre Ministre Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat au D\u00e9partement de la Guerre : Nous avons ordonn\u00e9 et ordonnons ce qui suit :\n\nArt. 1 - Il sera form\u00e9 une L\u00e9gion compos\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9trangers.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends of France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essence base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favor this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839 and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand maneuvers. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843, and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now

Green bonds are becoming an increasingly prevalent form of green finance, particularly for clean and sustainable infrastructure development and their large funding needs. They offer a vehicle to both access finance from the capital markets and deliver green impacts that can be verified against standards. In developing countries, green bonds are already financing critical projects, including renewable energy, \nurban mass transit systems and water distribution.<ref name=\"GUIDE: New markets for green bonds\">[https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-new-markets-green-bonds-2/?loclang=en_gb GUIDE: New markets for green bonds], the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, accessdate 25 July 2017</ref>\n\nGreen bonds mobilised over $93 billion in 2016 to projects and assets with positive environmental impacts.

Today, green bonds mainly finance projects within renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon transport, sustainable water, and waste and pollution.\n*It is a viable vehicle for enabling the increasing pool of sustainable investors to access environmental projects. Bonds are an instrument and an approach with which foreign investors are familiar, so these institutions need little new understanding or capacity. Investors are also interested in placing money where the environmental impact achieved is highest per unit of currency, and emerging and developing economies have the potential to offer this where lower project costs exist. \n*It can be a catalyst for further development of the domestic capital market and financial system more broadly beyond environmentally related projects.<ref name=\"GUIDE: New markets for green bonds\"/>\n\n==Demand for green bonds==\nThe Business and Sustainable Development Commission describes at least US$12 trillion in market opportunities for business from sustainable business models.<ref>[http://report.businesscommission.org/uploads/BetterBiz-BetterWorld.pdf Better business, better world: The report of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission], accessdate 25 July 2017</ref>\n\nThe United Nations estimates an annual funding gap of $2.5 trillion is needed for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),<ref>[http://www.innpact.com/_dbfiles/lacentrale_files/200/290/ada-sustainable-development-bonds-a4-final.pdf Sustainable development bonds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223030843/http://www.innpact.com/_dbfiles/lacentrale_files/200/290/ada-sustainable-development-bonds-a4-final.pdf# |date=2017-02-23 }} EIIL, 2016</ref> and within this, US$1 trillion is needed annually for clean energy alone. A large number and broad range of projects and assets that contribute to achieving the 17 SDGs need this funding for their development and operation.\n\nOne of the SDGs where \u2018green finance\u2019 has been successfully mobilised is on clean energy and climate action. The Paris Agreement on climate change entered into force in November 2016, after 196 countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Significant quantities of finance are now needed to convert country commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs) to implementation and a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.\n\nDespite recent increases in volumes of climate finance, a significant funding gap will arise unless new sources and channels of finance are mobilised.<ref>[http://www.unep.org/adaptationgapreport/sites/unep.org.adaptationgapreport/files/documents/agr2016.pdf Finance gap: the adaptation report], United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), accessdate 25 July 2017</ref>\n\nExisting international public finance dedicated to climate change is unable to achieve the rapid change required in meeting the finance gap alone. Furthermore, public sector balance sheets do not have the capacity to fund the amounts needed, and so an estimated 80\u201390% of funding will need to come from the private sector.<ref>[https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/analysis/cop-blog-the-role-of-the-green-climate-fund-in-providing-the-missing-clean-trillion.html The role of the Green Climate Fund in providing the missing \u201cclean trillion\u201d], COP Blog, Environmental Finance, accessdate 25 July 2017</ref>\n\nBank balance sheets can take only a proportion of the private finance needed so the capital markets have to be leveraged, along with other sources such as insurance and peer-to-peer.\n\nAccording to [https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-new-markets-green-bonds-2/?loclang=en_gb GUIDE: New markets for green bonds], the demand for green bonds has grown quickly on the investor side, with asset owners and managers diversifying their investment portfolios and seeking positive impact beyond financial return. In the light of the global commitment to shift to a green and low-carbon economy, the green bond market has the potential to grow substantially, while attracting more diverse issuers and investors.\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\nThe green bond market has attracted international criticism with some questioning the green credentials of certain bonds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matsuzaki |first1=Yusuke |title=Environmental bonds stained by 'green washing' |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Capital-Markets/Environmental-bonds-stained-by-green-washing |website=Nikkei Asian Review |accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref> This criticism pertains both to the projects that are funded, as well as the sustainability credentials of the issuers. In May 2017, the Climate Bonds Initiative refused to list a \u201cgreen\u201d bond issued by Repsol.

Today, green bonds mainly finance projects within renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon transport, sustainable water, and waste and pollution.\n*It is a viable vehicle for enabling the increasing pool of sustainable investors to access environmental projects. Bonds are an instrument and an approach with which foreign investors are familiar, so these institutions need little new understanding or capacity. Investors are also interested in placing money where the environmental impact achieved is highest per unit of currency, and emerging and developing economies have the potential to offer this where lower project costs exist. \n*It can be a catalyst for further development of the domestic capital market and financial system more broadly beyond environmentally related projects.<ref name=\"GUIDE: New markets for green bonds\"/>\n\n==Demand for green bonds==\nThe Business and Sustainable Development Commission describes at least US$12 trillion in market opportunities for business from sustainable business models.<ref>[http://report.businesscommission.org/uploads/BetterBiz-BetterWorld.pdf Better business, better world: The report of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission], accessdate 25 July 2017</ref>\n\nThe United Nations estimates an annual funding gap of $2.5 trillion is needed for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),<ref>[http://www.innpact.com/_dbfiles/lacentrale_files/200/290/ada-sustainable-development-bonds-a4-final.pdf Sustainable development bonds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223030843/http://www.innpact.com/_dbfiles/lacentrale_files/200/290/ada-sustainable-development-bonds-a4-final.pdf# |date=2017-02-23 }} EIIL, 2016</ref> and within this, US$1 trillion is needed annually for clean energy alone. A large number and broad range of projects and assets that contribute to achieving the 17 SDGs need this funding for their development and operation.\n\nOne of the SDGs where \u2018green finance\u2019 has been successfully mobilised is on clean energy and climate action. The Paris Agreement on climate change entered into force in November 2016, after 196 countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Significant quantities of finance are now needed to convert country commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs) to implementation and a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.\n\nDespite recent increases in volumes of climate finance, a significant funding gap will arise unless new sources and channels of finance are mobilised.<ref>[http://www.unep.org/adaptationgapreport/sites/unep.org.adaptationgapreport/files/documents/agr2016.pdf Finance gap: the adaptation report], United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), accessdate 25 July 2017</ref>\n\nExisting international public finance dedicated to climate change is unable to achieve the rapid change required in meeting the finance gap alone. Furthermore, public sector balance sheets do not have the capacity to fund the amounts needed, and so an estimated 80\u201390% of funding will need to come from the private sector.<ref>[https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/analysis/cop-blog-the-role-of-the-green-climate-fund-in-providing-the-missing-clean-trillion.html The role of the Green Climate Fund in providing the missing \u201cclean trillion\u201d], COP Blog, Environmental Finance, accessdate 25 July 2017</ref>\n\nBank balance sheets can take only a proportion of the private finance needed so the capital markets have to be leveraged, along with other sources such as insurance and peer-to-peer.\n\nAccording to [https://cdkn.org/resource/guide-new-markets-green-bonds-2/?loclang=en_gb GUIDE: New markets for green bonds], the demand for green bonds has grown quickly on the investor side, with asset owners and managers diversifying their investment portfolios and seeking positive impact beyond financial return. In the light of the global commitment to shift to a green and low-carbon economy, the green bond market has the potential to grow substantially, while attracting more diverse issuers and investors.\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\nThe green bond market has attracted international criticism with some questioning the green credentials of certain bonds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matsuzaki |first1=Yusuke |title=Environmental bonds stained by 'green washing' |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Capital-Markets/Environmental-bonds-stained-by-green-washing |website=Nikkei Asian Review |accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref> This criticism pertains both to the projects that are funded, as well as the sustainability credentials of the issuers. In May 2017, the Climate Bonds Initiative refused to list a \u201cgreen\u201d bond issued by Repsol.

While employed there, Hackenschmied made numerous advertising and documentary films, one of the most famous was directed by [[Elmar Klos]] in 1937, entitled ''The Highway Sings'', showing auto tires in motion.\n\nDuring the late 1930s he collaborated with the American filmmaker Herbert Kline on the feature-length [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Crisis (1939 film)|Crisis]]'' (1939) and moved to the USA where he met and married Eleanora Deren, he later on named her \"Maya\". ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943) was a home movie made by the filmmaker Hammid and his wife Maya who until that point had no experience in filmmaking. He also directed the documentaries ''[[The Forgotten Village]]'' (1941), ''The Valley of the Tennessee'' (1944), and ''A Better Tomorrow'' (1945). Hammid also made the 22-minute short ''The Private Life of a Cat'' (1947). This short film was part narrative, part documentary about cats and their daily lives. The film starts off with two cats, a male and a female. The female is eventually impregnated by the male cat, and begins to search for shelter for when she gives birth to her kittens. The film shows her giving birth to five kittens in graphic detail. \n \nIn 1944, he directed a documentary featuring conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]], ''[[Hymn of the Nations]]'', produced by the [[Office of War Information]]. His documentary ''[[Library of Congress (film)|Library of Congress]]'' (1945) was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Short Documentary.  Through the 1950s and 1960s Hammid made documentaries.  In 1951, Hackenschmied and [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] co-directed the film version of Menotti's opera ''[[The Medium]]''.\n\nHammid directed his final film, ''[[To Be Alive!]]'' (1964), for screening at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. The film won an [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary Short in 1965.\n\nHammid worked in partnership with filmmaker [[Francis Thompson (film director)|Francis Thompson]] (1908\u20132003) for over 25 years, producing numerous \u201cin-house\u201d documentaries as well as several films for general viewership.

(which won an Oscar after being shown at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] in 1964), ''We Are Young'' (on six screens for the [[Expo 67|Montreal World's Fair/Expo 67]] in 1967) and ''US'' (for [[San Antonio]]'s Hemisfair in 1969).\n\n==Legacy==\nAustrian film director, Martina Kudl\u00e1\u010dek directed, documentary, ''Aimless Walk: Alexander Hammid'' (1996) based on his life and work.<ref>{{IMDb title|0157299|Aimless Walk: Alexander Hammid}}</ref> In 2006, [[MoMA]] organized a tribute film exhibition titled, \"Alexander Hammid: A Memorial Salute\" based on its film archives.<ref name=moma>{{cite web | title = Alexander Hammid: A Memorial Salute |work= MoMA| url = http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/films/931 |date=February 24\u201326, 2006| accessdate = 2014-08-24 }}</ref>\n\nThe Academy Film Archive has preserved \"Arturo Toscanini: Conducting Music of Giuseppe Verdi\" and \"Library of Congress\" by Alexandr Hackenschmied.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=&filmmaker=hackenschmied&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Director===\n* ''[[Aimless Walk]]'' (1930)\n* ''The Prague Castle'' (1932)\n* ''[[Crisis (1939 film)|Crisis]]'' (1939)\n* ''[[The Forgotten Village]]'' (1941)\n* ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943)\n* ''Valley of the Tennessee'' (1944)\n* ''[[The Private Life of a Cat]]'' (1944)\n* ''[[Hymn of the Nations]]'' (1944)\n* ''[[Library of Congress (film)|Library of Congress]]'' (1945)\n* ''A Better Tomorrow'' (1945) \n* ''Marriage Today'' (1950)\n* ''Angry Boy'' (1950)\n* ''Of Men and Music'' (1951)\n* ''Power Among Men'' (1959) \n* ''[[To Be Alive!]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[To Fly!]]'' (1976)\n\n===Editor===\n* ''Loupe\u017en\u00edk'' (1931)\n* ''Zem spiev\u00e1'' (1933, The Earth Sings)\n* ''A \u017eivot jde d\u00e1l'' (1935)\n* ''Crisis'' (1939)\n* ''The Photographer'' (1948) \n* ''[[The Medium]]'' (1951)\n* ''Miracle in Java'' (1956)\n* ''[[Out (1957 film)|Out]]'' (1957)\n* ''[[To Be Alive!]]'' (1964)\n\n==See also==\n*'''Book''': Michael Omasta (ed.): ''Tribute to Sasha'' (Vienna: SYNEMA, 2002) (German/English)\n*'''Documentary Film''': ''Aimless Walk: Alexander Hammid'' (1996, 48 minutes) directed by Martina Kudlacek\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web | title = Alexander Hammid Biography and films| url = http://hammid.wz.cz/content/index_en.html }}\n*[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/56570 Czech avant-garde pioneer Alexandr Hackenschmied (Hammid) dies at 96] Radio Prague article.\n*{{IMDb name|id=0352413|name=Alexander Hammid}}\n*[https://archive.org/details/PrivateL1947 ''Private Life of a Cat'' (1947) at the Internet Archive]\n*[http://www.macfreefilms.com/behind/DisplayPress.asp?NewsID=16 ''To Fly'' details at MacGillivray Freeman Films]\n*[http://www.batahistory.com/ Bata company history]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hackenschmied, Alexandr}}\n[[Category:1907 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:Czech photographers]]\n[[Category:American experimental filmmakers]]\n[[Category:American documentary filmmakers]]\n[[Category:Czech emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:People from Linz]]\n[[Category:American film editors]]\n[[Category:American cinematographers]]\n[[Category:Documentary film editors]]\n[[Category:Directors of Best Documentary Short Subject Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Czech film directors]]\n[[Category:Czech experimental filmmakers]]\n", "name_user": "Quiksteppe", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegacy:Changed quotes to italics for movie title.

His career began as a scratch DJ in 1994, rapidly growing a cult fan base due to his virtuosic skills. Ever innovating, he quickly evolved into combining turntables with analog machines and visual storytelling devices to create his signature style. Kid Koala jumps effortlessly between genres as eclectic as hip hop, ambient, alternative, contemporary classical, blues, classic rock and traditional jazz. He has released 5 solo albums on Ninja Tune, and 3 albums on Arts & Crafts Records, the most recent being ''Music To Draw To: IO'' featuring Trixie Whitley. He has also released two award-winning graphic novels: ''Nufonia Must Fall'' and ''Space Cadet''. He has collaborated with artists such as Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, The Slew, Lovage, and The Afiara String Quartet.\n\nKid Koala has toured with the likes of [[Radiohead]], [[the Beastie Boys]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Money Mark]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Mike Patton]], [[DJ Shadow]], and [[The Preservation Hall Jazz Band]]. He has contributed to scores for the films The Great Gatsby, Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Men Women and Children, Shaun of the Dead and Looper amongst others. He has composed music for The National Film Board of Canada, the Cartoon Network, Sesame Street and Adult Swim. He has also been commissioned to create music for runway shows for Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten. \n\nKid Koala\u2019s unforgettable live shows range from touring turntable carnivals like Vinyl Vaudeville, to immersive multimedia shows like Nufonia Must Fall, The Storyville Mosquito, Satellite Turntable Orchestra and his Space Cadet Headphone Concert; each of which express his unique form of storytelling with music, animation, film and interactive entertainment.\n\nKid Koala has toured 6 continents and lives with his wife and two daughters in Montreal, Canada.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan attended [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (Vancouver)|Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but graduated from [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School]], in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]], U.S., and went on to study elementary education at [[McGill University]], in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>Bryant, Luke. \"The new faces of music: Kid Koala's got all the technical moves but more important, he's making new music\" The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia), March 20, 2004, Pg. D3</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSan began by distributing copies of his demo tape ''Scratchcratchratchatch'' to students living in residence at McGill. He is well known for his enigmatic style of [[turntablism]], which uses an unusual collection of samples. He has used samples of music from [[Charlie Brown]] television specials, old comedy sketch routines (including those that mock turntablism), people [[sneezing]], and people reading a menu in [[Cantonese]]. \n\nIn 2000, San released his album, ''Carpal Tunnel Syndrome''. He designed and illustrated the cover for this and his later albums. A comic book he drew is included as the liner notes. Following the release of the album, Kid Koala embarked on an extensive tour, during which he opened for a number of musicians, including [[Radiohead]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=8 |title=Ninja / Ninja Tune |website=Ninjatune.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031006041300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1317575|title=BBC - collective - kid koala interview - A1317575|date=6 October 2003|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> The [[cabaret]]-style tour throughout North America, Europe and Australia, known as ''[[The Short Attention Span Theatre]]'', featured an unpredictable opening act\u2014three Djs (Kid Koala, [[P-Love]], and [[DJ Jester the Filipino Fist]]) on eight turntables set up like a band, and a bingo game at intermission among other quirky surprises. Following this tour Kid Koala has performed DJ sets in Asia, as well as in Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South America whilst working on a new book and a puppet show.\n\nSan released a full length graphic novel, ''[[Nufonia Must Fall]]'', which includes a soundtrack CD he composed. ''Some of my Best Friends are DJs'' includes a [[chess]] set as part of the packaging. In June 2014, the ''[[Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live]]'' made its world premiere at Toronto's Luminato Festival.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412125243/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/nufonia|title=Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live - Luminato Festival 2014|date=12 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> Directed by K.K.

The two joined together to create a series of \"imaginary journeys with real food and music\", inspired by their respective passion for trains.

His career began as a scratch DJ in 1994, rapidly growing a cult fan base due to his virtuosic skills. Ever innovating, he quickly evolved into combining turntables with analog machines and visual storytelling devices to create his signature style. Kid Koala jumps effortlessly between genres as eclectic as hip hop, ambient, alternative, contemporary classical, blues, classic rock and traditional jazz. He has released 5 solo albums on Ninja Tune, and 3 albums on Arts & Crafts Records, the most recent being ''Music To Draw To: IO'' featuring Trixie Whitley. He has also released two award-winning graphic novels: ''Nufonia Must Fall'' and ''Space Cadet''. He has collaborated with artists such as Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, The Slew, Lovage, and The Afiara String Quartet.\n\nKid Koala has toured with the likes of [[Radiohead]], [[the Beastie Boys]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Money Mark]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Mike Patton]], [[DJ Shadow]], and [[The Preservation Hall Jazz Band]]. He has contributed to scores for the films The Great Gatsby, Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Men Women and Children, Shaun of the Dead and Looper amongst others. He has composed music for The National Film Board of Canada, the Cartoon Network, Sesame Street and Adult Swim. He has also been commissioned to create music for runway shows for Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten. \n\nKid Koala\u2019s unforgettable live shows range from touring turntable carnivals like Vinyl Vaudeville, to immersive multimedia shows like Nufonia Must Fall, The Storyville Mosquito, Satellite Turntable Orchestra and his Space Cadet Headphone Concert; each of which express his unique form of storytelling with music, animation, film and interactive entertainment.\n\nKid Koala has toured 6 continents and lives with his wife and two daughters in Montreal, Canada.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan attended [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (Vancouver)|Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but graduated from [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School]], in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]], U.S., and went on to study elementary education at [[McGill University]], in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>Bryant, Luke. \"The new faces of music: Kid Koala's got all the technical moves but more important, he's making new music\" The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia), March 20, 2004, Pg. D3</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSan began by distributing copies of his demo tape ''Scratchcratchratchatch'' to students living in residence at McGill. He is well known for his enigmatic style of [[turntablism]], which uses an unusual collection of samples. He has used samples of music from [[Charlie Brown]] television specials, old comedy sketch routines (including those that mock turntablism), people [[sneezing]], and people reading a menu in [[Cantonese]]. \n\nIn 2000, San released his album, ''Carpal Tunnel Syndrome''. He designed and illustrated the cover for this and his later albums. A comic book he drew is included as the liner notes. Following the release of the album, Kid Koala embarked on an extensive tour, during which he opened for a number of musicians, including [[Radiohead]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=8 |title=Ninja / Ninja Tune |website=Ninjatune.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031006041300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1317575|title=BBC - collective - kid koala interview - A1317575|date=6 October 2003|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> The [[cabaret]]-style tour throughout North America, Europe and Australia, known as ''[[The Short Attention Span Theatre]]'', featured an unpredictable opening act\u2014three Djs (Kid Koala, [[P-Love]], and [[DJ Jester the Filipino Fist]]) on eight turntables set up like a band, and a bingo game at intermission among other quirky surprises. Following this tour Kid Koala has performed DJ sets in Asia, as well as in Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South America whilst working on a new book and a puppet show.\n\nSan released a full length graphic novel, ''[[Nufonia Must Fall]]'', which includes a soundtrack CD he composed. ''Some of my Best Friends are DJs'' includes a [[chess]] set as part of the packaging. In June 2014, the ''[[Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live]]'' made its world premiere at Toronto's Luminato Festival.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412125243/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/nufonia|title=Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live - Luminato Festival 2014|date=12 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> Directed by K.K.

San and the Afiara Quartet provide live scoring on piano, strings and turntables.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\"/> San also has another project debuting at Luminato Festival entitled ''[[The Lost Train]]'', a collaboration between San and Joe Beef's Chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morin. The two joined together to create a series of \"imaginary journeys with real food and music\", inspired by their respective passion for trains.
