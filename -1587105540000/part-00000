In 2015, she began recording the album with bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]], drummer Amy Aileen Wood and guitarist [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThey began recording in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting  as they marched around the house. They spent three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. Upon returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording, making the announcement in sign language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=NME|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.

It is also the entrance to [[Oxford Circus tube station]].\n\nThe junction opened in 1819 as part of the Regent Street development under [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], and was originally known as '''Regent Circus North'''. After the original lease expired, it was redesigned around a series of four quadrant buildings by [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] between 1913 and 1928, the north-eastern of which has been used by [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]], [[Topshop]], the [[BBC]] and the [[London Co-operative Society]]; these are now [[listed building|Grade II listed buildings]]. Oxford Circus remains a busy junction for traffic, and a \u00a35&nbsp;million upgrade for pedestrians opened in 2009. It has also attracted attention as a place for demonstrations and protests, including by  [[Extinction Rebellion]].\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Oxford Circus (22891646886).jpg|thumb|Oxford Circus in 1904, showing [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s original design]]\nThe junction was designed as part of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s work on [[Regent Street]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}} Circuses had become popular in English architecture after [[George Dance the Younger]] had popularised them in the [[Minories]] in East London. Nash wanted to use extra land space so that vehicles could move around one another when turning, with a concave layout attracting shopkeepers and increasing the potential for land value. He originally intended the circus to be [[colonnade]]d, but when the New Street Bill was proposed to parliament, it was rejected, with one MP fearing the circus would \"be a nuisance by day and something worse by night\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=1}} He redesigned the circus so that the new Regent Street would meet the established Oxford Street at a near right-angle, with a smaller {{convert|164|ft|adj=on}} diameter reducing its land intake.  Parliament approved the design in 1813.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nConstruction of the circus began in 1816, with Nash working in association with Samuel Baxter. Work was complicated by the [[compulsory purchase]] of properties along Oxford Street. Eight houses on the north side and eleven on the south were demolished to make way for the junction.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20134}} To avoid legal challenges, Nash attempted to rehouse existing tenants in the new buildings around the circus wherever possible. After John Richardson, proprietor of Richardson's silk shop on 118 Oxford Street died, Nash ensured his widow and surviving family and employees were all housed in a building on the circus's north-eastern section. After the family complained and demanded changes, Nash worked with Baxter to try to accommodate them as much as possible.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nMost buildings around the circus were designed in a more disciplined manner than some of Nash's later work, and were based on [[Palladian architecture]]. They featured [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster]]s and artificial stone capitals. The pilaster order continued down Regent Street.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=7}}\n\nThe circus opened officially in November 1819.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=3}} It was originally known as Regent Circus North, with the corresponding [[Piccadilly Circus]] named Regent Circus South.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus and the Regent Street Quadrant|work=Survey of London|volume=31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1963|pp=85\u2013100|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols31-2/pt2/pp85-100|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> However, unlike Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus had no decorations and was designed as a straightforward traffic crossing.{{sfn|Glinert|2008|p=88}} Fellow architect [[James Elmes]] described Nash's work on the circus as giving \"an air of grandeur\" and \"as elegant in form as it is useful in application\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} The current name began to be used around 1836.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nIn 1842, the MP [[Joseph Hume]] proposed a commemorative [[obelisk]] should be constructed in the middle of the circus.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} Construction began in December 1842, but was quickly disrupted and abandoned after the Marylebone parish [[vestry]] realised they only had authority to clean and maintain the circus, and not to construct anything on top of it. The obelisk was eventually built in 1850 at [[Nunhead Cemetery]] to a slightly different design.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=10}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:London Oxford Circus, 1949 geograph-3044387-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Oxford Circus in 1949]]\nThe lease on the four quadrants around the interchange was due to expire in 1917, and it was determined they would need to be rebuilt. In 1904, the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]] outlined a plan to redevelop Regent Street, including Oxford Circus. In 1909, they invited proposals to redevelop the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=11}} The new design was awarded in October 1910 to [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]], who saw off several rival designs, and was built in stages between 1913 and 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=14}} Tanner's design was inspired by 18th-century French architecture, particularly that of [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=15}} Each quadrant was designed to be symmetrical with the others.<ref name=NHLE/>\n\nThe south-eastern quadrant was completed first in 1913, before work stopped at the beginning of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=16}} The north-western quadrant opened in May 1922 as the London premises for the [[Magasins du Louvre]]. The store was never popular and closed in 1930.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=17}} The south-western quadrant followed in 1925 and the north-eastern in 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=17}}\n\nThe new north-eastern quadrant was originally occupied by the [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]] department store.

The [[BBC]] requisitioned part of the block and it saw significant use in overseas broadcasting during the war. It was sold to the [[London Co-operative Society]] in 1944.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=18}} Through a series of buyouts and mergers, Peter Robinson became [[Topshop]], which now occupies the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=17}} It is the flagship store of the franchise, covering four floors and attracting around 28,000 shoppers a day, half of whom buy something.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/business/worldbusiness/21topshop.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1415214562-edQGoGWtOdP4K7Vcqbj+RA|title=But Will It Play in Manhattan?|newspaper=New York Times|date=21 June 2006|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe buildings are constructed of [[Portland stone]] with a cladding steel frame and slate roofs.

It is also the entrance to [[Oxford Circus tube station]].\n\nThe junction opened in 1819 as part of the Regent Street development under [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], and was originally known as '''Regent Circus North'''. After the original lease expired, it was redesigned around a series of four quadrant buildings by [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] between 1913 and 1928, the north-eastern of which has been used by [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]], [[Topshop]], the [[BBC]] and the [[London Co-operative Society]]; these are now [[listed building|Grade II listed buildings]]. Oxford Circus remains a busy junction for traffic, and a \u00a35&nbsp;million upgrade for pedestrians opened in 2009. It has also attracted attention as a place for demonstrations and protests, including by  [[Extinction Rebellion]].\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Oxford Circus (22891646886).jpg|thumb|Oxford Circus in 1904, showing [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s original design]]\nThe junction was designed as part of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s work on [[Regent Street]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}} Circuses had become popular in English architecture after [[George Dance the Younger]] had popularised them in the [[Minories]] in East London. Nash wanted to use extra land space so that vehicles could move around one another when turning, with a concave layout attracting shopkeepers and increasing the potential for land value. He originally intended the circus to be [[colonnade]]d, but when the New Street Bill was proposed to parliament, it was rejected, with one MP fearing the circus would \"be a nuisance by day and something worse by night\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=1}} He redesigned the circus so that the new Regent Street would meet the established Oxford Street at a near right-angle, with a smaller {{convert|164|ft|adj=on}} diameter reducing its land intake.  Parliament approved the design in 1813.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nConstruction of the circus began in 1816, with Nash working in association with Samuel Baxter. Work was complicated by the [[compulsory purchase]] of properties along Oxford Street. Eight houses on the north side and eleven on the south were demolished to make way for the junction.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20134}} To avoid legal challenges, Nash attempted to rehouse existing tenants in the new buildings around the circus wherever possible. After John Richardson, proprietor of Richardson's silk shop on 118 Oxford Street died, Nash ensured his widow and surviving family and employees were all housed in a building on the circus' northeast section. After the family complained and demanded changes, Nash worked with Baxter to try to accommodate them as much as possible.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nMost buildings around the circus were designed in a more disciplined manner than some of Nash's later work, and were based on [[Palladian architecture]]. They featured fluted [[Corinthian order]] pilasters and artificial stone capitals. The pilaster order continued down Regent Street.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=7}}\n\nThe circus opened officially in November 1819.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=3}} It was originally known as Regent Circus North, with the corresponding [[Piccadilly Circus]] named Regent Circus South.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus and the Regent Street Quadrant|work=Survey of London|volume=31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1963|pp=85\u2013100|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols31-2/pt2/pp85-100|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> However, unlike Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus had no decorations and was designed as a straightforward traffic crossing.{{sfn|Glinert|2008|p=88}} Fellow architect [[James Elmes]] described Nash's work on the circus as giving \"an air of grandeur\" and \"as elegant in form as it is useful in application\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} The current name began to be used around 1836.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nIn 1842, the MP [[Joseph Hume]] proposed a commemorative [[obelisk]] should be constructed in the middle of the circus.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} Construction began in December 1842, but was quickly disrupted and abandoned after the Marylebone parish [[vestry]] realised they only had authority to clean and maintain the circus, and not to construct anything on top of it.

In 1904, the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]] outlined a plan to redevelop Regent Street, including Oxford Circus. In 1909, they invited proposals to redevelop the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=11}} The new design was awarded to [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] in October 1910, who saw off several rival designs, and built in stages between 1913 and 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=14}} Tanner's design was inspired by 18th-century French architecture, particularly that of [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=15}} Each quadrant was designed to be symmetrical with the others.<ref name=NHLE/>\n\nThe southeastern quadrant was completed first in 1913, before work stopped at the start of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=16}} The northwest quadrant opened in May 1922 as the London premises for the [[Magasins du Louvre]].

It is worn by men in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] communities at all times.

He held that nowadays, wearing a kippah is required by [[Halakha|halacha]].<ref name=\"Wearing a Kippa\"/>\n\nOther halachic authorities like Sephardi posek, the [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai|Chida]] (Rabbi Chaim David Yosef Azulai), hold that wearing a head covering is a ''midat hasidut'', an additional measure of piety.<ref name=\"Wearing a Kippa\"/> In a recent responsum, former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel [[Ovadia Yosef]] ruled that it should be worn to show affiliation with the religiously observant community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yosef|first=Chief Rabbi Ovadia|title=Responsa Yechavei Da'ath}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Talmud]] states, \"Cover your head in order that the fear of heaven may be upon you.\"<ref>[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 156b.</ref> Rabbi Hunah ben Joshua never walked 4 [[cubits]] (6.6 feet, or 2 meters) with his head uncovered. He explained: \"Because the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] is always over my head.\"<ref>[[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 31a.</ref> This was understood by Rabbi Yosef Karo in the [[Shulchan Arukh]] as indicating that Jewish men should cover their heads, and should not walk more than four cubits bareheaded.<ref>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 2:6.</ref> Covering one's head, such as by wearing a kippah, is described as \"honoring God\".<ref>''Shaar HaTzion'', OC 2:6.</ref> The ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'' modifies this ruling, adding that the ''[[Achronim]]'' established a requirement to wear a head covering even when traversing fewer than four cubits,<ref>Be'er Heitev, Orach Chaim 2:6, note 4, who quotes the ''[[Yoel Sirkis|Bach]]'', ''[[David HaLevi Segal|Taz]]'', and the ''[[Magen Avraham]]''.</ref> and even when one is standing still, indoors and outside.<ref>Mishnah Berurah 2:6, note 9, 10</ref> ''[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' cites a story from the Talmud (Shabbat 156b) about [[Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak]], who might have become a thief had his mother not saved him from this fate by insisting that he cover his head, which instilled in him the fear of God.<ref name=autogenerated1>KSA 3:6</ref> In Orthodox communities, boys are encouraged to wear a ''kippah'' from a young age in order to ingrain the habit.<ref>Be'er Heitev, OC 2:6, note 5</ref>\n[[File:IDF soldier kippah put on tefillin-small.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldier prays with kippah and [[tefillin]].]]\nThe Talmud also implies that unmarried men did not wear a kippah:\n:Rabbi Hisda praised Rabbi Hamnuna before Rabbi Huna as a great man. He said to him, 'When he visits you, bring him to me.' When he arrived, he saw that he wore no head-covering. 'Why do you not have head-covering?', he asked. 'Because I am not married', was the reply. Thereupon, he [Rabbi Huna] turned his face away from him, and said, 'See to it that you do not appear before me again before you are married.'<ref>Tractate Kiddushin 29b</ref>\n\nThe Tanakh implies that covering one's head is a sign of mourning:\n{{quote|And [[David]] went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went, and his head was covered and he walked barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his head and went up weeping as they went.|{{tanakhverse|2 Samuel|15:30}}}}\n{{quote|[Judah mourns,] and their nobles send their lads for water: they come to the pits, and find no water; their vessels return empty; they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads. Because of the ground which is cracked, for there hath been no rain in the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads.|{{tanakhverse|Jeremiah|14:3\u20134}}}}The argument for the kippa has two sides. The [[Vilna Gaon]] said one can make a ''[[berakhah]]'' without a kippah, since wearing a kippah is only an ''midos chassidus'' (\"exemplary attribute\"). Recently, there has been an effort to suppress earlier sources that practiced this leniency, including erasing lenient [[responsa]] from newly published books.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Yarmulke: A historic cover up?|journal=Flatbush Journal of Jewish Law|url=http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%204%20Rabinowitz.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Rabbi [[Isaac Klein]], a Conservative Jew ought to cover his head when in the synagogue, at prayer or sacred study, when engaging in a ritual act, and when eating.<ref>Klein, Isaac. ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice'', New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1979.</ref> In the mid-19th century, Reformers led by [[Isaac Mayer Wise|Isaac Wise]] completely rejected the ''kippot'' after an altercation in which Rabbi Wise's kippah was knocked off his head.<ref>Scharfman, Rabbi Harold (1988). ''The First Rabbi''. Pangloss Press.</ref>\n\nThere is still debate about whether wearing a Kippah is Halachic law or simply a custom. Many Sephardic Jews wear a kippah only when praying and eating.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Types and variation ==\n[[File:Jewish Chaplain Iraq.jpg|thumb|Rabbinical chaplain [[Sarah Schechter]] with fellow U.S. Airmen wearing [[camouflage]] kippot.]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, the distinctive Jewish headgear was the [[Jewish hat]], a full hat with a brim and a central point or stalk.  Originally used by choice among Jews to distinguish themselves, it was later made compulsory in some places by Christian governments as a discriminatory measure. In the early 19th century in the United States, rabbis often wore a scholar's cap (large saucer-shaped caps of cloth, like a beret) or a Chinese skullcap. Other Jews of this era wore black pillbox-shaped ''kippot''.\n\nOften, the color and fabric of the ''kippah'' can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement, particularly in Israel.

Members of most [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] groups wear black velvet or cloth ''kippot''.\n\nMore recently, ''kippot'' have been observed made in the colors of sports teams, especially [[football]]. In the United States, children's ''kippot'' with cartoon characters or themes such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' are popular. (In response to this trend, some Jewish schools have banned ''kippot'' with characters that do not conform to traditional Jewish values.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/23/style/lifestyle-the-yarmulke-is-now-a-fashion-item.html Lifestyle; \"The Yarmulke Is Now a Fashion Item\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 Sept 1990</ref>) ''Kippot'' have been inscribed on the inside as a souvenir for a celebration (''bar/bat mitzvah'' or wedding).

One passage of the older literature is of significance: I Kings 20:31 mentions \u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b8\u05dc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd ''havalim'',  which are placed around the head. This calls to mind pictures of [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] on [[Egypt]]ian monuments, represented wearing a cord around their long, flowing hair, a custom still followed in [[Arabia]].\n\nEvidently the costume of the poorest classes is represented; but as the cord gave no protection against the heat of the sun, there is little probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the simple cloth skullcap, dating back to Egyptian times when those of high society routinely shaved their heads, to prevent lice. Conversely, their skullcaps also served as protection against irritation from their wigs.\n\nThe Israelites might have worn a headdress similar to that worn by the [[Bedouins]], but it is unknown whether a fixed type of headdress was utilized. That the headdress of the Israelites might have been in the fellah style may be inferred from the use of the noun \u05e6\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e3 ''tzanif'' (the verb ''tzanaf'' meaning \"to roll like a ball\", Isaiah 22:18) and by the verb \u05d7\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9 ''habash'' (\"to wind\", comp. Ezekiel 16:10; Jonah 2:6). As to the form of such turbans, nothing is known, and they may have varied according to the different classes of society. This was customary with the Assyrians and Babylonians, for example, whose fashions likely influenced the costume of the Israelites\u2014particularly during and after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]].<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=465&letter=H&search=Head-Dress \"Head-dress\"], ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> In Yemen, the wrap around the cap was called \u05de\u05b7\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8 ''matzar''; the head covering worn by women was a \u05d2\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9 ''[[gargush]]''.<ref>[http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm \"Clothing of the Yemenite Jews\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220174330/http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm |date=2006-02-20 }}, Chayas.com</ref>\n\n== Civil legal issues ==\n\nIn ''[[Goldman v.

(In response to this trend, some Jewish schools have banned ''kippot'' with characters that do not conform to traditional Jewish values.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/23/style/lifestyle-the-yarmulke-is-now-a-fashion-item.html Lifestyle; \"The Yarmulke Is Now a Fashion Item\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 Sept 1990</ref>) ''Kippot'' have been inscribed on the inside as a souvenir for a celebration (''bar/bat mitzvah'' or wedding). ''Kippot'' for women are also being made and worn.<ref name=\"GU\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/July06/archives06July07-06.html|title=A guide to Jewish head-coverings: Kippot no longer only come in one style, but a medley of colors, shapes and designs|first1=Wendy|last1=Elliman|date=July 7, 2006|work=Jewish Independent|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309024448/http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/July06/archives06July07-06.html|archivedate=March 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"MAZ\">[http://www.mazorguide.com/Living/JewishAttire/home.htm Living Jewish \u2013 Jewish Attire!], Mazor Guide.

One passage of the older literature is of significance: I Kings 20:31 mentions \u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b8\u05dc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd ''havalim'',  which are placed around the head. This calls to mind pictures of [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] on [[Egypt]]ian monuments, represented wearing a cord around their long, flowing hair, a custom still followed in [[Arabia]].\n\nEvidently the costume of the poorest classes is represented; but as the cord gave no protection against the heat of the sun, there is little probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the simple cloth skullcap, dating back to Egyptian times when those of high society routinely shaved their heads, to prevent lice. Conversely, their skullcaps also served as protection against irritation from their wigs.\n\nThe Israelites might have worn a headdress similar to that worn by the [[Bedouins]], but it is unknown whether a fixed type of headdress was utilized. That the headdress of the Israelites might have been in the fellah style may be inferred from the use of the noun \u05e6\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e3 ''tzanif'' (the verb ''tzanaf'' meaning \"to roll like a ball\", Isaiah 22:18) and by the verb \u05d7\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9 ''habash'' (\"to wind\", comp. Ezekiel 16:10; Jonah 2:6). As to the form of such turbans, nothing is known, and they may have varied according to the different classes of society. This was customary with the Assyrians and Babylonians, for example, whose fashions likely influenced the costume of the Israelites\u2014particularly during and after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]].<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=465&letter=H&search=Head-Dress \"Head-dress\"], ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> In Yemen, the wrap around the cap was called \u05de\u05b7\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8 ''matzar''; the head covering worn by women was a \u05d2\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9 ''[[gargush]]''.<ref>[http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm \"Clothing of the Yemenite Jews\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220174330/http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm |date=2006-02-20 }}, Chayas.com</ref>\n\n== Civil legal issues ==\n\nIn ''[[Goldman v.
