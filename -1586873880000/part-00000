The intersection of circles whose centers are a radius width apart is a pair of equilateral arches, each of which can be inscribed with an equilateral triangle. They form faces of regular and uniform [[polyhedra]]. Three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s are composed of equilateral triangles. In particular, the [[tetrahedron|regular tetrahedron]] has four equilateral triangles for faces and can be considered the three-dimensional analogue of the shape. The plane can be [[Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons|tiled]] using equilateral triangles giving the [[triangular tiling]].\n\n==Geometric construction==\n\n[[File:Equilateral triangle construction.svg|200px|thumb|right|Construction of equilateral triangle with compass and straightedge]]\n\nAn equilateral triangle is easily constructed using a [[straightedge and compass]], because 3 is a [[Fermat prime]]. Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment. Repeat with the other side of the line. Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment\n\nAn alternative method is to draw a circle with radius ''r'', place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.\n\nIn both methods a by-product is the formation of [[vesica piscis]].\n\nThe proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].\n\n[[File:Equilateral_Triangle_Inscribed_in_a_Circle.gif|center]]\n\n==Derivation of area formula==\nThe area formula <math>A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2</math> in terms of side length ''a'' can be derived directly using the Pythagorean theorem or using trigonometry.\n\n===Using the Pythagorean theorem===\nThe area of a triangle is half of one side ''a'' times the height ''h'' from that side:\n:<math>A = \\frac{1}{2} ah.</math>\n\n[[File:30-60-90.svg|thumb|150px|An equilateral triangle with a side of 2 has a height of {{sqrt|3}} as the sine of 60\u00b0 is {{sqrt|3}}/2.]]\nThe legs of either right triangle formed by an altitude of the equilateral triangle are half of the base ''a'', and the hypotenuse is the side ''a'' of the equilateral triangle.

The intersection of circles whose centers are a radius width apart is a pair of equilateral arches, each of which can be inscribed with an equilateral triangle. They form faces of regular and uniform [[polyhedra]]. Three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s are composed of equilateral triangles. In particular, the [[tetrahedron|regular tetrahedron]] has four equilateral triangles for faces and can be considered the three-dimensional analogue of the shape. The plane can be [[Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons|tiled]] using equilateral triangles giving the [[triangular tiling]].\n\n==Geometric construction==\n\n[[File:Equilateral triangle construction.svg|200px|thumb|right|Construction of equilateral triangle with compass and straightedge]]\n\nAn equilateral triangle is easily constructed using a [[straightedge and compass]], because 3 is a [[Fermat prime]]. Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment. Repeat with the other side of the line. Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment\n\nAn alternative method is to draw a circle with radius ''r'', place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.\n\nIn both methods a by-product is the formation of [[vesica piscis]].\n\nThe proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].\n\n[[File:Equilateral_Triangle_Inscribed_in_a_Circle.gif|center]]\n\n==Derivation of area formula==\nThe area formula <math>A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2</math> in terms of side length ''a'' can be derived directly using the Pythagorean theorem or using trigonometry.\n\n===Using the Pythagorean theorem===\nThe area of a triangle is half of one side ''a'' times the height ''h'' from that side:\n:<math>A = \\frac{1}{2} ah.</math>\n\n[[File:30-60-90.svg|thumb|150px|An equilateral triangle with a side of 2 has a height of {{sqrt|3}} as the sine of 60\u00b0 is {{sqrt|3}}/2.]]\nThe legs of either right triangle formed by an altitude of the equilateral triangle are half of the base ''a'', and the hypotenuse is the side ''a'' of the equilateral triangle.

Among the top 100 words in the English language, which make up more than 50% of all written English, the average word has more than 15 senses,<ref>[[Most common words in English]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamu.si/polysemy_top_100|title=Polysemy in top 100 Oxford English Corpus words within Wiktionary|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> which makes the odds of a correct translation about 15 to 1 if each sense maps to a different word in the target language. Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'. Particularly \"tu\".|website=Reddit|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> Since its English reference material contains only \"you\" forms, it has difficulty translating a language with \"you all\" or formal \"you\" variations.\n\nDue to differences between languages in investment, research, and the extent of digital resources, the accuracy of Google Translate varies greatly among languages.<ref name=\":7\" /> Some languages produce better results than others. Most languages from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, tend to score poorly in relation to the scores of many well-financed European languages, with Afrikaans and Chinese being the high-scoring exceptions from their continents.<ref name=\"Kamu.si\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freitas|first=Connor|last2=Liu|first2=Yudong|date=December 15, 2017|title=Exploring the Differences between Human and Machine Translation|url=https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=wwu_honors|journal=Western Washington University|volume=|pages=5|via=}}</ref> No languages indigenous to Australia or the Americas are included within Google Translate.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.\n\nIn its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.<ref name=\":52\" /> Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nMoreover, like all machine translation programs, Google Translate struggles with [[polysemy]] (the multiple meanings a word may have)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#polysemy|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Polysemy|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> and [[multiword expression]]s (terms that have meanings that cannot be understood or translated by analyzing the individual word units that compose them).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teachyoubackwards.com/mt-mathematics/#party-terms|title=The Astounding Mathematics of Machine Translation - Party Terms|last=Benjamin|first=Martin|date=2019|website=Teach You Backwards|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language.

Most common English words have at least two senses, which produces 50/50 odds in the likely case that the target language uses different words for those different senses. The odds are similar from other languages to English. Google Translate makes statistical guesses that raise the likelihood of producing the most frequent sense of a word, with the consequence that an accurate translation will be unobtainable in cases that do not match the majority or plurality [[text corpus|corpus]] occurrence. The accuracy of single-word predictions has not been measured for any language. Because almost all non-English language pairs pivot through English, the odds against obtaining accurate single-word translations from one non-English language to another can be estimated by multiplying the number of senses in the source language with the number of senses each of those terms have in English. When Google Translate does not have a word in its vocabulary, it makes up a result as part of its algorithm.<ref name=\"Ooga Booga\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\nGoogle Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. The service limits the number of paragraphs and the range of technical terms that can be translated, and while it can help the reader understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations, and most times it tends to repeat verbatim the same word it's expected to translate. Grammatically, for example, Google Translate struggles to differentiate between ''imperfect'' and ''perfect'' [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s in Romance languages so habitual and continuous acts in the past often become single ''historical'' events. Although seemingly pedantic, this can often lead to incorrect results (to a native speaker of for example French and Spanish) which would have been avoided by a human translator. Knowledge of the ''[[subjunctive mood]]'' is virtually non-existent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifiwerejudgingu/status/334830611929919488|title=Subjunctive Mood|website=Twitter|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Moreover, the formal second person (''vous'') is often chosen, whatever the context or accepted usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1rw4iq/google_translate_doesnt_really_understand_tu_and/|title=Google Translate doesn't really understand 'tu' and 'vous'.

While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.<ref name=\"tr1\" /> A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words.

{"title_page": "History of the violin", "text_new": "{{violin}}\n\nThe [[violin]], [[viola]], and [[cello]] were first made in the early 16th century, in Italy. The earliest evidence for their existence is in paintings by [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]] from the 1530s, though Ferrari's instruments had only three strings. The ''Academie musicale'', a treatise written in 1556 by [[Philibert Jambe de Fer]], gives a clear description of the violin family much as we know it today.\n\nViolins are likely to have been developed from a number of other string instruments of the 15th and 16th centuries, including the [[vielle]], [[rebec]], and [[lira da braccio]]. The history of bowed string instruments in Europe goes back to the 9th century with the Byzantine [[Byzantine lyra|''lira'']] (or ''l\u016br\u0101'', ''Greek: \u03bb\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1'').\n\nSince their invention, instruments in the violin family have seen a number of changes. The overall pattern for the instrument was set in the 17th century by luthiers like the prolific [[Amati]] family, [[Jakob Stainer]] of the Tyrol, and [[Antonio Stradivari]], with many makers at the time and since following their templates.\n\n== Early history==\nThe direct ancestor of all European bowed instruments is the [[Arabic music|Arabic]] ''[[rebab]]'' (\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629), which developed into the [[Byzantine lira]] by the 9th century and later the European [[rebec]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rabab |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/rabab |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lira {{!}} musical instrument |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/lira-musical-instrument |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref> The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d.  of the 9th century, was the first to cite the bowed Byzantine lira as a typical instrument of the Byzantines and equivalent to the [[rab\u0101b]]  (\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629) used in the [[Muslim world]] since the beginning of 8th century.<ref>Margaret J.

In the meantime [[rab\u0101b]] was introduced to the Western Europe possibly through the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and both bowed instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments.\n\nOver the centuries that followed, Europe continued to have two distinct types of bowed instruments: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, known with the Italian term [[lira da braccio]] (meaning ''viol for the arm'') family; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, known with the Italian term ''[[lira da gamba]]''  (or '''viola da gamba''', meaning ''viol for the leg'') group.<ref>stringed instrument.

Bottom, left of centre, is an infant playing a three-stringed violin]]\n[[File:Gaudenzio Ferrari 002.jpg|thumb|right|The cupola of Madonna dei Miracoli in [[Saronno]] , with angels playing violin, viola and cello.]]\n\nThe first clear record of a violin-like instrument comes from paintings by [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]]. In his ''Madonna of the Orange Tree'', painted 1530, a cherub is seen playing a bowed instrument which clearly has the hallmarks of violins. A few years later, on a fresco inside the cupola of the church of Madonna dei Miracoli in [[Saronno]], angels play three instruments of the violin family, corresponding to violin, viola and cello. The instruments Ferrari depicts have bulging front and back plates, strings which feed into peg-boxes with side pegs, and f-holes. They do not have frets. The only real difference between these instruments and the modern violin is that Ferrari's have three strings, and a rather more extravagant curved shape.<ref>Boyden, p. 6-8</ref> It is not clear exactly who made these first violins, but there is good evidence that they originate from northern Italy, in the vicinity (and at the time the political orbit) of [[Milan]]. Not only are Ferrari's paintings in this area, but at the time towns like [[Brescia]] and [[Cremona]] had a great reputation for the craftsmanship of stringed instruments.\n\nThe earliest documentary evidence for a violin is in the records of the treasury of Savoy, which paid for \"trompettes et vyollons de Verceil\", that is to say, \"trumpets and violins from [[Vercelli]]\", the town where Ferrari painted his Madonna of the Orange Tree.

Stroh was not the only person who made instruments of this class. Over twenty different inventions appear in the Patent books up to 1949.

Solid-body electric violins produce very little sound on their own, and require the use of an electronic [[sound reinforcement system]], which usually includes [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and may also apply sonic [[Effects unit|effects]].\n\nElectric violins may have four strings, or as many as seven strings. Since the [[strength of materials]] imposes limits on the upper string, it is usually tuned to [[Scientific pitch notation|E5]], with additional strings tuned in [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] below the usual G3 of a typical four-string violin.

The earliest evidence for their existence is in paintings by [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]] from the 1530s, though Ferrari's instruments had only three strings. The ''Academie musicale'', a treatise written in 1556 by [[Philibert Jambe de Fer]], gives a clear description of the violin family much as we know it today.\n\nViolins are likely to have been developed from a number of other string instruments of the 15th and 16th centuries, including the [[vielle]], [[rebec]], and [[lira da braccio]]. The history of bowed string instruments in Europe goes back to the 9th century with the Byzantine [[Byzantine lyra|''lira'']] (or ''l\u016br\u0101'', ''Greek: \u03bb\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1'').\n\nSince their invention, instruments in the violin family have seen a number of changes. The overall pattern for the instrument was set in the 17th century by luthiers like the prolific [[Amati]] family, [[Jakob Stainer]] of the Tyrol, and [[Antonio Stradivari]], with many makers at the time and since following their templates.\n\n== Early history==\nThe direct ancestor of all European bowed instruments is the [[Arabic music|Arabic]] ''[[rebab]]'' (\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629), which developed into the [[Byzantine lira]] by the 9th century and later the European [[rebec]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rabab |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/rabab |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lira {{!}} musical instrument |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/lira-musical-instrument |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref> The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d.  of the 9th century, was the first to cite the bowed Byzantine lira as a typical instrument of the Byzantines and equivalent to the [[rab\u0101b]]  (\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629) used in the [[Muslim world]] since the beginning of 8th century.<ref>Margaret J.

In the meantime [[rab\u0101b]] was introduced to the Western Europe possibly through the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and both bowed instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments.\n\nOver the centuries that followed, Europe continued to have two distinct types of bowed instruments: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, known with the Italian term [[lira da braccio]] (meaning ''viol for the arm'') family; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, known with the Italian term ''[[lira da gamba]]''  (or '''viola da gamba''', meaning ''viol for the leg'') group.<ref>stringed instrument.

In his ''Madonna of the Orange Tree'', painted 1530, a cherub is seen playing a bowed instrument which clearly has the hallmarks of violins. A few years later, on a fresco inside the cupola of the church of Madonna dei Miracoli in [[Saronno]], angels play three instruments of the violin family, corresponding to violin, viola and cello. The instruments Ferrari depicts have bulging front and back plates, strings which feed into peg-boxes with side pegs, and f-holes. They do not have frets. The only real difference between these instruments and the modern violin is that Ferrari's have three strings, and a rather more extravagant curved shape.<ref>Boyden, p. 6-8</ref> It is not clear exactly who made these first violins, but there is good evidence that they originate from northern Italy, in the vicinity (and at the time the political orbit) of [[Milan]]. Not only are Ferrari's paintings in this area, but at the time towns like [[Brescia]] and [[Cremona]] had a great reputation for the craftsmanship of stringed instruments.\n\nThe earliest documentary evidence for a violin is in the records of the treasury of Savoy, which paid for \"trompettes et vyollons de Verceil\", that is to say, \"trumpets and violins from [[Vercelli]]\", the town where Ferrari painted his Madonna of the Orange Tree.
