On the release, \"A Horse with No Name\" shared the A-side with \"Everyone I Meet Is from California\"; \"Sandman\" featured on the B-side. However, its early-1972 two-track US release did not include \"Sandman\", with \"Everyone I Meet Is from California\" appearing on the B-side.\n\n==Composition==\n\"A Horse with No Name\" was recorded in the E Dorian mode with acoustic guitars, bass guitar, drum kit, and bongo drums. The only other chord is a D, fretted on the low E and G strings, second fret. A [[12-string guitar]] plays an added F\u266f (second fret, high E string) on the back beat of the Em. A noted feature of the song is the driving bass line with a [[clawhammer|hammer-hook]] in each chorus. A \"waterfall\"-type solo completes the arrangement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarnoise.com/lessons/horse-with-no-name-2/|title=A Horse With No Name by America - Adding Some Personal Touches|first=David|last=Hodge|website=Guitarnoise.com|date=January 13, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref> Produced by [[Ian Samwell]] on the day of final recording at Morgan Studios, when at first the group thought it was too corny and took some convincing to actually play it.

The interpretation of the song as a drug reference comes from the fact that the word \"horse\" is a common slang term for [[heroin]].\n\nThe song's resemblance to some of [[Neil Young]]'s work aroused some controversy. \"I know that virtually everyone, on first hearing, assumed it was Neil\", Bunnell says. \"I never fully shied away from the fact that I was inspired by him.

On the release, \"A Horse with No Name\" shared the A-side with \"Everyone I Meet Is from California\"; \"Sandman\" featured on the B-side. However, its early-1972 two-track US release did not include \"Sandman\", with \"Everyone I Meet Is from California\" appearing on the B-side.\n\n==Composition==\n\"A Horse with No Name\" was recorded in the E Dorian mode with acoustic guitars, bass guitar, drum kit, and bongo drums. The only other chord is a D, fretted on the low E and G strings, second fret. A [[12-string guitar]] plays an added F\u266f (second fret, high E string) on the back beat of the Em. A noted feature of the song is the driving bass line with a [[clawhammer|hammer-hook]] in each chorus. A \"waterfall\"-type solo completes the arrangement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarnoise.com/lessons/horse-with-no-name-2/|title=A Horse With No Name by America - Adding Some Personal Touches|first=David|last=Hodge|website=Guitarnoise.com|date=January 13, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref> Produced by [[Ian Samwell]] on the day of final recording at Morgan Studios, when at first the group thought it was too corny and took some convincing to actually play it.

The interpretation of the song as a drug reference comes from the fact that the word \"horse\" is a common slang term for [[heroin]].\n\nThe song's resemblance to some of [[Neil Young]]'s work aroused some controversy. \"I know that virtually everyone, on first hearing, assumed it was Neil\", Bunnell says. \"I never fully shied away from the fact that I was inspired by him.

Furie]], and written by [[Frank De Felitta]], who adapted his 1978 novel of the same name. The film stars [[Barbara Hershey]] as a single mother in [[Los Angeles]] who is raped and tormented by an invisible assailant. \n\nLike the novel, the film is based on the 1974 case of [[Doris Bither case|Doris Bither]], a woman who claimed to have been repeatedly sexually assaulted by an invisible entity, and who was observed by doctoral students at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].\n\nDespite being filmed and planned for a release in 1981, the movie was not released in worldwide theaters until September 1982 and February 1983 in the United States.  \n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], single mother Carla Moran is violently raped in her home by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of [[poltergeist]] activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her friend Cindy Nash.\n\nThey return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself, despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach. Carla explains to Sneiderman that she suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy, and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma.\n\nCarla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene, but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken. Dr. Sneiderman urges Carla to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses and becomes angry when Sneiderman goes so far as to suggest she has [[incest]]uous feelings for her son.\n\nAfter Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two [[parapsychologists]], whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home. During their study, Dr. Sneiderman arrives and confronts Carla, trying to convince her that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him. Reassured that her case is being taken seriously, Carla begins to relax. Her boyfriend, Jerry Anderson, visits and she suffers a particularly disturbing attack, which he witnesses. Hearing the commotion, Carla\u2019s son enters the room and believes that Jerry is harming her, prompting him to attack Jerry. Later at the hospital, Jerry is so troubled by the experience that he ends their relationship.\n\nDesperate for a solution to her problem, Carla agrees to participate in an elaborate experiment carried out by the parapsychologists. A full mock-up of her home is created to lure the entity into a trap. Liquid helium will be used to freeze the entity, once inside. Before the experiment can begin, Dr. Sneiderman unsuccessfully tries to convince Carla to leave. The entity arrives but unexpectedly takes control of the liquid helium jets and uses them against Carla. She defiantly stands up to it, stating that even if it kills her, it can never have her. Dr. Sneiderman rushes in and saves her. As they look back, they see the entity frozen for a brief period into a very large mass of ice. It eventually breaks free and vanishes, but Dr. Sneiderman realizes that Carla was telling the truth the whole time. \n\nCarla returns to her house the next day. The front door slams by itself and she is greeted by a demonic voice which says, \"Welcome home, [[cunt]]\". She calmly opens the door, exits the house, gets in a car with her family and leaves.\n\nA closing disclaimer verifies that Carla and her family have moved to Texas. Carla still experiences attacks from the entity, although they have lessened in frequency and severity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Carla Moran\n* [[Ron Silver]] as Dr. Phil Sneiderman\n* [[David Labiosa]] as Billy Moran\n* [[George Coe]] as Dr. Weber\n* [[Margaret Blye]] as Cindy Nash\n* [[Jacqueline Brookes]] as Dr. Elizabeth Cooley\n* Michael Alldredge as George Nash\n* [[Alex Rocco]] as Jerry Anderson\n* [[Allan Rich]] as Dr. Walcott\n* Richard Brestoff as Gene Kraft\n* Raymond Singer as Joe Mehan\n* Natasha Ryan as Julie Moran\n* Melanie Gaffin as Kim Moran\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nFilm scholar Daniel Kremer interprets ''The Entity'' as a parable for female sexual victimhood, citing the lead character of Carla Moran as a woman who \"goes head-to-head with a gaggle of men (including the \"entity\" itself). If the men of the film do not undermine her credibility or sanity, they objectify her, exploit her victimhood, belittle her ability to take control of her unfortunate circumstances, and ultimately give her the dignity of a glorified [[Laboratory rat|lab rat]].\"{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=274}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nScreenwriter [[Frank De Felitta]] adapted the screenplay from his own novel, which was based on the case of [[Doris Bither case|Doris Bither]], a woman who alleged to have been sexually assaulted by an invisible supernatural entity on numerous occasions.{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=267}}\n\nIn a rare interview with ''Rue Morgue'' magazine in July 2012, director Sidney J. Furie told journalist Michael Doyle that he did not consider ''The Entity'' to be a horror film in spite of its extreme imagery, unsettling atmosphere and horrific plot. Instead, Furie said he considers ''The Entity'' to be more of a \"supernatural suspense movie.\" Furie also confessed that he intentionally avoided researching the actual case upon which ''The Entity'' is based as he \"did not want to judge the characters and story in any way.\" Neither he nor actress Barbara Hershey met with [[Doris Bither]], the woman on whom the character of Carla Moran was based, at any point.{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=100}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Barbara Hershey by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Barbara Hershey]] was cast in the role of Carla Moran only ten days prior to production]]\nSeveral actresses were considered for the role of Carla Moran, including [[Jill Clayburgh]], [[Sally Field]], [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Bette Midler]], but all four declined the offer.{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=268}} Barbara Hershey was cast in the role only ten days before production was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=268}} Hershey had hesitations about the part due to the nudity in the screenplay, but agreed to it after director Sidney J.

Furie]], and written by [[Frank De Felitta]], who adapted his 1978 novel of the same name. The film stars [[Barbara Hershey]] as a single mother in [[Los Angeles]] who is raped and tormented by an invisible assailant. \n\nLike the novel, the film is based on the 1974 case of [[Doris Bither case|Doris Bither]], a woman who claimed to have been repeatedly sexually assaulted by an invisible entity, and who was observed by doctoral students at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].\n\nDespite being filmed and planned for a release in 1981, the movie was not released in worldwide theaters until September 1982 and February 1983 in the United States.  \n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], single mother Carla Moran is violently raped in her home by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of [[poltergeist]] activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her friend Cindy Nash.\n\nThey return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself, despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach. Carla explains to Sneiderman that she suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy, and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma.\n\nCarla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene, but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken. Dr. Sneiderman urges Carla to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses and becomes angry when Sneiderman goes so far as to suggest she has [[incest]]uous feelings for her son.\n\nAfter Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two [[parapsychologists]], whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home. During their study, Dr. Sneiderman arrives and confronts Carla, trying to convince her that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him. Reassured that her case is being taken seriously, Carla begins to relax. Her boyfriend, Jerry Anderson, visits and she suffers a particularly disturbing attack, which he witnesses. Hearing the commotion, Carla\u2019s son enters the room and believes that Jerry is harming her, prompting him to attack Jerry. Later at the hospital, Jerry is so troubled by the experience that he ends their relationship.\n\nDesperate for a solution to her problem, Carla agrees to participate in an elaborate experiment carried out by the parapsychologists. A full mock-up of her home is created to lure the entity into a trap. Liquid helium will be used to freeze the entity, once inside. Before the experiment can begin, Dr. Sneiderman unsuccessfully tries to convince Carla to leave. The entity arrives but unexpectedly takes control of the liquid helium jets and uses them against Carla. She defiantly stands up to it, stating that even if it kills her, it can never have her. Dr. Sneiderman rushes in and saves her. As they look back, they see the entity frozen for a brief period into a very large mass of ice. It eventually breaks free and vanishes, but Dr. Sneiderman realizes that Carla was telling the truth the whole time. \n\nCarla returns to her house the next day. The front door slams by itself and she is greeted by a demonic voice which says, \"Welcome home, [[cunt]]\". She calmly opens the door, exits the house, gets in a car with her family and leaves.\n\nA closing disclaimer verifies that Carla and her family have moved to Texas. Carla still experiences attacks from the entity, although they have lessened in frequency and severity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Carla Moran\n* [[Ron Silver]] as Dr. Phil Sneiderman\n* [[David Labiosa]] as Billy Moran\n* [[George Coe]] as Dr. Weber\n* [[Margaret Blye]] as Cindy Nash\n* [[Jacqueline Brookes]] as Dr. Elizabeth Cooley\n* Michael Alldredge as George Nash\n* [[Alex Rocco]] as Jerry Anderson\n* [[Allan Rich]] as Dr. Walcott\n* Richard Brestoff as Gene Kraft\n* Raymond Singer as Joe Mehan\n* Natasha Ryan as Julie Moran\n* Melanie Gaffin as Kim Moran\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nFilm scholar Daniel Kremer interprets ''The Entity'' as a parable for female sexual victimhood, citing the lead character of Carla Moran as a woman who \"goes head-to-head with a gaggle of men (including the \"entity\" itself). If the men of the film do not undermine her credibility or sanity, they objectify her, exploit her victimhood, belittle her ability to take control of her unfortunate circumstances, and ultimately give her the dignity of a glorified [[Laboratory rat|lab rat]].\"{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=274}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nScreenwriter [[Frank De Felitta]] adapted the screenplay from his own novel, which was based on the case of [[Doris Bither case|Doris Bither]], a woman who alleged to have been sexually assaulted by an invisible supernatural entity on numerous occasions.{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=267}}\n\nIn a rare interview with ''Rue Morgue'' magazine in July 2012, director Sidney J. Furie told journalist Michael Doyle that he did not consider ''The Entity'' to be a horror film in spite of its extreme imagery, unsettling atmosphere and horrific plot. Instead, Furie said he considers ''The Entity'' to be more of a \"supernatural suspense movie.\" Furie also confessed that he intentionally avoided researching the actual case upon which ''The Entity'' is based as he \"did not want to judge the characters and story in any way.\" Neither he nor actress Barbara Hershey met with [[Doris Bither]], the woman on whom the character of Carla Moran was based, at any point.{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=100}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Barbara Hershey by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Barbara Hershey]] was cast in the role of Carla Moran only ten days prior to production]]\nSeveral actresses were considered for the role of Carla Moran, including [[Jill Clayburgh]], [[Sally Field]], [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Bette Midler]], but all four declined the offer.{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=268}} Barbara Hershey was cast in the role only ten days before production was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|Kremer|2015|p=268}} Hershey had hesitations about the part due to the nudity in the screenplay, but agreed to it after director Sidney J.

Similar rollers are used also at landfills or in agriculture.\n\nRoad rollers are frequently referred to as [[steamroller]]s, regardless of their method of propulsion.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|Steamroller}}\n\n[[Image:Deutsches Stra\u00dfenmuseum, Germersheim. Horse-drawn road roller 01.jpg|thumb|Horse-drawn road roller from 1800]]\n[[Image:Steam engine Lausanne 2.jpg|thumb| [[Steam engine|Steam]]-powered roller]]\n[[Image:ZettelmeyerWalze.jpg|thumb|[[Zettelmeyer]] diesel-powered road roller]]\n\nThe first road rollers were [[horse]]-drawn, and were probably just borrowed farm implements'' (see [[Roller (agricultural tool)|Roller]])''.\n\nSince the effectiveness of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were [[steam roller]]s. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs with [[low gear|low gearing]] to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls in much the same way as a vibrating roller. The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as \"chip chasers\" which followed behind the hot tar and chipping laying machines. Some road companies in the United States used steamrollers through the 1950s, and in the UK, some remained in commercial service until the early 1970s.\n\nAs internal combustion engine technology improved during the 20th century, [[kerosene]]-, [[gasoline]]- (petrol), and [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered rollers gradually replaced their [[steam]]-powered counterparts. The first internal-combustion powered road rollers were very similar to the steam rollers they replaced. They used similar mechanisms to transmit power from the engine to the wheels, typically large, exposed spur gears. Some users did not like them in their infancy, as the engines of the era were typically difficult to start, particularly the kerosene-powered ones.\n\nVirtually all road rollers in commercial use now use diesel power.\n\n==Uses on a road==\nRoad rollers use the weight of the vehicle to compress the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial [[Soil compaction|compaction]] of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways, a four-wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed, and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads, a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used.\n\nThe next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface.\n\nThe next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller, or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (there is, however, an exception if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine).\n\nThe final wear course of [[asphalt concrete]] (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.\n\nRollers are also used in [[landfill]] compaction. Such compactors typically have padfoot or \"sheep's foot\" drums, and do not achieve a smooth surface. The pads aid in compression, due to the smaller area contacting the ground.\n\n==Configurations==\n[[File:Construction site near Yass site cleared and bull dozed cleared steam roller in background.JPG|thumb|Flattened and leveled construction site with road roller in the background]]\n\nThe roller can be a simple drum with a handle that is operated by one person and weighs {{convert|100|lb|order=flip}} or as large as a ride-on road roller weighing {{convert|20|t}} and costing more than [[United States dollar|US$]]150,000.

Very heavy tyre rollers are used to compact soil.\n\n===Variations and features===\n* On some machines, the drums may be filled with water on site to achieve the desired weight. When empty, the lighter machine is easier and cheaper to transport between work sites. On pneumatic tyre rollers the body may be ballasted with water or sand, or for extra compaction wet sand is used. Modern tyre rollers may be filled with steel ballast, which gives a more even balance for better compaction.\n* Additional compaction may be achieved by [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrating]] the roller drums, allowing a small, light machine to perform as well as a much heavier one. Vibration is typically produced by a free-spinning hydrostatic motor inside the drum to whose shaft an eccentric weight has been attached. Some rollers have a second weight that can be rotated relative to the main weight, to adjust the vibration amplitude and thus the compacting force.\n* Water lubrication may be provided to the drum surface from on-board \"sprinkler tanks\" to prevent hot asphalt sticking to the drum.\n* Hydraulic transmissions permit greater design flexibility. While early examples used direct mechanical drives, hydraulics reduce the number of moving parts exposed to contamination and allows the drum to be driven, providing extra traction on inclines.\n* Human-propelled rollers may only have a single roller drum.\n* Self-propelled rollers may have two drums, mounted one in front of the other (format known as \"duplex\"), or three rolls, or just one, with the back rollers replaced with treaded pneumatic tyres for increased traction.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Road roller powered walk-behind 03.jpg|Powered, vibrating walk-behind\nImage:Road_roller_ride-on_articulating-swivel_small_01.jpg|Ride-on with articulating-swivel (small machine)\nImage:Road roller ride-on articulating-swivel large 02.jpg|Ride-on with articulating-swivel (large machine)\nFile:Ch\u00e2tignac 16 Travaux LGV Compacteur 2013.jpg|Ride-on with articulating-swivel, Bomag BW 219 DH WR 2500\nImage:Dynapac CC232.JPG|Vibrating Dynapac CC232\nImage:Caterpillar CS-533E.jpg | A [[Caterpillar CS-533E]] vibratory roller.\nImage:Pneumatic road roller Hamm AG GRW 18 01.jpg|Pneumatic roller\nImage:Tractor-powered Roadroller.jpg|A road-roller powered by a tractor mounted on it\n</gallery>\n\n==Manufacturers==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ingersoll-Rand ABG|ABG (Germany)]]&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD (purchased by [[Ingersoll Rand]] and now part of [[Volvo Construction Equipment|Volvo CE]])\n* Albaret (France)&nbsp;\u2014 PT/TD (now part of [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]])\n* [[Ammann Group]] (Switzerland)&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Aveling-Barford]] (England)&nbsp;\u2014 TD/PT/3P\n* [[BOMAG]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT ([[BOMAG]]/[[Hyster Company|HYPAC]] in the USA market)\n* [[Case CE]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD (brands the [[Ammann Group|Ammann]]/Sta machines as Case in the USA)\n* [[Caterpillar Inc.]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (has the former lines of RAYGO, BROS and Bitelli)\n* [[Dynapac]] (Sweden)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P \n* [[Galion Iron Works|Galion]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Hamm AG]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P (now part of the [[Wirtgen Group]])\n* [[HEPCO]] (Iran)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P\n* [[Hitachi Construction Machinery|Hitachi]] (Japan)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P\n* [[Huber Manufacturing Co.|Huber Company]], (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Hyster]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (part of [[Hyster Company|HYPAC]] and [[BOMAG|Bomag USA]])\n* [[Ingersoll Rand]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (now owned by [[Volvo Construction Equipment|Volvo]])\n* [[Kamani Engineering Corporation]] (India)&nbsp;\u2014 tractor-mounted (now part of the [[RPG Group]]; production ended [[Circa|c.]]1970-1980)\n* [[LiuGong Construction Machinery, LLC.|LiuGong]], HQ at [[Liuzhou]], [[China]]&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Marshall, Sons & Co.|Marshall]] (England)&nbsp;\u2014 TD\n* [[:ja:\u9152\u4e95\u91cd\u5de5\u696d|Sakai Heavy Industries]] (Japan)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P\n* [[Sany]] (China)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT\n* World Equipment(China)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT\n* [[Tampo]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD\n* [[Vibromax]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (purchased by [[JCB (company)|JCB]], now branded JCB)\n* [[Wacker Neuson]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014\n{{div col end}}\nKEY:\n* SD = Single drum\n* TD = Tandem drum\n* PT = Pneumatic tyre&nbsp;\u2014 Rubber tyre or multi-tyre are also common\n* 3P = 3-point rollers&nbsp;\u2014 These are very similar to the old steam roller design\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Road rollers}}\n* [[Tractor]]\n* [[Roller (agricultural tool)]]&nbsp;\u2014 for farm rollers\n* [[Roller (disambiguation)]]&nbsp;\u2014 for other types of roller\n* [[Landfill compaction vehicle]]\n* [[Mine roller]] - a [[demining]] device\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\nJojo's bizzare adventure Part 3\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.r-r-a.org.uk/ Road Roller Association]&nbsp;\u2014 UK-based society dedicated to the preservation of steam and motor rollers, and ancillary road-making equipment.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Road Roller}}\n[[Category:Engineering vehicles]]\n[[Category:Road construction]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2019}}\n{{redirect|Roller-compactor|other types of rolling compactors|Compactor}}\n[[File:John Deere roller, U.S. Navy, Camp Covington, NMCB-133, 080928-N-1106H-001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] soil compactor equipped with padfoot drum, being used to compact the ground before placing concrete]]\n[[Image:Roadroller.jpg|thumb|An old diesel-powered road roller]]\n\nA '''road roller''' (sometimes called a '''roller-compactor''', or just '''roller''') is a [[compactor]]-type [[engineering vehicle]] used to [[soil compaction|compact soil]], [[gravel]], [[concrete]], or [[asphalt]] in the [[construction]] of [[road]]s and [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]].

While early examples used direct mechanical drives, hydraulics reduce the number of moving parts exposed to contamination and allows the drum to be driven, providing extra traction on inclines.\n* Human-propelled rollers may only have a single roller drum.\n* Self-propelled rollers may have two drums, mounted one in front of the other (format known as \"duplex\"), or three rolls, or just one, with the back rollers replaced with treaded pneumatic tyres for increased traction.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Road roller powered walk-behind 03.jpg|Powered, vibrating walk-behind\nImage:Road_roller_ride-on_articulating-swivel_small_01.jpg|Ride-on with articulating-swivel (small machine)\nImage:Road roller ride-on articulating-swivel large 02.jpg|Ride-on with articulating-swivel (large machine)\nFile:Ch\u00e2tignac 16 Travaux LGV Compacteur 2013.jpg|Ride-on with articulating-swivel, Bomag BW 219 DH WR 2500\nImage:Dynapac CC232.JPG|Vibrating Dynapac CC232\nImage:Caterpillar CS-533E.jpg | A [[Caterpillar CS-533E]] vibratory roller.\nImage:Pneumatic road roller Hamm AG GRW 18 01.jpg|Pneumatic roller\nImage:Tractor-powered Roadroller.jpg|A road-roller powered by a tractor mounted on it\n</gallery>\n\n==Manufacturers==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ingersoll-Rand ABG|ABG (Germany)]]&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD (purchased by [[Ingersoll Rand]] and now part of [[Volvo Construction Equipment|Volvo CE]])\n* Albaret (France)&nbsp;\u2014 PT/TD (now part of [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]])\n* [[Ammann Group]] (Switzerland)&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Aveling-Barford]] (England)&nbsp;\u2014 TD/PT/3P\n* [[BOMAG]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT ([[BOMAG]]/[[Hyster Company|HYPAC]] in the USA market)\n* [[Case CE]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD (brands the [[Ammann Group|Ammann]]/Sta machines as Case in the USA)\n* [[Caterpillar Inc.]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (has the former lines of RAYGO, BROS and Bitelli)\n* [[Dynapac]] (Sweden)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P \n* [[Galion Iron Works|Galion]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Hamm AG]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P (now part of the [[Wirtgen Group]])\n* [[HEPCO]] (Iran)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P\n* [[Hitachi Construction Machinery|Hitachi]] (Japan)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P\n* [[Huber Manufacturing Co.|Huber Company]], (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Hyster]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (part of [[Hyster Company|HYPAC]] and [[BOMAG|Bomag USA]])\n* [[Ingersoll Rand]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (now owned by [[Volvo Construction Equipment|Volvo]])\n* [[Kamani Engineering Corporation]] (India)&nbsp;\u2014 tractor-mounted (now part of the [[RPG Group]]; production ended [[Circa|c.]]1970-1980)\n* [[LiuGong Construction Machinery, LLC.|LiuGong]], HQ at [[Liuzhou]], [[China]]&nbsp;\u2014 \n* [[Marshall, Sons & Co.|Marshall]] (England)&nbsp;\u2014 TD\n* [[:ja:\u9152\u4e95\u91cd\u5de5\u696d|Sakai Heavy Industries]] (Japan)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT/3P\n* [[Sany]] (China)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT\n* World Equipment(China)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT\n* [[Tampo]] (USA)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD\n* [[Vibromax]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014 SD/TD/PT (purchased by [[JCB (company)|JCB]], now branded JCB)\n* [[Wacker Neuson]] (Germany)&nbsp;\u2014\n{{div col end}}\nKEY:\n* SD = Single drum\n* TD = Tandem drum\n* PT = Pneumatic tyre&nbsp;\u2014 Rubber tyre or multi-tyre are also common\n* 3P = 3-point rollers&nbsp;\u2014 These are very similar to the old steam roller design\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Road rollers}}\n* [[Tractor]]\n* [[Roller (agricultural tool)]]&nbsp;\u2014 for farm rollers\n* [[Roller (disambiguation)]]&nbsp;\u2014 for other types of roller\n* [[Landfill compaction vehicle]]\n* [[Mine roller]] - a [[demining]] device\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.r-r-a.org.uk/ Road Roller Association]&nbsp;\u2014 UK-based society dedicated to the preservation of steam and motor rollers, and ancillary road-making equipment.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Road Roller}}\n[[Category:Engineering vehicles]]\n[[Category:Road construction]]\n", "name_user": "Ekkoexcellent", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_roller"}
