In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel. He was especially concerned with the difficulty of properly loading the steamer to maintain her stability, which resulted in a heated exchange between the owners and the builders following the vessel's return to England.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry into her sinking raised some disputed reports of instability on this voyage.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77352720 |title=THE S.S.

Sawyer, an engineer and experienced sea traveller, left the ship and sent the following [[Telegram|cable]] to his wife in London: \"Thought Waratah top-heavy, landed Durban\". Sawyer later testified to the London inquiry that he had booked passage on ''Waratah'' through to Cape Town, but had decided to disembark at Durban, as he had been nervous about the behaviour of the ship during his voyage. He also claimed that he had been disturbed by visions he saw in dreams during the voyage of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" Sawyer claimed that he took these visions to be a warning to leave the ship at the earliest opportunity. In any event his decision to leave the ship at Durban saved his life.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n===Disappearance===\nThe ''Waratah'' left Durban at approximately 20:15 on 26 July with 211 passengers and crew. At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire. When darkness fell, the crew of the ''Harlow'' could see the steamer's running lights approaching, but still {{convert|10|to|12|mi|km}} behind them, when there were suddenly two bright flashes from the direction of the steamer and the lights vanished. The captain thought they were caused by explosions, but the mate of the ''Harlow'' who had also seen them, thought the flashes were brush fires on the shore (a common phenomenon in the area at that time of year). The captain agreed and did not even enter the events in the log \u2013 only when he learnt of the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' did he think the events significant.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}} Reportedly the ''Harlow'' was {{convert|180|mi|km}} from Durban.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189442/the_new_york_times/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 September 1909 |page=6 |title=Saw Steamer Blow Up. |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=24 September 1909 |title=The Loss of the Waratah. |page=12 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189605/the_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nThat same evening at around 21:30 the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}}\n\nAnother possible sighting, which was not disclosed to the Inquiry at the time, was by Edward Joe Conquer, a [[Cape Mounted Riflemen|Cape Mounted Rifleman]] who on 28 July 1909, was posted to carry out military exercises on the banks of the mouth of the [[Xora River]] along with Signaller H.Adshead. He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously. He did not come forward with his story until 1929.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=173\u2013174|ps=}}<ref name=\"TSSGuaurdian\">{{cite web |title=The Titanic of the southern seas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/19/southafrica.rorycarroll |work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 June 2019 |date=19 April 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was expected to reach Cape Town on 29 July 1909, but never reached its destination. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Search efforts==\n===Contemporary searches===\nInitially, the non-appearance of the ship did not cause alarm as it was not uncommon for ships to arrive at port days, or occasionally even weeks overdue. As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W.

The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]].

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

Interest in [[local currency]] moved on to other designs such as [[time-based currency]] and dollar-backed local voucher schemes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Internet networks===\nOn the whole, the movement was slow to adapt to the internet and to the possibility of networking together. Reluctance to engage with technology, a belief in decentralisation/localisation and lack of funds all contributed to this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nExamples of LETS networks based on free software are the [[Cape Town]]-based [[Community Exchange System]] (CES), which {{as of|lc=yes|March 2019}} links to the [[Geneva]]-based Community Forge<ref>[http://communityforge.net/ CommunityForge]</ref> and [[Spain|Spanish]]  IntegralCES.<ref>[http://integralces.net/]</ref><ref name=CESstats/>\n\n== Criteria ==\n\nLETS networks facilitate exchange between members by providing a directory of offers and needs and by allowing a line of [[interest]]-free credit to each. Members' [[IOU]]s are logged in a centralised accounting system which publishes a directory as well as balances visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss of value or units is absorbed equally by all members, which makes it a [[mutual credit]] exchange. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network, or they may spend first and earn later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn many countries, the distinction between LETS and [[timebanking]] is not clear, as many LETS use time as their unit of account.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAs per Linton's definition, LETS are generally considered to have the following five fundamental criteria:<ref name=\"LETS1\"/>\n* Cost of service: from the community for the community\n* Consent: there is no compulsion to trade\n* Disclosure: information about balances is available to all members\n* Equivalence to the national currency\n* No interest\n\nAccording to a 1996 survey by LetsLink UK, only 13% of LETS networks actually practise equivalence, with most groups establishing alternative systems of valuation \"in order to divorce [themselves] entirely from the mainstream economy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Croall | year=1997 | title=LETS Act Locally | publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation | isbn=0-903319-81-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Lang | year=1994 | title=LETS Work: Rebuilding the Local Economy | publisher=Grover Books | isbn=1-899233-00-8}}</ref> Michael Linton has stated that such systems are \"personal money\" networks rather than LETS.<ref name=\"LETS1\" />\n\n== Operation ==\nA list of services offered by network members is put together to create a LETS scheme, and trading takes place between members using a local currency. The LETS foundation is a virtual currency, a check book, a directory as well as a transparent accounting system built on trust and community regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=North |first1=Peter |title=Explorations in heterotopia: Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS) and the micropolitics of money and livelihood |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |date=1999 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201386 |doi=10.1068/d170069 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/d170069 |issn=0263-7758}}</ref>\nThe first LETS required nothing more than a telephone, an answering machine and a notebook.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/low/Ep45_final_lowbitrate.mp3 |title=Opening Money |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=2012-11-07}}</ref> Since then, there have been several attempts to improve the process with software, printed notes, and other familiar aspects of traditional currencies.\n# Local people set up an organization to trade between themselves, often paying a small membership fee to cover administration costs\n# Members maintain a directory of offers and wants to help facilitate trades\n# Upon trading, members may 'pay' each other with printed notes, log the transaction in log books or online, or  write cheques which are later cleared by the system accountant.\n# Members whose balances exceed specified limits (positive or negative) are obliged to move their balance back towards zero by spending or earning.\n\nLETS is a full-fledged monetary or exchange system, unlike direct [[barter (economics)|barter]]. LETS members are able to earn credits from any member and spend them with anyone else on the scheme. Since the details are worked out by the users, there is much variation between schemes.\n\nLETS is not a scheme for avoiding the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax.  In a number of countries, various government taxation authorities have examined LETS along with other forms of [[counter trade]], and made rulings concerning their use. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Generally for personal arrangements, social arrangements, hobbies or pastimes, there are no taxation implications.  This generally covers the vast majority of LETS transactions.{{Disputed inline|Tax|date=May 2010}}  Taxation liabilities accrue when a [[tradesperson]] or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units.  In such cases, the businesses are generally encouraged to sell the service or product partly for LETS units and partly in the national currency, to allow the payment of all required taxation. This does imply, however, that in situations where national-currency expenditures would be tax-deductible, LETS must be as well.\n\nIn a number of countries, LETS have been encouraged as a social security initiative.  For example, in Australia, [[Peter Baldwin (politician)|Peter Baldwin]], a former Minister of Social Security in the Keating government, encouraged LETS as a way of letting welfare recipients borrow against their welfare entitlement for urgent personal needs or to establish themselves in business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nSince their commencement over 30 years ago, LETS have been highly innovative in adapting to the needs of their local communities in all kinds of ways.  For example, in Australia, people have built houses using LETS in place of a bank [[mortgage loan|mortgage]], freeing the owner from onerous interest payments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n== Benefits ==\nLETS can help [[community building|revitalise and build community]] by allowing a wider cross-section of the [[community]]\u2014individuals, small businesses, local services and [[Non-profit organization|voluntary group]]s\u2014to save money and resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal of this approach is to stimulate the economies of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.\nThe environmental benefits of enhanced locals' self-reliance involve less-distance transport (as local goods are substituted for imports) and more evident environmental effects. Moreover, diverse local economies support sustainability by decreasing the need to use assets in an inefficient manner to satisfy external consumer demands. That also requires improving the local [[Quality_of_life]] without having to make expenditures.  There is no doubt that LETS allow much greater self-direction and flexibility in employment patterns than the [[Traditional_economy]] and, in particular, enable the skills of the unemployed to be valued and used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seyfang |first1=Gill J. |title=Local Exchange Trading Systems and Sustainable Development |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |date=1 March 1996 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201345 |doi=10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457?journalCode=venv20 |issn=0013-9157}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nEven though LETS are strongly oriented towards the formal market economy, they disengage from it by establishing small, cooperative exchange enclaves in which trust and intimacy relationships are cultivated.

Interest in [[local currency]] moved on to other designs such as [[time-based currency]] and dollar-backed local voucher schemes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Internet networks===\nOn the whole, the movement was slow to adapt to the internet and to the possibility of networking together. Reluctance to engage with technology, a belief in decentralisation/localisation and lack of funds all contributed to this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nExamples of LETS networks based on free software are the [[Cape Town]]-based [[Community Exchange System]] (CES), which {{as of|lc=yes|March 2019}} links to the [[Geneva]]-based Community Forge<ref>[http://communityforge.net/ CommunityForge]</ref> and [[Spain|Spanish]]  IntegralCES.<ref>[http://integralces.net/]</ref><ref name=CESstats/>\n\n== Criteria ==\n\nLETS networks facilitate exchange between members by providing a directory of offers and needs and by allowing a line of [[interest]]-free credit to each. Members' [[IOU]]s are logged in a centralised accounting system which publishes a directory as well as balances visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss of value or units is absorbed equally by all members, which makes it a [[mutual credit]] exchange. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network, or they may spend first and earn later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn many countries, the distinction between LETS and [[timebanking]] is not clear, as many LETS use time as their unit of account.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAs per Linton's definition, LETS are generally considered to have the following five fundamental criteria:<ref name=\"LETS1\"/>\n* Cost of service: from the community for the community\n* Consent: there is no compulsion to trade\n* Disclosure: information about balances is available to all members\n* Equivalence to the national currency\n* No interest\n\nAccording to a 1996 survey by LetsLink UK, only 13% of LETS networks actually practise equivalence, with most groups establishing alternative systems of valuation \"in order to divorce [themselves] entirely from the mainstream economy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Croall | year=1997 | title=LETS Act Locally | publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation | isbn=0-903319-81-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Lang | year=1994 | title=LETS Work: Rebuilding the Local Economy | publisher=Grover Books | isbn=1-899233-00-8}}</ref> Michael Linton has stated that such systems are \"personal money\" networks rather than LETS.<ref name=\"LETS1\" />\n\n== Operation ==\nA list of services offered by network members is put together to create an LETS scheme, and trading takes place between members using a local currency. The LETS foundation is a virtual currency, a check book, a directory as well as a transparent accounting system built on trust and community regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=North |first1=Peter |title=Explorations in heterotopia: Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS) and the micropolitics of money and livelihood |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |date=1999 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201386 |doi=10.1068/d170069 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/d170069 |issn=0263-7758}}</ref>\nThe first LETS required nothing more than a telephone, an answering machine and a notebook.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/low/Ep45_final_lowbitrate.mp3 |title=Opening Money |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=2012-11-07}}</ref> Since then, there have been several attempts to improve the process with software, printed notes, and other familiar aspects of traditional currencies.\n# Local people set up an organization to trade between themselves, often paying a small membership fee to cover administration costs\n# Members maintain a directory of offers and wants to help facilitate trades\n# Upon trading, members may 'pay' each other with printed notes, log the transaction in log books or online, or  write cheques which are later cleared by the system accountant.\n# Members whose balances exceed specified limits (positive or negative) are obliged to move their balance back towards zero by spending or earning.\n\nLETS is a full-fledged monetary or exchange system, unlike direct [[barter (economics)|barter]]. LETS members are able to earn credits from any member and spend them with anyone else on the scheme. Since the details are worked out by the users, there is much variation between schemes.\n\nLETS is not a scheme for avoiding the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax.  In a number of countries, various government taxation authorities have examined LETS along with other forms of [[counter trade]], and made rulings concerning their use. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Generally for personal arrangements, social arrangements, hobbies or pastimes, there are no taxation implications.  This generally covers the vast majority of LETS transactions.{{Disputed inline|Tax|date=May 2010}}  Taxation liabilities accrue when a [[tradesperson]] or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units.  In such cases, the businesses are generally encouraged to sell the service or product partly for LETS units and partly in the national currency, to allow the payment of all required taxation. This does imply, however, that in situations where national-currency expenditures would be tax-deductible, LETS must be as well.\n\nIn a number of countries, LETSystems have been encouraged as a social security initiative.  For example, in Australia, [[Peter Baldwin (politician)|Peter Baldwin]], a former Minister of Social Security in the Keating government, encouraged LETSystems as a way of letting welfare recipients borrow against their welfare entitlement for urgent personal needs or to establish themselves in business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nSince its commencement over 30 years ago, LETSystems have been highly innovative in adapting to the needs of their local communities in all kinds of ways.  For example, in Australia, people have built houses using LETS in place of a bank [[mortgage loan|mortgage]], freeing the owner from onerous interest payments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n== Benefits ==\nLETS can help [[community building|revitalise and build community]] by allowing a wider cross-section of the [[community]]\u2014individuals, small businesses, local services and [[Non-profit organization|voluntary group]]s\u2014to save money and resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal of this approach is to stimulate the economies of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.\nThe environmental benefits of enhanced locals' self-reliance involve less-distance transport (as local goods are substituted for imports) and more evident environmental effects. Moreover, diverse local economies support sustainability by decreasing the need to use assets in an inefficient manner to satisfy external consumer demands. That also requires improving the local [[Quality_of_life]] without having to make wash expenditures.  There is no doubt that LETS allows much greater self-direction and flexibility in employment patterns than the [[Traditional_economy]] and, in particular, unable the skills of the unemployed to be valued and used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seyfang |first1=Gill J. |title=Local Exchange Trading Systems and Sustainable Development |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |date=1 March 1996 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201345 |doi=10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457?journalCode=venv20 |issn=0013-9157}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nEven though LETS are strongly oriented towards the formal market economy, they disengage from it by establishing small, cooperative exchange enclaves in which trust and intimacy relationships.

He then had a fifth-place finish at Dover.\n\nBusch's bad luck at Kansas continued in the fall. Both he and brother Kurt wrecked their primary cars in practice, forcing both to start from the back of the field in backup cars. While Kurt managed to charge through the field to finish second, Kyle spun out on the first lap trying to avoid a wrecking [[Danica Patrick]] and [[David Reutimann]] in turn 1. Busch then had to struggle with a poor handling racecar for most of the day. On lap 188, Busch was spun by [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] in turn 4. 12 laps later, on a restart from [[Marcos Ambrose]]'s spin, Busch's day was ended prematurely when he was tapped by [[Carl Edwards]] and turned into [[Brian Vickers]], then shot up head-on into the turn 2 wall, destroying the front part of his car and leaving him with a 34th-place finish. Despite this, Busch finished fourth in the final points, his best career point finish at the time.\n\n====2014====\nIn 2014, Busch announced that he would drive the No. 54 car part-time in the Nationwide Series for Joe Gibbs Racing, splitting the ride with [[Sam Hornish, Jr.]]<ref name=foxsports1514>{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Lee|title=Sources: Hornish to share car with Kyle Busch in Nationwide Series|publisher=Fox Sports|date=January 5, 2014|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/sam-hornish-joe-gibbs-racing-share-54-car-kyle-busch-nationwide-series-010513#!rsdXP|accessdate=January 5, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106134303/http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/sam-hornish-joe-gibbs-racing-share-54-car-kyle-busch-nationwide-series-010513#!rsdXP|archivedate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> He also stated that he would drive the No. 51 truck part-time for 10 races in the Camping World Truck Series, with [[Erik Jones]] driving the other 12.<ref name=kbm12314>{{cite web|title=Erik Jones and Kyle Busch to Share Driving Duties for the Defending Truck Series Owner's Champions|date=January 23, 2014|publisher=Kyle Busch Motosports|url=http://www.kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=1027|accessdate=January 24, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204018/http://www.kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=1027|archivedate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nKyle Busch's first highlight of the season came at Daytona in the NASCAR truck series race. He took the lead half-way in the 100 lap event, after leader Ben Kennedy (grandson of Bill France Jr.) ran out of gas. He led 25 laps and [[Timothy Peters]] got by Busch with 5 laps to go. With help from [[Ron Hornaday Jr.]] and [[Ryan Truex]], Busch used a high-line move, to beat Peters by an inch for the win in a [[photo-finish]].\n\nKyle Busch led some laps during the Daytona 500 and was running 4th on the final lap but got collected in an accident involving former arch rival Kevin Harvick. Harvick apologized for causing the wreck, but he and Busch both called out the track for not having safer-barriers in the front-stretch. Busch hinted in a post-race interview that the wreck was the hardest impact he's ever had in a race-car.\n\nThe next week at Phoenix, Busch ran second with 65 laps to go, but he and then leader Ryan Newman lost their shot at the win when they had to pit during an untimely caution. Despite this, Ryan Newman and Busch were able to recover to finish in the top ten.\n\nOn March 23, 2014 at Auto Club Speedway, Busch started 14th and was running fifth on the final restart. His older brother Kurt Busch appeared to have the win locked up, but Kurt and Tony Stewart got into an aggressive battle for the lead that resulted in Busch catching up to the leaders and passing for the win on the final lap. Busch held off rookie Kyle Larson for the win after passing Kurt Busch and Stewart.\n\nAt Richmond, Busch finished 3rd after an amazing charge from 16th place to 3rd in the final restart thanks to 4 fresh tires. At Talladega, Busch appeared to have a dominant car, but he was collected in a multi-car pileup caused when [[Brad Keselowski]] controversially raced aggressively while 6 laps down. Having seen Brad call out teammate [[Matt Kenseth]] for aggressive driving at Richmond the previous week, Busch and several other drivers were furious with Keselowski in their post-wreck interviews. Keselowski apologized for his role in the accident.\n\nAt Charlotte in the All-Star Race, Busch controlled the race early. He won $50,000 for winning segment No. 1 but got into an early accident in the second segment collecting [[Joey Logano]]. While racing hard with older brother Kurt, Kyle got into Clint Bowyer and spun out; came back down and was hit hard by Logano. It resembled his 2013 spring Kansas wreck. Busch famously climbed out and tried to walk to the infield hospital by himself to gain his composure but an ambulance picked him up escorting him to the hospital.\n\nKyle Busch also had a good Nationwide series season. He shared the No. 54 with [[Sam Hornish Jr.]] bringing the 54 to victory many times. Busch took the win at Phoenix holding off former rival Kevin Harvick. The rain delayed the race finish forcing it to be called official therefore giving Busch the win. He took the checkers at Bristol by holding off Kyle Larson in a re-run of the 2013 Bristol race. He then ended [[Joey Logano]]'s Dover streak by winning the Dover NNS race on May 31, 2014 edging [[Trevor Bayne]] by 9 seconds (29 car-lengths) after a side-by-side battle with Bayne with 20\u201315 laps to go.\n\nDuring the spring and early summer, Busch had great results in the truck series. In the first 5 races he entered he dominated and won. Busch led the most laps in 4 of the races. Four of the races were also won after starting on the pole.\n\nIn June 2014 Busch led 31 laps of the Quaker State 400 but got passed by Brad Keselowski with 16 laps to go. Busch finished second but said in an interview that after his 10-week streak of bad luck the runner-up felt like a win to him. The runner-up returned Busch to the top ten in points after being ranked 12th before the Kentucky event.\n\nAt Daytona Busch ran in the top ten all day long. However \"the big one\" struck after half-way into the race. Busch got clipped by [[Justin Allgaier]] and [[Denny Hamlin]]. He then got crushed and t-boned by [[Cole Whitt]] causing him to flip over onto his roof. Busch was mostly unscathed. Busch recovered from the bad finish by winning the pole a week later for the [[Camping World RV Sales 301]], a race at a track he's finished second at many times and won in 2006. Busch finished second to Brad Keselowski.\n\nAt the Brickyard 400 Busch finished second for a second consecutive time while [[Jeff Gordon]] pulled away to win. He then had a streak of 4 races with 36th or less finishes. At Bristol Busch appeared to have a dominant car but got into a multi-car wreck on lap 117 after leading many laps. He then broke down because of axle issues. He and his crew chief David Rogers argued on their radios as Busch went to the garages with Rogers telling Busch to ''\"take your whiny little ass to the bus.\"'' Rogers later apologized for his comments when it was figured out that Rogers only thought Busch was complaining because of miscommunication due to radio issues.\n\nAt Atlanta the next week Busch and [[Martin Truex Jr.]] wrecked while racing with 3 laps to go bringing out a caution. Busch and Truex exchanged heated words in the garages. Busch made the Chase for a second consecutive year. At Chicago Busch won the truck race despite 2 errors. Busch led 46 laps at Chicago and finished 7th.\n\nBusch came to Kansas nervous, after a history of struggles and bad luck. Despite this, Busch won the Nationwide race, and finished 3rd in the Cup race the next day. His luck ran out just as the checkered flag fell, his engine expired immediately after the 400 miles were completed. Busch stated after the race that the third-place finish at his worst race-track felt like a championship to him.\n\nBusch made it to the second round of the first elimination-format Chase and while he was 2nd in points coming in to Talladega, a crash on lap 103, where he was rear-ended by rookie Austin [[Austin Dillon|Dillon]], eliminated him from contention due to a 40th-place finish which dropped him to 10th (below the 8th-place cutline).\n\nBusch's results in the Chase spiraled downward after he did not make it to the next round but went on to finish 10th in the standings. He won a Nationwide race at Kansas and almost won a Nationwide race at Phoenix, but got passed by [[Brad Keselowski]] on the final lap. Busch's [[Kyle Busch Motorsports|truck series operation]] won the most races in 2014 for the truck series and he won the owner's championship for a second consecutive time. When his truck driver/teammate [[Darrell Wallace Jr.]] celebrated the race win on the track, Wallace joined his buddy/boss on the front-stretch doing donuts together.\n\nBusch finished 10th in the 2014 Cup series standings.\n\n====2015: First championship====\nBusch and crew chief [[Dave Rogers (NASCAR)|Dave Rogers]] parted ways at the end of the 2014 season. In the offseason shuffle of crew chiefs, Busch was paired with his Xfinity Series crew chief [[Adam Stevens (NASCAR)|Adam Stevens]]. Dave Rogers was transferred over to [[Denny Hamlin]], while Hamlin's previous crew chief [[Darian Grubb]] was transferred over to newly recruited [[Carl Edwards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New Crew Chiefs Announced for Kyle Busch in 2015|publisher=KyleBusch.com|date=December 4, 2014|url=http://www.kylebusch.com/news/entry.php?nid=1307|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121043349/http://www.kylebusch.com/news/entry.php?nid=1307|archivedate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> In late January 2015, Busch was accidentally criticized by [[Keith Olbermann]] for brother Kurt's domestic violence case, being mistaken for Kurt.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianchi|first=Jordan|title=Kyle Busch upset about being mistaken for older brother, Kurt|work=SBNation|date=January 26, 2015|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/1/26/7918735/kyle-busch-keith-olbermann-kurt-busch-patricia-driscoll-domestic-assualt|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201201144/http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/1/26/7918735/kyle-busch-keith-olbermann-kurt-busch-patricia-driscoll-domestic-assualt|archivedate=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn February 10, 2015, Busch announced that he would skip the truck series race at Daytona to focus on racing in the Daytona 500. During the second Budweiser Duel, Busch dominated the first half of the race. However he was called for a stop-and-go-penalty for speeding exiting pit road. He restarted the second half of the race in 23rd spot. He came back to the front of the field within 15 laps of the penalty, finishing second behind former Hendrick Motorsports teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]].\n\n=====Daytona injury=====\nOn February 21, 2015, Busch was involved in a multi-car accident with eight laps to go during the Xfinity Series race at [[Daytona International Speedway]]. The accident happened exiting the tri-oval, and Kyle Busch bounced off Kyle Larson and slid down into the infield grass and slammed into a concrete wall head-on with no SAFER barriers, Busch climbed out of his race car with the help of medical and on-track officials. He laid on the ground before being placed on a stretcher as medical personnel attended to his right leg. He later was transported to [[Halifax Medical Center]] for further evaluation. A few hours later, the diagnosis was found to be a massive [[compound fracture]] in the lower right leg, a small fracture in the left foot, and a sprained left finger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/02/21/kyle-busch-injured-multicar-crash-xfinity-series-daytona/23809443/|title=Kyle Busch breaks right leg, left foot, out indefinitely|date=February 22, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=December 18, 2015|location=McLean, VA|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127044008/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/02/21/kyle-busch-injured-multicar-crash-xfinity-series-daytona/23809443/|archivedate=November 27, 2015}}</ref> Busch did receive a medical waiver by NASCAR, enabling him to run for the championship even with his injury layoff, so long as he could qualify under playoff rules.\n\n=====Return=====\nOn May 12, 2015, Busch announced on Twitter that he would return to NASCAR at the [[Sprint All-Star Race]] at Charlotte on May 16, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|title=Kyle Busch to return for Sprint All-Star Race at Charlotte|publisher=ESPN|date=May 12, 2015|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/12871175/kyle-busch-return-sprint-all-star-race-11-race-absence|accessdate=May 12, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515022936/http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/12871175/kyle-busch-return-sprint-all-star-race-11-race-absence|archivedate=May 15, 2015}}</ref> On June 13, 2015, nearly four months after his injury, he won the Xfinity Series race at Michigan in his second start of the season. In order to make the Chase in 2015, Busch needed to be in the Top 30 in points and have one win in the Sprint Cup Series.\n\n[[File:TSM - Kyle Busch - 2015 - Stierch - 11.jpg|thumb|left|Busch racing at Sonoma Raceway in 2015]][[File:5 Hour Energy DSC 0121 (19270455634).jpg|thumb|right|Busch racing at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in 2015]]\nOn return to the Sprint Cup Series, Busch had an up-and-down season. In the Coca-Cola 600, he finished 11th. At Dover, he was running well until he was caught up in a late race crash and finished 36th. He then finished ninth at Pocono. At Michigan, Busch lost control of his car and cracked the wall, wrecking his car and finishing dead last. At Sonoma, Busch won after a late race caution put him on fresher tires than leader [[Jimmie Johnson]]. A few laps later, Busch was leading over brother [[Kurt Busch]] and [[Clint Bowyer]]. Their race against each other for second place allowed Busch to keep enough distance to hold first place. He had built up just enough time to come in first knowing that his brother had passed Bowyer and was quickly gaining on him.  On July 11, 2015, Busch won at [[Kentucky Speedway|Kentucky]], making him only 87 points from breaking the top 30 in points, and be eligible to enter the Chase.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kyle Busch Chase Watch {{!}} NASCAR.com|url = http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/7/11/kyle-busch-chase-watch-what-he-needs-to-make-postseason.html|accessdate = July 12, 2015|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150714080402/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/7/11/kyle-busch-chase-watch-what-he-needs-to-make-postseason.html|archivedate = July 14, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> It also denied [[Jeff Gordon]]'s quest to win at least once on every active NASCAR tracks in his final season as a full-time driver.

A caution was later thrown, ultimately putting Busch in the lead with 44 laps to go, where he would not be challenged at all in the remaining laps. The race ended under caution when [[Alex Bowman]] smacked the wall off turn 2 as a result of a blown tire on the last lap. This was Busch's third victory in the past four races in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. He also fended off [[Brad Keselowski]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] for the win. In the next race at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], he won the prestigious [[Brickyard 400]] and put himself 23 points behind the cutoff for the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. He also completed the sweep for the weekend after winning the Xfinity race the day before and won three Cup Series races in a row for the first time in his career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3kcSUjFcC4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713153525/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3kcSUjFcC4|url-status=dead|title=RACE RECAP: Busch beats Blaney to the bricks|date=July 25, 2015|archivedate=July 13, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nBusch clinched his spot in the Chase with one race left. Busch, with two top tens during the first round of the Chase advanced to round two. However his hopes to advance to the next round took a heavy hit during the race at Charlotte. After running second to teammate Matt Kenseth for most of the race, Busch and [[Kyle Larson]] collided while entering pit road, spinning Larson and eliminating both from contention for the race win. Busch hit the wall several times during the final 50 laps due to oil on the race-track from the No. 51 driven by [[Justin Allgaier]] who had lost a transmission after an on-track collision. After the race Busch and several other competitors such as [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] criticized NASCAR for allowing the drivers to race in oil during the final 50 laps.\n\nOn November 15, 2015, Busch clinched a spot to stay in contention as the Championship Four for the final Chase at Homestead. On November 20, 2015, Kyle Busch Motorsports's [[Erik Jones]] won the Camping World Truck Series championship, making Busch the owners champion. He was named to the Championship 4, mainly competing against Jeff Gordon. On November 22, 2015, Busch won the [[2015 Ford EcoBoost 400|Ford EcoBoost 400]] to win his first ever Cup Series championship. Busch ended the season with five wins, twelve top fives, and sixteen top tens, despite racing in only 25 of 36 races.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyle Busch wins first Sprint Cup Series championship|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=November 22, 2015|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/11/22/kyle-busch-sprint-cup-champion-2015.html|accessdate=November 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123131225/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/11/22/kyle-busch-sprint-cup-champion-2015.html|archivedate=November 23, 2015}}</ref> The Championship win is arguably the most controversial due to Busch missing several races at the beginning and some thought he didn't deserve a Chase spot because of that.\n\n====2016====\nBefore the 2016 season started, Busch announced that he would no longer race in [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]] or [[Camping World Truck Series]] restrictor plate races because of his Daytona crash in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/19/kyle-busch-not-running-restrictor-plate-races-in-trucks-xfinity.html|title=KYLE BUSCH: NO MORE XFINITY, TRUCK RESTRICTOR-PLATE RACES|work=NASCAR.com|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=November 17, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225094814/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/19/kyle-busch-not-running-restrictor-plate-races-in-trucks-xfinity.html|archivedate=December 25, 2016}}</ref> Busch started his season off with a 17th-place finish in the [[2016 Sprint Unlimited|Sprint Unlimited]], crashing with less than 5 laps left in the race. He won his [[2016 Can-Am Duels|Can-Am Duel]] and started on the front row of the [[2016 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] after his teammate [[Matt Kenseth]], who qualified second for the 500, wrecked his car in the Duel and was forced to start from the back of the field. Busch finished 3rd in the 500. After the Daytona 500, Busch stated that he could \"obtain 200 wins from all three national touring series combined\" before he retires, which would tie [[Richard Petty]]'s record. On February 27, 2016, Busch won the Xfinity Series' [[Heads Up Georgia 250]] at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]. The next week, Busch led all but one lap at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] to win the [[Boyd Gaming 300]]. That same race, he led his 16,000th career Xfinity Series lap just before a red flag came out around lap 163.\n\nDuring the [[2016 Kobalt 400]], Busch was leading with 13 laps to go, and seemed to be the eventual winner, when he reported a vibration on his right front tire, thinking it was going to shred. He fell behind [[Brad Keselowski]], [[Joey Logano]], and [[Jimmie Johnson]], finishing fourth at his hometown track. He had started 23rd in that same race. At Phoenix, Busch earned his third Xfinity Series win in a row, making it his 79th career victory (led 175 of 200 laps). The next day, he started on the pole at the [[2016 Good Sam 500|Good Sam 500]] and finished fourth.\n\nWhile leading the final lap of the [[TreatMyClot.com 300]] at [[Auto Club Speedway]], Busch ran over a piece of debris, blowing his left front tire. He lost the lead to Joe Gibbs Racing teammate [[Daniel Su\u00e1rez]], who ran out of fuel, allowing Busch to re-take the lead on only three tires, though in the final corner, Austin Dillon was able to get by Busch and win the race. Kyle Busch made remarks about how NASCAR did not throw the caution, causing speculations that he had stated that NASCAR rigged the race. With his radio statements (plus refusing to do media and press interviews, as well as response to Austin Dillon claiming he tried to wreck him), Kyle Busch was fined $10,000 and was put on probation for 4 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/kyle-busch-danica-patrick-cole-pearn-penalties-sprint-cup-series-auto-club-speedway-032416|title=Kyle Busch, Danica Patrick fined and placed on probation for actions at Fontana|last=Jensen|first=Tom|website=FOX Sports|access-date=April 3, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410122356/http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/kyle-busch-danica-patrick-cole-pearn-penalties-sprint-cup-series-auto-club-speedway-032416|archivedate=April 10, 2016}}</ref> Busch rumorly apologized to NASCAR, yet was not confirmed.\n\nAfter coming back from Easter/Spring Break and the incident at Auto Club, Kyle Busch started 2nd and finished 1st in the [[Camping World Truck Series|NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]] race at Martinsville, his first ever win at the track in any touring series (31st attempt).

The Xfinity Cup win was his 80th overall in the series, and his 160th in all 3 top NASCAR touring series combined (which he extended at the Cup race at Texas the following day). The win in the Sprint Cup Series placed him 1st in the standings.\n\n[[File:M&M's World Las Vegas NASCAR car.jpg|thumb|Busch's 2016 car at the [[M&M's World]] location on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]]]\nThe next week at Bristol Motor Speedway, however, was brutal for Busch. Following a 2nd-place finish in the Xfinity race, he had a 38th-place finish in the Cup race due to multiple tire failures. The following week, Busch was passed by teammate Carl Edwards on the final lap at the Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond, finishing 2nd to him. At Talladega, Busch avoided several wrecks to finish second to Brad Keselowski. That race was his 400th career race, 1 day prior to his birthday. During post-race interviews, Busch showed his displeasure at NASCAR for racing at super-speedway tracks like Daytona and Talladega, stating \"It sucks. I'd rather be at home.\" He and many other drivers would express their issues of safety and how they raced there due to 3 cars flipping upside-down and 4 \"Big Ones\", causing 35 of the 40 cars in the field to have damage or be involved in a crash.\nAt the [[2016 Go Bowling 400|Go Bowling 400]] at Kansas, Busch led the final 40 laps on pit strategy to win the race ahead of former rival Kevin Harvick after affiliate driver Martin Truex Jr., the polesitter and dominant car of the race, like at Texas, had pit issues, failing to secure all 5 lug nuts in the pit stop. Martin Truex Jr. had to pit twice to fix the issue, resulting in a 14th-place finish. It was Busch's first win at Kansas, a track where he has had 4 DNFs and only 1 top 5 at prior to the start of the race, and he also became the first driver of 2016 to score three wins. He remained with 2 tracks he had yet to win at: Charlotte Motor Speedway and Pocono Raceway.\n\nAfter his win at Kansas, Busch had a rough stretch of races, having 4 finishes of 30th or worse. After a 40th-place finish at Michigan, Busch and the #18 team regrouped during the off-week and got a solid 7th-place finish at Sonoma Raceway.\n\nThe following week at Daytona, Busch finished second to race winner [[Brad Keselowski]]. He finished second despite being in a backup car after a hard practice crash before qualifying. The next week at [[Kentucky Speedway]], Busch won the Xfinity race at Kentucky. The following day in the Cup race, Busch finished 12th in the fuel mileage race, despite being in the top 5 late before pitting for fuel. The next week at New Hampshire, Busch once again won the Xfinity race. The next day, Busch led the most laps, but faltered on late restarts and finished 8th behind race winner and teammate [[Matt Kenseth]].\n\nThe following week at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], Busch made NASCAR history as the first driver to sweep both poles and both races in the same weekend at the same track. In the Xfinity Series [[Lilly Diabetes 250]], Busch dominated the race leading almost every lap and winning the race from the pole. It was his third Xfinity Series victory in a row and 83rd victory in the series. The following day in the [[2016 Brickyard 400|Brickyard 400]], Busch dominated the race, leading 149 of the 170 laps and after surviving several late restarts, Busch won his second consecutive Brickyard 400. It was his 38th career Cup Series victory, 4th victory of the year, and 2nd career victory at Indianapolis.\n\nBusch dominated the Bristol race in August. He led 57% of the whole race leading for 252 of the first 419 laps. However, Busch began having handling problems during the final quarter of the race and it was enough to send him to the garages. On his way to the garages, however, Busch got t-boned by a crashing [[Justin Allgaier]], driving a one-off race for [[HScott Motorsports]], taking him out of the race. Busch expressed discontent with Allgaier and Allgaier's spotter in his post-race interview, calling them \"The biggest morons out there.\"\n\nBusch went on to make the Championship Four at Homestead-Miami Speedway and finish third in the standings.\n\n====2017====\nBusch started the 2017 season on a slow note when he wrecked in the [[2017 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] after his rear tire lost air, spinning him and collecting race leader [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]]. In his interview, Busch criticized [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]'s tires, saying they \"aren't very good at holding air.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Martinelli|first=Michelle|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/nascar-daytona-500-crash-wreck-dale-earnhardt-jr-kyle-busch-out|title=Kyle Busch blasts Goodyear following race-ending Daytona 500 crash|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 26, 2017|accessdate=March 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322203802/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/nascar-daytona-500-crash-wreck-dale-earnhardt-jr-kyle-busch-out|archivedate=March 22, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Kyle Busch 2017 Toyota Save Mart 350 qualifying.jpg|thumb|Busch during qualifying for the [[2017 Toyota/Save Mart 350]].]]\nIn the [[2017 Kobalt 400|Kobalt 400]] at Las Vegas, Busch collided with [[Joey Logano]] as the two battled for a top-five finish on the final lap.

Busch had led 1,000+ laps in 2017 coming to the second Pocono race in July, where he had yet to win. He started on the pole, led the most laps, and took the lead from [[Kevin Harvick]] for his 39th career victory. It was his first at Pocono and left [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] as the only track where Busch had yet to win at in the Cup Series. On August 19, 2017, Busch swept the weekend at Bristol Motor Speedway. He won all stages in the truck race on Wednesday and did the same in the Xfinity Series race on Friday.

Busch was able to win the truck series race at Las Vegas in his first time competing there in the truck series since 2001. With the win, Busch has now won at his home track in all 3 major touring series of NASCAR. Busch followed the win with back to back runner up finishes at Las Vegas and Phoenix in the cup series to [[Kevin Harvick]], even leading the most laps in the latter. He later finished third at Auto Club Speedway to [[Martin Truex Jr]] and finished second at Martinsville to [[Clint Bowyer]]. Busch won his first race of the season at Texas in April. He followed that win with another win at Bristol on a Monday after using a bump and run against [[Kyle Larson]] in the closing laps. \n\nBusch won his third straight race at Richmond after starting the race in 32nd, marking the first time he has won three in a row since July 2015 when he won Kentucky, New Hampshire, and the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pistone|first=Pete|authorlink=Pete Pistone|title=Kyle Busch Wins Third Straight|url=https://www.mrn.com/2018/04/21/kyle-busch-wins-third-straight/|website=MRN.com|publisher=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=April 22, 2018|date=April 21, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422202413/https://www.mrn.com/2018/04/21/kyle-busch-wins-third-straight/|archivedate=April 22, 2018}}</ref> Next at Talladega, he went as high as second, but went on to finish 13th.

At Daytona, Busch, was turned by [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]] resulting in a 33rd-place finish. Two weeks after Daytona, at New Hampshire, Busch, was moved in the final laps by Harvick having Busch finish 2nd. The next week Busch started at the back in 27th but finished 4th in Stage 1, then used pit strategy at before the end of Stage 2 to get in front of the dominate car of Kevin Harvick (who also started at the rear) and then held off [[Daniel Su\u00e1rez]] to win his 6th race of the year and second straight summer race at Pocono. In the final pit stop for the 18 team during Watkins Glen, the gas can had a malfunction to where fuel wasn't put into the car and forced Busch to pit before the green flag putting him as the last car on the lead lap. He rebounded to a 3rd-place finish. In the first laps of the Bristol Night race, a caution came out for Busch who spun exiting turn 4. After spending most of the race picking up laps, fixing the damage, and being 2 laps down, Busch was able to contend up in the Top 5. However, after an incident with Truex Jr. and later on Jimmie Johnson and Chris Buescher, he finished 20th. After the Brickyard 400 in September, which was the Regular Season Finale for the first time, he easily won the 2018 Regular Season Championship. Busch finally won his 50th career Cup Series race at Richmond. With the 50th win, Kyle Busch is the only driver in NASCAR history to reach 50+ wins in all 3 of the top touring series. After making it to the round of 8, Busch went on to win at Phoenix ([[ISM Raceway]]) for the first time since his rookie season in 2005, and secured his spot in the championship 4. He would go on to finish 4th in the final standings, with [[Joey Logano]] winning the championship.\n\n====2019: Second championship====\nBusch started the season with a 2nd-place finish in the Daytona 500, along with Truck Series wins at Atlanta, Las Vegas and Texas and Xfinity Series wins at Las Vegas, ISM Raceway, Texas, and Indianapolis. \n[[File:Kyle Busch celebrates his 95th NASCAR XFINITY Series win at the 2019 My Bariatric Solutions 300 at Texas Motor Speedway.jpg | thumb | right | alt= Kyle Busch celebrates his 95th NASCAR XFINITY Series win at the 2019 My Bariatric Solutions 300 at Texas Motor Speedway. |\nKyle Busch celebrates his 95th NASCAR XFINITY Series win at the 2019 My Bariatric Solutions 300 at Texas Motor Speedway.]]\nHis first Cup series win of the season came early in the fourth race of the schedule at ISM Raceway.

He stayed consistent throughout the whole entire summer to catch up with Logano for the Regular Season Championship. Following the [[2019 Bojangles' Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway]], Busch clinched his second consecutive Regular Season Championship with a third-place finish despite cutting a tire with less than 3 laps to go racing for the win, and riding the wall to finish.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/09/02/kyle-busch-clinches-regular-season-championship-darlington/ |title=Kyle Busch clinches regular-season championship at Darlington |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=September 2, 2019 |accessdate=September 2, 2019}}</ref> Despite an engine blow to end the day at Indianapolis, Busch claimed his second consecutive regular season championship and ended it with 21 top 10 finishes.\n\nBusch's playoffs was up and down. Las Vegas was mediocre as he wrecked a lapped car without avoiding it and finished 19th. Richmond was a rebound race as he was looking to win the race, but eventually got passed by Martin Truex Jr and wounded 2nd. He once again had a suspension issue at the Charlotte ROVAL and finished 37th. Despite that, the Round Of 12 looked more confident as he consistently finished in the top 6 at Dover. Things took a turn at Talladega as he got side-drafted by Stenhouse and wrecked causing the Big One and finished the race in the top 20. With all the bonus points and playoff points, he finished 3rd at Kansas Speedway to make it to the Round of 8. At Martinsville however, he had a run-in with Aric Almirola which gave him some damage and finished 14th as a result. After the race, it looked as though Almirola would end his playoff hopes. But it didn't happen as after finishing in the top 10 at Texas and a runner-up to his credit at ISM Raceway, he made the Championship 4 for the 5th season in a row. He then was 4th heading to Homestead as the underdog. After the green flag dropped, Busch dominated part of the race and won at Homestead for his second championship and won his second race at Homestead. This was his 5th win of the season, snapping A 21-race winless streak. In the process, his 2019 season saw him earn 5 wins, 17 top 5s, 27 top 10s, 1 pole, 1,582 laps led, an average finish of 8.9, and finished the season as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Champion. He also won both the Regular Season championship and the playoff for the first time in his career.\n\n====2020====\nBusch started the [[2020 NASCAR Cup Series|2020 season]] with a 34th place finish at the [[2020 Daytona 500]] after blowing an engine.\n\nOn February 22, 2020, after Busch won the [[Strat 200|Las Vegas Truck race]], [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Camping World]] CEO [[Marcus Lemonis]] offered a {{USD}}100,000 reward to any full-time Cup Series driver who can beat Busch in the Truck Series.

[[NASCAR Cup Series]], driving the No. 18 [[Toyota Camry]] for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]], part-time in the [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], driving the No. 54 [[Toyota Supra]] for JGR, and part-time in the [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]], driving the No. 51 [[Toyota Tundra]] for [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]]. KBM runs multiple trucks in the Truck Series and a Super Late Model team. Busch is the [[2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2009 Xfinity Series]] champion and the [[2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2015]] and [[2019 NASCAR Cup Series|2019]] NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nBusch is the younger brother of [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series]] champion [[Kurt Busch]]. He holds several records in NASCAR competition, including the most race wins in a season across the top three NASCAR series, with 24 wins, which he accomplished in 2010. He holds the record for most all-time wins in all three of NASCAR's national touring series with 209 (as of February 21, 2020). Furthermore, he holds the record for the most Xfinity Series wins in a season with 13 in 2010, and the most overall with 96. Busch also holds the record for most overall wins in the Truck Series with 57. As of 2019, he is the only driver in history to have 50+ wins in NASCAR's top 3 series. At Dover on May 6, 2019, he tied the record of consecutive top ten finishes to start a season by tying Morgan Shepherd with 11.\n\nAt age 19 years and 317 days, Busch became NASCAR's youngest ever pole winner in a Cup Series race at [[California Speedway]] in 2005. He is the youngest driver to qualify for the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup]], in 2006. Furthermore, Busch became the first driver to win a race and a championship in a Toyota in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]], winning at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] during the 2008 season and the 2015 Cup Series championship. Additionally, he is the only driver to win four straight spring races at [[Richmond International Raceway]] (2009&ndash;2012), and was also the inaugural winner of the first Cup Series race at [[Kentucky Speedway]], in 2011.\n\nBusch, who began his NASCAR career in 2003, is one of only five drivers that have [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Driver championships in two of the top divisions|won a championship in both]] the Sprint Cup Series and the Xfinity Series, and in 2005 became the 14th of only 28 drivers to [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Triple Threat|win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series]].  In 2009, Busch became the first driver to win two of NASCAR's top touring series races in the same day (at [[Auto Club Speedway]]), followed in 2010 as the first driver to win races in all three of NASCAR's top three touring series in the same weekend (at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]]), which he did again at the same track in 2017.\n\nWhen Busch won the [[2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2009]] [[Crown Royal Presents the Russell Friedman 400]] at Richmond International Raceway as he turned 24, he was the second of just three people to ever win on their birthday. His team, [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]], became the first [[Camping World Truck Series]] team to win the owners' championship in its first year after recording 8 wins, 16 top 5, and 21 top 10 finishes in 2010.\n\n==Early life and career==\nBusch was born in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. His first driving lessons came at the age of six when he drove around the [[cul-de-sac]] of his family's Las Vegas neighborhood in a makeshift [[go-kart]].<ref name=\"McGee1\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/7292336/nascar-kurt-busch-kyle-busch-stirring-pot|title=Busch brothers still stirring the pot|last=McGee|first=Ryan|date=November 29, 2011|work=[[ESPN The Magazine]]|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=September 2, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029212727/http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/7292336/nascar-kurt-busch-kyle-busch-stirring-pot|archivedate=October 29, 2013}}</ref> Although he could not reach the throttle, Busch still was able to pick up the basics from his father Tom, who controlled the gas pedal as Busch drove the vehicle.<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|url=http://joegibbsracing.com/kyle-busch-bio-continued/|title=Kyle Busch Bio Continued|publisher=Joe Gibbs Racing|accessdate=September 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200408/http://joegibbsracing.com/kyle-busch-bio-continued/|archivedate=October 29, 2013}}</ref> Busch worked in the family garage with his father and older brother [[Kurt Busch|Kurt]] as he grew, becoming [[car chief|crew chief]] for his brother's [[Modified racing#Dwarf cars|dwarf car]] team at age ten.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nBusch began his driving career in 1998, shortly after his 13th birthday; from 1999 through 2001, Busch won over 65 races in [[legends car racing]], winning two track championships at the [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] Bullring short-track, before moving to [[late model]]s;<ref name=\"Hometown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/mar/03/hometown-racer-wins-big/|title=Hometown racer wins big|date=March 3, 2009|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|accessdate=September 4, 2013|location=Las Vegas, NV|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129084231/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/mar/03/hometown-racer-wins-big/|archivedate=November 29, 2014}}</ref> Busch scored ten victories in late model competition at the Bullring during the 2001 season.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nAt the age of 16, Busch began competing in the [[NASCAR]] Craftsman Truck Series (now [[Gander Outdoors Truck Series]]), driving the No. 99 Ford for [[Roush Racing]] as a replacement for [[Nathan Haseleu]], who was released midway in the [[2001 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2001 season]].

He then had a fifth-place finish at Dover.\n\nBusch's bad luck at Kansas continued in the fall. Both he and brother Kurt wrecked their primary cars in practice, forcing both to start from the back of the field in backup cars. While Kurt managed to charge through the field to finish second, Kyle spun out on the first lap trying to avoid a wrecking [[Danica Patrick]] and [[David Reutimann]] in turn 1. Busch then had to struggle with a poor handling racecar for most of the day. On lap 188, Busch was spun by [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] in turn 4. 12 laps later, on a restart from [[Marcos Ambrose]]'s spin, Busch's day was ended prematurely when he was tapped by [[Carl Edwards]] and turned into [[Brian Vickers]], then shot up head-on into the turn 2 wall, destroying the front part of his car and leaving him with a 34th-place finish. Despite this, Busch finished fourth in the final points, his best career point finish at the time.\n\n====2014====\nIn 2014, Busch announced that he would drive the No. 54 car part-time in the Nationwide Series for Joe Gibbs Racing, splitting the ride with [[Sam Hornish, Jr.]]<ref name=foxsports1514>{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Lee|title=Sources: Hornish to share car with Kyle Busch in Nationwide Series|publisher=Fox Sports|date=January 5, 2014|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/sam-hornish-joe-gibbs-racing-share-54-car-kyle-busch-nationwide-series-010513#!rsdXP|accessdate=January 5, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106134303/http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/sam-hornish-joe-gibbs-racing-share-54-car-kyle-busch-nationwide-series-010513#!rsdXP|archivedate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> He also stated that he would drive the No. 51 truck part-time for 10 races in the Camping World Truck Series, with [[Erik Jones]] driving the other 12.<ref name=kbm12314>{{cite web|title=Erik Jones and Kyle Busch to Share Driving Duties for the Defending Truck Series Owner's Champions|date=January 23, 2014|publisher=Kyle Busch Motosports|url=http://www.kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=1027|accessdate=January 24, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204018/http://www.kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=1027|archivedate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nKyle Busch's first highlight of the season came at Daytona in the NASCAR truck series race. He took the lead half-way in the 100 lap event, after leader Ben Kennedy (grandson of Bill France Jr.) ran out of gas. He led 25 laps and [[Timothy Peters]] got by Busch with 5 laps to go. With help from [[Ron Hornaday Jr.]] and [[Ryan Truex]], Busch used a high-line move, to beat Peters by an inch for the win in a [[photo-finish]].\n\nKyle Busch led some laps during the Daytona 500 and was running 4th on the final lap but got collected in an accident involving former arch rival Kevin Harvick. Harvick apologized for causing the wreck, but he and Busch both called out the track for not having safer-barriers in the front-stretch. Busch hinted in a post-race interview that the wreck was the hardest impact he's ever had in a race-car.\n\nThe next week at Phoenix, Busch ran second with 65 laps to go, but he and then leader Ryan Newman lost their shot at the win when they had to pit during an untimely caution. Despite this, Ryan Newman and Busch were able to recover to finish in the top ten.\n\nOn March 23, 2014 at Auto Club Speedway, Busch started 14th and was running fifth on the final restart. His older brother Kurt Busch appeared to have the win locked up, but Kurt and Tony Stewart got into an aggressive battle for the lead that resulted in Busch catching up to the leaders and passing for the win on the final lap. Busch held off rookie Kyle Larson for the win after passing Kurt Busch and Stewart.\n\nAt Richmond, Busch finished 3rd after an amazing charge from 16th place to 3rd in the final restart thanks to 4 fresh tires. At Talladega, Busch appeared to have a dominant car, but he was collected in a multi-car pileup caused when [[Brad Keselowski]] controversially raced aggressively while 6 laps down. Having seen Brad call out teammate [[Matt Kenseth]] for aggressive driving at Richmond the previous week, Busch and several other drivers were furious with Keselowski in their post-wreck interviews. Keselowski apologized for his role in the accident.\n\nAt Charlotte in the All-Star Race, Busch controlled the race early. He won $50,000 for winning segment No. 1 but got into an early accident in the second segment collecting [[Joey Logano]]. While racing hard with older brother Kurt, Kyle got into Clint Bowyer and spun out; came back down and was hit hard by Logano. It resembled his 2013 spring Kansas wreck. Busch famously climbed out and tried to walk to the infield hospital by himself to gain his composure but an ambulance picked him up escorting him to the hospital.\n\nKyle Busch also had a good Nationwide series season. He shared the No. 54 with [[Sam Hornish Jr.]] bringing the 54 to victory many times. Busch took the win at Phoenix holding off former rival Kevin Harvick. The rain delayed the race finish forcing it to be called official therefore giving Busch the win. He took the checkers at Bristol by holding off Kyle Larson in a re-run of the 2013 Bristol race. He then ended [[Joey Logano]]'s Dover streak by winning the Dover NNS race on May 31, 2014 edging [[Trevor Bayne]] by 9 seconds (29 car-lengths) after a side-by-side battle with Bayne with 20\u201315 laps to go.\n\nDuring the spring and early summer, Busch had great results in the truck series. In the first 5 races he entered he dominated and won. Busch led the most laps in 4 of the races. Four of the races were also won after starting on the pole.\n\nIn June 2014 Busch led 31 laps of the Quaker State 400 but got passed by Brad Keselowski with 16 laps to go. Busch finished second but said in an interview that after his 10-week streak of bad luck the runner-up felt like a win to him. The runner-up returned Busch to the top ten in points after being ranked 12th before the Kentucky event.\n\nAt Daytona Busch ran in the top ten all day long. However \"the big one\" struck after half-way into the race. Busch got clipped by [[Justin Allgaier]] and [[Denny Hamlin]]. He then got crushed and t-boned by [[Cole Whitt]] causing him to flip over onto his roof. Busch was mostly unscathed. Busch recovered from the bad finish by winning the pole a week later for the [[Camping World RV Sales 301]], a race at a track he's finished second at many times and won in 2006. Busch finished second to Brad Keselowski.\n\nAt the Brickyard 400 Busch finished second for a second consecutive time while [[Jeff Gordon]] pulled away to win. He then had a streak of 4 races with 36th or less finishes. At Bristol Busch appeared to have a dominant car but got into a multi-car wreck on lap 117 after leading many laps. He then broke down because of axle issues. He and his crew chief David Rogers argued on their radios as Busch went to the garages with Rogers telling Busch to ''\"take your whiny little ass to the bus.\"'' Rogers later apologized for his comments when it was figured out that Rogers only thought Busch was complaining because of miscommunication due to radio issues.\n\nAt Atlanta the next week Busch and [[Martin Truex Jr.]] wrecked while racing with 3 laps to go bringing out a caution. Busch and Truex exchanged heated words in the garages. Busch made the Chase for a second consecutive year. At Chicago Busch won the truck race despite 2 errors. Busch led 46 laps at Chicago and finished 7th.\n\nBusch came to Kansas nervous, after a history of struggles and bad luck. Despite this, Busch won the Nationwide race, and finished 3rd in the Cup race the next day. His luck ran out just as the checkered flag fell, his engine expired immediately after the 400 miles were completed. Busch stated after the race that the third-place finish at his worst race-track felt like a championship to him.\n\nBusch made it to the second round of the first elimination-format Chase and while he was 2nd in points coming in to Talladega, a crash on lap 103, where he was rear-ended by rookie Austin [[Austin Dillon|Dillon]], eliminated him from contention due to a 40th-place finish which dropped him to 10th (below the 8th-place cutline).\n\nBusch's results in the Chase spiraled downward after he did not make it to the next round but went on to finish 10th in the standings. He won a Nationwide race at Kansas and almost won a Nationwide race at Phoenix, but got passed by [[Brad Keselowski]] on the final lap. Busch's [[Kyle Busch Motorsports|truck series operation]] won the most races in 2014 for the truck series and he won the owner's championship for a second consecutive time. When his truck driver/teammate [[Darrell Wallace Jr.]] celebrated the race win on the track, Wallace joined his buddy/boss on the front-stretch doing donuts together.\n\nBusch finished 10th in the 2014 Cup series standings.\n\n====2015: First championship====\nBusch and crew chief [[Dave Rogers (NASCAR)|Dave Rogers]] parted ways at the end of the 2014 season. In the offseason shuffle of crew chiefs, Busch was paired with his Xfinity Series crew chief [[Adam Stevens (NASCAR)|Adam Stevens]]. Dave Rogers was transferred over to [[Denny Hamlin]], while Hamlin's previous crew chief [[Darian Grubb]] was transferred over to newly recruited [[Carl Edwards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New Crew Chiefs Announced for Kyle Busch in 2015|publisher=KyleBusch.com|date=December 4, 2014|url=http://www.kylebusch.com/news/entry.php?nid=1307|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121043349/http://www.kylebusch.com/news/entry.php?nid=1307|archivedate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> In late January 2015, Busch was accidentally criticized by [[Keith Olbermann]] for brother Kurt's domestic violence case, being mistaken for Kurt.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianchi|first=Jordan|title=Kyle Busch upset about being mistaken for older brother, Kurt|work=SBNation|date=January 26, 2015|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/1/26/7918735/kyle-busch-keith-olbermann-kurt-busch-patricia-driscoll-domestic-assualt|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201201144/http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/1/26/7918735/kyle-busch-keith-olbermann-kurt-busch-patricia-driscoll-domestic-assualt|archivedate=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn February 10, 2015, Busch announced that he would skip the truck series race at Daytona to focus on racing in the Daytona 500. During the second Budweiser Duel, Busch dominated the first half of the race. However he was called for a stop-and-go-penalty for speeding exiting pit road. He restarted the second half of the race in 23rd spot. He came back to the front of the field within 15 laps of the penalty, finishing second behind former Hendrick Motorsports teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]].\n\n=====Daytona injury=====\nOn February 21, 2015, Busch was involved in a multi-car accident with eight laps to go during the Xfinity Series race at [[Daytona International Speedway]]. The accident happened exiting the tri-oval, and Kyle Busch bounced off Kyle Larson and slid down into the infield grass and slammed into a concrete wall head-on with no SAFER barriers, Busch climbed out of his race car with the help of medical and on-track officials. He laid on the ground before being placed on a stretcher as medical personnel attended to his right leg. He later was transported to [[Halifax Medical Center]] for further evaluation. A few hours later, the diagnosis was found to be a massive [[compound fracture]] in the lower right leg, a small fracture in the left foot, and a sprained left finger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/02/21/kyle-busch-injured-multicar-crash-xfinity-series-daytona/23809443/|title=Kyle Busch breaks right leg, left foot, out indefinitely|date=February 22, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=December 18, 2015|location=McLean, VA|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127044008/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/02/21/kyle-busch-injured-multicar-crash-xfinity-series-daytona/23809443/|archivedate=November 27, 2015}}</ref> Busch did receive a medical waiver by NASCAR, enabling him to run for the championship even with his injury layoff, so long as he could qualify under playoff rules.\n\n=====Return=====\nOn May 12, 2015, Busch announced on Twitter that he would return to NASCAR at the [[Sprint All-Star Race]] at Charlotte on May 16, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|title=Kyle Busch to return for Sprint All-Star Race at Charlotte|publisher=ESPN|date=May 12, 2015|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/12871175/kyle-busch-return-sprint-all-star-race-11-race-absence|accessdate=May 12, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515022936/http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/12871175/kyle-busch-return-sprint-all-star-race-11-race-absence|archivedate=May 15, 2015}}</ref> On June 13, 2015, nearly four months after his injury, he won the Xfinity Series race at Michigan in his second start of the season. In order to make the Chase in 2015, Busch needed to be in the Top 30 in points and have one win in the Sprint Cup Series.\n\n[[File:TSM - Kyle Busch - 2015 - Stierch - 11.jpg|thumb|left|Busch racing at Sonoma Raceway in 2015]][[File:5 Hour Energy DSC 0121 (19270455634).jpg|thumb|right|Busch racing at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in 2015]]\nOn return to the Sprint Cup Series, Busch had an up-and-down season. In the Coca-Cola 600, he finished 11th. At Dover, he was running well until he was caught up in a late race crash and finished 36th. He then finished ninth at Pocono. At Michigan, Busch lost control of his car and cracked the wall, wrecking his car and finishing dead last. At Sonoma, Busch won after a late race caution put him on fresher tires than leader [[Jimmie Johnson]]. A few laps later, Busch was leading over brother [[Kurt Busch]] and [[Clint Bowyer]]. Their race against each other for second place allowed Busch to keep enough distance to hold first place. He had built up just enough time to come in first knowing that his brother had passed Bowyer and was quickly gaining on him.  On July 11, 2015, Busch won at [[Kentucky Speedway|Kentucky]], making him only 87 points from breaking the top 30 in points, and be eligible to enter the Chase.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kyle Busch Chase Watch {{!}} NASCAR.com|url = http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/7/11/kyle-busch-chase-watch-what-he-needs-to-make-postseason.html|accessdate = July 12, 2015|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150714080402/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/7/11/kyle-busch-chase-watch-what-he-needs-to-make-postseason.html|archivedate = July 14, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> It also denied [[Jeff Gordon]]'s quest to win at least once on every active NASCAR tracks in his final season as a full-time driver.

A caution was later thrown, ultimately putting Busch in the lead with 44 laps to go, where he would not be challenged at all in the remaining laps. The race ended under caution when [[Alex Bowman]] smacked the wall off turn 2 as a result of a blown tire on the last lap. This was Busch's third victory in the past four races in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. He also fended off [[Brad Keselowski]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] for the win. In the next race at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], he won the prestigious [[Brickyard 400]] and put himself 23 points behind the cutoff for the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. He also completed the sweep for the weekend after winning the Xfinity race the day before and won three Cup Series races in a row for the first time in his career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3kcSUjFcC4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713153525/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3kcSUjFcC4|url-status=dead|title=RACE RECAP: Busch beats Blaney to the bricks|date=July 25, 2015|archivedate=July 13, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nBusch clinched his spot in the Chase with one race left. Busch, with two top tens during the first round of the Chase advanced to round two. However his hopes to advance to the next round took a heavy hit during the race at Charlotte. After running second to teammate Matt Kenseth for most of the race, Busch and [[Kyle Larson]] collided while entering pit road, spinning Larson and eliminating both from contention for the race win. Busch hit the wall several times during the final 50 laps due to oil on the race-track from the No. 51 driven by [[Justin Allgaier]] who had lost a transmission after an on-track collision. After the race Busch and several other competitors such as [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] criticized NASCAR for allowing the drivers to race in oil during the final 50 laps.\n\nOn November 15, 2015, Busch clinched a spot to stay in contention as the Championship Four for the final Chase at Homestead. On November 20, 2015, Kyle Busch Motorsports's [[Erik Jones]] won the Camping World Truck Series championship, making Busch the owners champion. He was named to the Championship 4, mainly competing against Jeff Gordon. On November 22, 2015, Busch won the [[2015 Ford EcoBoost 400|Ford EcoBoost 400]] to win his first ever Cup Series championship. Busch ended the season with five wins, twelve top fives, and sixteen top tens, despite racing in only 25 of 36 races.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyle Busch wins first Sprint Cup Series championship|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=November 22, 2015|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/11/22/kyle-busch-sprint-cup-champion-2015.html|accessdate=November 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123131225/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/11/22/kyle-busch-sprint-cup-champion-2015.html|archivedate=November 23, 2015}}</ref> The Championship win is arguably the most controversial due to Busch missing several races at the beginning and some thought he didn't deserve a Chase spot because of that.\n\n====2016====\nBefore the 2016 season started, Busch announced that he would no longer race in [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]] or [[Camping World Truck Series]] restrictor plate races because of his Daytona crash in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/19/kyle-busch-not-running-restrictor-plate-races-in-trucks-xfinity.html|title=KYLE BUSCH: NO MORE XFINITY, TRUCK RESTRICTOR-PLATE RACES|work=NASCAR.com|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=November 17, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225094814/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/19/kyle-busch-not-running-restrictor-plate-races-in-trucks-xfinity.html|archivedate=December 25, 2016}}</ref> Busch started his season off with a 17th-place finish in the [[2016 Sprint Unlimited|Sprint Unlimited]], crashing with less than 5 laps left in the race. He won his [[2016 Can-Am Duels|Can-Am Duel]] and started on the front row of the [[2016 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] after his teammate [[Matt Kenseth]], who qualified second for the 500, wrecked his car in the Duel and was forced to start from the back of the field. Busch finished 3rd in the 500. After the Daytona 500, Busch stated that he could \"obtain 200 wins from all three national touring series combined\" before he retires, which would tie [[Richard Petty]]'s record. On February 27, 2016, Busch won the Xfinity Series' [[Heads Up Georgia 250]] at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]. The next week, Busch led all but one lap at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] to win the [[Boyd Gaming 300]]. That same race, he led his 16,000th career Xfinity Series lap just before a red flag came out around lap 163.\n\nDuring the [[2016 Kobalt 400]], Busch was leading with 13 laps to go, and seemed to be the eventual winner, when he reported a vibration on his right front tire, thinking it was going to shred. He fell behind [[Brad Keselowski]], [[Joey Logano]], and [[Jimmie Johnson]], finishing fourth at his hometown track. He had started 23rd in that same race. At Phoenix, Busch earned his third Xfinity Series win in a row, making it his 79th career victory (led 175 of 200 laps). The next day, he started on the pole at the [[2016 Good Sam 500|Good Sam 500]] and finished fourth.\n\nWhile leading the final lap of the [[TreatMyClot.com 300]] at [[Auto Club Speedway]], Busch ran over a piece of debris, blowing his left front tire. He lost the lead to Joe Gibbs Racing teammate [[Daniel Su\u00e1rez]], who ran out of fuel, allowing Busch to re-take the lead on only three tires, though in the final corner, Austin Dillon was able to get by Busch and win the race. Kyle Busch made remarks about how NASCAR did not throw the caution, causing speculations that he had stated that NASCAR rigged the race. With his radio statements (plus refusing to do media and press interviews, as well as response to Austin Dillon claiming he tried to wreck him), Kyle Busch was fined $10,000 and was put on probation for 4 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/kyle-busch-danica-patrick-cole-pearn-penalties-sprint-cup-series-auto-club-speedway-032416|title=Kyle Busch, Danica Patrick fined and placed on probation for actions at Fontana|last=Jensen|first=Tom|website=FOX Sports|access-date=April 3, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410122356/http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/kyle-busch-danica-patrick-cole-pearn-penalties-sprint-cup-series-auto-club-speedway-032416|archivedate=April 10, 2016}}</ref> Busch rumorly apologized to NASCAR, yet was not confirmed.\n\nAfter coming back from Easter/Spring Break and the incident at Auto Club, Kyle Busch started 2nd and finished 1st in the [[Camping World Truck Series|NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]] race at Martinsville, his first ever win at the track in any touring series (31st attempt).

The Xfinity Cup win was his 80th overall in the series, and his 160th in all 3 top NASCAR touring series combined (which he extended at the Cup race at Texas the following day). The win in the Sprint Cup Series placed him 1st in the standings.\n\n[[File:M&M's World Las Vegas NASCAR car.jpg|thumb|Busch's 2016 car at the [[M&M's World]] location on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]]]\nThe next week at Bristol Motor Speedway, however, was brutal for Busch. Following a 2nd-place finish in the Xfinity race, he had a 38th-place finish in the Cup race due to multiple tire failures. The following week, Busch was passed by teammate Carl Edwards on the final lap at the Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond, finishing 2nd to him. At Talladega, Busch avoided several wrecks to finish second to Brad Keselowski. That race was his 400th career race, 1 day prior to his birthday. During post-race interviews, Busch showed his displeasure at NASCAR for racing at super-speedway tracks like Daytona and Talladega, stating \"It sucks. I'd rather be at home.\" He and many other drivers would express their issues of safety and how they raced there due to 3 cars flipping upside-down and 4 \"Big Ones\", causing 35 of the 40 cars in the field to have damage or be involved in a crash.\nAt the [[2016 Go Bowling 400|Go Bowling 400]] at Kansas, Busch led the final 40 laps on pit strategy to win the race ahead of former rival Kevin Harvick after affiliate driver Martin Truex Jr., the polesitter and dominant car of the race, like at Texas, had pit issues, failing to secure all 5 lug nuts in the pit stop. Martin Truex Jr. had to pit twice to fix the issue, resulting in a 14th-place finish. It was Busch's first win at Kansas, a track where he has had 4 DNFs and only 1 top 5 at prior to the start of the race, and he also became the first driver of 2016 to score three wins. He remained with 2 tracks he had yet to win at: Charlotte Motor Speedway and Pocono Raceway.\n\nAfter his win at Kansas, Busch had a rough stretch of races, having 4 finishes of 30th or worse. After a 40th-place finish at Michigan, Busch and the #18 team regrouped during the off-week and got a solid 7th-place finish at Sonoma Raceway.\n\nThe following week at Daytona, Busch finished second to race winner [[Brad Keselowski]]. He finished second despite being in a backup car after a hard practice crash before qualifying. The next week at [[Kentucky Speedway]], Busch won the Xfinity race at Kentucky. The following day in the Cup race, Busch finished 12th in the fuel mileage race, despite being in the top 5 late before pitting for fuel. The next week at New Hampshire, Busch once again won the Xfinity race. The next day, Busch led the most laps, but faltered on late restarts and finished 8th behind race winner and teammate [[Matt Kenseth]].\n\nThe following week at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], Busch made NASCAR history as the first driver to sweep both poles and both races in the same weekend at the same track. In the Xfinity Series [[Lilly Diabetes 250]], Busch dominated the race leading almost every lap and winning the race from the pole. It was his third Xfinity Series victory in a row and 83rd victory in the series. The following day in the [[2016 Brickyard 400|Brickyard 400]], Busch dominated the race, leading 149 of the 170 laps and after surviving several late restarts, Busch won his second consecutive Brickyard 400. It was his 38th career Cup Series victory, 4th victory of the year, and 2nd career victory at Indianapolis.\n\nBusch dominated the Bristol race in August. He led 57% of the whole race leading for 252 of the first 419 laps. However, Busch began having handling problems during the final quarter of the race and it was enough to send him to the garages. On his way to the garages, however, Busch got t-boned by a crashing [[Justin Allgaier]], driving a one-off race for [[HScott Motorsports]], taking him out of the race. Busch expressed discontent with Allgaier and Allgaier's spotter in his post-race interview, calling them \"The biggest morons out there.\"\n\nBusch went on to make the Championship Four at Homestead-Miami Speedway and finish third in the standings.\n\n====2017====\nBusch started the 2017 season on a slow note when he wrecked in the [[2017 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] after his rear tire lost air, spinning him and collecting race leader [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]]. In his interview, Busch criticized [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]'s tires, saying they \"aren't very good at holding air.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Martinelli|first=Michelle|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/nascar-daytona-500-crash-wreck-dale-earnhardt-jr-kyle-busch-out|title=Kyle Busch blasts Goodyear following race-ending Daytona 500 crash|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 26, 2017|accessdate=March 21, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322203802/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/nascar-daytona-500-crash-wreck-dale-earnhardt-jr-kyle-busch-out|archivedate=March 22, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Kyle Busch 2017 Toyota Save Mart 350 qualifying.jpg|thumb|Busch during qualifying for the [[2017 Toyota/Save Mart 350]].]]\nIn the [[2017 Kobalt 400|Kobalt 400]] at Las Vegas, Busch collided with [[Joey Logano]] as the two battled for a top-five finish on the final lap.

Busch had led 1,000+ laps in 2017 coming to the second Pocono race in July, where he had yet to win. He started on the pole, led the most laps, and took the lead from [[Kevin Harvick]] for his 39th career victory. It was his first at Pocono and left [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] as the only track where Busch had yet to win at in the Cup Series. On August 19, 2017, Busch swept the weekend at Bristol Motor Speedway. He won all stages in the truck race on Wednesday and did the same in the Xfinity Series race on Friday.

Busch was able to win the truck series race at Las Vegas in his first time competing there in the truck series since 2001. With the win, Busch has now won at his home track in all 3 major touring series of NASCAR. Busch followed the win with back to back runner up finishes at Las Vegas and Phoenix in the cup series to [[Kevin Harvick]], even leading the most laps in the latter. He later finished third at Auto Club Speedway to [[Martin Truex Jr]] and finished second at Martinsville to [[Clint Bowyer]]. Busch won his first race of the season at Texas in April. He followed that win with another win at Bristol on a Monday after using a bump and run against [[Kyle Larson]] in the closing laps. \n\nBusch won his third straight race at Richmond after starting the race in 32nd, marking the first time he has won three in a row since July 2015 when he won Kentucky, New Hampshire, and the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pistone|first=Pete|authorlink=Pete Pistone|title=Kyle Busch Wins Third Straight|url=https://www.mrn.com/2018/04/21/kyle-busch-wins-third-straight/|website=MRN.com|publisher=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=April 22, 2018|date=April 21, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422202413/https://www.mrn.com/2018/04/21/kyle-busch-wins-third-straight/|archivedate=April 22, 2018}}</ref> Next at Talladega, he went as high as second, but went on to finish 13th.

At Daytona, Busch, was turned by [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]] resulting in a 33rd-place finish. Two weeks after Daytona, at New Hampshire, Busch, was moved in the final laps by Harvick having Busch finish 2nd. The next week Busch started at the back in 27th but finished 4th in Stage 1, then used pit strategy at before the end of Stage 2 to get in front of the dominate car of Kevin Harvick (who also started at the rear) and then held off [[Daniel Su\u00e1rez]] to win his 6th race of the year and second straight summer race at Pocono. In the final pit stop for the 18 team during Watkins Glen, the gas can had a malfunction to where fuel wasn't put into the car and forced Busch to pit before the green flag putting him as the last car on the lead lap. He rebounded to a 3rd-place finish. In the first laps of the Bristol Night race, a caution came out for Busch who spun exiting turn 4. After spending most of the race picking up laps, fixing the damage, and being 2 laps down, Busch was able to contend up in the Top 5. However, after an incident with Truex Jr. and later on Jimmie Johnson and Chris Buescher, he finished 20th. After the Brickyard 400 in September, which was the Regular Season Finale for the first time, he easily won the 2018 Regular Season Championship. Busch finally won his 50th career Cup Series race at Richmond. With the 50th win, Kyle Busch is the only driver in NASCAR history to reach 50+ wins in all 3 of the top touring series. After making it to the round of 8, Busch went on to win at Phoenix ([[ISM Raceway]]) for the first time since his rookie season in 2005, and secured his spot in the championship 4. He would go on to finish 4th in the final standings, with [[Joey Logano]] winning the championship.\n\n====2019: Second championship====\nBusch started the season with a 2nd-place finish in the Daytona 500, along with Truck Series wins at Atlanta, Las Vegas and Texas and Xfinity Series wins at Las Vegas, ISM Raceway, Texas, and Indianapolis. \n[[File:Kyle Busch celebrates his 95th NASCAR XFINITY Series win at the 2019 My Bariatric Solutions 300 at Texas Motor Speedway.jpg | thumb | right | alt= Kyle Busch celebrates his 95th NASCAR XFINITY Series win at the 2019 My Bariatric Solutions 300 at Texas Motor Speedway. |\nKyle Busch celebrates his 95th NASCAR XFINITY Series win at the 2019 My Bariatric Solutions 300 at Texas Motor Speedway.]]\nHis first Cup series win of the season came early in the fourth race of the schedule at ISM Raceway.

He stayed consistent throughout the whole entire summer to catch up with Logano for the Regular Season Championship. Following the [[2019 Bojangles' Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway]], Busch clinched his second consecutive Regular Season Championship with a third-place finish despite cutting a tire with less than 3 laps to go racing for the win, and riding the wall to finish.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/09/02/kyle-busch-clinches-regular-season-championship-darlington/ |title=Kyle Busch clinches regular-season championship at Darlington |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=September 2, 2019 |accessdate=September 2, 2019}}</ref> Despite an engine blow to end the day at Indianapolis, Busch claimed his second consecutive regular season championship and ended it with 21 top 10 finishes.\n\nBusch's playoffs was up and down. Las Vegas was mediocre as he wrecked a lapped car without avoiding it and finished 19th. Richmond was a rebound race as he was looking to win the race, but eventually got passed by Martin Truex Jr and wounded 2nd. He once again had a suspension issue at the Charlotte ROVAL and finished 37th. Despite that, the Round Of 12 looked more confident as he consistently finished in the top 6 at Dover. Things took a turn at Talladega as he got side-drafted by Stenhouse and wrecked causing the Big One and finished the race in the top 20. With all the bonus points and playoff points, he finished 3rd at Kansas Speedway to make it to the Round of 8. At Martinsville however, he had a run-in with Aric Almirola which gave him some damage and finished 14th as a result. After the race, it looked as though Almirola would end his playoff hopes. But it didn't happen as after finishing in the top 10 at Texas and a runner-up to his credit at ISM Raceway, he made the Championship 4 for the 5th season in a row. He then was 4th heading to Homestead as the underdog. After the green flag dropped, Busch dominated part of the race and won at Homestead for his second championship and won his second race at Homestead. This was his 5th win of the season, snapping A 21-race winless streak. In the process, his 2019 season saw him earn 5 wins, 17 top 5s, 27 top 10s, 1 pole, 1,582 laps led, an average finish of 8.9, and finished the season as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Champion. He also won both the Regular Season championship and the playoff for the first time in his career.\n\n====2020====\nBusch started the [[2020 NASCAR Cup Series|2020 season]] with a 34th place finish at the [[2020 Daytona 500]] after blowing an engine.\n\nOn February 22, 2020, after Busch won the [[Strat 200|Las Vegas Truck race]], [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Camping World]] CEO [[Marcus Lemonis]] offered a {{USD}}100,000 reward to any full-time Cup Series driver who can beat Busch in the Truck Series.

The [[Inca Empire]], which lasted from 1438 to 1533 AD, represented the height of this civilization. The Inca state was known as the [[Kingdom of Cusco]] before 1438. Over the course of the empire, the rulers used conquest and peaceful assimilation to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centred on the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges. The empire proved relatively short-lived, however: by 1533, [[Atahualpa]], the last [[Sapa Inca]] (emperor) of the Inca Empire, was killed on the orders of the [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Pizarro]], marking the beginning of Spanish rule. The last Inca stronghold, the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\n==Population==\n\nPopulation estimates for the Tawantinsuyu society range from as few as 4.1 million people to more than 37 million. Most estimates are between 6 and 14 million people. The reason for these various estimates is that, despite that the Inca kept excellent census records using their [[quipus]], knowledge of how to read them has been lost. Almost all of them were destroyed by the Spanish in the course of their conquest and rule.<ref>{{Cite book | last=McEwan | first=Gordon Francis | authorlink=Gordon Francis McEwan | title=The Incas: New Perspectives | year=2006 | publisher=W.

Having more wives showed that the man had more labour showing that the household was wealthy. The death of the principal wife was sometimes met with suspicion that the husband played a role in her death. The man had to find a new principal wife before he was able to recover from the previous wife's death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Altroy|first1=Terence|title=The Incas|date=2015|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=West Sussex, UK|isbn=9781444331158|pages=305\u2013306|edition=2nd}}</ref> To prevent such suspicion and to increase the likelihood of a successful marriage, there were situations in which the couple could test how well the marriage would work out.\n\nTrial marriages were typical of Inca culture. In this type of marriage, the man and woman would agree to try out being married to one another for a few years. At the end of this time, the woman could go home to her parents if she wished, and her husband could also send her home if he did not think it would work out. However, once the marriage was made final, they could only divorce if the woman was childless. To make the marriage final, the provincial governor had to approve the union.<ref name=\"The Incas\">{{cite book|last1=D'Altroy|first1=Terence|title=The Incas|date=2015|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=West Sussex, UK|isbn=9781444331158|page=304|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nIn the Inca society, a wedding was a simple event.<ref name=\"The Incas\"/>  Instead, it was looked at more as a business-like agreement. Therefore, marriage was an economic agreement between two families.

Women of higher ranking also weaved, like those of lower ranks, but their work was used in special clothing for the higher ranks.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silverblatt|first1=Irene|title=Andean Women in the Inca Empire|journal=Feminist Studios, Inc.|date=Oct 1978|volume=4|issue=3|page=42}}</ref> A man's role sometimes resembled those of a woman, but acted in conjunction with one another.<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Altroy|first1=Terence|title=The Incas|date=2015|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=West Sussex, UK|isbn=9781444331158|page=300}}</ref> A woman\u2019s household obligations would not change after she became pregnant. When she did find out she was pregnant she prayed and made offerings to an Inca god, Kanopa.Using marriage as an alliance strategy was also common among the Inca. Even before the Spaniards' arrival, the Inca used marriage as a way to claim themselves to power. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spaniards arrival]] the Inca allowed marriages between the Inca and Spaniards in order to gain power during a time of civil war.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Guengerich|first1=Sara Vicuna|title=Capac Women and the Politics of Marriage in Early Colonial Peru|journal=Colonial Latin America Review|date=2015|volume=24|issue=2|pages=147\u2013148|doi=10.1080/10609164.2015.1040275}}</ref>\n\n==Arts==\nThe Inca were a conquering society, and their expansionist assimilation of other cultures is evident in their artistic style.  The artistic style of the Inca utilized the vocabulary of many regions and cultures, but incorporated these themes into a standardized imperial style that could easily be replicated and spread throughout the empire.  The simple abstract geometric forms and highly stylised animal representation in ceramics, wood carvings, textiles and metalwork were all part of the Inca culture.  The motifs were not as revivalist as previous empires. No motifs of other societies were directly used with the exception of [[Huari culture|Huari]] and [[Tiwanaku]] arts.\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Totora titicaca.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of Inca ship sailing on Lake Titicaca in Bolivia]] -->\n\nFor fishing, trade, construction, transport and military purposes, the Inca built seagoing vessels called [[Balsa (ship)|''balsas'']] by weaving together [[totora (plant)|totora]] reeds. The largest of these vessels were 20 to 30 meters long, making them comparable in length to the Spanish ''[[caravel]]'' .{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} This method of constructing ships from woven reeds is an ancient Peruvian tradition which long predates the Inca. There are depictions of such vessels in [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] pottery dating back to 100 A.D.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Tupa-inca-tunic.png|thumb|Inca tunic]]\n\nInca officials wore stylized [[tunic]]s that indicated their status. It contains an amalgamation of motifs used in the tunics of particular officeholders. For instance, the black and white [[checkerboard]] pattern topped with a pink triangle is believed to have been worn by soldiers of the army. Some of the motifs make reference to earlier cultures, such as the stepped diamonds of the [[Huari culture|Huari]] and the three-step stairstep motif of the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]].\n\nCloth was divided into three classes. ''Awaska'' was used for household use, and usually made from [[llama]] wool. Finer cloth, ''qunpi'', was divided into two classes: The first, woven by male ''qunpikamayuq'' (keepers of fine cloth) from [[alpaca]] wool, was collected as tribute from throughout the country and was used for trade. The other class of ''qunpi'' ranked highest. It was woven in the Acllawasi (acllahuasi) by \"aclla\" (female virgins of the sun god temple) from [[vicu\u00f1a]] wool and used solely for royal and religious use.  These had thread counts of 300 or more per inch, unsurpassed anywhere in the world, until the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century.\n\nAside from the tunic, a person of importance wore a ''[[llawt'u]]'', a series of cords wrapped around the head. To establish his importance, the Inca [[Atahualpa]] commissioned a ''llawt'u'' woven from vampire bat hair. The leader of each [[ayllu]], or extended family, had its own headdress.\n\nIn conquered regions, traditional clothing continued to be worn, but the finest weavers, such as those of [[Chan Chan]], were transferred to Cusco and kept there to weave ''qunpi''. (The [[Chimu|Chim\u00fa]] had previously transferred these same weavers to Chan Chan from [[Sican culture|Sican]].)\n\nThe Incan government controlled all clothing of their society.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} One would receive two outfits of clothing, one formal and one casual pair, and they would then proceed to wear those same outfits until they could literally be worn no longer. Since the government was in such strict control on their clothing, the Incas could not alter their clothing without the permission of the government.\n\n===Jewelry===\nThe wearing of [[jewellery]] was not uniform throughout the empire. Chim\u00fa [[artisan]]s, for example, continued to wear [[earrings]] after their integration into the empire, but in many other regions, usually, only local leaders wore them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Jewelry may have been common among the Inca people, however it did not hold as much value to them because labor was the main way people paid each other.<ref name=\"Karen Spalding\">{{cite book|last1=Spalding|first1=Karen|title=Huarochir\u00c3: An Andean Society Under Inca and Spanish Rule|date=1984|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|isbn=0-8047-1516-5|pages=83\u201384|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kTPgOxyliqQC&pg=PA1&dq=inca+jewelry#v=onepage&q=inca%20jewelry&f=false|accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Ceramics and metalwork===\n[[File:Recipiente Chim\u00fa-Inca caim\u00e1n (M. Am\u00e9rica, Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Chim\u00fa]]-Inca ceramic from the [[Cultural periods of Peru|Late Horizon]].]]\n\nCeramics were for the most part utilitarian in nature, but also incorporated the imperialist style that was prevalent in the Inca textiles and metalwork.  In addition, the Inca played drums and on woodwind instruments including [[flute]]s, [[pan-pipe]]s and [[trumpet]]s made of shell and ceramics.\n\nThe Inca made beautiful objects of gold, silver, copper, bronze and [[tumbaga]] . But precious metals were in shorter supply than in earlier Peruvian cultures. The Inca metalworking style draws much of its inspiration from [[Chim\u00fa]] art and in fact the best metal workers of [[Chan Chan]] were transferred to Cusco when the Kingdom of [[Chimor]] was incorporated into the empire. Unlike the Chim\u00fa, the Inca do not seem to have regarded metals to be as precious as fine cloth. Nonetheless, the metalworks of the Incas were perhaps the most advanced in America. When the Spanish first encountered the Inca they were offered gifts of ''qunpi'' cloth.\n\nIncan ceramics are usually very distinct and easy to recognize. The shapes of the vessels are highly standardized. The most typical Incan pottery would have a spherical body with a cone shaped base. This spherical body usually includes two vertical side handles with a tall neck and flaring rim. The Incans often would place animal heads on their pottery as well usually near the top of the vessel. There were also several other popular styles for Incan ceramics which included a shallow dish with a single bird head and handle, a pedestal beaker, and a single or double handled bottle.\n\nIncans often decorated their ceramics with a multitude of images and colors. They usually decorated their pottery with bright colors of red, yellow, orange, black and white. Much like all other forms of Incan art, the pottery was often decorated with geometric shapes. The Incans would put diamonds, squares, checkers, triangles, circles and dots on almost all of their ceramic work. Other common themes were animals and insects like llamas, birds, jaguars, alpacas, bees, butterflies as well as block-like humans.\n\nAs part of a tax obligation to the commoners, mining was required in all the provinces. Even though the Inca Empire contained a lot of precious metals, the Incans did not value their metal as much as fine cloth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The Incans adopted much of their metal-working characteristics from the metalwork of [[Chimu]]. Because of their expertise in metalworking, after the fall of Chimu many metalworkers were taken back to the capital city of Cuzco to continue their metalworking for the emperor. Copper, tin, gold, and silver were all obtained from mines or washed from the river gravels. These metals would then be handed over to metallurgists. Because the Inca had a system that emphasized political and religious organization, there were many specialized artisans like metallurgists. There were also specialized weavers, cloth makers, pottery makers, and many more. Both copper and bronze would be used for basic farming tools or weapons. Some of the common bronze and copper pieces found in the Incan empire included sharp sticks for digging, club-heads, knives with curved blades, axes, chisels, needles and pins. All of these items would be forged by a metallurgist and then spread throughout the empire.\n\nThe Incans reserved their more precious metals for ornaments and decorations. Gold and silver were common themes throughout the palaces of Incan emperors. It was said that the walls and thrones were covered with gold and that the emperor dined on gold and silver service. These golden plated services would often be inlaid with llamas, butterflies or other creatures. Even beyond the gold and decoration of the emperor\u2019s palace were the ornaments that decorated all of the temples throughout the empire. The temples of the Incans were strewn with sacred and highly precious objects. Headdresses, crowns, ceremonial knives, cups, and a lot of ceremonial clothing were all inlaid with gold or silver.\n\nMany historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} believe that the choice of gold was to distinguish the more \u201csacred\u201d or \u201choly\u201d pieces from others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The commonality of gold has much to do with the Incan religion surrounding the sun. Because of the beautiful reflection that gold casts, it gave the appearance of containing the sun, making the precious metal even more valued in a sun-obsessed society. Gold was reserved for the highest class of Incan society which consisted of priests, lords and of course the Sapa Inca or emperor.\n\n==Politics==\n\nInca government is generally seen as an omnipotent emperor that ruled over a bureaucracy made up of local elites who had been recruited to serve in the state.<ref name=\":1z\">{{Cite book|title=The Incas|last=D'Altroy|first=Terence|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4443-3115-8|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=174}}</ref> This style of rule is often credited to Cuzco's success.<ref name=\":1z\" />\n\nThe Inca empire was adamant about expansion and did so through two imperialism strategies: territorial administration and indirect-hegemonic control. Territorial administration consisted of a complete take over of provinces by reorganizing the economy through increased agricultural production and control of exchange routes via the Incan road system. The territorial administration allowed the Inca empire to put in a great deal of effort to control a new territory in hopes to strengthen the empire by a flow of surplus goods back to the empire core from the overtaken province. Indirect-hegemonic control enabled the Incas to gain control over a province but would allow the local leaders to govern the province. The reason behind this strategy was to gain land and flow of surplus goods back to the empire core without spending a great deal of effort to overtake and govern.<ref name=\":3\">Distant Provinces in the Inka Empire : Toward a Deeper Understanding of Inka Imperialism, edited by Michael A.

Temples and shrines were also constructed in overtaken provinces to inflict Incan religion upon provincial peoples.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Inca education}}\n[[File:Quipu.png|thumb|Representation of an Incan quipu]]\n\nThe Inca used [[quipu]] or bunches of knotted strings, for accounting and census purposes.  Much of the information on the surviving quipus has been shown to be numeric data; some numbers seem to have been used as mnemonic labels, and the colour, spacing, and structure of the quipu carried information as well.  Since it isn't known how to interpret the coded or non-numeric data, the associated information is considered lost.\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Inca religion}}\n\nThe belief system of the Incas was polytheistic. Viracocha, the creator of the universe and Inti, the Sun God, were the most important gods. Viracocha was believed to have created humanity on an island in the middle of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Inti was devoutly loved so much that the Inca people called themselves \"Intip Churin\" which in the Inca language means \"the children of the sun.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Inca took part in spiritual human sacrifices known as the [[Capacocha]]. These sacrifices were taken out onto mountains all throughout the Andes and placed alive into burial tombs where they were left with items such as figurines, coca leaves, food, alcoholic beverages, and pottery. These offerings were carried out on large mountains where ceremonial sites were constructed, and were believed to have been made for numerous events such as: important festivals, natural phenomenon, and efforts to please the mountain deities. The ''vilca camayos'' were the overseers of the offerings, in which they had decision on where the sacrifices were made and the amount of sacrifices made on each mountain. Mountain deities were worshiped because it was believed that they controlled things like rainfall, water flow and therefore, the abundance and fertility of crops.,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reinhard|first1=Johan|title=Frozen Mummies of the Andes|date=September 2016|url=http://um9mh3ku7s.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=FROZEN+MUMMIES+of+the+ANDES&rft.jtitle=Expedition&rft.au=Johan+Reinhard&rft.date=2016-10-01&rft.pub=University+of+Pennsylvania%2C+University+Museum&rft.issn=0014-4738&rft.volume=58&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=8&rft.externalDocID=4187432271&paramdict=en-US|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>[Reinhard, Johan and Constanza Ceruti. \"Sacred Mountains, Ceremonial Sites, and Human Sacrifice among the Incas.\" Archaeoastronomy, vol. 19, June 2005, pp. 1-43.

A temple was built, the Incamisana, to worship water and the deities granting them water. The temple, as well as many other buildings constructed by the Inca, incorporated aesthetics, underground water conduits, and hydraulic systems. The Inca understood water was needed for agricultural production (used in terraces) and for domestic purposes. The civil engineers of the time for the Inca were tasked with laying out diversion and canal routes to a designated spot, finding what water source would give the desired flow rate, and what elevation the water source would need to be tapped from for gravity to work effectively.<ref name=\":2\" />\nSanitation was also well known by the Inca.

The [[Inca Empire]], which lasted from 1438 to 1533 AD, represented the height of this civilization. The Inca state was known as the [[Kingdom of Cusco]] before 1438. Over the course of the Inca Empire, the rulers used conquest and peaceful assimilation to incorporate in their empire a large portion of western South America, centred on the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges. The empire proved relatively short-lived however: by 1533, [[Atahualpa]], the last [[Sapa Inca]] (emperor) of the Inca Empire, was killed on the orders of the [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Pizarro]], marking the beginning of Spanish rule. The last Inca stronghold, the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\n==Population==\n\nPopulation estimates for the Tawantinsuyu society range from as few as 4.1 million people to more than 37 million. Most estimates are between 6 and 14 million people. The reason for these various estimates is that, despite that the Inca kept excellent census records using their [[quipus]], knowledge of how to read them has been lost. Almost all of them were destroyed by the Spanish in the course of their conquest and rule.<ref>{{Cite book | last=McEwan | first=Gordon Francis | authorlink=Gordon Francis McEwan | title=The Incas: New Perspectives | year=2006 | publisher=W.

The man had to find a new principal wife before he was able to recover from the previous wife's death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Altroy|first1=Terence|title=The Incas|date=2015|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=West Sussex, UK|isbn=9781444331158|pages=305\u2013306|edition=2nd}}</ref> To prevent such suspicion and to increase the likelihood of a successful marriage, there were situations in which the couple could test how well the marriage would work out.\n\nTrial marriages were typical of Inca culture. In this type of marriage, the man and woman would agree to try out being married to one another for a few years. At the end of this time, the woman could go home to her parents if she wished, and her husband could also send her home if he did not think it would work out. However, once the marriage was made final, they could only divorce if the woman was childless. To make the marriage final, the provincial governor had to approve the union.<ref name=\"The Incas\">{{cite book|last1=D'Altroy|first1=Terence|title=The Incas|date=2015|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|location=West Sussex, UK|isbn=9781444331158|page=304|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nIn the Inca society, a wedding was a simple event.<ref name=\"The Incas\"/>  Instead, it was looked at more as a business-like agreement.

The artistic style of the Inca utilized the vocabulary of many regions and cultures, but incorporated these themes into a standardized imperial style that could easily be replicated and spread throughout the empire.  The simple abstract geometric forms and highly stylised animal representation in ceramics, wood carvings, textiles and metalwork were all part of the Inca culture.  The motifs were not as revivalist as previous empires. No motifs of other societies were directly used with the exception of [[Huari culture|Huari]] and [[Tiwanaku]] arts.\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Totora titicaca.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of Inca ship sailing on Lake Titicaca in Bolivia]] -->\n\nFor fishing, trade, construction, transport and military purposes, the Inca built seagoing vessels called [[Balsa (ship)|''balsas'']] by weaving together [[totora (plant)|totora]] reeds. The largest of these vessels were 20 to 30 meters long, making them comparable in length to the Spanish ''[[caravel]]'' .{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} This method of constructing ships from woven reeds is an ancient Peruvian tradition which long predates the Inca. There are depictions of such vessels in [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] pottery dating back to 100 A.D.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Tupa-inca-tunic.png|thumb|Inca tunic]]\n\nInca officials wore stylized [[tunic]]s that indicated their status. It contains an amalgamation of motifs used in the tunics of particular officeholders. For instance, the black and white [[checkerboard]] pattern topped with a pink triangle is believed to have been worn by soldiers of the army. Some of the motifs make reference to earlier cultures, such as the stepped diamonds of the [[Huari culture|Huari]] and the three-step stairstep motif of the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]].\n\nCloth was divided into three classes. ''Awaska'' was used for household use, and usually made from [[llama]] wool. Finer cloth, ''qunpi'', was divided into two classes: The first, woven by male ''qunpikamayuq'' (keepers of fine cloth) from [[alpaca]] wool, was collected as tribute from throughout the country and was used for trade. The other class of ''qunpi'' ranked highest. It was woven in the Acllawasi (acllahuasi) by \"aclla\" (female virgins of the sun god temple) from [[vicu\u00f1a]] wool and used solely for royal and religious use.  These had thread counts of 300 or more per inch, unsurpassed anywhere in the world, until the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century.\n\nAside from the tunic, a person of importance wore a ''[[llawt'u]]'', a series of cords wrapped around the head. To establish his importance, the Inca [[Atahualpa]] commissioned a ''llawt'u'' woven from vampire bat hair. The leader of each [[ayllu]], or extended family, had its own headdress.\n\nIn conquered regions, traditional clothing continued to be worn, but the finest weavers, such as those of [[Chan Chan]], were transferred to Cusco and kept there to weave ''qunpi''. (The [[Chimu|Chim\u00fa]] had previously transferred these same weavers to Chan Chan from [[Sican culture|Sican]].)\n\nThe Incan government controlled all clothing of their society.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} One would receive two outfits of clothing, one formal and one casual pair, and they would then proceed to wear those same outfits until they could literally be worn no longer. Since the government was in such strict control on their clothing, the Incas could not alter their clothing without the permission of the government.\n\n===Jewelry===\nThe wearing of [[jewellery]] was not uniform throughout the empire. Chim\u00fa [[artisan]]s, for example, continued to wear [[earrings]] after their integration into the empire, but in many other regions, usually, only local leaders wore them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Jewelry may have been common among the Inca people, however it did not hold as much value to them because labor was the main way people paid each other.<ref name=\"Karen Spalding\">{{cite book|last1=Spalding|first1=Karen|title=Huarochir\u00c3: An Andean Society Under Inca and Spanish Rule|date=1984|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|isbn=0-8047-1516-5|pages=83\u201384|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kTPgOxyliqQC&pg=PA1&dq=inca+jewelry#v=onepage&q=inca%20jewelry&f=false|accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Ceramics and metalwork===\n[[File:Recipiente Chim\u00fa-Inca caim\u00e1n (M. Am\u00e9rica, Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Chim\u00fa]]-Inca ceramic from the [[Cultural periods of Peru|Late Horizon]].]]\n\nCeramics were for the most part utilitarian in nature, but also incorporated the imperialist style that was prevalent in the Inca textiles and metalwork.  In addition, the Inca played drums and on woodwind instruments including [[flute]]s, [[pan-pipe]]s and [[trumpet]]s made of shell and ceramics.\n\nThe Inca made beautiful objects of gold, silver, copper, bronze and [[tumbaga]] . But precious metals were in shorter supply than in earlier Peruvian cultures. The Inca metalworking style draws much of its inspiration from [[Chim\u00fa]] art and in fact the best metal workers of [[Chan Chan]] were transferred to Cusco when the Kingdom of [[Chimor]] was incorporated into the empire. Unlike the Chim\u00fa, the Inca do not seem to have regarded metals to be as precious as fine cloth. Nonetheless, the metalworks of the Incas were perhaps the most advanced in America. When the Spanish first encountered the Inca they were offered gifts of ''qunpi'' cloth.\n\nIncan ceramics are usually very distinct and easy to recognize. The shapes of the vessels are highly standardized. The most typical Incan pottery would have a spherical body with a cone shaped base. This spherical body usually includes two vertical side handles with a tall neck and flaring rim. The Incans often would place animal heads on their pottery as well usually near the top of the vessel. There were also several other popular styles for Incan ceramics which included a shallow dish with a single bird head and handle, a pedestal beaker, and a single or double handled bottle.\n\nIncans often decorated their ceramics with a multitude of images and colors. They usually decorated their pottery with bright colors of red, yellow, orange, black and white. Much like all other forms of Incan art, the pottery was often decorated with geometric shapes. The Incans would put diamonds, squares, checkers, triangles, circles and dots on almost all of their ceramic work. Other common themes were animals and insects like llamas, birds, jaguars, alpacas, bees, butterflies as well as block-like humans.\n\nAs part of a tax obligation to the commoners, mining was required in all the provinces. Even though the Inca Empire contained a lot of precious metals, the Incans did not value their metal as much as fine cloth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The Incans adopted much of their metal-working characteristics from the metalwork of [[Chimu]]. Because of their expertise in metalworking, after the fall of Chimu many metalworkers were taken back to the capital city of Cuzco to continue their metalworking for the emperor. Copper, tin, gold, and silver were all obtained from mines or washed from the river gravels. These metals would then be handed over to metallurgists. Because the Inca had a system that emphasized political and religious organization, there were many specialized artisans like metallurgists. There were also specialized weavers, cloth makers, pottery makers, and many more. Both copper and bronze would be used for basic farming tools or weapons. Some of the common bronze and copper pieces found in the Incan empire included sharp sticks for digging, club-heads, knives with curved blades, axes, chisels, needles and pins. All of these items would be forged by a metallurgist and then spread throughout the empire.\n\nThe Incans reserved their more precious metals for ornaments and decorations. Gold and silver were common themes throughout the palaces of Incan emperors. It was said that the walls and thrones were covered with gold and that the emperor dined on gold and silver service. These golden plated services would often be inlaid with llamas, butterflies or other creatures. Even beyond the gold and decoration of the emperor\u2019s palace were the ornaments that decorated all of the temples throughout the empire. The temples of the Incans were strewn with sacred and highly precious objects. Headdresses, crowns, ceremonial knives, cups, and a lot of ceremonial clothing were all inlaid with gold or silver.\n\nMany historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} believe that the choice of gold was to distinguish the more \u201csacred\u201d or \u201choly\u201d pieces from others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The commonality of gold has much to do with the Incan religion surrounding the sun. Because of the beautiful reflection that gold casts, it gave the appearance of containing the sun, making the precious metal even more valued in a sun-obsessed society. Gold was reserved for the highest class of Incan society which consisted of priests, lords and of course the Sapa Inca or emperor.\n\n==Politics==\n\nInca government is generally seen as an omnipotent emperor that ruled over a bureaucracy made up of local elites who had been recruited to serve in the state.<ref name=\":1z\">{{Cite book|title=The Incas|last=D'Altroy|first=Terence|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4443-3115-8|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=174}}</ref> This style of rule is often credited to Cuzco's success.<ref name=\":1z\" />\n\nThe Inca empire was adamant about expansion and did so through two imperialism strategies: territorial administration and indirect-hegemonic control. Territorial administration consisted of a complete take over of provinces by reorganizing the economy through increased agricultural production and control of exchange routes via the Incan road system. The territorial administration allowed the Inca empire to put in a great deal of effort to control a new territory in hopes to strengthen the empire by a flow of surplus goods back to the empire core from the overtaken province. Indirect-hegemonic control enabled the Incas to gain control over a province but would allow the local leaders to govern the province. The reason behind this strategy was to gain land and flow of surplus goods back to the empire core without spending a great deal of effort to overtake and govern.<ref name=\":3\">Distant Provinces in the Inka Empire : Toward a Deeper Understanding of Inka Imperialism, edited by Michael A.

Much of the information on the surviving quipus has been shown to be numeric data; some numbers seem to have been used as mnemonic labels, and the colour, spacing, and structure of the quipu carried information as well.  Since it isn't known how to interpret the coded or non-numeric data, the associated information is considered lost.\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Inca religion}}\n\nThe belief system of the Incas was polytheistic. Viracocha, the creator of the universe and Inti, the Sun God, were the most important gods. Viracocha was believed to have created humanity on an island in the middle of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Inti was devoutly loved so much that the Inca people called themselves \"Intip Churin\" which in the Inca language means \"the children of the sun.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Inca took part in spiritual human sacrifices known as the [[Capacocha]]. These sacrifices were taken out onto mountains all throughout the Andes and placed alive into burial tombs where they were left with items such as figurines, coca leaves, food, alcoholic beverages, and pottery. These offerings were carried out on large mountains where ceremonial sites were constructed, and were believed to have been made for numerous events such as: important festivals, natural phenomenon, and efforts to please the mountain deities. The ''vilca camayos'' were the overseers of the offerings, in which they had decision on where the sacrifices were made and the amount of sacrifices made on each mountain. Mountain deities were worshiped because it was believed that they controlled things like rainfall, water flow and therefore, the abundance and fertility of crops.,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reinhard|first1=Johan|title=Frozen Mummies of the Andes|date=September 2016|url=http://um9mh3ku7s.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=FROZEN+MUMMIES+of+the+ANDES&rft.jtitle=Expedition&rft.au=Johan+Reinhard&rft.date=2016-10-01&rft.pub=University+of+Pennsylvania%2C+University+Museum&rft.issn=0014-4738&rft.volume=58&rft.issue=2&rft.spage=8&rft.externalDocID=4187432271&paramdict=en-US|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>[Reinhard, Johan and Constanza Ceruti. \"Sacred Mountains, Ceremonial Sites, and Human Sacrifice among the Incas.\" Archaeoastronomy, vol. 19, June 2005, pp. 1-43.

The main crops were [[potato]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], [[Chile pepper|chili peppers]], [[cotton]], [[tomato]]es, [[peanut]]s, an edible root called [[oxalis tuberosa|oca]], and the [[pseudograin]]s [[quinoa]] and [[amaranth]]. The crops developed by the Inca and preceding cultures makes South America one of the historic centers of [[crop diversity]] (along with the [[Middle East]], [[India]], [[Mesoamerica]], [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Far East]]). Many of these crops were widely distributed by the Spanish and are now important crops worldwide. [[Salsa (sauce)|Salsa]] was originated by the [[Inca people]] using tomatoes, chili peppers, and other spices.\n\nIn the Incan settlement of Vitcos, pollen from maize and quinoa was found in several soil samples which date back as early as the Incan period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meseth|first=Enrique|display-authors=etal|date=July 2015|title=Reconstructing Agriculture in Vitcos Inca Settlement, Peru|url=|journal=Irrigation and Drainage|volume=64|issue=3|pages=340\u2013352|via=Database|doi=10.1002/ird.1891}}</ref>\n\nThe Inca cultivated food crops on dry Pacific coastlines, high on the slopes of the Andes, and in the lowland [[Amazon rainforest]]. In mountainous Andean environments, they made extensive use of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] fields which not only allowed them to put to use the mineral-rich mountain soil which other peoples left fallow, but also took advantage of micro-climates conducive to a variety of crops being cultivated throughout the year. A contributing factor for the ability of the Inca to expand their population and agriculture as quick as they did, was because of a small climate shift that allowed for slightly warmer temperatures and a small increase in annual precipitation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Chepstow-Lusty|first=A.

The Inca also constructed vast storehouses, which allowed them to live through [[El Ni\u00f1o]] years while some neighboring civilizations suffered.\n\nInca leaders kept records of what each ''ayllu'' in the empire produced, but did not tax them on their production. They instead used the ''mita'' for the support of the empire.\n\nThe Inca diet consisted primarily of fish and vegetables, supplemented less frequently with the meat of [[guinea pig|cuyes]] (guinea pigs) and camelids. In addition, they hunted various animals for meat, skins and feathers.  Maize was malted and used to make [[chicha]], a fermented alcoholic [[beverage]].\n<!--\n==Currency==\nInca society was based on a [[barter]] system.

Uses were not only for nobility to spread information and expand the empire, but was also used for soldiers, for transportation of goods, and for private usage. Not only were Incan roads expansive, but they were also well planned and maintained. The Incans made a standard design for the roads and carried out the standard throughout the empire. Roads were built so that they were easily drained to prevent damage of the roads and flooding. The roads were cleaned often by designated maintenance workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Garrido|first1=Franciso|title=Rethinking Imperial Infrastructure:A Bottom- up Perspective on the Inca Road|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=September 2016|volume=43|pages=94\u2013109|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2016.06.001|doi-access=free}}https://ac-els-cdn-com.libproxy.mst.edu/S0278416516300599/1-s2.0-S0278416516300599-main.pdf?_tid=a3b4c3be-aef6-11e7-80a7-00000aab0f02&acdnat=1507776179_8ef75bdf7e76a27dd4b488c65a746988</ref> Lodges for traveling nobles were also constructed alongside the roads. Rest stops called [[Tambo (Incan structure)|tambos]] were built close to roads with water supplies leading to each so that travelers and messengers could have a place to rest and clean water to drink. Military store houses were also built near the roads and kept food for when troops were traveling. Bridges were built across rivers that were too deep to cross, and large flat stones were placed along the sides of roads as markers to distinguish different sections of the roads.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Incamisana: Engineering an Inca Water Temple|last1=Wright|first1=Kenneth R.|last2=Gibaja Oviendo|first2=Arminda M.|last3=McEwan|first3=Gordon F.|last4=Miksad|first4=Richard W.|last5=Wright|first5=Ruth M.|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/lib/umr-ebooks/reader.action?docID=4534226</ref>\n\nThe Inca relied on and worshiped water heavily. A temple was built, the Incamisana, to worship water and the deities granting them water. The temple, as well as many other buildings constructed by the Inca, incorporated aesthetics, underground water conduits, and hydraulic systems. The Inca understood water was needed for agricultural production (used in terraces) and for domestic purposes. The civil engineers of the time for the Inca were tasked with laying out diversion and canal routes to a designated spot, finding what water source would give the desired flow rate, and what elevation the water source would need to be tapped from for gravity to work effectively.<ref name=\":2\" />\nSanitation was also well known by the Inca.

His works include ''The Literature of the Kymry'' (1849,1876), ''Madoc: An Essay on the Discovery of America by Madoc ap Owen Gwynedd in the Twelfth Century'' (1858,1893), and ''Orgraff yr Iaith Gymraeg'' (1859) (an [[orthography]] of [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), as well as a number of prize-winning essays presented at [[eisteddfod]]au between 1840 and 1858. He was the first Welsh historian and literary critic to employ rigorous scientific methods, and is considered to have done more to raise the standards of the National Eisteddfod than any other Welshman of his time.

Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or \"[[qubit]]\", which is somewhat analogous to the [[bit]] in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 [[quantum state]], or they can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation is performed by manipulating qubits with [[quantum logic gate]]s, which are somewhat analogous to [[logic gate|classical logic gates]].<!--Limitations on quantum computers-->\n\nLimitations outlined in the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|strong Church thesis]] are imposed on quantum computers.\u00a0Many hypothetical machines have been realized, however these machines cannot be constructed in reality. Church\u2019s thesis requires these machines to be physical, therefore these hypothetical machines cannot represent a quantum computer that satisfies the strong Church thesis. Church\u2019s thesis originally defined the guideline for hypothetical quantum computers used to realize quantum algorithms such as [[Peter Shor|Shor\u2019s]] [[Quantum algorithm|algorithms]] for factorization and discrete logarithms. Specifically, [[Peter Shor|Shor\u2019s]] algorithms utilize the [[Quantum gate|quantum gate array]] model to simulate a quantum computer with an arbitrary [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]].\u00a0There are many other quantum models, including the [[Adiabatic quantum computation|adiabatic quantum computer]] and [[one-way quantum computer]].

Analog approaches are further divided into [[quantum simulator|quantum simulation]], [[quantum annealing]], and [[adiabatic quantum computation]]. Digital quantum computers use [[quantum logic gate]]s to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or [[qubit]]s.<ref name=2018Report/>{{rp|2\u201313}}\n\n<!-- Computability and complexity -->\nAny [[computational problem]] that can be solved by a classical computer can also, in principle, be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, quantum computers obey the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church\u2013Turing thesis;]] that is, any [[computational problem]] that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer. While this means that quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of [[computability]], they do in theory provide additional power when it comes to the [[time complexity]] of solving certain problems. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer could solve in ''any feasible amount of time''\u2014a feat known as \"[[quantum supremacy]]\". The study of the [[computational complexity]] of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as [[quantum complexity theory]].\n\n== Quantum operations ==\n[[File:Bloch Sphere.svg|thumb|The [[Bloch sphere]] is a representation of a [[qubit]], the fundamental building block of quantum computers.]]\n\nThe prevailing model of quantum computation describes the computation in terms of a network of [[quantum logic gate]]s.<ref name=\"Nielson-Chuang\">{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition|last=Nielsen|first=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511976667|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511976667|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/465953}}</ref>\n\nA memory consisting of <math display=\"inline\">n</math> bits of information has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> possible states. A vector representing all memory states thus has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> entries (one for each state). This vector is viewed as a ''[[probability vector]]'' and represents the fact that the memory is to be found in a particular state.\n\nIn the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero.  \nIn quantum mechanics, probability vectors are generalized to [[Density matrix|density operators]]. This is the technically rigorous [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical foundation for quantum logic gates]], but the intermediate quantum state vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler. This article focuses on the quantum state vector formalism for simplicity.\n\nWe begin by considering a simple memory consisting of only one bit. This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms.

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.

However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement.

This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system. [[Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric ciphers]] such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} This application of quantum computing is a major interest of government agencies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption |first1=Steven |last1=Rich |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |date=2014-02-01 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum simulation ===\n{{Main|Quantum simulator}}\nSince chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, many believe [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulation]] will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72734 |title=The Father of Quantum Computing |journal=Wired |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=2007-02-15 }}</ref> Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a [[collider]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/ias-letter/ambainis-quantum-computing |title=What Can We Do with a Quantum Computer? |first=Andris |last=Ambainis |date=Spring 2014 |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization ===\n[[Quantum annealing]] or [[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations.

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.
