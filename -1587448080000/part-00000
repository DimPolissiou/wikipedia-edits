Its capital is [[Catbalogan City]]. It is bordered by [[Northern Samar]], [[Eastern Samar]], [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and includes several islands in the [[Samar Sea]]. Samar is connected to the [[Leyte|island of Leyte]] via the [[San Juanico Bridge]] (Marcos Bridge).\n\nIn 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the [[Samar Province (1768-1965)|historical province of Samar]].  In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anuncacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.\n* '''1941''' \u2014 The [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion by the Japanese]] via fighter and bomber planes.\n* '''1941''' to '''1942''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Infantry Division]], Philippine Commonwealth Army, and [[USAFFE]] (under the Visayan-Mindanao Force) were established, but all fell to the invading Japanese forces. The general headquarters in Samar also fell to the Japanese. This resulted in the defeat of the Filipino troops of the USAFFE 91st Division.\n* '''1942''' \u2014 The occupying [[Imperial Japanese forces]] arrived in the province of Samar.\n* '''1942''' \u2013 The established of the 3rd Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were based at the general headquarters and camp base in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]]. \n* '''1942''' to '''1944''' \u2014 During the occupation, thousands of local Samare\u00f1os \u2014 men and women \u2014 joined guerrilla groups in the province and helped local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units [[Philippine resistance against Japan|fight the Japanese Imperial forces]] which led to the latter's defeat and started the pre-Allied liberation.\n** The [[4th Infantry Division (Philippines)|4th]], [[9th Infantry Division (Philippines)|9th]], 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters and military camps. The military unit organizations started the anti-Japanese military operations in the province from 1942 to 1945.\n** The 96th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was founded and established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters in the province of Samar.\n** The [[Philippine Guerrilla Forces]] or PGF were established from 1942 to 1998 as a guerrilla resistance organization with headquarters in San Andres, [[Villareal, Samar]].\n* '''September 18, 1944''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the constable 9th Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were ambushed at Barrio Cansumangay in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar]] was fought against the Imperial Japanese force. The casualties almost 31 Japanese and 2 Filipinos killed in action. \n* '''1944''' \u2014 The [[Battle off Samar]] took place on October 24 as [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force warships clashed with several allied naval vessels in a collision course. His forces sank escort carrier {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73}}, destroyers {{USS|Hoel|DD-533}} and {{USS|Johnston|DD-557}}, and escort destroyer {{USS|Samuel B.

Replaced by PC 9th Samar Company was fought by the Japanese. \n* '''1944''' to '''1945''' \u2014 Combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces, including recognized guerrillas, liberated the province of Samar and defeated Imperial Japanese forces. The local Filipino soldiers under the 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 9th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, started the battles in Samar and fought against Japanese troops.\n* '''1945''' \u2014 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers under the [[1st Filipino Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Filipino Infantry Regiment]] of the United States Army began the Battle of Samar and aided the local Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions and the Philippine Constabulary [[9th Constabulary Regiment (Philippine Constabulary)|9th Constabulary Regiment]], the local Samare\u00f1o guerrilla resistance and the U.S. liberation forces defeated the Japanese liberating the province of Samar.\n* '''1965''' \u2014 On June 19, the [[Philippine Congress]] along with the three Samar [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Representatives]], Eladio T.

The province is bordered on the north by [[Northern Samar]], east by [[Eastern Samar]], south by [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and west by the [[Samar Sea]].\n\n===Topography===\nSamar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from {{Convert|200|to|800|m}} high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the [[alluvial plain]]s and [[river delta|delta]]s accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of [[Catubig River|Catubig]] and [[Catarman River|Catarman]] rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the [[Calbayog]] area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and [[Ulot River|Ulot]] rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to [[deforestation]]. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

Its capital is [[Catbalogan City]]. It is bordered by [[Northern Samar]], [[Eastern Samar]], [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and includes several islands in the [[Samar Sea]]. Samar is connected to the [[Leyte|island of Leyte]] via the [[San Juanico Bridge]] (Marcos Bridge).\n\nIn 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the [[Samar Province (1768-1965)|historical province of Samar]].  In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anuncacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.\n* '''1941''' \u2014 The [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion by the Japanese]] via fighter and bomber planes.\n* '''1941''' to '''1942''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Infantry Division]], Philippine Commonwealth Army, and [[USAFFE]] (under the Visayan-Mindanao Force) were established, but all fell to the invading Japanese forces. The general headquarters in Samar also fell to the Japanese. This resulted in the defeat of the Filipino troops of the USAFFE 91st Division.\n* '''1942''' \u2014 The occupying [[Imperial Japanese forces]] arrived in the province of Samar.\n* '''1942''' \u2013 The established of the 3rd Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were based at the general headquarters and camp base in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]]. \n* '''1942''' to '''1944''' \u2014 During the occupation, thousands of local Samare\u00f1os \u2014 men and women \u2014 joined guerrilla groups in the province and helped local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units [[Philippine resistance against Japan|fight the Japanese Imperial forces]] which led to the latter's defeat and started the pre-Allied liberation.\n** The [[4th Infantry Division (Philippines)|4th]], [[9th Infantry Division (Philippines)|9th]], 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters and military camps. The military unit organizations started the anti-Japanese military operations in the province from 1942 to 1945.\n** The 96th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was founded and established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters in the province of Samar.\n** The [[Philippine Guerrilla Forces]] or PGF were established from 1942 to 1998 as a guerrilla resistance organization with headquarters in San Andres, [[Villareal, Samar]].\n* '''September 18, 1944''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the constable 9th Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were ambushed at Barrio Cansumangay in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar]] was fought against the Imperial Japanese force. The casualties almost 31 Japanese and 2 Filipinos killed in action. \n* '''1944''' \u2014 The [[Battle off Samar]] took place on October 24 as [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force warships clashed with several allied naval vessels in a collision course. His forces sank escort carrier {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73}}, destroyers {{USS|Hoel|DD-533}} and {{USS|Johnston|DD-557}}, and escort destroyer {{USS|Samuel B.

Despite being a tactical victory for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], it did not alter the course of the Philippines campaign.\n* '''October 28, 1944''' \u2013 The established of the 9th Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were based at the general headquarters and camp base in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]] among the provincial companies in Leyte and Samar, constabulary battalions, infantry battalions and military-police battalions. Replaced by PC 9th Samar Company was fought by the Japanese. \n* '''1944''' to '''1945''' \u2014 Combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces, including recognized guerrillas, liberated the province of Samar and defeated Imperial Japanese forces. The local Filipino soldiers under the 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 9th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, started the battles in Samar and fought against Japanese troops.\n* '''1945''' \u2014 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers under the [[1st Filipino Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Filipino Infantry Regiment]] of the United States Army began the Battle of Samar and aided the local Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions and the Philippine Constabulary [[9th Constabulary Regiment (Philippine Constabulary)|9th Constabulary Regiment]], the local Samare\u00f1o guerrilla resistance and the U.S. liberation forces defeated the Japanese liberating the province of Samar.\n* '''1965''' \u2014 On June 19, the [[Philippine Congress]] along with the three Samar [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Representatives]], Eladio T.

The province is bordered on the north by [[Northern Samar]], east by [[Eastern Samar]], south by [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and west by the [[Samar Sea]].\n\n===Topography===\nSamar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from {{Convert|200|to|800|m}} high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the [[alluvial plain]]s and [[river delta|delta]]s accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of [[Catubig River|Catubig]] and [[Catarman River|Catarman]] rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the [[Calbayog]] area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and [[Ulot River|Ulot]] rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to [[deforestation]]. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

The government moved to the contemporary city during the [[Tang dynasty]]. It achieved its greatest importance under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (AD 581\u2013618), [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618\u2013907), and early [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the [[New Bian Canal]], which joined the [[Yellow River]] to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at [[Luoyang]] and [[Chang'an]] to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to [[Kaifeng]] robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn 1903 the [[Beijing]]\u2013[[Hankou]] Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the [[Longhai Railway]] gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at [[Lianyungang]], [[Jiangsu]], and westward to [[Xi'an]] ([[Chang'an]]), [[Shaanxi]], as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, [[peanut]]s, and other agricultural produce. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's [[National Revolutionary Army]] opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|tide of invading Japanese]]; however, the ensuing [[1938 Yellow River flood]] also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|title=History Should Not Be Forgotten|first=Israel|last=Epstein|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|year=2005|isbn=978-7-5085-0694-4|page=70}}</ref>\n\nZhengzhou also has a [[locomotive]] and [[rolling-stock]] repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided [[irrigation]] for the surrounding countryside. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The city has an agricultural university.\n\n==Geography==\n\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the [[Yellow River]], Zhengzhou borders [[Luoyang]] to the west, [[Jiaozuo]] to the northwest, [[Xinxiang]] to the northeast, [[Kaifeng]] to the east, [[Xuchang]] to the southeast, and [[Pingdingshan]] to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the [[North China Plain]] to the east and the [[Song Mountains]] and [[Xionger Mountains]] to the west, which are part of the greater [[Qin Mountains|Qinling]] range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the [[Taihang Mountains]] and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of {{convert|7446.2|sqkm}}, including the metropolitan area, which covers {{convert|1013.3|sqkm|1|abbr=on}}, and the city centre, which occupies {{convert|147.7|sqkm|1}}.\n\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends {{convert|150.4|km|abbr=on}}. Mountains loom over the western counties of [[Gongyi]] and [[Dengfeng]] while the easternmost county of [[Zhongmu County|Zhongmu]] is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.\n\n===Climate===\nZhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cwa''), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers.

The government moved to the contemporary city during the [[Tang dynasty]]. It achieved its greatest importance under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (AD 581\u2013618), [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618\u2013907), and early [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the [[New Bian Canal]], which joined the [[Yellow River]] to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at [[Luoyang]] and [[Chang'an]] to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to [[Kaifeng]] robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn 1903 the [[Beijing]]\u2013[[Hankou]] Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the [[Longhai Railway]] gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at [[Lianyungang]], [[Jiangsu]], and westward to [[Xi'an]] ([[Chang'an]]), [[Shaanxi]], as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, [[peanut]]s, and other agricultural produce. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's [[National Revolutionary Army]] opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|tide of invading Japanese]]; however, the ensuing [[1938 Yellow River flood]] also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|title=History Should Not Be Forgotten|first=Israel|last=Epstein|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|year=2005|isbn=978-7-5085-0694-4|page=70}}</ref>\n\nZhengzhou also has a [[locomotive]] and [[rolling-stock]] repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided [[irrigation]] for the surrounding countryside. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The city has an agricultural university.\n\n==Geography==\n\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the [[Yellow River]], Zhengzhou borders [[Luoyang]] to the west, [[Jiaozuo]] to the northwest, [[Xinxiang]] to the northeast, [[Kaifeng]] to the east, [[Xuchang]] to the southeast, and [[Pingdingshan]] to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the [[North China Plain]] to the east and the [[Song Mountains]] and [[Xionger Mountains]] to the west, which are part of the greater [[Qin Mountains|Qinling]] range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the [[Taihang Mountains]] and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of {{convert|7446.2|sqkm}}, including the metropolitan area, which covers {{convert|1013.3|sqkm|1|abbr=on}}, and the city centre, which occupies {{convert|147.7|sqkm|1}}.\n\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends {{convert|150.4|km|abbr=on}}.
