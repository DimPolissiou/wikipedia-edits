The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a [[cockatoo]]. The theme song, \"Telling the World,\" was performed by [[Taio Cruz]].\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]]. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.\n\n''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011 in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], followed by its general release on April 15, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received moderately positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song \"Real in Rio\", but lost to the other nominee, \"[[Man or Muppet]]\" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,<ref name=\"TeleRhap\" /> Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly tame and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.\n\nOne day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] T\u00falio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. Linda initially refuses, but later accepts and they fly to Rio. At T\u00falio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] female longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel.\n\nWhile Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on \"pretty birds\" after his role on a television show had been replaced by a parakeet. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and T\u00falio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his [[bulldog]] friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain.\n\nHe attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel coerces a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the macaws to a Rio-style dance party, where they dance together and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]].\n\nFernando takes Linda and T\u00falio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.\n\nPedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and T\u00falio have spotted the smugglers' parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and T\u00falio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and T\u00falio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]].\n\nDuring the flight, Blu breaks out his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Jewel's wing in the process. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Jewel kiss, and he carries her to Linda and T\u00falio for help.\n\nLater, they adopt Fernando and live in the jungle to help protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Jewel eventually raise three chicks named Bia, Carla, and Tiago together, and celebrate with Rafael, Nico, Pedro, Linda, Luiz, and T\u00falio. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Tyler Blu Gunderson, AKA: Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]]<ref>{{cite news |title=The Real \"Rio\": True Story of a Spix's Macaw |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/15/1065030/-The-Real-Rio-True-Story-of-a-Spix-s-Macaw |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |newspaper=Daily Kos |date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> who was born in Rio de Janeiro but raised in [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], after he was smuggled.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from The Amazon Jungle, but was taken into Rio de Janeiro.\n* [[Will.i.am]] as Pedro, a [[red-crested cardinal]] who is Nico's best friend.\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Nico, a [[yellow canary]] who loves to [[samba]], and whose bottlecap hat functions as a tambourine.\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic [[toco toucan]] fond of Carnival.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] who is Rafael's friend and a [[chainsaw]] expert who has a medical condition of drooling.\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who used to be a TV star, but was replaced by a Parakeet, causing him to have a  strong hatred for \"pretty birds.\"\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Dr. T\u00falio Monteiro, a Brazilian ornithologist.

The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a [[cockatoo]]. The theme song, \"Telling the World,\" was performed by [[Taio Cruz]].\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]]. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.\n\n''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011 in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], followed by its general release on April 15, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received moderately positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song \"Real in Rio\", but lost to the other nominee, \"[[Man or Muppet]]\" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,<ref name=\"TeleRhap\" /> Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly tame and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.\n\nOne day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] T\u00falio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. Linda initially refuses, but later accepts and they fly to Rio. At T\u00falio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] female longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel.\n\nWhile Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on \"pretty birds\" after his role on a television show had been replaced by a parakeet. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and T\u00falio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his [[bulldog]] friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain.\n\nHe attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel coerces a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the macaws to a Rio-style dance party, where they dance together and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]].\n\nFernando takes Linda and T\u00falio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.\n\nPedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and T\u00falio have spotted the smugglers' parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and T\u00falio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and T\u00falio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]].\n\nDuring the flight, Blu breaks out his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Jewel's wing in the process. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Jewel kiss, and he carries her to Linda and T\u00falio for help.\n\nLater, they adopt Fernando and live in the jungle to help protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Jewel eventually raise three chicks named Bia, Carla, and Tiago together, and celebrate with Rafael, Nico, Pedro, Linda, Luiz, and T\u00falio. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Tyler Blu Gunderson, AKA: Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]]<ref>{{cite news |title=The Real \"Rio\": True Story of a Spix's Macaw |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/15/1065030/-The-Real-Rio-True-Story-of-a-Spix-s-Macaw |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |newspaper=Daily Kos |date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> who was born in Rio de Janeiro but raised in [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], after he was smuggled.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from The Amazon Jungle, but was taken into Rio de Janeiro.\n* [[Will.i.am]] as Pedro, a [[red-crested cardinal]] who is Nico's best friend.\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Nico, a [[yellow canary]] who loves to [[samba]], and whose bottlecap hat functions as a tambourine.\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic [[toco toucan]] fond of Carnival.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] who is Rafael's friend and a [[chainsaw]] expert who has a medical condition of drooling.\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who used to be a TV star, but was replaced by a Parakeet, causing him to have a  strong hatred for \"pretty birds.\"\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Dr. T\u00falio Monteiro, a Brazilian ornithologist.

The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]] (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>Classic Football History of FIFA \u2013 Foundation, https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/foundation.html</ref> The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Association|Denmark]], [[French Football Federation|France]], [[Royal Dutch Football Association|the Netherlands]], Spain (represented by the then-[[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid Football Club]]; [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|the Royal Spanish Football Federation]] was not created until 1913), [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]] and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]]. Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.<ref name=\"Filmcircle.com\" />\n\nThe first president of FIFA was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]]. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by [[Daniel Burley Woolfall]] from [[The Football Association|England]], by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1909, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] in 1912, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and [[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1913, and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/52/00/10/fs-120_01a_ma.pdf |title=FIFA's 208 Member Associations |accessdate=1 December 2015 |author=FIFA |date=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]].

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a [[mafia]] family\", highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and [[corruption]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996 |title=BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |website=BBC News }}</ref>\n\nAll testimonies offered in the ''Panorama'' expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan\u2014the highest-level [[African-American]] in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, [[Trinidad]]ian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.\n\n[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.<ref>''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 \"Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe\"], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the [[International Olympic Committee]] had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] into claims of bribery. ''Panorama'' alleged that Havelange accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".<ref>{{cite news |author=International |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa {{Sic |nolink=y|honou|rary |expected=honorary}} president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 interview, American sports writer [[Dave Zirin]] said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership, and that the organization should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.<ref>[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12014 Dave Zirin: Abolish FIFA] (17 June 2014), [[Dave Zirin]], ''[[The Real News Network]]''</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested |title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched |author=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Guilty pleas===\nBetween 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges.

The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]] (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>Classic Football History of FIFA \u2013 Foundation, https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/foundation.html</ref> The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Association|Denmark]], [[French Football Federation|France]], [[Royal Dutch Football Association|the Netherlands]], Spain (represented by the then-[[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid Football Club]]; [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|the Royal Spanish Football Federation]] was not created until 1913), [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]] and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]]. Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.<ref name=\"Filmcircle.com\" />\n\nThe first president of FIFA was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]]. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by [[Daniel Burley Woolfall]] from [[The Football Association|England]], by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1909, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] in 1912, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and [[Federaci\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1913, and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/52/00/10/fs-120_01a_ma.pdf |title=FIFA's 208 Member Associations |accessdate=1 December 2015 |author=FIFA |date=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies.

FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Discipline of national associations ===\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]].

The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a [[mafia]] family\", highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and [[corruption]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996 |title=BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |website=BBC News }}</ref>\n\nAll testimonies offered in the ''Panorama'' expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan\u2014the highest-level [[African-American]] in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, [[Trinidad]]ian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA.

Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.\n\n[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.<ref>''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 \"Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe\"], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the [[International Olympic Committee]] had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president [[Jo\u00e3o Havelange]] into claims of bribery. ''Panorama'' alleged that Havelange accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".<ref>{{cite news |author=International |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa {{Sic |nolink=y|honou|rary |expected=honorary}} president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 interview, American sports writer [[Dave Zirin]] said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership, and that the organization should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.<ref>[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12014 Dave Zirin: Abolish FIFA] (17 June 2014), [[Dave Zirin]], ''[[The Real News Network]]''</ref>\n\nIn May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested |title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched |author=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Guilty pleas===\nBetween 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges.

{"title_page": "Jewish views on incest", "text_new": "'''Jewish views on incest''' deal with the [[sexual relationship]]s which are prohibited by [[Judaism]] and rabbinic authorities on account of a close family relationship that exists between persons. Such prohibited relationships are commonly referred to as [[incest]] or incestuous, though that term does not appear in the biblical and rabbinic sources. The term mostly used by rabbinic sources is \"[[forbidden relationships in Judaism]].\"\n\n==Relationships forbidden in the Hebrew Bible ==\n{{main|Incest in the Bible}}\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] sets out several lists of relationships sexual relations between which are forbidden. Two lists appear in the [[Book of Leviticus]] and one list appears in [[Deuteronomy]]. The lists only mention relationships with female relatives; excluding [[lesbianism]], this implies that the list is addressed to men. Since the lists would then describe women with whom it is forbidden for a man to have a relationship, they also indirectly imply a list of men with whom it is forbidden for a woman to have a relationship. \n\nThe lists are as follows:\n{{legend|blue|Forbidden for men only}}\n{{legend|red |Forbidden for women only}}\n{{legend|#ffff00|Forbidden for both men and women}}\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Holiness Code]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Deuteronomic Code]]\n|-\n!

If it is speaking to everyone, then a woman is not allowed to have sex with her father.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|18:6-7\"/> It also explicitly prohibits having sex with a woman and her daughter.<ref name=\"bibleverse||Leviticus|18:6-7\"/> A man's daughter is obviously also the daughter of a woman with whom he had sexual relations.) The Talmud argues that this absence is because the prohibition was ''obvious'', especially given the proscription against a relationship with a granddaughter.<ref>Yebamot 3a</ref> As with the case of a man's own daughter, the shortness of the list in Leviticus 20, and especially of that in Deuteronomy, are explained by classical Jewish scholarship as being due to the ''obviousness'' of the missing prohibitions.<ref name=\"JewEncInce\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=incest |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=126&letter=I}}</ref><ref>[[Samuel ben Meir]], ''Commentary'', ad loc.</ref> Some say it means sexual relations between father and his daughter are only allowed if the husband is a widower, if the mother has died (and cannot feel jealousy) the relationship is allowed.

Such prohibited relationships are commonly referred to as [[incest]] or incestuous, though that term does not appear in the biblical and rabbinic sources. The term mostly used by rabbinic sources is \"[[forbidden relationships in Judaism]].\"\n\n==Relationships forbidden in the Hebrew Bible ==\n{{main|Incest in the Bible}}\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] sets out several lists of relationships sexual relations between which are forbidden. Two lists appear in the [[Book of Leviticus]] and one list appears in [[Deuteronomy]]. The lists only mention relationships with female relatives; excluding [[lesbianism]], this implies that the list is addressed to men. Since the lists would then describe women with whom it is forbidden for a man to have a relationship, they also indirectly imply a list of men with whom it is forbidden for a woman to have a relationship. \n\nThe lists are as follows:\n{{legend|blue|Forbidden for men only}}\n{{legend|red |Forbidden for women only}}\n{{legend|#ffff00|Forbidden for both men and women}}\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Holiness Code]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Deuteronomic Code]]\n|-\n!

Founded in 1841 at 412 [[Houston Street]] in lower [[Manhattan]], it was known initially as \"Academy of the Sacred Heart\", then later as \"Manhattanville College\" after 1847. In 1917, the academy received a charter from the [[New York State|Regents of the State of New York]] to raise the school officially to a collegiate level granting degrees as the \"College of the Sacred Heart\". The school moved to its current location further north, in a suburb beyond [[New York City]] in Purchase, New York, in 1952. It is near the hamlet of [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].\n\nApproximately 1,600 undergraduate and 900 graduate students attend Manhattanville, with students coming from 45+ countries and 35+ American states.<ref name=Facts/>\n\nThe architectural and administrative centerpiece of the Manhattanville campus is Reid Hall (1864) which was named after [[Whitelaw Reid]], publisher and owner of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', one of the leading newspapers in the nation for a century. On either side of Reid Hall stand academic buildings on one side and on the other residence halls around a central quad designed by the landscaping / architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], also the designer of New York's landmark [[Central Park]] in the 1850s and 1860s. The Manhattanville community regards the central quad and buildings as representing the academic vision of the college's commitment to integrated learning and centered strengths. Other historic buildings include the Lady Chapel, the President's Cottage known as the Barbara Debs House, the old Stables, and Water Tower.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Academy of the Sacred Heart (1841&ndash;1917)===\n\nManhattanville traces its origins to an Academy of the Sacred Heart founded over 175 years ago on the Lower East Side of [[New York City]]. In August 1841 the Society of the Sacred Heart (RSCJ), a Catholic religious order dedicated to the education of young women, established an academy at 412 Houston Street in the tightly packed warren of narrow streets in the southeast corner of [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]] facing the [[East River (New York)|East River]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garvey, RSCJ|first1=Mary|title=Mary Aloysia Hardey: Religious of the Sacred Heart 1809-1886|date=1925|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=New York|pages=78\u201384|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007659972}}</ref>  In September 1844 the boarding school moved to Ravenswood in the [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] section of [[Queens, New York|Queens]].

The first baccalaureate degrees were granted in 1918. The Absolute Charter was signed May 29, 1919.  As the college grew, the city of New York also expanded northward, toward the far north end of Manhattan Island towards the [[Harlem River]] transforming the surrounding area from a rural village to diverse residential/commercial communities of Manhattan bordered by the [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]] and [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] neighborhoods. In 1935, The College of the Sacred Heart was accredited by the prestigious [[Association of American Universities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Patricia|title=A Tradition of Educating Women: The Religious of the Sacred Heart and Higher Education|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|date=1995|volume=13|issue=4|page=65}}</ref> The name was officially changed to \"Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart\" in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manhattanville Timeline|url=http://annex.mville.edu/undergraduate/academics/library/special-collections/manhattanville-timeline.html|website=www.manhattanville.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart (1937&ndash;1966)===\n\nIn the 1930s, the Manhattanville student body consisted of approximately 200 female students.

Manhattanville was a microhistory of the societal transformation in the\n[[Roman Catholic Church]], higher education, and American society as a whole during the 1960s. In 1966 the college Board of Trustees voted to amend the school charter and remove the words \"of the Sacred Heart\" from the official college name. This marked an important moment in the [[secularization]] of the college. Between 1966 and 1970, the Manhattanville administration oversaw the gradual removal of Catholic symbols and traditions from the campus. Although the college had been operated by an independent Board of Trustees since its founding in 1841, it was strongly identified with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and these changes were difficult for the community. By 1969, the College Charter was expanded to include the admitting education of both women and men. The first coeducational freshman class entered Manhattanville in August 1971.\n\nIn 1973 the student academic experience evolved due to an important campus study funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Interviews with the Manhattanville community led to the development of the Portfolio System, a personalized and guided self-assessment charting the development of each student. Today the ATLAS program continues this tradition. In 1965 the college introduced its first graduate program, a Masters of Arts in Teaching. The fifty years since have seen a remarkable growth of graduate programs. Since 1993, the School of Graduate and Professional Studies, now the School of Business, has developed masters and certificate programs in a variety of professional and business fields. In 2012 Manhattanville's Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing Degree Program was formally approved. The first doctoral program was introduced in 2010 with the Ed.D. in Educational Leadership from the School of Education.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wepner|first1=Shelley B.|title=Greetings from the Dean|url=http://annex.mville.edu/images/stories/Graduate_Academics_Education/Alumni/EducationIsLife_Magazine/EducationIsLife_2010-Fall.pdf|work=Education is Life: School of Education Alumni Magazine|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\n\n[[File:ManhattanvilleGraveyard.JPG|right|thumb|Manhattanville Graveyard.]]\nThe university has had 13 presidents and one interim president:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mville.edu/AboutManhattanville/History/ManhattanvilleCollegePresidents.aspx |title=Manhattanville College Presidents |accessdate=2014-08-16 |publisher=Manhattanville College |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217134334/http://mville.edu/AboutManhattanville/History/ManhattanvilleCollegePresidents.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-17 }}</ref>\n# Mary Moran, [[RSCJ]] (1917\u20131918)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mville.edu/academics/library/digital-collections-and-exhibits/campus-buildings/residence-buildings|title=Residence Buildings|last=|first=|date=2018-07-15|website=Manhattanville College|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n#[[Ruth Burnett]], RSCJ (1918\u20131924)\n# Charlotte Lewis, RSCJ (1924\u20131930)\n#[[Grace Dammann]], RSCJ (1930\u20131945)\n#[[Eleanor O'Byrne]], RSCJ (1945\u20131965)\n#[[Elizabeth McCormack]] (1965\u20131974)\n# Harold Delaney (1974\u20131975)\n# [[Barbara Knowles Debs]] (1975\u20131985)<ref name=named>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title= An Acting President At Manhattanville Named by Trustees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/21/archives/an-acting-president-at-manhattanville-named-by-trustees.html |quote=Dr. Barbara Knowles Debs, chairman of the art history department at Manhattanville College, was named acting president of the strife-torn institution today by the board of trustees. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=June 21, 1975 |accessdate=2009-06-25 }}</ref>\n# Jane C.

The school, at the time still an Academy, purchased the Jacob Lorillard Estate in 1847 in a rural village called Manhattanville.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Margaret|title=Second Sowing: The Life of Mary Aloysia Hardey|date=1942|publisher=Sheed & Ward|location=New York|page=240}}</ref>  Over the next century New York City expanded, transforming the area from a farming village to a neighborhood in West Harlem.\n\nThe campus was located between 130th and 135th streets. The eastern border was Convent Avenue and its western border St. Nicholas Terrace. In 1949 proceedings began to incorporate the campus into the existing City College campus. Today it is known as the South Campus of City College. The final remaining buildings from the Manhattanville era are Park Hall (then known as Benziger) and Mott Hall (the Parish School during Manhattanville's time).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lost World of CCNY: Architectural Gems of Our Past: South Campus|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/lostworld/southcampus.html|publisher=CCNY Libraries Exhibitions}}</ref>\n\n===Reid Estate (1860-1949)===\n\nManhattanville purchased its current 100-acre campus in 1949. The first owner of the parcel of land was Ben Holladay who bought the estate in the 1860s and named its Ophir Farm after a silver mine in Nevada.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lucia|first1=Ellis|title=The Saga of Ben Holladay: Giant of the Old West|date=1959|publisher=Hastings House|location=New York|pages=189\u2013192}}</ref>  The Holladay family built a mansion called Ophir Hall, family chapel, and several outbuildings. However, after several family deaths and financial difficulties, Ben Holladay left the estate in 1873.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lucia|first1=Ellis|title=The Saga of Ben Holladay: Giant of the Old West|date=1959|publisher=Hastings House|location=New York|pages=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888 Whitelaw Reid and his wife Elisabeth Mills Reid purchased the property. Whitelaw was editor of The New York Tribune and served various political positions including ambassador to France and England. Elisabeth was the daughter of Darius Ogden Mills, founder of The Bank of California. The Reids remodeled the existing Ophir Hall and outfitted it with the latest home luxuries, including electricity. However, shortly before completion, faulty wiring sparked a fire that destroyed the home on July 14, 1888. The Reids rebuilt under the direction of the famed architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White. This home was designed in the style of a gothic castle and built onto the existing foundation. The Castle was completed in 1892.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Todd|first1=Nancy E.|title=The Chapel at Reid Hall: History of Land of the Site Now Occupied by Manhattanville College, Purchase, N.Y.|journal=The Westchester Historian|date=Spring 2004|volume=80|pages=55\u201357}}</ref> A three-story addition including the East Library and West Room was completed in 1912.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Bingham|title=Whitelaw Reid: Journalist, Politician, Diplomat|date=1974|publisher=The University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|pages=224\u2013225}}</ref> Whitelaw Reid died while serving as the ambassador to England in 1912. Elizabeth Mills Reid died in 1931 and the contents of the house were auctioned in 1935.

In 1974 the U.S. Department of the Interior placed the building on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its historical and architectural significance.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=The History of Reid Castle|url=https://www.mville.edu/sites/default/files/ReidCastle_History_Rev0723_1.pdf|publisher=Manhattanville College|accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Purchase Campus (1952\u2013present)===\nThe new Manhattanville campus was completed in 1952 with six buildings: a renovated Reid Castle for use as an administration building, the library, the academic building, Brownson Hall; the music building Pius X Hall; Benziger Dining Hall, and Founders Dormitory.\n\nThe increasing student population led to the addition of the Spellman Hall dormitory in 1957. The Kennedy Gymnasium, also completed in 1957, was made possible through a grant from the Lieutenant Joseph Kennedy Jr. Foundation. The [[Kennedy family]] dedicated the gymnasium in honor of their daughter, [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen, Marchioness of Hartington]]. The dedication for both the Kennedy Gymnasium and Spellman Hall were held October 27, 1957, and was presided over by [[Francis Cardinal Spellman]], [[Archbishop of New York]]. In attendance were [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy]] \u201811, Jean Kennedy Smith \u201849, and Ethel Skakel Kennedy \u201849. Edward M. Kennedy delivered the dedication speech.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardinal Spellman Presides at Dedication Ceremony|work=The Centurion|agency=Manhattanville College Special Collections|date=31 October 1957}}</ref>\n\nFor the first decade in Purchase, the campus worship space was located in the West Room. The Chapel was completed in 1963 and named in honor of President Eleanor O\u2019Byrne, RSCJ. O\u2019Byrne is the longest serving president with an administration lasting from 1945 to 1966. Dammann and Tenney Halls were the final residence buildings completed in 1966. In 1991 forty-eight faculty and staff housing units added a new dimension to the Manhattanville campus community.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn September 26, 2006 the Manhattanville community dedicated the Ohnell Environmental Center. The center includes a classroom housed within a LEED-compliant, non-invasive structure designed by Maya Lin, architect of the Vietnam War Memorial. The project also included a restoration of the Holladay Stone Chapel, which features new stonework and a glass roof providing a unique reflective space on campus. In 2008 the Berman Center was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campus Buildings - What's In A Name?|url=http://annex.mville.edu/undergraduate/academics/library/special-collections/digital-collections-and-exhibits/2745-main-buildings.html|publisher=Manhattanville College Library Digital Collections and Exhibits}}</ref>  This building currently houses the Communication and Media Department, the Berger Art Gallery, the student-run radio station MVL; the school newspaper, Touchstone; a dance studio and a fitness center. The past several years have seen a variety of campus renovations including improvements to the library, dining facilities, gym, athletic fields, tennis courts and campus walkways. In 2012 the college welcomed Heritage Hall, a permanent exhibition of the college's history.\n\n==Academics==\nManhattanville is a liberal arts institution, offering the four-year Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees to undergraduate students and the M.A., M.S., Ph.D. and Ed.

Castle Honors students also learn how to become effective leaders and give back to the Manhattanville community by organizing Human Rights Awareness Day each fall, and the Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievement Fair each spring.\n\n===Pius&nbsp;X School of Liturgical Music===\nThe Pius&nbsp;X School of Liturgical Music was opened in 1916 as part of the college. It was founded by Justine Ward, who had developed teaching methods for Gregorian chant emulating the techniques of the monks in [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]], and by Mother Georgia Stevens, RSCJ, a musician and [[Roman Catholic]] nun.<ref>Catherine A.

The school's namesake was [[Pope Pius X]], a devotee of sacred music who initiated reform of the [[liturgy]] in the 20th&nbsp;century. The institute closed in 1969. In 2010 a Gregorian Chant, held in Pius&nbsp;X Hall, as part of Inauguration festivities for the previous President, saw a packed auditorium of alumni, students, and faculty.\n\n===Graduate programs===\n[[File:The old chapel at Manhattanville College.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The restored nineteenth-century \"Lady Chapel\" in Ohnell Environmental Park]]\nIn addition to its 45 majors and minors of undergraduate study, Manhattanville College offers graduate master's degrees in ten areas of study and an [[Ed.D.]] in the School of Education.

Founded in 1841 at 412 [[Houston Street]] in lower [[Manhattan]], it was known initially as \"Academy of the Sacred Heart\", then later as \"Manhattanville College\" after 1847. In 1917, the academy received a charter from the [[New York State|Regents of the State of New York]] to raise the school officially to a collegiate level granting degrees as the \"College of the Sacred Heart\". The school moved to its current location further north, in a suburb beyond [[New York City]] in Purchase, New York, in 1952. It is near the hamlet of [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].\n\nApproximately 1,600 undergraduate and 900 graduate students attend Manhattanville, with students coming from 45+ countries and 35+ American states.<ref name=Facts/>\n\nThe architectural and administrative centerpiece of the Manhattanville campus is Reid Hall (1864) which was named after [[Whitelaw Reid]], publisher and owner of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', one of the leading newspapers in the nation for a century. On either side of Reid Hall stand academic buildings on one side and on the other residence halls around a central quad designed by the landscaping / architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], also the designer of New York's landmark [[Central Park]] in the 1850s and 1860s. The Manhattanville community regards the central quad and buildings as representing the academic vision of the college's commitment to integrated learning and centered strengths. Other historic buildings include the Lady Chapel, the President's Cottage known as the Barbara Debs House, the old Stables, and Water Tower.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Academy of the Sacred Heart (1841&ndash;1917)===\n\nManhattanville traces its origins to an Academy of the Sacred Heart founded over 175 years ago on the Lower East Side of [[New York City]]. In August 1841 the Society of the Sacred Heart (RSCJ), a Catholic religious order dedicated to the education of young women, established an academy at 412 Houston Street in the tightly packed warren of narrow streets in the southeast corner of [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]] facing the [[East River (New York)|East River]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garvey, RSCJ|first1=Mary|title=Mary Aloysia Hardey: Religious of the Sacred Heart 1809-1886|date=1925|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=New York|pages=78\u201384|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007659972}}</ref>  In September 1844 the boarding school moved to Ravenswood in the [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] section of [[Queens, New York|Queens]].

The first baccalaureate degrees were granted in 1918. The Absolute Charter was signed May 29, 1919.  As the college grew, the city of New York also expanded northward, toward the far north end of Manhattan Island towards the [[Harlem River]] transforming the surrounding area from a rural village to diverse residential/commercial communities of Manhattan bordered by the [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]] and [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] neighborhoods. In 1935, The College of the Sacred Heart was accredited by the prestigious [[Association of American Universities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Patricia|title=A Tradition of Educating Women: The Religious of the Sacred Heart and Higher Education|journal=U.S. Catholic Historian|date=1995|volume=13|issue=4|page=65}}</ref> The name was officially changed to \"Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart\" in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manhattanville Timeline|url=http://annex.mville.edu/undergraduate/academics/library/special-collections/manhattanville-timeline.html|website=www.manhattanville.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart (1937&ndash;1966)===\n\nIn the 1930s, the Manhattanville student body consisted of approximately 200 female students. Though small, the college made headlines across the country for taking a strong position promoting racial equality decades before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the late 1950s, into the 1960s and 1970s. In May 1933, students created the \"Manhattanville Resolutions\" a document that pledged an active student commitment to racial justice.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Manhattanville Resolutions|url=http://cdm16694.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15052coll3/id/182/rec/5%20Accessed%207/21/2015}}</ref> This commitment was tested when the first Negro woman student was admitted to the college in 1938.

At the annual Class Day reunion on May 31, 1938, she delivered a passionate speech entitled \"Principles Versus Prejudices.\" She stated that education is the key to rising above prejudices.\n\n\"The more we know of man\u2019s doing and thinking throughout time and throughout the world\u2019s extent, the more we understand that beauty and goodness and truth are not the monopoly of any age nor of any group nor of any race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Principles Versus Prejudices|url=http://nyheritage.nnyln.net/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15052coll3/id/184%20Accessed%207/21/2015}}</ref>\"\n\nThe speech went on to be published in several national publications and established Manhattanville as a leader in higher education and human rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manhattanville College of Sacred Heart Epitome of Liberal Interracial Educational Institution|url=http://cdm16694.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15052coll3/id/68/rec/10}}</ref>  When [[Grace Dammann|President Dammann]] died suddenly in 1945, ''The New York Times'' obituary summarized her life's work with the headline, \"Mother Dammann, College President: Head of Manhattanville Since 1930 Dies--Champion of Racial Equality.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mother Dammann College President|work=New York Times|date=14 February 1945}}</ref> Manhattanville would continue its work in social action first through the National Federation of Catholic College Students and to this day with the Duchesne Center for Religion and Social Justice and the Connie Hogarth Center for Social Action.

In 1946, the [[Mayor of New York City]] formed a special commission to investigate the resource needs of the city's public education institutions. Their recommendations would have particularly extensive ramifications for the future of the neighboring Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart.\n\nIn February 1949 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that City College was campaigning to acquire the Manhattanville campus to expand their facilities.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fine|first1=Benjamin|title=City College Seeking to Buy Near-by Manhattanville Plant|work=New York Times|date=6 February 1949}}</ref> The same month, C.C.N.Y. distributed a pamphlet entitled \"No Other Place to Go: A City College Plea for Purchase of the Manhattanville Property.\"  The N.Y.C.

The next two years saw condemnation proceedings work through the [[New York State Supreme Court]] system. Manhattanville was eventually given near $8.8 million ($8,808,620) for the Manhattan campus and buildings.<ref>{{cite news|title=City Buys College Paying $8,800,620: Manhattanville Campus|work=New York Times|date=June 14, 1952}}</ref>  A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the new campus near [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]], in [[Purchase, New York]] on May 3, 1951.

Over the course of the next decade, the student population doubled once again, reaching 1,400 students by 1970.  Manhattanville was a microhistory of the societal transformation in the\n[[Roman Catholic Church]], higher education, and American society as a whole during the 1960s. In 1966 the college Board of Trustees voted to amend the school charter and remove the words \"of the Sacred Heart\" from the official college name. This marked an important moment in the [[secularization]] of the college. Between 1966 and 1970, the Manhattanville administration oversaw the gradual removal of Catholic symbols and traditions from the campus. Although the college had been operated by an independent Board of Trustees since its founding in 1841, it was strongly identified with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and these changes were difficult for the community. By 1969, the College Charter was expanded to include the admitting education of both women and men. The first coeducational freshman class entered Manhattanville in August 1971.\n\nIn 1973 the student academic experience evolved due to an important campus study funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Interviews with the Manhattanville community led to the development of the Portfolio System, a personalized and guided self-assessment charting the development of each student. Today the ATLAS program continues this tradition. In 1965 the college introduced its first graduate program, a Masters of Arts in Teaching. The fifty years since have seen a remarkable growth of graduate programs. Since 1993, the School of Graduate and Professional Studies, now the School of Business, has developed masters and certificate programs in a variety of professional and business fields. In 2012 Manhattanville's Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing Degree Program was formally approved. The first doctoral program was introduced in 2010 with the Ed.D. in Educational Leadership from the School of Education.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wepner|first1=Shelley B.|title=Greetings from the Dean|url=http://annex.mville.edu/images/stories/Graduate_Academics_Education/Alumni/EducationIsLife_Magazine/EducationIsLife_2010-Fall.pdf|work=Education is Life: School of Education Alumni Magazine|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\n\n[[File:ManhattanvilleGraveyard.JPG|right|thumb|Manhattanville Graveyard.]]\nThe university has had 13 presidents and one interim president:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mville.edu/AboutManhattanville/History/ManhattanvilleCollegePresidents.aspx |title=Manhattanville College Presidents |accessdate=2014-08-16 |publisher=Manhattanville College |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217134334/http://mville.edu/AboutManhattanville/History/ManhattanvilleCollegePresidents.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-17 }}</ref>\n# Mary Moran, [[RSCJ]] (1917\u20131918)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mville.edu/academics/library/digital-collections-and-exhibits/campus-buildings/residence-buildings|title=Residence Buildings|last=|first=|date=2018-07-15|website=Manhattanville College|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n#[[Ruth Burnett]], RSCJ (1918\u20131924)\n# Charlotte Lewis, RSCJ (1924\u20131930)\n#[[Grace Dammann]], RSCJ (1930\u20131945)\n#[[Eleanor O'Byrne]], RSCJ (1945\u20131965)\n#[[Elizabeth McCormack]] (1965\u20131974)\n# Harold Delaney (1974\u20131975)\n# [[Barbara Knowles Debs]] (1975\u20131985)<ref name=named>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title= An Acting President At Manhattanville Named by Trustees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/21/archives/an-acting-president-at-manhattanville-named-by-trustees.html |quote=Dr. Barbara Knowles Debs, chairman of the art history department at Manhattanville College, was named acting president of the strife-torn institution today by the board of trustees. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=June 21, 1975 |accessdate=2009-06-25 }}</ref>\n# Jane C.

The eastern border was Convent Avenue and its western border St. Nicholas Terrace. In 1949 proceedings began to incorporate the campus into the existing City College campus. Today it is known as the South Campus of City College. The final remaining buildings from the Manhattanville era are Park Hall (then known as Benziger) and Mott Hall (the Parish School during Manhattanville's time).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lost World of CCNY: Architectural Gems of Our Past: South Campus|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/lostworld/southcampus.html|publisher=CCNY Libraries Exhibitions}}</ref>\n\n===Reid Estate (1860-1949)===\n\nManhattanville purchased its current 100-acre campus in 1949.

Whitelaw was editor of The New York Tribune and served various political positions including ambassador to France and England. Elisabeth was the daughter of Darius Ogden Mills, founder of The Bank of California. The Reids remodeled the existing Ophir Hall and outfitted it with the latest home luxuries, including electricity. However, shortly before completion, faulty wiring sparked a fire that destroyed the home on July 14, 1888. The Reids rebuilt under the direction of the famed architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White. This home was designed in the style of a gothic castle and built onto the existing foundation.

Castle Scholars Honors Students benefit from rigorous, intellectually stimulating, interdisciplinary seminars, all of which are taught by full-time faculty. Castle Scholars can also apply for special funding to complete independent Honors research and creative projects, allowing them to design, implement, and achieve the ambitious goals they set for themselves. Castle Honors students also learn how to become effective leaders and give back to the Manhattanville community by organizing Human Rights Awareness Day each fall, and the Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievement Fair each spring.\n\n===Pius&nbsp;X School of Liturgical Music===\nThe Pius&nbsp;X School of Liturgical Music was opened in 1916 as part of the College.

It is the sequel to the 2011 [[computer-animated]] film ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' and the studio's first film since [[Ice Age (2002 film)|''Ice Age'']] to have a sequel. The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], where the first film was set and ''Rio 2'' begins, though most of its plot occurs in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Featuring the returning voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[will.i.am]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], and [[Jake T. Austin]], with new members including [[Bruno Mars]], [[Andy Garcia]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Rachel Crow]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]], [[Amandla Stenberg]], [[Pierce Gagnon]], and [[Miguel Ferrer]], the film was released internationally on March 20, 2014,<ref name=Cast /> and on April 11, 2014,<ref name=\"Cast\" /> in American theaters. The film grossed $498 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the animation, visuals, and music, but criticism for its story and writing.\n==Plot==\n[[Spix's Macaw]]s Blu and Jewel and their three children\u2014Bia, Carla, and Tiago\u2014are living happily [[Rio de Janeiro|in the city]] but Jewel is disappointed to see her children becoming too domesticated like their father. Meanwhile, Blu's former owner, Linda Gunderson and her [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] husband, Tulio are on an expedition in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and, after a fall down a waterfall, discover a quick-flying Spix's macaw that loses one of its feathers. When word gets out about this through television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along. Blu brings a [[fanny pack]] full of supplies, including a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], much to Jewel's chagrin.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of a group in a line of [[illegal logging]] named Big Boss, discovers Linda and Tulio's expedition to find the macaws and orders his henchmen to hunt them down to avoid disruptions to their work. At the same time, the evil cockatoo Nigel seeks revenge against Blu for crippling his ability to fly, and makes several failed attempts to kill Blu along with his new lackeys, an anteater named Charlie and a poisonous frog named Gabi, who is in love with Nigel. Blu, his family, and their friends, Rafael the toucan, Pedro the cardinal, and Nico the canary, use a boat to get to the jungle. When they arrive, they initially find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in an uncharted section of the Amazon. There, they meet Jewel's stern long-lost father, Eduardo, his older sister Mimi, and Jewel's childhood friend and old flame, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu, but expresses gratitude to him over bringing Jewel back home. Having lost their previous habitat to arson from the illegal loggers, Eduardo is incredibly anti-human, and angrily brushes off Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection. At the same time, Blu is intimidated by the suave Roberto, who quickly bonds with Blu's kids.\n\nWhile searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually captured by the loggers. Meanwhile, Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, as his family are doing, but his continued reliance on human tools prevent him from connecting with anyone. Meanwhile, in another attempt to get closer to Blu, Nigel successfully wins a talent show to become a performer for a Carnival show that Rafael, Pedro, Nico and Blu's daughter Carla are hosting. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the [[scarlet macaw]]s, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally swats Felipe with a branch. The war turns out to be just like football (soccer), and Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory when he scores into [[own goal]]. Blu flies off, upset over his failures despite his best intentions and efforts.\n\nRegardless of the difficulties, Blu decides that he will leave his human roots behind him if it means building a future with his family. He visits Linda and Tulio's campsite to drop off his fanny pack, but discovers that it had been raided. Roberto accuses Blu of betraying the flock, but before Blu can defend himself, loggers storm the area. Roberto, unable to deal with real danger, panics and Blu is forced to save him from an oncoming bulldozer. Blu immediately steps up and orders Roberto to warn the flock while he goes to rescue Linda and Tulio. After doing so, Blu persuades the macaws to defend their homes instead of running away. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, they're able to successfully disable the loggers' machinery. Big Boss tries to blow up the trees instead, but Blu steals the lit dynamite and takes it into the sky where it detonates harmlessly. Big Boss runs off before Linda and Tulio can stop him, but winds up getting eaten by a [[boa constrictor]]. Nigel then attacks Blu in a final attempt to get revenge, but Gabi, while attempting to help, accidentally hits Nigel with one of Charlie's pines filled with her poison; Nigel gives a theatrical death speech before seemingly dying, and Gabi then drinks her own poison to die alongside Nigel. However, it's revealed that Gabi isn't poisonous at all, and an overjoyed Gabi lovingly smothers a dismayed Nigel and drags him away.   \n\nWith the flock now under Linda and Tulio's protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids, though still agreeing to visit Rio in the summer.

Austin]], with new members including [[Bruno Mars]], [[Andy Garcia]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Rachel Crow]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]], [[Amandla Stenberg]], [[Pierce Gagnon]], and [[Miguel Ferrer]], the film was released internationally on March 20, 2014,<ref name=Cast /> and on April 11, 2014,<ref name=\"Cast\" /> in American theaters. The film grossed $498 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the animation, visuals, and music, but criticism for its story and writing.\n==Plot==\n[[Spix's Macaw]]s Blu and Jewel and their three children\u2014Bia, Carla, and Tiago\u2014are living happily [[Rio de Janeiro|in the city]] but Jewel is disappointed to see her children becoming too domesticated like their father. Meanwhile, Blu's former owner, Linda Gunderson and her [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] husband, Tulio are on an expedition in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and, after a fall down a waterfall, discover a quick-flying Spix's macaw that loses one of its feathers. When word gets out about this through television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along. Blu brings a [[fanny pack]] full of supplies, including a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], much to Jewel's chagrin.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of a group in a line of [[illegal logging]] named Big Boss, discovers Linda and Tulio's expedition to find the macaws and orders his henchmen to hunt them down to avoid disruptions to their work. At the same time, the evil cockatoo Nigel seeks revenge against Blu for crippling his ability to fly, and makes several failed attempts to kill Blu along with his new lackeys, an anteater named Charlie and a poisonous frog named Gabi, who is in love with Nigel. Blu, his family, and their friends, Rafael the toucan, Pedro the cardinal, and Nico the canary, use a boat to get to the jungle. When they arrive, they initially find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in an uncharted section of the Amazon. There, they meet Jewel's stern long-lost father, Eduardo, his older sister Mimi, and Jewel's childhood friend and old flame, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu, but expresses gratitude to him over bringing Jewel back home. Having lost their previous habitat to arson from the illegal loggers, Eduardo is incredibly anti-human, and angrily brushes off Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection. At the same time, Blu is intimidated by the suave Roberto, who quickly bonds with Blu's kids.\n\nWhile searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually captured by the loggers. Meanwhile, Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, as his family are doing, but his continued reliance on human tools prevent him from connecting with anyone. Meanwhile, in another attempt to get closer to Blu, Nigel successfully wins a talent show to become a performer for a Carnival show that Rafael, Pedro, Nico and Blu's daughter Carla are hosting. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the [[scarlet macaw]]s, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally swats Felipe with a branch. The war turns out to be just like football (soccer), and Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory when he scores into [[own goal]]. Blu flies off, upset over his failures despite his best intentions and efforts.\n\nRegardless of the difficulties, Blu decides that he will leave his human roots behind him if it means building a future with his family. He visits Linda and Tulio's campsite to drop off his fanny pack, but discovers that it had been raided. Roberto accuses Blu of betraying the flock, but before Blu can defend himself, loggers storm the area. Roberto, unable to deal with real danger, panics and Blu is forced to save him from an oncoming bulldozer. Blu immediately steps up and orders Roberto to warn the flock while he goes to rescue Linda and Tulio. After doing so, Blu persuades the macaws to defend their homes instead of running away. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, they're able to successfully disable the loggers' machinery. Big Boss tries to blow up the trees instead, but Blu steals the lit dynamite and takes it into the sky where it detonates harmlessly. Big Boss runs off before Linda and Tulio can stop him, but winds up getting eaten by a [[boa constrictor]]. Nigel then attacks Blu in a final attempt to get revenge, but Gabi, while attempting to help, accidentally hits Nigel with one of Charlie's pines filled with her poison; Nigel gives a theatrical death speech before seemingly dying, and Gabi then drinks her own poison to die alongside Nigel. However, it's revealed that Gabi isn't poisonous at all, and an overjoyed Gabi lovingly smothers a dismayed Nigel and drags him away.   \n\nWith the flock now under Linda and Tulio's protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids, though still agreeing to visit Rio in the summer. Eduardo finally drops his anti-human stance by wearing a fannypack of his own, and proudly accepts Blu into the flock. Nigel and Gabi are sent to Rio for study, Nico and Pedro's Carnival show goes on, and Luiz the bulldog arrives at the Amazon for a visit.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Anne Hathaway 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Anne Hathaway]] at the film's screening at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]] on April 26, 2014]]\n\n<!-- MAIN CAST AS IDENTIFIED IN FILM CREDITS AND IN CREDIT ORDER -->\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female [[Spix's macaw]] from Rio de Janeiro and Blu's mate<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Blu, a male Spix's macaw from [[Moose Lake, Minnesota|Moose Lake]] who was born in Rio de Janeiro and Jewel's mate<ref name=Cast>{{cite news|title=Twentieth Century Fox Animation Announces RIO 2 Casting|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130222005613/en/Twentieth-Century-Fox-Animation-Announces-RIO-2|accessdate=February 28, 2013|newspaper=Business Wire|date=February 22, 2013|author=20th Century Fox Film|archivedate=June 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130222005613/en/Twentieth-Century-Fox-Animation-Announces-RIO-2|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who seeks revenge on Blu for crippling his ability to fly<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]]<ref name=Cast/> as Gabi, a [[poison dart frog]] and Nigel's sidekick<ref name=\"USA Today\"/>\n* [[will.i.am]] as Pedro, a rapping [[red-crested cardinal]]<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic [[toco toucan]] fond of the [[Rio Carnival]], Eva's mate<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Bruno Mars]]<ref name=Cast/> as Roberto, Jewel's suave childhood friend<ref name=\"USA Today\"/>\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Linda, an American woman who adopted Blu for 15 years and Tulio's wife.<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Tulio, a Brazilian ornithologist and Linda's husband<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Rita Moreno]] as Aunt Mimi, Eduardo's older sister and Jewel's aunt<ref name=Cast/><ref>{{cite web|title=Characters - Mimi|url=http://www.riomovies.com/characters/mimi|publisher=Rio Movies|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] and a chainsaw expert with a drooling condition<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Jake T.

Along with works by other filmmakers such as [[Shuji Terayama]] and [[Donald Richie]], Obayashi's films would develop the tone of Japanese experimental cinema through the 1960s. In these early experimental films Obayashi employed a number of avant-garde techniques that he would carry into his later mainstream work. Though these films tended to be of a personal nature, they received public viewership due to distribution by the [[Art Theatre Guild]].\n\nFollowing his departure from university, Obayashi continued to work on his experimental films while earning a living as a director in the new field of television advertisements. Obayashi's TV commercials had a visual appeal similar to that of his experimental works. In the 1970s he began a series of Japanese ads featuring well-known American stars such as [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]].<ref name=schillingvariety>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/asia/tokyo-festival-nobuhiko-obayashi-labyrinth-cinema-1203381807/|title=Tokyo Film Festival: Nobuhiko Obayashi Re-enters 'Labyrinth of Cinema'|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=27 October 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> Throughout his career, Obayashi directed around 3,000 television commercials.<ref name=varietyrip>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/asia/nobuhiko-obayashi-dies-dead-japanese-director-1234577784/|title=Nobuhiko Obayashi Japanese Director Dead at 82|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=10 April 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He made his feature film [[directorial debut]] with the horror film ''[[House (1977 film)|House]]'', released in 1977.<ref name=dargis /><ref name=atkinson>{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2010/01/12/rediscovering-the-japanese-horror-flick-house/|title=Rediscovering the Japanese Horror Flick House|last=Atkinson|first=Michael|date=12 January 2010|work=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> The film employed a mixture of trick photography and avant-garde techniques to achieve its distinctive, surreal visuals, and has gone on to be considered a [[Cult film|cult classic]].

Along with works by other filmmakers such as [[Shuji Terayama]] and [[Donald Richie]], Obayashi's films would develop the tone of Japanese experimental cinema through the 1960s. In these early experimental films Obayashi employed a number of avant-garde techniques that he would carry into his later mainstream work. Though these films tended to be of a personal nature, they received public viewership due to distribution by the [[Art Theatre Guild]].\n\nFollowing his departure from university, Obayashi continued to work on his experimental films while earning a living as a director in the new field of television advertisements. Obayashi's TV commercials had a visual appeal similar to that of his experimental works. In the 1970s he began a series of Japanese ads featuring well-known American stars such as [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]].<ref name=schillingvariety>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/asia/tokyo-festival-nobuhiko-obayashi-labyrinth-cinema-1203381807/|title=Tokyo Film Festival: Nobuhiko Obayashi Re-enters 'Labyrinth of Cinema'|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=27 October 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> Throughout his career, Obayashi directed around 3,000 television commercials.<ref name=varietyrip>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/asia/nobuhiko-obayashi-dies-dead-japanese-director-1234577784/|title=Nobuhiko Obayashi Japanese Director Dead at 82|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=10 April 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He made his feature film [[directorial debut]] with the horror film ''[[House (1977 film)|House]]'', released in 1977.<ref name=dargis /><ref name=atkinson>{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2010/01/12/rediscovering-the-japanese-horror-flick-house/|title=Rediscovering the Japanese Horror Flick House|last=Atkinson|first=Michael|date=12 January 2010|work=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> The film employed a mixture of trick photography and avant-garde techniques to achieve its distinctive, surreal visuals, and has gone on to be considered a [[Cult film|cult classic]].

Initially, barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines. These barcodes, now commonly referred to as linear or one-dimensional (1D), can be scanned by special [[optical scanner]]s, called [[barcode reader]]s. Later, two-dimensional (2D) variants were developed, using rectangles, dots, [[hexagon]]s and other geometric patterns, called ''matrix codes'' or ''2D barcodes'', although they do not use bars as such. 2D barcodes can be read or deconstructed using [[application software]] on [[mobile device]]s with inbuilt cameras, such as [[smartphone]]s.\n\nThe barcode was invented by Norman Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver and patented in the US in 1951.<ref name=\"patent\">{{cite patent |country=US |number=2612994 |status=patent}}</ref> The invention was based on Morse code<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-barcodes-work.htm|title=How Barcodes Work|date=4 June 2019|website=Stuff You Should Know|language=en|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> that was extended to thin and thick bars. However, it took over twenty years before this invention became commercially successful. An early use of one type of barcode in an industrial context was sponsored by the [[Association of American Railroads]] in the late 1960s.  Developed by [[GTE|General Telephone and Electronics]] (GTE) and called [[KarTrak ACI]] (Automatic Car Identification), this scheme involved placing colored stripes in various combinations on steel plates which were affixed to the sides of railroad rolling stock.  Two plates were used per car, one on each side, with the arrangement of the colored stripes encoding information such as ownership, type of equipment, and identification number.<ref name=\"Cranstone\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nakina.net/other/aci/aci.html|title=A guide to ACI (Automatic Car Identification)/KarTrak|last=Cranstone|first=Ian|work=Canadian Freight Cars A resource page for the Canadian Freight Car Enthusiast|accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref> The plates were read by a trackside scanner, located for instance, at the entrance to a classification yard, while the car was moving past.<ref name=\"Keyes\">{{cite web|url=http://johnkeyes.com/2003/08/kartrak|title=KarTrak|last=Keyes|first=John|date=22 August 2003|work=John Keyes Boston photoblogger.

The Uniform Grocery Product Code Council had chosen, in 1973, the barcode design developed by [[George Laurer]]. Laurer's barcode, with vertical bars, printed better than the circular barcode developed by Woodland and Silver.<ref name=RobertsNYT>{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Sam |title=George Laurer, Who Developed the Bar Code, Is Dead at 94 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/technology/george-laurer-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1 |accessdate=13 December 2019 |work=New York Times |date=11 December 2019}}</ref> Their use has spread to many other tasks that are generically referred to as [[automatic identification and data capture]] (AIDC).

His next inspiration came from [[Morse code]], and he formed his first barcode from sand on the beach. \"I just extended the dots and dashes downwards and made narrow lines and wide lines out of them.\"<ref name=story/> To read them, he adapted technology from optical soundtracks in movies, using a 500-watt incandescent light bulb shining through the paper onto an [[RCA935]] [[photomultiplier]] tube (from a movie projector) on the far side. He later decided that the system would work better if it were printed as a circle instead of a line, allowing it to be scanned in any direction.\n\nOn 20 October 1949, Woodland and Silver filed a patent application for \"Classifying Apparatus and Method\", in which they described both the linear and [[bullseye (target)|bull's eye]] printing patterns, as well as the mechanical and electronic systems needed to read the code. The patent was issued on 7 October 1952 as US Patent 2,612,994.<ref name=\"patent\"/> In 1951, Woodland moved to [[IBM]] and continually tried to interest IBM in developing the system. The company eventually commissioned a report on the idea, which concluded that it was both feasible and interesting, but that processing the resulting information would require equipment that was some time off in the future.\n\nIBM offered to buy the patent, but the offer was not accepted. [[Philco]] purchased the patent in 1962 and then sold it to [[RCA]] sometime later.<ref name=\"story\"/>\n\n===Collins at Sylvania===\nDuring his time as an undergraduate, [[David Collins (Sylvania)|David Collins]] worked at the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and became aware of the need to automatically identify railroad cars. Immediately after receiving his master's degree from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1959, he started work at [[Sylvania Electric Products|GTE Sylvania]] and began addressing the problem. He developed a system called ''KarTrak'' using blue and red reflective stripes attached to the side of the cars, encoding a six-digit company identifier and a four-digit car number.<ref name=\"story\"/> Light reflected off the colored stripes was read by [[photomultiplier]] vacuum tubes.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601032/david-collins-sm-59/ | title =David Collins, SM \u201959: Making his mark on the world with bar codes | last =Dunn | first =Peter | date =2015-10-20 | website=technologyreview.com | publisher =MIT | access-date =2019-12-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] tested the KarTrak system on their gravel cars in 1961. The tests continued until 1967, when the [[Association of American Railroads]] (AAR) selected it as a standard, [[Automatic Car Identification]], across the entire North American fleet. The installations began on 10 October 1967. However, the [[1970s#Economy|economic downturn]] and rash of bankruptcies in the industry in the early 1970s greatly slowed the rollout, and it was not until 1974 that 95% of the fleet was labeled. To add to its woes, the system was found to be easily fooled by dirt in certain applications, which greatly affected accuracy. The AAR abandoned the system in the late 1970s, and it was not until the mid-1980s that they introduced a similar system, this time based on radio tags.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Graham-White|first=Sean |date=August 1999|title=Do You Know Where Your Boxcar Is?|journal=Trains |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=48\u201353 }}</ref>\n\nThe railway project had failed, but a [[toll bridge]] in [[New Jersey]] requested a similar system so that it could quickly scan for cars that had purchased a monthly pass. Then the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] requested a system to track trucks entering and leaving their facilities. These applications required special [[retroreflector]] labels. Finally, [[Whiskas|Kal Kan]] asked the Sylvania team for a simpler (and cheaper) version which they could put on cases of pet food for inventory control.\n\n===Computer Identics Corporation===\nIn 1967, with the railway system maturing, Collins went to management looking for funding for a project to develop a black-and-white version of the code for other industries. They declined, saying that the railway project was large enough, and they saw no need to branch out so quickly.\n\nCollins then quit Sylvania and formed the Computer Identics Corporation.<ref name=\"story\"/> As its first innovations, Computer Identics moved from using incandescent light bulbs in its systems, replacing them with [[helium\u2013neon laser]]s, and incorporated a mirror as well, making it capable of locating a barcode up to several feet in front of the scanner. This made the entire process much simpler and more reliable, and typically enabled these devices to deal with damaged labels, as well, by recognizing and reading the intact portions.\n\nComputer Identics Corporation installed one of its first two scanning systems in the spring of 1969 at a [[General Motors]] (Buick) factory in Flint, Michigan.<ref name=\"story\"/> The system was used to identify a dozen types of transmissions moving on an overhead conveyor from production to shipping. The other scanning system was installed at General Trading Company's distribution center in Carlstadt, New Jersey to direct shipments to the proper loading bay.\n\n===Universal Product Code===\n{{Main|Universal Product Code}}\n\nIn 1966, the [[National Association of Food Chains]] (NAFC) held a meeting on the idea of automated checkout systems. [[RCA]], who had purchased the rights to the original Woodland patent, attended the meeting and initiated an internal project to develop a system based on the bullseye code. The [[Kroger]] grocery chain volunteered to test it.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the NAFC established the Ad-Hoc Committee for U.S. Supermarkets on a Uniform Grocery-Product Code to set guidelines for barcode development. In addition, it created a symbol-selection subcommittee to help standardize the approach. In cooperation with consulting firm, McKinsey & Co., they developed a standardized 11-digit code for identifying products. The committee then sent out a contract tender to develop a [[barcode system]] to print and read the code. The request went to [[Singer Corporation|Singer]], [[National Cash Register]] (NCR), [[Litton Industries]], RCA, [[Pitney-Bowes]], IBM and many others.<ref>{{cite web |first=George |last=Laurer |authorlink=George Laurer |url=http://bellsouthpwp.net/l/a/laurergj/UPC/upc_work.html |title=Development of the U.P.C.

IBM executives at the meeting noticed the crowds at the RCA booth and immediately developed their own system. IBM marketing specialist Alec Jablonover remembered that the company still employed Woodland, and he{{who|date=February 2016}} established a new facility in Raleigh-Durham [[Research Triangle Park]] to lead development.\n\nIn July 1972, RCA began an 18-month test in a Kroger store in Cincinnati. Barcodes were printed on small pieces of adhesive paper, and attached by hand by store employees when they were adding price tags. The code proved to have a serious problem; the printers would sometimes smear ink, rendering the code unreadable in most orientations. However, a linear code, like the one being developed by Woodland at IBM, was printed in the direction of the stripes, so extra ink would simply make the code \"taller\" while remaining readable. So on 3 April 1973, the IBM UPC was selected as the NAFC standard. IBM had designed five versions of UPC symbology for future industry requirements: UPC A, B, C, D, and E.<ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite book | last = Nelson | first = Benjamin | year = 1997 | title = Punched Cards To Bar Codes: A 200-year journey |publisher=Helmers |location=Peterborough, N.H. |isbn=9780911261127}}</ref>\n\nNCR installed a testbed system at [[Marsh Supermarkets|Marsh's Supermarket]] in [[Troy, Ohio]], near the factory that was producing the equipment. On 26 June 1974, Clyde Dawson pulled a 10-pack of Wrigley's [[Juicy Fruit]] gum out of his basket and it was scanned by Sharon Buchanan at 8:01&nbsp;am. The pack of gum and the receipt are now on display in the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

By 1973, the team were meeting with grocery manufacturers to introduce the symbol that would need to be printed on the packaging or labels of all of their products. There were no cost savings for a grocery to use it, unless at least 70% of the grocery's products had the barcode printed on the product by the manufacturer. IBM projected that 75% would be needed in 1975. Yet, although this was achieved, there were still scanning machines in fewer than 200 grocery stores by 1977.<ref name=\"Selmeier\">{{cite book |title=Spreading the Barcode |last=Selmeier |first=Bill |year=2009 |publisher=Lulu |pages= 26, 214, 236, 238, 244, 245, 236, 238, 244, 245 | isbn=978-0-578-02417-2 }}</ref>\n\nEconomic studies conducted for the grocery industry committee projected over $40 million in savings to the industry from scanning by the mid-1970s. Those numbers were not achieved in that time-frame and some predicted the demise of barcode scanning. The usefulness of the barcode required the adoption of expensive scanners by a critical mass of retailers while manufacturers simultaneously adopted barcode labels. Neither wanted to move first and results were not promising for the first couple of years, with ''Business Week'' proclaiming \"The Supermarket Scanner That Failed\" in a 1976 article.<ref name=\"Varchaver\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/t-magazine/womens-fashion/28talk-rawsthorn.html?_r=0|title=Scan Artists| work=New York Times|last= Rawsthorn| first= Alice| date= 23 February 2010| accessdate= 31 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, experience with barcode scanning in those stores revealed additional benefits. The detailed sales information acquired by the new systems allowed greater responsiveness to customer habits, needs and preferences. This was reflected in the fact that about 5 weeks after installing barcode scanners, sales in grocery stores typically started climbing and eventually leveled off at a 10\u201312% increase in sales that never dropped off. There was also a 1\u20132% decrease in operating cost for those stores, and this enabled them to lower prices and thereby to increase market share. It was shown in the field that the [[return on investment]] for a barcode scanner was 41.5%. By 1980, 8,000 stores per year were converting.<ref name=\"Selmeier\" />\n\n[[Sims Supermarket]]s were the first location in Australia to use barcodes, starting in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=World hails barcode on important birthday|url=http://www.fullyloaded.com.au/news/logistics/1407/world-hails-barcode-on-important-birthday/|website=ATN|date=1 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Industrial adoption==\nIn 1981, the [[United States Department of Defense]] adopted the use of [[Code 39]] for marking all products sold to the United States military. This system, Logistics Applications of Automated Marking and Reading Symbols (LOGMARS), is still used by DoD and is widely viewed as the catalyst for widespread adoption of barcoding in industrial uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adams1.com/history.html |title=A Short History of Bar Code |website=BarCode 1 |publisher=Adams Communications |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Use==\n[[File:EAN-13-ISBN-13.svg|thumb|right|[[International Article Number (EAN)|EAN-13 ISBN barcode]]]]\n[[File:LB2-ADULT-L3 Assembled.jpg|thumb|right|Barcode on a patient identification wristband]]\n[[File:Barcodedmail.JPG|thumb|right|Barcoded parcel]]\n\nBarcodes are widely used around the world in many contexts. In stores, UPC barcodes are pre-printed on most items other than fresh produce from a [[grocery store]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This speeds up processing at check-outs and helps track items and also reduces instances of [[shoplifting]] involving price tag swapping, although shoplifters can now print their own barcodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwatchsystems.com/technical/2011/05/02/barcode/ |title=Barcode |website=iWatch Systems |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> Barcodes that encode a book's [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] are also widely pre-printed on books, journals and other printed materials. In addition, retail chain membership cards use barcodes to identify customers, allowing for customized marketing and greater understanding of individual consumer shopping patterns. At the point of sale, shoppers can get product discounts or special marketing offers through the address or e-mail address provided at registration.\n\nBarcodes are widely [[Barcode technology in healthcare|used in the healthcare and hospital settings]], ranging from patient identification (to access patient data, including medical history, drug allergies, etc.) to creating [[SOAP note|SOAP Notes]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Oberfield|first=Craig|title=QNotes Barcode System|url=http://www.qnotes.com/quix/|work=US Patented #5296688|publisher=Quick Notes Inc.|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> with barcodes to medication management. They are also used to facilitate the separation and indexing of documents that have been imaged in batch scanning applications, track the organization of [[species]] in biology,<ref>National Geographic, May 2010, page 30</ref> and integrate with in-motion [[checkweigher]]s to identify the item being weighed in a [[conveyor]] line for [[data collection]].\n\nThey can also be used to keep track of objects and people; they are used to keep track of [[rental car]]s, [[checked baggage|airline luggage]], [[nuclear waste]], [[registered mail]], [[express mail]] and parcels. Barcoded tickets (which may be printed by the customer on their home printer, or stored on their mobile device) allow the holder to enter sports arenas, cinemas, theatres, fairgrounds, and transportation, and are used to record the arrival and departure of vehicles from rental facilities etc. This can allow proprietors to identify duplicate or fraudulent tickets more easily. Barcodes are widely used in shop floor control applications software where employees can scan work orders and track the time spent on a job.\n\nBarcodes are also used in some kinds of non-contact 1D and 2D [[position sensor]]s. A series of barcodes are used in some kinds of absolute 1D [[linear encoder]]. The barcodes are packed close enough together that the reader always has one or two barcodes in its field of view. As a kind of [[fiducial marker]], the relative position of the barcode in the field of view of the reader gives incremental precise positioning, in some cases with [[sub-pixel resolution]]. The data decoded from the barcode gives the absolute coarse position. An \"address carpet\", such as Howell's binary pattern and the [[Anoto]] dot pattern, is a 2D barcode designed so that a reader, even though only a tiny portion of the complete carpet is in the field of view of the reader, can find its absolute X,Y position and rotation in the carpet.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David L. |last=Hecht |url=http://turing.plymouth.edu/~wjt/HCI/ui2.pdf |title=Printed Embedded Data Graphical User Interfaces |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603223227/http://turing.plymouth.edu/~wjt/HCI/ui2.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013| publisher=Xerox Palo Alto Research Center |journal=[[IEEE Computer]] |date=March 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Jon |last1=Howell |first2=Keith |last2=Kotay |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2000-364/ |title=Landmarks for absolute localization |website=Dartmouth Computer Science Technical Report TR2000-364 |date=March 2000}}</ref>\n\n2D barcodes can embed a [[hyperlink]] to a web page. A mobile device with an inbuilt camera might be used to read the pattern and browse the linked website, which can help a shopper find the best price for an item in the vicinity.

In the 1970s and 1980s, software source code was occasionally encoded in a barcode and printed on paper ([[Cauzin Softstrip]] and Paperbyte<ref>{{cite news |url=http://primepuzzle.com/waduzitdo/waduzitdo.html |title=Paperbyte Bar Codes for Waduzitdo |work=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte magazine]] |date=September 1978 |page=172}}</ref> are barcode symbologies specifically designed for this application), and the 1991 ''[[Barcode Battler]]'' computer game system used any standard barcode to generate combat statistics.\n\nArtists have used barcodes in art, such as [[Scott Blake|Scott Blake's]] Barcode Jesus, as part of the [[post-modernism]] movement.\n\n==Symbologies==\nThe mapping between messages and barcodes is called a ''[[symbology]]''. The specification of a symbology includes the encoding of the message into bars and spaces, any required start and stop markers, the size of the quiet zone required to be before and after the barcode, and the computation of a [[checksum]].\n\nLinear symbologies can be classified mainly by two properties:\n; Continuous vs. discrete\n* Characters in discrete symbologies are composed of ''n'' bars and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 spaces.  There is an additional space between characters, but it does not convey information, and may have any width as long as it is not confused with the end of the code.\n* Characters in continuous symbologies are composed of ''n'' bars and ''n'' spaces, and usually abut, with one character ending with a space and the next beginning with a bar, or vice versa.  A special end pattern that has bars on both ends is required to end the code.\n;Two-width vs. many-width\n* A two-width, also called a '''binary bar code''', contains bars and spaces of two widths, \"wide\" and \"narrow\".  The precise width of the wide bars and spaces is not critical; typically it is permitted to be anywhere between 2 and 3 times the width of the narrow equivalents. \n* Some other symbologies use bars of two different heights ([[POSTNET]]), or the presence or absence of bars ([[CPC Binary Barcode]]).  These are normally also considered binary bar codes.\n* Bars and spaces in many-width symbologies are all multiples of a basic width called the ''module''; most such codes use four widths of 1, 2, 3 and 4 modules.\n\nSome symbologies use interleaving. The first character is encoded using black bars of varying width. The second character is then encoded by varying the width of the white spaces between these bars. Thus characters are encoded in pairs over the same section of the barcode. [[Interleaved 2 of 5]] is an example of this.\n\nStacked symbologies repeat a given linear symbology vertically.\n\nThe most common among the many 2D symbologies are matrix codes, which feature square or dot-shaped modules arranged on a grid pattern. 2D symbologies also come in circular and other patterns and may employ [[steganography]], hiding modules within an image (for example, [[DataGlyphs]]).\n\nLinear symbologies are optimized for laser scanners, which sweep a light beam across the barcode in a straight line, reading a ''slice'' of the barcode light-dark patterns.  Scanning at an angle makes the modules appear wider, but does not change the width ratios. Stacked symbologies are also optimized for laser scanning, with the laser making multiple passes across the barcode.\n\nIn the 1990s development of [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) imagers to read barcodes was pioneered by [[Welch Allyn]]. Imaging does not require moving parts, as a laser scanner does. In 2007, linear imaging had begun to supplant laser scanning as the preferred scan engine for its performance and durability.\n\n2D symbologies cannot be read by a laser, as there is typically no sweep pattern that can encompass the entire symbol. They must be scanned by an image-based scanner employing a CCD or other digital camera sensor technology.\n\n==Barcode readers==\n{{Main|Barcode reader}}\n[[File:GTIN Barcodes of coke bottles - what you see and what the barcode scanner see 2 IMG 2908 2913 2919.JPG|thumb|[[Global Trade Item Number|GTIN]] barcodes on Coke bottles.

Barcode scanners can be classified into three categories based on their connection to the computer. The older type is the [[RS-232]] barcode scanner. This type requires special programming for transferring the input data to the application program. Keyboard interface scanners connect to a computer using a [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] or [[AT keyboard]]\u2013compatible adaptor cable (a \"[[keyboard wedge]]\"). The barcode's data is sent to the computer as if it had been typed on the keyboard.\n\nLike the keyboard interface scanner, [[USB]] scanners do not need custom code for transferring input data to the application program. On PCs running Windows the [[human interface device]] emulates the data merging action of a hardware \"keyboard wedge\", and the scanner automatically behaves like an additional keyboard.\n\nMost modern smartphones are able to decode barcode using their built-in camera. Google's mobile [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system can use their own [[Google Lens]] application to scan QR codes, or third party apps like [[Barcode Scanner (application)|Barcode Scanner]] to read both one-dimensional barcodes and QR codes.

For example:\n* Fast-selling items can be identified quickly and automatically reordered.\n* Slow-selling items can be identified, preventing inventory build-up.\n* The effects of merchandising changes can be monitored, allowing fast-moving, more profitable items to occupy the best space.\n* Historical data can be used to predict seasonal fluctuations very accurately.\n* Items may be repriced on the shelf to reflect both sale prices and price increases.\n* This technology also enables the profiling of individual consumers, typically through a voluntary registration of discount cards. While pitched as a benefit to the consumer, this practice is considered to be potentially dangerous by privacy advocates.{{which|date=March 2019}}\n\nBesides sales and inventory tracking, barcodes are very useful in logistics and supply chain management.\n* When a manufacturer packs a box for shipment, a Unique Identifying Number (UID) can be assigned to the box.\n* A database can link the UID to relevant information about the box; such as order number, items packed, quantity packed, destination, etc.\n* The information can be transmitted through a communication system such as [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI) so the retailer has the information about a shipment before it arrives.\n* Shipments that are sent to a Distribution Center (DC) are tracked before forwarding. When the shipment reaches its final destination, the UID gets scanned, so the store knows the shipment's source, contents, and cost.\n\nBarcode scanners are relatively low cost and extremely accurate compared to key-entry, with only about 1 substitution error in 15,000 to 36 trillion characters entered.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Craig K. |last1=Harmon |first2=Russ |last2=Adams |date=1989 |title=Reading Between The Lines:An Introduction to Bar Code Technology |page=13 |publisher=Helmers |location=Peterborough, NH |isbn=0-911261-00-1}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2010}} The exact error rate depends on the type of barcode.\n\n==Types of barcodes==\n\n===Linear barcodes===\nA first generation, \"one dimensional\" barcode that is made up of lines and spaces of various widths that create specific patterns.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Example!!Symbology!!Continuous or discrete!!Bar widths!!Uses\n|-\n|[[File:Australia Post 4-state barcode.png|128px]]||[[Australia Post]] barcode||Discrete||4 bar heights||An Australia Post barcode as used on a business reply paid envelope and applied by automated sorting machines to other mail when initially processed in fluorescent ink .\n|-\n|[[File:Codabar.svg|128px]]||[[Codabar]]||Discrete||Two||Old format used in libraries and blood banks and on airbills (out of date, but still widely used in libraries)\n|-\n| ||[[Two-out-of-five code|Code 25 \u2013 Non-interleaved 2 of 5]] || Continuous || Two || Industrial\n|-\n|[[File:Barcode2of5example.svg|128px]]||[[Interleaved 2 of 5|Code 25 \u2013 Interleaved 2 of 5]]||Continuous||Two|| Wholesale, libraries International standard ISO/IEC 16390\n|-\n|[[File:Code11 barcode.png|128px]]||[[Code 11]]||Discrete||Two||Telephones (out of date)\n\n|-\n| [[File:Code32 01234567.png|128px]]  ||[[Farmacode]] or Code 32||Discrete ||Two||Italian pharmacode \u2013 use [[Code 39]] (no international standard available)\n|-\n|[[File:Code 3 of 9.svg|128px]]||[[Code 39]]||Discrete ||Two||Various \u2013 international standard ISO/IEC 16388\n|-\n|[[File:Code 49 wikipedia.png|128px]]||[[Code 49]]||Continuous||Many||Various\n|-\n|[[File:Code 93 wikipedia.png|128px]]||[[Code 93]]||Continuous||Many||Various\n|-\n|[[File:Code 128B-2009-06-02.svg|128px]]||[[Code 128]]||Continuous||Many||Various \u2013 International Standard ISO/IEC 15417\n|-\n| ||[[CPC Binary Barcode|CPC Binary]]||Discrete||Two||\n|-\n|[[File:Dx-film-edge-barcode.jpg|128px]]||[[DX encoding#DX film edge barcode|DX film edge barcode]]||Neither||Tall/short||[[Color print film]]\n|-\n|[[File:Issn barcode.png|128px]]||[[EAN 2]]||Continuous||Many||Addon code (magazines), [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 not an own symbology \u2013 to be used only with an EAN/UPC according to ISO/IEC 15420\n|-\n|[[File:Isbn add5.png|128px]]||[[EAN 5]]||Continuous||Many||Addon code (books), [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 not an own symbology \u2013 to be used only with an EAN/UPC according to ISO/IEC 15420\n|-\n|[[File:EAN8.svg|128px]]||[[EAN-8]], [[EAN-13]]||Continuous||Many||Worldwide retail, [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 International Standard ISO/IEC 15420\n|-\n| ||[[Facing Identification Mark]]||Discrete||Two||USPS business reply mail\n|-\n|[[File:Gs1-128 example.svg|128px]]||[[GS1-128]] (formerly named UCC/EAN-128), incorrectly referenced as [[EAN 128]] and [[UCC 128]]||Continuous||Many||Various, [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 just an application of the Code 128 (ISO/IEC 15417) using the ANS MH10.8.2 AI Datastructures.

Initially, barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines. These barcodes, now commonly referred to as linear or one-dimensional (1D), can be scanned by special [[optical scanner]]s, called [[barcode reader]]s. Later, two-dimensional (2D) variants were developed, using rectangles, dots, [[hexagon]]s and other geometric patterns, called ''matrix codes'' or ''2D barcodes'', although they do not use bars as such. 2D barcodes can be read or deconstructed using [[application software]] on [[mobile device]]s with inbuilt cameras, such as [[smartphone]]s.\n\nThe barcode was invented by Norman Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver and patented in the US in 1951.<ref name=\"patent\">{{cite patent |country=US |number=2612994 |status=patent}}</ref> The invention was based on Morse code<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-barcodes-work.htm|title=How Barcodes Work|date=4 June 2019|website=Stuff You Should Know|language=en|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> that was extended to thin and thick bars. However, it took over twenty years before this invention became commercially successful. Early use of one type of barcode in an industrial context was sponsored by the [[Association of American Railroads]] in the late 1960s.  Developed by [[GTE|General Telephone and Electronics]] (GTE) and called [[KarTrak ACI]] (Automatic Car Identification), this scheme involved placing colored stripes in various combinations on steel plates which were affixed to the sides of railroad rolling stock.  Two plates per car were used, one on each side, encoding information of colored stripes, such as ownership, type of equipment and identification number.<ref name=\"Cranstone\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nakina.net/other/aci/aci.html|title=A guide to ACI (Automatic Car Identification)/KarTrak|last=Cranstone|first=Ian|work=Canadian Freight Cars A resource page for the Canadian Freight Car Enthusiast|accessdate=26 May 2013}}</ref> The plates were read by a trackside scanner, for example, at the entrance to the classification yard, while the car was moving past.<ref name=\"Keyes\">{{cite web|url=http://johnkeyes.com/2003/08/kartrak|title=KarTrak|last=Keyes|first=John|date=22 August 2003|work=John Keyes Boston photoblogger.

The Uniform Grocery Product Code Council had chosen, in 1973, the barcode design developed by [[George Laurer]]. Laurer's barcode is printed better than the circular QR code developed by Woodland and Silver, along with the vertical bar.\n<ref name=RobertsNYT>{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Sam |title=George Laurer, Who Developed the Bar Code, Is Dead at 94 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/technology/george-laurer-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1 |accessdate=13 December 2019 |work=New York Times |date=11 December 2019}}</ref> Their use has spread to many other tasks that are generically referred to as [[automatic identification and data capture]] (AIDC).

Their first working system used [[ultraviolet]] ink, but the ink faded too easily and was expensive.<ref name=story>{{Citation |first=Tony |last=Seideman |title=Barcodes Sweep the World |work=Wonders of Modern Technology |url=http://www.bar-code.com/upc/bar_code_history.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016084435/http://www.bar-code.com/upc/bar_code_history.php|archivedate=16 October 2016|url-status=dead|date=Spring 1993}}</ref>\n\nConvinced that the system was viable with further development, Woodland relocated to Drexel, relocated to his father's apartment in Florida, and continued to work on the system. His next inspiration came from [[Morse code]], and he formed his first barcode from sand on the beach. \"I just extended the dots and dashes downwards and made narrow lines and wide lines out of them.\"<ref name=story/> To read them, he adapted technology from optical soundtracks in movies, using a 500-watt incandescent light bulb shining through the paper onto an [[RCA935]] [[photomultiplier]] tube (from a movie projector) on the far side. He later decided that the system would work better if it were printed as a circle instead of a line, allowing it to be scanned in any direction.\n\nOn 20 October 1949, Woodland and Silver filed a patent application for \"Classifying Apparatus and Method\", in which they described both the linear and [[bullseye (target)|bull's eye]] printing patterns, as well as the mechanical and electronic systems needed to read the code. The patent was issued on 7 October 1952 as US Patent 2,612,994.<ref name=\"patent\"/> In 1951, Woodland moved to [[IBM]] and continually tried to interest IBM in developing the system. The company eventually commissioned a report on the idea, which concluded that it was both feasible and interesting, but that processing the resulting information would require equipment that was some time off in the future.\n\nIBM offered to buy the patent, but the offer was not accepted. [[Philco]] purchased the patent in 1962 and then sold it to [[RCA]] sometime later.<ref name=\"story\"/>\n\n===Collins at Sylvania===\nDuring his time as an undergraduate, [[David Collins (Sylvania)|David Collins]] worked at the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and became aware of the need to automatically identify railroad cars. Immediately after receiving his master's degree from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1959, he started work at [[Sylvania Electric Products|GTE Sylvania]] and began addressing the problem. He developed a system called ''KarTrak'' using blue and red reflective stripes attached to the side of the cars, encoding a six-digit company identifier and a four-digit car number.<ref name=\"story\"/> Light reflected off the colored stripes was read by [[photomultiplier]] vacuum tubes.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601032/david-collins-sm-59/ | title =David Collins, SM \u201959: Making his mark on the world with bar codes | last =Dunn | first =Peter | date =2015-10-20 | website=technologyreview.com | publisher =MIT | access-date =2019-12-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] tested the KarTrak system on their gravel cars in 1961. The tests continued until 1967, when the [[Association of American Railroads]] (AAR) selected it as a standard, [[Automatic Car Identification]], across the entire North American fleet. The installations began on 10 October 1967. However, the [[1970s#Economy|economic downturn]] and rash of bankruptcies in the industry in the early 1970s greatly slowed the rollout, and it was not until 1974 that 95% of the fleet was labeled. To add to its woes, the system was found to be easily fooled by dirt in certain applications, which greatly affected accuracy. The AAR abandoned the system in the late 1970s, and it was not until the mid-1980s that they introduced a similar system, this time based on radio tags.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Graham-White|first=Sean |date=August 1999|title=Do You Know Where Your Boxcar Is?|journal=Trains |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=48\u201353 }}</ref>\n\nThe railway project had failed, but a [[toll bridge]] in [[New Jersey]] requested a similar system so that it could quickly scan for cars that had purchased a monthly pass. Then the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] requested a system to track trucks entering and leaving their facilities. These applications required special [[retroreflector]] labels. Finally, [[Whiskas|Kal Kan]] asked the Sylvania team for a simpler (and cheaper) version which they could put on cases of pet food for inventory control.\n\n===Computer Identics Corporation===\nIn 1967, with the railway system maturing, Collins went to management looking for funding for a project to develop a black-and-white version of the code for other industries. They declined, saying that the railway project was large enough, and they saw no need to branch out so quickly.\n\nCollins then quit Sylvania and formed the Computer Identics Corporation.<ref name=\"story\"/> As its first innovations, Computer Identics moved from using incandescent light bulbs in its systems, replacing them with [[helium\u2013neon laser]]s, and incorporated a mirror as well, making it capable of locating a barcode up to several feet in front of the scanner. This made the entire process much simpler and more reliable, and typically enabled these devices to deal with damaged labels, as well, by recognizing and reading the intact portions.\n\nComputer Identics Corporation installed one of its first two scanning systems in the spring of 1969 at a [[General Motors]] (Buick) factory in Flint, Michigan.<ref name=\"story\"/> The system was used to identify a dozen types of transmissions moving on an overhead conveyor from production to shipping. The other scanning system was installed at General Trading Company's distribution center in Carlstadt, New Jersey to direct shipments to the proper loading bay.\n\n===Universal Product Code===\n{{Main|Universal Product Code}}\n\nIn 1966, the [[National Association of Food Chains]] (NAFC) held a meeting on the idea of automated checkout systems. [[RCA]], who had purchased the rights to the original Woodland patent, attended the meeting and initiated an internal project to develop a system based on the bullseye code. The [[Kroger]] grocery chain volunteered to test it.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the NAFC established the Ad-Hoc Committee for U.S. Supermarkets on a Uniform Grocery-Product Code to set guidelines for barcode development. In addition, it created a symbol-selection subcommittee to help standardize the approach. In cooperation with consulting firm, McKinsey & Co., they developed a standardized 11-digit code for identifying products. The committee then sent out a contract tender to develop a [[barcode system]] to print and read the code. The request went to [[Singer Corporation|Singer]], [[National Cash Register]] (NCR), [[Litton Industries]], RCA, [[Pitney-Bowes]], IBM and many others.<ref>{{cite web |first=George |last=Laurer |authorlink=George Laurer |url=http://bellsouthpwp.net/l/a/laurergj/UPC/upc_work.html |title=Development of the U.P.C.

IBM executives at the meeting noticed the crowds at the RCA booth and immediately developed their own system. IBM marketing specialist Alec Jablonover remembered that the company still employed Woodland, and he{{who|date=February 2016}} established a new facility in Raleigh-Durham [[Research Triangle Park]] to lead development.\n\nIn July 1972, RCA began an 18-month test in a Kroger store in Cincinnati. Barcodes were printed on small pieces of adhesive paper and attached by hand by store employees when they were adding price tags. The code proved to have a serious problem; the printers would sometimes smear ink, rendering the code unreadable in most orientations. However, a linear code, like the one being developed by Woodland at IBM, was printed in the direction of the stripes, so extra ink would simply make the code \"taller\" while remaining readable. So on 3 April 1973, the IBM UPC was selected as the NAFC standard. IBM had designed five versions of UPC symbology for future industry requirements: UPC A, B, C, D, and E.<ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite book | last = Nelson | first = Benjamin | year = 1997 | title = Punched Cards To Bar Codes: A 200-year journey |publisher=Helmers |location=Peterborough, N.H. |isbn=9780911261127}}</ref>\n\nNCR installed a testbed system at [[Marsh Supermarkets|Marsh's Supermarket]] in [[Troy, Ohio]], near the factory that was producing the equipment. On 26 June 1974, Clyde Dawson pulled a 10-pack of Wrigley's [[Juicy Fruit]] gum out of his basket and it was scanned by Sharon Buchanan at 8:01&nbsp;am.

By 1973, the team was meeting with grocery manufacturers to introduce the symbol that would need to be printed on the packaging or labels of all of their products. There were no cost savings for a grocery to use it unless at least 70% of the grocery's products had the barcode printed on the product by the manufacturer. IBM projected that 75% would be needed in 1975. Yet, although this was achieved, there were still scanning machines in fewer than 200 grocery stores by 1977.<ref name=\"Selmeier\">{{cite book |title=Spreading the Barcode |last=Selmeier |first=Bill |year=2009 |publisher=Lulu |pages= 26, 214, 236, 238, 244, 245, 236, 238, 244, 245 | isbn=978-0-578-02417-2 }}</ref>\n\nEconomic studies conducted for the grocery industry committee projected over $40 million in savings to the industry from scanning by the mid-1970s. Those numbers were not achieved in that time-frame and some predicted the demise of barcode scanning. The usefulness of the barcode required the adoption of expensive scanners by a critical mass of retailers while manufacturers simultaneously adopted barcode labels. Neither wanted to move first and results were not promising for the first couple of years, with ''Business Week'' proclaiming \"The Supermarket Scanner That Failed\" in a 1976 article.<ref name=\"Varchaver\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/t-magazine/womens-fashion/28talk-rawsthorn.html?_r=0|title=Scan Artists| work=New York Times|last= Rawsthorn| first= Alice| date= 23 February 2010| accessdate= 31 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, experience with barcode scanning in those stores revealed additional benefits. The detailed sales information acquired by the new systems allowed greater responsiveness to customer habits, needs and preferences. This was reflected in the fact that about 5 weeks after installing barcode scanners, sales in grocery stores typically started climbing and eventually leveled off at a 10\u201312% increase in sales that never dropped off. There was also a 1\u20132% decrease in operating cost for those stores, and this enabled them to lower prices and thereby to increase market share. It was shown in the field that the [[return on investment]] for a barcode scanner was 41.5%. By 1980, 8,000 stores per year were converting.<ref name=\"Selmeier\" />\n\n[[Sims Supermarket]]s were the first location in Australia to use barcodes, starting in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=World hails barcode on important birthday|url=http://www.fullyloaded.com.au/news/logistics/1407/world-hails-barcode-on-important-birthday/|website=ATN|date=1 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Industrial adoption==\nIn 1981, the [[United States Department of Defense]] adopted the use of [[Code 39]] for marking all products sold to the United States military.

In stores, UPC barcodes are pre-printed on most items other than fresh produce from a [[grocery store]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This speeds up processing at check-outs and helps track items and also reduces instances of [[shoplifting]] involving price tag swapping, although shoplifters can now print their own barcodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwatchsystems.com/technical/2011/05/02/barcode/ |title=Barcode |website=iWatch Systems |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> Barcodes that encode a book's [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] are also widely pre-printed on books, journals and other printed materials. In addition, retail chain membership cards use barcodes to identify customers, allowing for customized marketing and greater understanding of individual consumer shopping patterns. At the point of sale, shoppers can get product discounts or special marketing offers through the address or e-mail address provided at registration.\n\nBarcodes are widely [[Barcode technology in healthcare|used in the healthcare and hospital settings]], ranging from patient identification (to access patient data, including medical history, drug allergies, etc.) to creating [[SOAP note|SOAP Notes]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Oberfield|first=Craig|title=QNotes Barcode System|url=http://www.qnotes.com/quix/|work=US Patented #5296688|publisher=Quick Notes Inc.|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> with barcodes to medication management. They are also used to facilitate the separation and indexing of documents that have been imaged in batch scanning applications, track the organization of [[species]] in biology,<ref>National Geographic, May 2010, page 30</ref> and integrate with in-motion [[checkweigher]]s to identify the item being weighed in a [[conveyor]] line for [[data collection]].\n\nThey can also be used to keep track of objects and people; they are used to keep track of [[rental car]]s, [[checked baggage|airline luggage]], [[nuclear waste]], [[registered mail]], [[express mail]] and parcels. Barcoded tickets (which may be printed by the customer on their home printer, or stored on their mobile device) allow the holder to enter sports arenas, cinemas, theatres, fairgrounds, and transportation, and are used to record the arrival and departure of vehicles from rental facilities etc. This can allow proprietors to identify duplicate or fraudulent tickets more easily. Barcodes are widely used in shop floor control applications software where employees can scan work orders and track the time spent on a job.\n\nBarcodes are also used in some kinds of non-contact 1D and 2D [[position sensor]]s. A series of barcodes are used in some kinds of absolute 1D [[linear encoder]]. The barcodes are packed close enough together that the reader always has one or two barcodes in its field of view. As a kind of [[fiducial marker]], the relative position of the barcode in the field of view of the reader gives incremental precise positioning, in some cases with [[sub-pixel resolution]]. The data decoded from the barcode gives the absolute coarse position. An \"address carpet\", such as Howell's binary pattern and the [[Anoto]] dot pattern, is a 2D barcode designed so that a reader, even though only a tiny portion of the complete carpet is in the field of view of the reader, can find its absolute X,Y position and rotation in the carpet.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David L. |last=Hecht |url=http://turing.plymouth.edu/~wjt/HCI/ui2.pdf |title=Printed Embedded Data Graphical User Interfaces |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603223227/http://turing.plymouth.edu/~wjt/HCI/ui2.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013| publisher=Xerox Palo Alto Research Center |journal=[[IEEE Computer]] |date=March 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Jon |last1=Howell |first2=Keith |last2=Kotay |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2000-364/ |title=Landmarks for absolute localization |website=Dartmouth Computer Science Technical Report TR2000-364 |date=March 2000}}</ref>\n\n2D barcodes can embed a [[hyperlink]] to a web page.

In the 1970s and 1980s, software source code was occasionally encoded in a barcode and printed on paper ([[Cauzin Softstrip]] and Paperbyte<ref>{{cite news |url=http://primepuzzle.com/waduzitdo/waduzitdo.html |title=Paperbyte Bar Codes for Waduzitdo |work=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte magazine]] |date=September 1978 |page=172}}</ref> are barcode symbologies specifically designed for this application), and the 1991 ''[[Barcode Battler]]'' computer game system used any standard barcode to generate combat statistics.\n\nArtists have used barcodes in art, such as [[Scott Blake|Scott Blake's]] Barcode Jesus, as part of the [[post-modernism]] movement.\n\n==Symbologies==\nThe mapping between messages and barcodes is called a ''[[symbology]]''. The specification of a symbology includes the encoding of the message into bars and spaces, any required start and stop markers, the size of the quiet zone required to be before and after the barcode, and the computation of a [[checksum]].\n\nLinear symbologies can be classified mainly by two properties:\n; Continuous vs. discrete\n* Characters in discrete symbologies are composed of ''n'' bars and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 spaces.  There is an additional space between characters, but it does not convey information and may have any width as long as it is not confused with the end of the code.\n* Characters in continuous symbologies are composed of ''n'' bars and ''n'' spaces, and usually abut, with one character ending with a space and the next beginning with a bar, or vice versa.  A special end pattern that has bars on both ends is required to end the code.\n;Two-width vs. many-width\n* A two-width, also called a '''binary bar code''', contains bars and spaces of two widths, \"wide\" and \"narrow\".  The precise width of the wide bars and spaces is not critical; typically it is permitted to be anywhere between 2 and 3 times the width of the narrow equivalents. \n* Some other symbologies use bars of two different heights ([[POSTNET]]), or the presence or absence of bars ([[CPC Binary Barcode]]).  These are normally also considered binary bar codes.\n* Bars and spaces in many-width symbologies are all multiples of a basic width called the '' module''; most such codes use four widths of 1, 2, 3 and 4 modules.\n\nSome symbologies use interleaving. The first character is encoded using black bars of varying width. The second character is then encoded by varying the width of the white spaces between these bars. Thus characters are encoded in pairs over the same section of the barcode. [[Interleaved 2 of 5]] is an example of this.\n\nStacked symbologies repeat a given linear symbology vertically.\n\nThe most common among the many 2D symbologies are matrix codes, which feature square or dot-shaped modules arranged on a grid pattern. 2D symbologies also come in circular and other patterns and may employ [[steganography]], hiding modules within an image (for example, [[DataGlyphs]]).\n\nLinear symbologies are optimized for laser scanners, which sweep a light beam across the barcode in a straight line, reading a ''slice'' of the barcode light-dark patterns.  Scanning at an angle makes the modules appear wider, but does not change the width ratios. Stacked symbologies are also optimized for laser scanning, with the laser making multiple passes across the barcode.\n\nIn the 1990s development of [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) imagers to read barcodes was pioneered by [[Welch Allyn]]. Imaging does not require moving parts, as a laser scanner does. In 2007, linear imaging had begun to supplant laser scanning as the preferred scan engine for its performance and durability.\n\n2D symbologies cannot be read by a laser, as there is typically no sweep pattern that can encompass the entire symbol. They must be scanned by an image-based scanner employing a CCD or other digital camera sensor technology.\n\n==Barcode readers==\n{{Main|Barcode reader}}\n[[File:GTIN Barcodes of coke bottles - what you see and what the barcode scanner see 2 IMG 2908 2913 2919.JPG|thumb|[[Global Trade Item Number|GTIN]] barcodes on Coke bottles.

Barcode scanners can be classified into three categories based on their connection to the computer. The older type is the [[RS-232]] barcode scanner. This type requires special programming for transferring the input data to the application program. Keyboard interface scanners connect to a computer using a [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] or [[AT keyboard]]\u2013compatible adaptor cable (a \"[[keyboard wedge]]\"). The barcode's data is sent to the computer as if it had been typed on the keyboard.\n\nLike the keyboard interface scanner, [[USB]] scanners do not need custom code for transferring input data to the application program. On PCs running Windows the [[human interface device]] emulates the data merging action of a hardware \"keyboard wedge\", and the scanner automatically behaves like an additional keyboard.\n\nMost modern smartphones are able to decode barcode using their built-in camera. Google's mobile [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system can use their own [[Google Lens]] application to scan QR codes, or third party apps like [[Barcode Scanner (application)|Barcode Scanner]] to read both one-dimensional barcodes and QR codes.

For example:\n* Fast-selling items can be identified quickly and automatically reordered.\n* Slow-selling items can be identified, preventing inventory build-up.\n* The effects of merchandising changes can be monitored, allowing fast-moving, more profitable items to occupy the best space.\n* Historical data can be used to predict seasonal fluctuations very accurately.\n* Items may be repriced on the shelf to reflect both sale prices and price increases.\n* This technology also enables the profiling of individual consumers, typically through a voluntary registration of discount cards. While pitched as a benefit to the consumer, this practice is considered to be potentially dangerous by privacy advocates.{{which|date=March 2019}}\n\nBesides sales and inventory tracking, barcodes are very useful in logistics and supply chain management.\n* When a manufacturer packs a box for shipment, a Unique Identifying Number (UID) can be assigned to the box.\n* A database can link the UID to relevant information about the box; such as order number, items packed, quantity packed, destination, etc.\n* The information can be transmitted through a communication system such as [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI) so the retailer has the information about a shipment before it arrives.\n* Shipments that are sent to a Distribution Center (DC) are tracked before forwarding. When the shipment reaches its final destination, the UID gets scanned, so the store knows the shipment's source, contents, and cost.\n\nBarcode scanners are relatively low cost and extremely accurate compared to key-entry, with only about 1 substitution error in 15,000 to 36 trillion characters entered.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Craig K. |last1=Harmon |first2=Russ |last2=Adams |date=1989 |title=Reading Between The Lines:An Introduction to Bar Code Technology |page=13 |publisher=Helmers |location=Peterborough, NH |isbn=0-911261-00-1}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2010}} The exact error rate depends on the type of barcode.\n\n==Types of barcodes==\n\n===Linear barcodes===\nA first generation, \"one dimensional\" barcode that is made up of lines and spaces of various widths that create specific patterns.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Example!!Symbology!!Continuous or discrete!!Bar widths!!Uses\n|-\n|[[File:Australia Post 4-state barcode.png|128px]]||[[Australia Post]] barcode||Discrete||4 bar heights||An Australia Post barcode as used on a business reply paid envelope and applied by automated sorting machines to other mail when initially processed in fluorescent ink .\n|-\n|[[File:Codabar.svg|128px]]||[[Codabar]]||Discrete||Two||Old format used in libraries and blood banks and on airbills (out of date, but still widely used in libraries)\n|-\n| ||[[Two-out-of-five code|Code 25 \u2013 Non-interleaved 2 of 5]] || Continuous || Two || Industrial\n|-\n|[[File:Barcode2of5example.svg|128px]]||[[Interleaved 2 of 5|Code 25 \u2013 Interleaved 2 of 5]]||Continuous||Two|| Wholesale, libraries International standard ISO/IEC 16390\n|-\n|[[File:Code11 barcode.png|128px]]||[[Code 11]]||Discrete||Two||Telephones (out of date)\n\n|-\n| [[File:Code32 01234567.png|128px]]  ||[[Farmacode]] or Code 32||Discrete ||Two||Italian pharmacode \u2013 use [[Code 39]] (no international standard available)\n|-\n|[[File:Code 3 of 9.svg|128px]]||[[Code 39]]||Discrete ||Two||Various \u2013 international standard ISO/IEC 16388\n|-\n|[[File:Code 49 wikipedia.png|128px]]||[[Code 49]]||Continuous||Many||Various\n|-\n|[[File:Code 93 wikipedia.png|128px]]||[[Code 93]]||Continuous||Many||Various\n|-\n|[[File:Code 128B-2009-06-02.svg|128px]]||[[Code 128]]||Continuous||Many||Various \u2013 International Standard ISO/IEC 15417\n|-\n| ||[[CPC Binary Barcode|CPC Binary]]||Discrete||Two||\n|-\n|[[File:Dx-film-edge-barcode.jpg|128px]]||[[DX encoding#DX film edge barcode|DX film edge barcode]]||Neither||Tall/short||[[Color print film]]\n|-\n|[[File:Issn barcode.png|128px]]||[[EAN 2]]||Continuous||Many||Addon code (magazines), [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 not an own symbology \u2013 to be used only with an EAN/UPC according to ISO/IEC 15420\n|-\n|[[File:Isbn add5.png|128px]]||[[EAN 5]]||Continuous||Many||Addon code (books), [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 not an own symbology \u2013 to be used only with an EAN/UPC according to ISO/IEC 15420\n|-\n|[[File:EAN8.svg|128px]]||[[EAN-8]], [[EAN-13]]||Continuous||Many||Worldwide retail, [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 International Standard ISO/IEC 15420\n|-\n| ||[[Facing Identification Mark]]||Discrete||Two||USPS business reply mail\n|-\n|[[File:Gs1-128 example.svg|128px]]||[[GS1-128]] (formerly named UCC/EAN-128), incorrectly referenced as [[EAN 128]] and [[UCC 128]]||Continuous||Many||Various, [[GS1]]-approved \u2013 just an application of the Code 128 (ISO/IEC 15417) using the ANS MH10.8.2 AI Datastructures.

the player who collects it will receive an extra life.\n*''[[New Rally-X]]'' (1981): The Lucky Flag appears as a bonus character on Stage 47 (but it is, once again, not a \"character\" as such).\n*''[[Warp & Warp]]'' (1981): An Orange Berobero appears as a bonus character on Stage 5, and like the TB Headquarters, is \"transparent\". \n*''[[Galaga]]'' (1981): A satellite-like Momiji that only appeared on ''Galaga'' bonus stages appears as a bonus character on Stage 9.   \n*''[[Bosconian]]'' (1981): A regular (this means orange, as opposed to green) E-Type Missile appears as a bonus character, on Stage 8.   \n*''[[Dig Dug]]'' (1982): Dig Dug himself appears as a bonus character on Stage 44, while several Pookas and Fygars appear as enemies and a Watermelon appears as another bonus character on Stage 26 (the Fygars can also breathe fire over walls to burn Pitt & Patti in game).  \n*''[[Xevious]]'' (1982): The Solvalou and a Kapi (one of the enemies) both appear as bonus characters on Stages 40 and 12 respectively.  \n*''[[Mappy]]'' (1983): Mappy, Nyamco, a Mewky, the Gosenzo, a Painting and a Safe all appear as bonus characters on Stages 43, 18, 4, 13 and 16 respectively;

the first two are, as they always were in the old game, joined together by the line that was strung between them.   \n*''[[Gaplus]]'' (1984): A Type 3 Zako, that initially appeared on Stages 21\u201330 of ''Gaplus'', appears as a bonus character on Stage 7.   \n*''[[The Tower of Druaga]]'' (1984): Princess Ki appears as a bonus character upon Stage 45 (and also as a \"high-score\" one at the end). \n*''[[Grobda]]'' (1984): A Green Furossa appears as a bonus character on Stage 14 (Grobda itself was not chosen to reappear in the game).\n*''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985): A Paccet appears as a bonus character upon Stage 27 but he is worth an unusual 10000 points upon collection.   \n*''[[Motos]]'' (1985): A Taitorian (which has no connections to the [[Taito Corporation]]) appears as a bonus character upon Stage 19.   \n*''[[Sky Kid]]'' (1985): The Red Baron (who is named after Baron [[Manfred von Richthofen]]) and a Grave both appear as bonus characters on Stages 37 and 33 respectively;
