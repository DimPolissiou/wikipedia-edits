The fraternity was founded as a result of friendships made while some of the founders fought in [[World War I]] in [[France]].<ref name=heritage35>Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 35. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.</ref>\n\nThe fraternity went on to create new chapters on the campuses surrounding teachers' colleges (at the time also called \"[[normal school]]s\"). Since the Fraternity's beginnings in 1920, they have since spread to more than 175 [[university]] campuses across the United States.<ref name=chapter120>Bernier, William P. \"Chapter Roll\" page 120.

Parsons commented that in founding the Fraternity they wanted to sustain a \"sense of service, responsibility, and affection for their companions.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} These four, together with Allen Ross Nieman, Edward Henry McCune, Carl Nelson Chapman, Buell Wright McDaniel, George Eugene Hartrick, A. Barney Cott, Chiles Edward Hoffman, Rodney Edward Herndon, William Edward Billings, Clarence Willard Salter, Frank H. Gorman, Alpheus Oliphant Fisher, and Daniel Frank Fisher, were the 17 founders of the fraternity.<ref>Anson, Jack L., & Marchesani Jr., Robert F. \"Sigma Tau Gamma\" page III-136. Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities, 20th Edition: 1991.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the founders were members of the [[College literary societies|Irving Literary Society]], but they wanted to create a new fraternity including members of other literary societies. On the morning of June 28, 1920, \"at an unusually early hour\" according to the original minutes, a list containing the names of about thirty men was posted on the college bulletin board by Emmett Ellis with a request to meet that afternoon.<ref name=heritage35/>\n\nAccording to the minutes, \"the notice had the proper effect and, as requested, there appeared a goodly number of men to learn what was in store for them.\" Founder Nieman, who had become familiar with fraternities while attending [[William Jewell College]], was the principal organizer of the meeting. He explained the purpose of the meeting and told them what such an organization could mean to the men of the college. The men elected Leland Hoback temporary Chairman and Emmett Ellis temporary Secretary. They agreed to begin crafting the organization and adjourned until July 7, 1920.\n\nThe founders were accompanied by Dr. Wilson C. Morris to present their petition to the faculty, who had been part of [[Sigma Nu]] in his college days. Dr. Morris became the Fraternity's first honorary member and served the alpha chapter at [[University of Central Missouri|Central Missouri]] as patron, counselor, and advisor until his death in 1947.<ref name=\"heritage36\">Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 36.

McCune recalled later that, \"from the very beginning, Sigma Tau Gamma prospered, both in membership and service. Its challenge to students to live well and promote the spirit of brotherhood was continually being met by those who were seeking membership.\"<ref name=heritage37>Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 37.

The fraternity was founded as a result of friendships made while some of the founders fought in [[World War I]] in [[France]].<ref name=heritage35>Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 35. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.</ref>\n\nThe fraternity went on to create new chapters on the campuses surrounding teachers' colleges (at the time also called \"[[normal school]]s\"). Since the Fraternity's beginnings in 1920, they have since spread to more than 175 [[university]] campuses across the United States.<ref name=chapter120>Bernier, William P. \"Chapter Roll\" page 120. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.</ref>\n\nSigma Tau Gamma Fraternity is an active member of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nicindy.org/about/|title=About - North American Interfraternity Conference|work=North American Interfraternity Conference|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\nFour of the founders (Emmett Ellis, Leland Thornton Hoback, Edward George Grannert, and William Glenn Parsons) had enlisted and served their country together during the First World War in France. Parsons commented that in founding the Fraternity they wanted to sustain a \"sense of service, responsibility, and affection for their companions.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} These four, together with Allen Ross Nieman, Edward Henry McCune, Carl Nelson Chapman, Buell Wright McDaniel, George Eugene Hartrick, A. Barney Cott, Chiles Edward Hoffman, Rodney Edward Herndon, William Edward Billings, Clarence Willard Salter, Frank H. Gorman, Alpheus Oliphant Fisher, and Daniel Frank Fisher, were the 17 founders of the fraternity.<ref>Anson, Jack L., & Marchesani Jr., Robert F. \"Sigma Tau Gamma\" page III-136. Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities, 20th Edition: 1991.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the founders were members of the [[College literary societies|Irving Literary Society]], but they wanted to create a new fraternity including members of other literary societies. On the morning of June 28, 1920, \"at an unusually early hour\" according to the original minutes, a list containing the names of about thirty men was posted on the college bulletin board by Emmett Ellis with a request to meet that afternoon.<ref name=heritage35/>\n\nAccording to the minutes, \"the notice had the proper effect and, as requested, there appeared a goodly number of men to learn what was in store for them.\" Founder Nieman, who had become familiar with fraternities while attending [[William Jewell College]], was the principal organizer of the meeting. He explained the purpose of the meeting and told them what such an organization could mean to the men of the college. The men elected Leland Hoback temporary Chairman and Emmett Ellis temporary Secretary. They agreed to begin crafting the organization and adjourned until July 7, 1920.\n\nThe founders were accompanied by Dr. Wilson C. Morris to present their petition to the faculty, who had been part of [[Sigma Nu]] in his college days. Dr. Morris became the Fraternity's first honorary member and served the alpha chapter at [[University of Central Missouri|Central Missouri]] as patron, counselor, and advisor until his death in 1947.<ref name=\"heritage36\">Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 36.

The SAGA of Sigma Tau Gamma, Summer 1970</ref>\n\nA further fourteen members were added in the first year of the fraternity's existence. Founder Edward H. McCune recalled later that, \"from the very beginning, Sigma Tau Gamma prospered, both in membership and service. Its challenge to students to live well and promote the spirit of brotherhood was continually being met by those who were seeking membership.\"<ref name=heritage37>Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 37.

Sigma Tau Gamma also has a development program known as the \"Path of Principles\". The first eight weeks of the program challenges associate members to \"promote the highest ideals of brotherhood and demonstrate an abiding spirit in which all things in life are done and possible\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://sigtau.org/resources/undergraduate/membership-application/|title=Membership Education|work=Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}</ref> Content is covered during weekly associate meetings held separate from the chapter meeting.\n\n===Awards and scholarships===\nThe fraternity offers scholarships and awards to undergraduates and alumni during the summer convention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sigtau.org/fraternity/awards-scholarships/|title=Awards & Scholarships|work=Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}</ref> The individual awards include the Michael J.

However the return of his ex-wife [[Isobel Kearney|Isobel]] ([[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]]) saw Ellen flee to Fiji and when David followed her and they reconciled, she admitted she was pregnant.\n\nThe following year the two married and not long later, Ellen gave birth to [[Rose Crozier-Kearney|Rose]] (Georgia Bishop). Rose died from [[cot death]] and when David discovered Ellen had cheated on him in grief, he too had an affair with [[Bridget Hastings]] ([[Katie Wolfe]]). However, as the year ended he realised he still loved Ellen but Bridget's diagnosis with a brain tumour led him to stay with her. In 1999 David and Ellen began an affair and Bridget soon left him. The happiness was short lived however when David was diagnosed with a rare disorder that would leave him blind. He retired and the couple decided to move to a lifestyle block in the [[Hawkes Bay]]. David and Ellen did not return for David's son [[Fergus Kearney|Fergus]]' (Paul Ellis) wedding in 2001 as David was too ill.\n\n==Character development==\n\n===Cot death storyline===\nIn 1996, producers decided to have ''Shortland Street'' undergo a [[cot death]] storyline and the decision was made for the character of [[Ellen Crozier]] ([[Robyn Malcolm]]) to undergo it. Needing a suitable father character, writers paired Ellen with the relatively new character of David.<ref name=\"eleventotwenty\"/> Ellen and David had been dating for several months but the arrival of his ex-wife [[Isobel Kearney]] ([[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]]) lead to Ellen thinking the two had reconciled, causing her to flee to Fiji.

It was founded on November 1, 1901, at Richmond College (now the [[University of Richmond]]), and its national headquarters remains in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]. It was founded on three principles: [[Virtue]], [[Diligence]], and [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|Brotherly Love]] (often abbreviated as \"VDBL\"). Sigma Phi Epsilon is one of the largest social fraternities in the United States in terms of current undergraduate membership.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sigep.org/about/facts_national.asp | title=Fraternity Facts - The National Fraternity | work=Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity | accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:OU Sigma Phi Epsilon.JPG|thumb|Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity House at [[Ohio University]].]]\n\n===Founding===\nIn the fall of 1900 18-year-old divinity student Carter Ashton Jenkens, the son of a Baptist minister, transferred from [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]] of New Jersey to [[University of Richmond|Richmond College]], a Baptist institution in the Virginia capital.<ref name=\"spefound\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 Years > Sigma Phi Epsilon Founded|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> At Rutgers Jenkens had been initiated into the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity. At Richmond, which did not have a chapter of Chi Phi, Jenkens was part of group of friends who were meeting regularly under the unofficial name the \"Saturday Night Club\".<ref name=\"spemeet\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 years >The First Meeting|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> By early October, 1901, Jenkens had persuaded the group, which had grown to twelve men, to try to establish a chapter of Chi Phi at Richmond. These men were reportedly spurned by the existing fraternities on campus for their sense of morality (seven of the twelve were studying for the ordained ministry) and for their rural, middle-class backgrounds.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens had convinced the others that their chapter could be different from the other fraternities on campus and assured them that Chi Phi's principles were in line with their own. The group's request for a charter, however, was met with refusal as the national fraternity felt that Richmond College was too small to host a Chi Phi chapter.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens and his friends therefore founded their own fraternity.\n\nAfter several secret meetings throughout October 1901, the new fraternity took shape and on November 1, 1901, the fraternity's first membership roster was publicly posted at the school. It listed the twelve founding members in this order: Carter Ashton Jenkens, Benjamin Donald Gaw, William Hugh Carter, William Andrew Wallace, Thomas Temple Wright, William Lazelle Phillips, Lucian Baum Cox, Richard Spurgeon Owens, Edgar Lee Allen, Robert Alfred McFarland, Franklin Webb Kerfoot and Thomas Vaden McCaul. After much discussion, the group settled on a secret motto and called their fraternity Sigma Phi.<ref name=\"spemeet\"/>\n\nJenkens, Gaw and Phillips then met with a faculty committee to seek official recognition for their new fraternity. The faculty members were reluctant to recognize a sixth fraternity in a school with only 300 students, especially as more than half the members would be soon-to graduate seniors. Additionally, another national fraternity already existed using the name [[Sigma Phi]].<ref name=\"sperecognized\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The First 50 Years > Fraternity Recognized|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013044231/http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|archive-date=2006-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> The founders responded that their new fraternity would be different from the others at Richmond, as was being founded upon biblical, egalitarian principles,<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/> and new members would quickly be taken in from the undergraduate classes to increase the new fraternity's size, and the fraternity's name was still open to debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/who-we-are/history-and-facts/thefirst50years/ |title=The First 50 Years |publisher=Sigep.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-24}}</ref> With these assurances from the founders, the faculty committee approved the new fraternity's request for official recognition. Shortly afterwards, the founders met and decided to rename the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon.<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/>\n\n===Badge and colors===\nThe colors dark red and royal purple were chosen to represent [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|fraternity]], while the golden heart was chosen as the fraternity's symbol. The principles of Virtue, Diligence and Brotherly Love, were chosen as \"The Three Cardinal Principles\". Jenkens also designed the fraternity's badge as a golden heart surmounted by a black enameled heart-shaped shield. Upon the shield are inscribed, in gold, the Greek-letters of the fraternity, \u03a3\u03a6\u0395, and below these letters, a [[skull and crossbones (symbol)|skull and crossbones]]. The meaning of these symbols is divulged during the initiation ritual and known to members only. The founders' badges were designed and ordered before the addition of \"Epsilon\" to the fraternity's name. Thus they had only a \"Sigma\" and a \"Phi\" inscribed on the lobes of the heart, with the skull and crossbones below. A last-minute telegraph sent to the jeweler requested that an \"Epsilon\" be added \"somewhere\" on the already-complete badges, so the jeweler replaced the bottom-most gemstones with a black enameled \"Epsilon.\" The badges of founders Carter and McCaul are on display at the Sigma Phi Epsilon headquarters at the fraternity's headquarters.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nChapter house doors are traditionally painted red. The tradition of the red door on Sigma Phi Epsilon Chapter houses began at Syracuse University (New York Alpha) in the 1920s. Brothers there painted the front door of their house red as a token of fraternalism, because it is a fraternity color. Today, all 260 SigEp chapters have red doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://semosigep.com/page.php?pageid=27|title=MO Zeta of Sigma Phi Epsilon at Southeast Missouri State University - MO Zeta, Sigma Phi Epsilon , Southeast Missouri State University, chapterspot fraternity websites, chapterspot sorority websites, chapterspot.com|website=semosigep.com|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance of transgender members===\nIn December 2014, Sigma Phi Epsilon became the first fraternity in the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] to accept [[transgender]] men as members.

It was founded on November 1, 1901, at Richmond College (now the [[University of Richmond]]), and its national headquarters remains in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]. It was founded on three principles: [[Virtue]], [[Diligence]], and [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|Brotherly Love]] (often abbreviated as \"VDBL\"). Sigma Phi Epsilon is one of the largest social fraternities in the United States in terms of current undergraduate membership.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sigep.org/about/facts_national.asp | title=Fraternity Facts - The National Fraternity | work=Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity | accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:OU Sigma Phi Epsilon.JPG|thumb|Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity House at [[Ohio University]].]]\n\n===Founding===\nIn the fall of 1900 18-year-old divinity student Carter Ashton Jenkens, the son of a Baptist minister, transferred from [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]] of New Jersey to [[University of Richmond|Richmond College]], a Baptist institution in the Virginia capital.<ref name=\"spefound\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 Years > Sigma Phi Epsilon Founded|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> At Rutgers Jenkens had been initiated into the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity. At Richmond, which did not have a chapter of Chi Phi, Jenkens was part of group of friends who were meeting regularly under the unofficial name the \"Saturday Night Club\".<ref name=\"spemeet\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 years >The First Meeting|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> By early October, 1901, Jenkens had persuaded the group, which had grown to twelve men, to try to establish a chapter of Chi Phi at Richmond. These men were reportedly spurned by the existing fraternities on campus for their sense of morality (seven of the twelve were studying for the ordained ministry) and for their rural, middle-class backgrounds.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens had convinced the others that their chapter could be different from the other fraternities on campus and assured them that Chi Phi's principles were in line with their own. The group's request for a charter, however, was met with refusal as the national fraternity felt that Richmond College was too small to host a Chi Phi chapter.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens and his friends therefore founded their own fraternity.\n\nAfter several secret meetings throughout October 1901, the new fraternity took shape and on November 1, 1901, the fraternity's first membership roster was publicly posted at the school. It listed the twelve founding members in this order: Carter Ashton Jenkens, Benjamin Donald Gaw, William Hugh Carter, William Andrew Wallace, Thomas Temple Wright, William Lazelle Phillips, Lucian Baum Cox, Richard Spurgeon Owens, Edgar Lee Allen, Robert Alfred McFarland, Franklin Webb Kerfoot and Thomas Vaden McCaul. After much discussion, the group settled on a secret motto and called their fraternity Sigma Phi.<ref name=\"spemeet\"/>\n\nJenkens, Gaw and Phillips then met with a faculty committee to seek official recognition for their new fraternity. The faculty members were reluctant to recognize a sixth fraternity in a school with only 300 students, especially as more than half the members would be soon-to graduate seniors. Additionally, another national fraternity already existed using the name [[Sigma Phi]].<ref name=\"sperecognized\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The First 50 Years > Fraternity Recognized|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013044231/http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|archive-date=2006-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> The founders responded that their new fraternity would be different from the others at Richmond, as was being founded upon biblical, egalitarian principles,<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/> and new members would quickly be taken in from the undergraduate classes to increase the new fraternity's size, and the fraternity's name was still open to debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/who-we-are/history-and-facts/thefirst50years/ |title=The First 50 Years |publisher=Sigep.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-24}}</ref> With these assurances from the founders, the faculty committee approved the new fraternity's request for official recognition. Shortly afterwards, the founders met and decided to rename the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon.<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/>\n\n===Badge and colors===\nThe colors dark red and royal purple were chosen to represent [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|fraternity]], while the golden heart was chosen as the fraternity's symbol. The principles of Virtue, Diligence and Brotherly Love, were chosen as \"The Three Cardinal Principles\". Jenkens also designed the fraternity's badge as a golden heart surmounted by a black enameled heart-shaped shield. Upon the shield are inscribed, in gold, the Greek-letters of the fraternity, \u03a3\u03a6\u0395, and below these letters, a [[skull and crossbones (symbol)|skull and crossbones]]. The meaning of these symbols is divulged during the initiation ritual and known to members only. The founders' badges were designed and ordered before the addition of \"Epsilon\" to the fraternity's name. Thus they had only a \"Sigma\" and a \"Phi\" inscribed on the lobes of the heart, with the skull and crossbones below. A last-minute telegraph sent to the jeweler requested that an \"Epsilon\" be added \"somewhere\" on the already-complete badges, so the jeweler replaced the bottom-most gemstones with a black enameled \"Epsilon.\" The badges of founders Carter and McCaul are on display at the Sigma Phi Epsilon headquarters at the fraternity's headquarters.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nChapter house doors are traditionally painted red. The tradition of the red door on Sigma Phi Epsilon Chapter houses began at Syracuse University (New York Alpha) in the 1920s. Brothers there painted the front door of their house red as a token of fraternalism, because it is a fraternity color.

It was released on October 22, 2012, by [[Big Machine Records]]. Inspired by past romantic relationships evoking \"[[Red#Symbolism|red]]\" intense, tumultuous emotions that Swift was experiencing during conception of the project, the album touches on the themes of romance and heartbreak, but represents a mature perspective, while exploring the pressure of being in the public eye. Featuring collaborations with [[Gary Lightbody]] and [[Ed Sheeran]], ''Red'' is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Rock music|rock]] album with influences from [[arena rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[dance]], [[dubstep]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[heartland rock]].\n\nVarious commentators described ''Red'' as a [[pop music|pop]] album, while some others said it was Swift transitioning from her [[country music|country]] roots to mainstream pop, which they found to be subsequently complete with its follow-up ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). ''Red'' was generally well received by critics, who complimented Swift's songwriting craftsmanship, but were divided on the incorporation of various genres, which received praise regarding Swift's emerging versatility and criticism for being inconsistent. The album is included on several year-end and decade-end lists by numerous publications. ''Red'' received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It was also nominated for Album of the Year at the [[2013 Country Music Association Awards]].

It was Swift's first chart-topper in the UK, and also topped charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. It has sold 4.4 million pure copies in the US. As of December 2017, ''Red'' was certified [[RIAA certification|7\u00d7 Platinum]] by [[Recording Industry Association of America]], for moving over seven million units in the country. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Red'' was the second best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 5.2 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpi.org/downloads/dmr2013-full-report_english.pdf|title=The Global Bestsellers of 2012|page=11|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=10 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409080309/http://www.aria.com.au/documents/RIN2013.pdf|archivedate=9 April 2013}}</ref> \n\n''Red'' was supported by seven singles, four of which peaked in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: the lead single \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\" topped the chart for three weeks, \"[[Begin Again (Taylor Swift song)|Begin Again]]\" and \"[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]\" peaked at numbers seven and two respectively, and the [[Red (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] at number six.

It was released on October 22, 2012, by [[Big Machine Records]]. Inspired by past romantic relationships evoking \"[[Red#Symbolism|red]]\" intense, tumultuous emotions that Swift was experiencing during conception of the project, the album touches on the themes of romance and heartbreak, but represents a mature perspective, while exploring the pressure of being in the public eye. Featuring collaborations with [[Gary Lightbody]] and [[Ed Sheeran]], ''Red'' is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Rock music|rock]] album with influences from [[arena rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[dance]], [[dubstep]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[heartland rock]].\n\nVarious commentators described ''Red'' as a [[pop music|pop]] album, while some others said it was Swift transitioning from her [[country music|country]] roots to mainstream pop, which they found to be subsequently complete with its follow-up ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). ''Red'' was generally well received by critics, who complimented Swift's songwriting craftsmanship, but were divided on the incorporation of various genres, which received praise regarding Swift's emerging versatility and criticism for being inconsistent. The album is included on several year-end and decade-end lists by numerous publications. ''Red'' received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It was also nominated for Album of the Year at the [[2013 Country Music Association Awards]]. In their aggregate decade-end list, [[Metacritic]] has ranked ''Red'' as one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the 2010s.<ref name = \"Metacritic\">{{cite web|title= Best Albums of the Decade (2010-19)|url= https://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-albums-of-the-decade-2010s|work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[Metacritic]] - CBS Interactive Inc.|date=January 11, 2020 |accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Red'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 1.2&nbsp;million copies, giving Swift her third consecutive number-one album and making her the first female artist to have two million-selling album openings. It was Swift's first chart-topper in the UK, and also topped charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. It has sold 4.4 million pure copies in the US. As of December 2017, ''Red'' was certified [[RIAA certification|7\u00d7 Platinum]] by [[Recording Industry Association of America]], for moving over seven million units in the country. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Red'' was the second best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 5.2 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpi.org/downloads/dmr2013-full-report_english.pdf|title=The Global Bestsellers of 2012|page=11|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=10 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409080309/http://www.aria.com.au/documents/RIN2013.pdf|archivedate=9 April 2013}}</ref> \n\n''Red'' was supported by seven singles, four of which peaked in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: the lead single \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\" topped the chart for three weeks, \"[[Begin Again (Taylor Swift song)|Begin Again]]\" and \"[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]\" peaked at numbers seven and two respectively, and the [[Red (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] at number six.
