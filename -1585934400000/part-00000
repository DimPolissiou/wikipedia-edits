From left: [[General of the Infantry]] [[Hermann Reinecke]]; Dr. [[Roland Freisler]], president of the court; Ernst Lautz, chief public prosecutor|300px]]\n\nThe '''People's Court''' ({{lang-de|Volksgerichtshof}}) was a ''{{lang|de|[[Sondergericht]]}}'' (\"special court\") of [[Nazi Germany]], set up outside the operations of the constitutional frame of law. Its headquarters were originally located in the former [[Prussian House of Lords]] in Berlin, later moved to the former [[Wilhelmsgymnasium (K\u00f6nigsberg)|K\u00f6nigsberg Wilhelmsgymnasium]] at Bellevuestrasse 15 in [[Potsdamer Platz]] (the location now occupied by the [[Sony Center]]; a marker is located on the sidewalk nearby).<ref>[http://www.crimefilenews.com/2013/07/meet-peoples-court.html Crime, Guns, and Videotape: Meet \"The People's Court\"]</ref>\n\nThe court was established in 1933 by order of [[Nazism|Nazi]] leader Adolf Hitler, in response to his dissatisfaction at the outcome of the [[Reichstag fire#Reichstag fire trial|Reichstag fire trial]], in which all but one of the defendants were acquitted. The court had jurisdiction over a rather broad array of \"political offenses\", which included crimes like [[black market]]eering, work slowdowns, [[defeatism]], and treason against the Third Reich. These crimes were viewed by the court as ''[[Wehrkraftzersetzung]]'' (\"disintegration of defensive capability\") and were accordingly punished severely; the death penalty was meted out in numerous cases.\n\nThe Court handed down an enormous number of death sentences under Judge-President [[Roland Freisler]], including those that followed the [[20 July plot|plot to kill Hitler]] on 20 July 1944. Many of those found guilty by the Court were executed in [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]] in Berlin. The proceedings of the court were often even less than [[show trials]] in that some cases, such as that of [[Sophie Scholl]] and her brother [[Hans Scholl]] and fellow [[White Rose]] activists, trials were concluded in less than an hour without evidence being presented or arguments made by either side. The president of the court often acted as prosecutor, denouncing defendants, then pronouncing his verdict and sentence without objection from defense counsel, who usually remained silent throughout. It almost always sided with the prosecution, to the point that being hauled before it was tantamount to a death sentence. While Nazi Germany was not a [[rule of law]] state, the People's Court frequently dispensed with even the nominal laws and procedures of regular German trials, and was thus easily characterized as a [[kangaroo court]].\n\n==Manner of proceedings==\n\nThere was no [[presumption of innocence]] nor could the defendants adequately represent themselves or consult counsel. A proceeding at the People's Court would follow an initial indictment in which a state or city prosecutor would forward the names of the accused to the ''Volksgerichtshof'' for charges of a political nature. Defendants were hardly ever allowed to speak to their attorneys beforehand and when they did the defense lawyer would usually simply answer questions about how the trial would proceed and refrain from any legal advice. In at least one documented case (the trial of the \"White Rose\" conspirators), the defense lawyer assigned to Sophie Scholl chastised her the day before the trial, stating that she would pay for her crimes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe People's Court proceedings began when the accused were led to a prisoner's dock under armed police escort. The presiding judge would read the charges and then call the accused forward for \"examination\". Although the court had a prosecutor, it was usually the judge who asked the questions. Defendants were often berated during the examination and never allowed to respond with any sort of lengthy reply. After a barrage of insults and condemnation, the accused would be ordered back to the dock with the order \"examination concluded\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAfter examination, the defense attorney would be asked if they had any statements or questions. Defense lawyers were present simply as a formality and hardly ever rose to speak. The judge would then ask the defendants for a statement during which time more insults and berating comments would be shouted at the accused. The verdict, which was almost always \"guilty\", would then be announced and the sentence handed down at the same time. In all, an appearance before the People's Court could take as little as fifteen minutes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFrom 1934 to 1945, the court sentenced 10,980 people to prison and imposed the death penalty on 5,179 more who were convicted of high treason.<ref>Wachsmann, ''Hitler's Prisons: Legal Terror in Nazi Germany''.

In some cases, this was due to defense lawyers presenting the accused as naive or the defendant adequately explaining the nature of the political charges against them. However, in nearly two-thirds of such cases, the defendants would be [[Double jeopardy|re-arrested]] by the [[Gestapo]] following the trial and sent to a [[concentration camp]]. After the defeat at Stalingrad, and with a growing fear in the German government regarding defeatism amongst the population, the People's Court became far more ruthless and hardly anyone brought before the tribunal escaped a guilty verdict.<ref>Roberts, G., ''Victory at Stalingrad: The Battle That Changed History'', Routledge (2002), {{ISBN|0582771854}}</ref>\n\n==Trials of August 1944==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 151-12-16, Volksgerichtshof, Erwin v.

The first eight men accused were [[Erwin von Witzleben]], [[Erich Hoepner]], [[Paul von Hase]], [[Peter Yorck von Wartenburg]], [[Helmuth Stieff]], [[Robert Bernardis]], [[Friedrich Klausing]], and [[Albrecht von Hagen]].

There were around 300 spectators, including [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] and selected civil servants, party functionaries, military officers and journalists. A film camera ran behind the red-robed Roland Freisler so that Hitler could view the proceedings, and to provide footage for newsreels and a documentary entitled ''Traitors Before the People's Court''.<ref name=\"won283\">Robert Edwin Hertzstein, ''The War That Hitler Won'' p283 {{ISBN|0-399-11845-4}}</ref> Intended to be used in ''[[Die Deutsche Wochenschau|The German Weekly Review]]'', it was not shown at the time, and turned out to be the last documentary made for the newsreel.<ref name=\"won283\"/>\n\nThe accused were forced to wear shabby clothes, denied neck ties and belts or suspenders for their pants, and were marched into the courtroom handcuffed to policemen. The proceedings began with Freisler announcing he would rule on \"...the most horrific charges ever brought in the history of the German people.\" Freisler was an admirer of [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], the chief prosecutor of the [[Great Purge#Moscow Trials|Soviet purge trials]], and copied Vyshinsky's practice of heaping loud and violent abuse on defendants.\n\nThe 62-year-old [[Field Marshal]] von Witzleben was the first to stand before Freisler and he was immediately castigated for giving a brief Nazi salute. He faced further humiliating insults while holding onto his trouser waistband. Next, former [[Colonel-General]] Erich Hoepner, dressed in a cardigan, faced Freisler, who addressed him as \"''Schweinehund''\". When he said that he was not a ''Schweinehund'', Freisler asked him what zoological category he thought he fitted into.\n\nThe accused were unable to consult their lawyers, who were not seated near them. None of them were allowed to address the court at length, and Freisler interrupted any attempts to do so. However, Major General [[Helmuth Stieff]] attempted to raise the issue of his motives before being shouted down, and Witzleben managed to call out \"You may hand us over to the executioner, but in three months' time, the disgusted and harried people will bring you to book and drag you alive through the dirt in the streets!\" All were condemned to death by hanging, and the sentences were carried out shortly afterwards in [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]].\n\nAnother trial of plotters was held on 10 August. On that occasion the accused were [[Erich Fellgiebel]], [[Alfred Kranzfelder]], [[Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg]], [[Georg Hansen]], and [[Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]].\n\nOn 15 August, [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf]], [[Egbert Hayessen]], [[Hans Bernd von Haeften]], and [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]] were condemned to death by Freisler.\n\nOn 21 August, the accused were [[Fritz Thiele]], [[Friedrich Gustav Jaeger]], and [[Ulrich Wilhelm Graf Schwerin von Schwanenfeld]] who was able to mention the \"...many murders committed at home and abroad\" as a motivation for his actions.\n\nOn 30 August, Colonel-General [[Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel]], who had blinded himself in a suicide attempt, was led into the court and condemned to death along with [[Caesar von Hofacker]], [[Hans Otfried von Linstow]], and [[Eberhard Finckh]].\n\n==Bombing==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P054489, Berlin, Ruine des Volksgerichtshofes.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the People's Court, as photographed in 1951]]\nField Marshal von Witzleben's prediction of Roland Freisler's fate proved slightly incorrect, as he died in a bombing raid in February 1945, approximately half a year later.<ref name=Nemesis>{{cite book|date=2000|author=Ian Kershaw|author-link=Ian Kershaw|isbn=0-393-32252-1|title= Hitler 1936\u20131945: Nemesis|publisher=Penguin Press}}</ref><ref name=\"PlottingHitler'sDeath\">{{cite book|date=1994|author=Joachim Fest|author-link=Joachim Fest|isbn=0-297-81774-4|title=[[Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933\u20131945]]|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1945, Freisler was conducting a Saturday session of the People's Court, when [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] bombers [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II#The largest American raid on Berlin|attacked Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://100thbg.com/index.php?option=com_bombgrp&view=personnel&id=4475&Itemid=334 |title=100th Bomb Group Foundation - Personnel - Lt Col  Robert Rosenthal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=100thbg.com |publisher=100th Bomb Group Foundation |access-date=December 5, 2016 |quote=Dec 1, 1944-Feb 3, 1945 - 418th BS, 100th BG (H) ETOUSAAF (8AF) Squadron Commander, 55 hours, B-17 Air Leader 5 c/m (combat missions) 45 c/hrs (combat hours) 1 Division Lead (Berlin Feb 3, 1945, shot down, picked up by Russians and returned to England) Acting Command 4 Wing Leads, Pilot Feb 3, 1945 - BERLIN - MACR #12046, - A/C#44 8379}}</ref>  Government and Nazi Party buildings were hit, including the Reich Chancellery, the Gestapo headquarters, the Party Chancellery and the People's Court.

From left: [[General of the Infantry]] [[Hermann Reinecke]]; Dr. [[Roland Freisler]], president of the court; Ernst Lautz, chief public prosecutor|300px]]\n\nThe '''People's Court''' ({{lang-de|Volksgerichtshof}}) was a ''{{lang|de|[[Sondergericht]]}}'' (\"special court\") of [[Nazi Germany]], set up outside the operations of the constitutional frame of law. Its headquarters were originally located in the former [[Prussian House of Lords]] in Berlin, later moved to the former [[Wilhelmsgymnasium (K\u00f6nigsberg)|K\u00f6nigsberg Wilhelmsgymnasium]] at Bellevuestrasse 15 in [[Potsdamer Platz]] (the location now occupied by the [[Sony Center]]; a marker is located on the sidewalk nearby).<ref>[http://www.crimefilenews.com/2013/07/meet-peoples-court.html Crime, Guns, and Videotape: Meet \"The People's Court\"]</ref>\n\nThe court was established in 1933 by order of [[Nazism|Nazi]] leader Adolf Hitler, in response to his dissatisfaction at the outcome of the [[Reichstag fire#Reichstag fire trial|Reichstag fire trial]], in which all but one of the defendants were acquitted. The court had jurisdiction over a rather broad array of \"political offenses\", which included crimes like [[black market]]eering, work slowdowns, [[defeatism]], and treason against the Third Reich. These crimes were viewed by the court as ''[[Wehrkraftzersetzung]]'' (\"disintegration of defensive capability\") and were accordingly punished severely; the death penalty was meted out in numerous cases.\n\nThe Court handed down an enormous number of death sentences under Judge-President [[Roland Freisler]], including those that followed the [[20 July plot|plot to kill Hitler]] on 20 July 1944. Many of those found guilty by the Court were executed in [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]] in Berlin. The proceedings of the court were often even less than [[show trials]] in that some cases, such as that of [[Sophie Scholl]] and her brother [[Hans Scholl]] and fellow [[White Rose]] activists, trials were concluded in less than an hour without evidence being presented or arguments made by either side. The president of the court often acted as prosecutor, denouncing defendants, then pronouncing his verdict and sentence without objection from defense counsel, who usually remained silent throughout. It almost always sided with the prosecution, to the point that being hauled before it was tantamount to a death sentence. While Nazi Germany was not a [[rule of law]] state, the People's Court frequently dispensed with even the nominal laws and procedures of regular German trials, and was thus easily characterized as a [[kangaroo court]].\n\n==Manner of proceedings==\n\nThere was no [[presumption of innocence]] nor could the defendants adequately represent themselves or consult counsel. A proceeding at the People's Court would follow an initial indictment in which a state or city prosecutor would forward the names of the accused to the ''Volksgerichtshof'' for charges of a political nature. Defendants were hardly ever allowed to speak to their attorneys beforehand and when they did the defense lawyer would usually simply answer questions about how the trial would proceed and refrain from any legal advice. In at least one documented case (the trial of the \"White Rose\" conspirators), the defense lawyer assigned to Sophie Scholl chastised her the day before the trial, stating that she would pay for her crimes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe People's Court proceedings began when the accused were led to a prisoner's dock under armed police escort. The presiding judge would read the charges and then call the accused forward for \"examination\". Although the court had a prosecutor, it was usually the judge who asked the questions. Defendants were often berated during the examination and never allowed to respond with any sort of lengthy reply. After a barrage of insults and condemnation, the accused would be ordered back to the dock with the order \"examination concluded\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAfter examination, the defense attorney would be asked if they had any statements or questions. Defense lawyers were present simply as a formality and hardly ever rose to speak. The judge would then ask the defendants for a statement during which time more insults and berating comments would be shouted at the accused. The verdict, which was almost always \"guilty\", would then be announced and the sentence handed down at the same time. In all, an appearance before the People's Court could take as little as fifteen minutes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFrom 1934 to 1945, the court sentenced 10,980 people to prison and imposed the death penalty on 5,179 more who were convicted of high treason.<ref>Wachsmann, ''Hitler's Prisons: Legal Terror in Nazi Germany''.

In some cases, this was due to defense lawyers presenting the accused as naive or the defendant adequately explaining the nature of the political charges against them. However, in nearly two-thirds of such cases, the defendants would be [[Double jeopardy|re-arrested]] by the [[Gestapo]] following the trial and sent to a [[concentration camp]]. After the defeat at Stalingrad, and with a growing fear in the German government regarding defeatism amongst the population, the People's Court became far more ruthless and hardly anyone brought before the tribunal escaped a guilty verdict.<ref>Roberts, G., ''Victory at Stalingrad: The Battle That Changed History'', Routledge (2002), {{ISBN|0582771854}}</ref>\n\n==Trials of August 1944==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 151-12-16, Volksgerichtshof, Erwin v.

There were around 300 spectators, including [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] and selected civil servants, party functionaries, military officers and journalists. A film camera ran behind the red-robed Roland Freisler so that Hitler could view the proceedings, and to provide footage for newsreels and a documentary entitled ''Traitors Before the People's Court''.<ref name=\"won283\">Robert Edwin Hertzstein, ''The War That Hitler Won'' p283 {{ISBN|0-399-11845-4}}</ref> Intended to be used in ''[[Die Deutsche Wochenschau|The German Weekly Review]]'', it was not shown at the time, and turned out to be the last documentary made for the newsreel.<ref name=\"won283\"/>\n\nThe accused were forced to wear shabby clothes, denied neck ties and belts or suspenders for their pants, and were marched into the courtroom handcuffed to policemen. The proceedings began with Freisler announcing he would rule on \"...the most horrific charges ever brought in the history of the German people.\" Freisler was an admirer of [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], the chief prosecutor of the [[Great Purge#Moscow Trials|Soviet purge trials]], and copied Vyshinsky's practice of heaping loud and violent abuse on defendants.\n\nThe 62-year-old [[Field Marshal]] von Witzleben was the first to stand before Freisler and he was immediately castigated for giving a brief Nazi salute. He faced further humiliating insults while holding onto his trouser waistband. Next, former [[Colonel-General]] Erich Hoepner, dressed in a cardigan, faced Freisler, who addressed him as \"''Schweinehund''\". When he said that he was not a ''Schweinehund'', Freisler asked him what zoological category he thought he fitted into.\n\nThe accused were unable to consult their lawyers, who were not seated near them. None of them were allowed to address the court at length, and Freisler interrupted any attempts to do so. However, Major General [[Helmuth Stieff]] attempted to raise the issue of his motives before being shouted down, and Witzleben managed to call out \"You may hand us over to the executioner, but in three months' time, the disgusted and harried people will bring you to book and drag you alive through the dirt in the streets!\" All were condemned to death by hanging, and the sentences were carried out shortly afterwards in [[Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison]].\n\nAnother trial of plotters was held on 10 August. On that occasion the accused were [[Erich Fellgiebel]], [[Alfred Kranzfelder]], [[Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg]], [[Georg Hansen]], and [[Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]].\n\nOn 15 August, [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf]], [[Egbert Hayessen]], [[Hans Bernd von Haeften]], and [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]] were condemned to death by Freisler.\n\nOn 21 August, the accused were [[Fritz Thiele]], [[Friedrich Gustav Jaeger]], and [[Ulrich Wilhelm Graf Schwerin von Schwanenfeld]] who was able to mention the \"...many murders committed at home and abroad\" as a motivation for his actions.\n\nOn 30 August, Colonel-General [[Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel]], who had blinded himself in a suicide attempt, was led into the court and condemned to death along with [[Caesar von Hofacker]], [[Hans Otfried von Linstow]], and [[Eberhard Finckh]].\n\n==Bombing==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P054489, Berlin, Ruine des Volksgerichtshofes.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the People's Court, as photographed in 1951]]\nField Marshal von Witzleben's prediction of Roland Freisler's fate proved slightly incorrect, as he died in a bombing raid in February 1945, approximately half a year later.<ref name=Nemesis>{{cite book|date=2000|author=Ian Kershaw|author-link=Ian Kershaw|isbn=0-393-32252-1|title= Hitler 1936\u20131945: Nemesis|publisher=Penguin Press}}</ref><ref name=\"PlottingHitler'sDeath\">{{cite book|date=1994|author=Joachim Fest|author-link=Joachim Fest|isbn=0-297-81774-4|title=[[Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933\u20131945]]|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1945, Freisler was conducting a Saturday session of the People's Court, when [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] bombers [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II#The largest American raid on Berlin|attacked Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://100thbg.com/index.php?option=com_bombgrp&view=personnel&id=4475&Itemid=334 |title=100th Bomb Group Foundation - Personnel - Lt Col  Robert Rosenthal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=100thbg.com |publisher=100th Bomb Group Foundation |access-date=December 5, 2016 |quote=Dec 1, 1944-Feb 3, 1945 - 418th BS, 100th BG (H) ETOUSAAF (8AF) Squadron Commander, 55 hours, B-17 Air Leader 5 c/m (combat missions) 45 c/hrs (combat hours) 1 Division Lead (Berlin Feb 3, 1945, shot down, picked up by Russians and returned to England) Acting Command 4 Wing Leads, Pilot Feb 3, 1945 - BERLIN - MACR #12046, - A/C#44 8379}}</ref>  Government and Nazi Party buildings were hit, including the Reich Chancellery, the Gestapo headquarters, the Party Chancellery and the People's Court.

The mosque was built in 1895 to the design of the Chinese architect Hon Piquet using the collected funds of immigrants. The mosque is under state protection since 1982 as a monument of architecture and history of republican significance.\n\n== History ==\nA proposal to build a new Mosque was received from the first guild merchant Vali Akhun Yuldashev in 1887 year at a meeting of the Muslim community of Zharkent. He made a down payment and organized the collection of donations from Muslims. The main architect was Chinese master Hon Pike (Mukan), who was assisted by the Uighur masters Hassan Imanov, Ushurbaki, Tair Ismailov, Nasretdin Kara, Zainutdin, Abdukadir and others. A mosque and the main portal entrance with a tower were erected between 1892-1895. A small mosque, a [[Madrasah]] and a Fence were built in 1903-1905. In 1910 there was an earthquake, which caused significant damage - both decorative towers collapsed, the tops of the domes fell, through cracks formed in the domes, etc. The Mosque was used for various purposes during Soviet rules: there were warehouses, a granary, a barracks for border guards, a cinema and a teahouse. Restoration work was carried out between 1975 and 1978. After reconstruction works an architectural and art museum was opened in the Mosque, according to the order of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR of the 24 March 1978, which was signed by the chairman of the Council of Ministers Baiken Ashimov. The roof and main portal were reconstructed between 2001 and 2004.\n\n== Architecture==\nThe mosque was built in the style of architecture of Central Asia, but using elements of a Buddhist temple. The total area of the mosque is 28 \u00d7 54 meters. Height is {{convert|14.5|m|ft}} and the minaret is {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The minaret is surrounded by 52 columns made of Tien Shan spruce. The [[entablature]] is decorated with wooden carvings. The walls of the mosque are made of beams, and the roof is made of tin. Nails were not used in the construction of the columns and other wooden parts. The mosque complex is surrounded by a stone wall {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. There are gates on the south and north sides. A small courtyard is located in the courtyard of the mosque from the north-east side, on the south side is a Madrasah. The soaring roof is an influence of Chinese architectural traditions. The roof has slope ends curved to the top, giving the building sophistication and airiness.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The Mosque has two floors. Cylindrical columns without capitals and with a large cornice form a gallery that encircles the building. The skeleton of the Mosque building is formed by 122 wooden posts fastened by a system of beams and nozzles. The highlight of the Mosque are the abundance of decor - wood carvings, polychrome paintings in rich colors. They enliven the surface of the arches and walls of the main hall of the Mosque. The interior decoration is dominated by plant motifs, Arabic script, elements of the Uyghur ornament. Also there are images of birds, fish and animals, including fantastic ones.\n\n== References ==\n1.

The mosque was built in 1895 to the design of the Chinese architect Hon Piquet using the collected funds of immigrants. The mosque is under state protection since 1982 as a monument of architecture and history of republican significance. \n\n=== History ===\nA proposal to build a new Mosque was received from the first guild merchant Vali Akhun Yuldashev in 1887 year at a meeting of the Muslim community of Zharkent. He made a down payment and organized the collection of donations from Muslims. The main architect was Chinese master Hon Pike (Mukan), who was assisted by the Uighur masters Hassan Imanov, Ushurbaki, Tair Ismailov, Nasretdin Kara, Zainutdin, Abdukadir and others. A mosque and the main portal entrance with a tower were erected between 1892-1895. A small mosque, a [[Madrasah]] and a Fence were built in 1903-1905. In 1910 there was an earthquake, which caused significant damage - both decorative towers collapsed, the tops of the domes fell, through cracks formed in the domes, etc. The Mosque was used for various purposes during Soviet rules: there were warehouses, a granary, a barracks for border guards, a cinema and a teahouse. Restoration work was carried out between 1975 and 1978. After reconstruction works an architectural and art museum was opened in the Mosque, according to the order of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR of the 24 March 1978, which was signed by the chairman of the Council of Ministers Baiken Ashimov. The roof and main portal were reconstructed between 2001 and 2004. \n\n=== Architecture===\nThe mosque was built in the style of architecture of Central Asia, but using elements of a Buddhist temple. The total area of the mosque is 28 \u00d7 54 meters. Height is {{convert|14.5|m|ft}} and the minaret is {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The minaret is surrounded by 52 columns made of Tien Shan spruce. The [[entablature]] is decorated with wooden carvings. The walls of the mosque are made of beams, and the roof is made of tin. Nails were not used in the construction of the columns and other wooden parts. The mosque complex is surrounded by a stone wall {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. There are gates on the south and north sides. A small courtyard is located in the courtyard of the mosque from the north-east side, on the south side is a Madrasah. The soaring roof is an influence of Chinese architectural traditions. The roof has slope ends curved to the top, giving the building sophistication and airiness.{{fact|date=March 2020}} The Mosque has two floors. Cylindrical columns without capitals and with a large cornice form a gallery that encircles the building. The skeleton of the Mosque building is formed by 122 wooden posts fastened by a system of beams and nozzles. The highlight of the Mosque are the abundance of decor - wood carvings, polychrome paintings in rich colors. They enliven the surface of the arches and walls of the main hall of the Mosque. The interior decoration is dominated by plant motifs, Arabic script, elements of the Uyghur ornament. Also there are images of birds, fish and animals, including fantastic ones.\n\n=== References ===\n1.

The next week, the song climbed 36 places to number #57. Ultimately, the song peaked at number #31. In Canada, it debuted at #41, the second-highest new entry on the chart that week.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"I Got It from My Mama\" was announced on [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' official website on July 26, 2007, along with a preview of it.<ref>[http://will-i-am.blackeyedpeas.com/ Will-i-am.com - The Official Will.i.am Website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922013430/http://will-i-am.blackeyedpeas.com/ |date=2007-09-22 }}</ref> It was fully released on August 2, 2007. The video begins with will.i.am opening a magazine of girls and then the camera descends onto will.i.am sitting on a chair on a Brazilian beach. There are girls walking around and flaunting their bodies to the camera. The video then shows will.i.am singing with the girls while they dance all over him and him sitting on a chair singing.\n\nIn the middle of the video it shows will.i.am on a chair with the girls lying on towels facing him, with an over view on them singing to the camera. At the last verse it shows will.i.am and the same girls at a beach party at night. The video concludes with will.i.am singing at the beach again with the girls and ends with a picture of will.i.am in the magazine saying: \"Brazil: Wish You Were Here!\". After shooting the video, will.i.am shot the video for \"She's a Star\" on a Braziliian beach, at night with special effects reminiscent of [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[What Happens Tomorrow]]\".\n\n==Usage in media==\n\"I Got It from My Mama\" was featured in several television programs including ''[[CSI Miami]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]''. The hook of the song is sampled in [[Psy (rapper)|PSY]]'s song \"[[Daddy (Psy song)|Daddy]]\".\n\n==Track listing==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* '''Promotional CD single'''\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Radio edit)</small>\u20143:58\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(LP version)</small>\u20144:05\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Instrumental)</small>\u20144:05\n\n* '''UK CD single'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Got-It-My-Mama/dp/B000VDDCQU/ref=sr_1_4?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1334421563&sr=1-4 |title=I Got It From My Mama: Amazon.co.uk: Music |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Radio edit)</small>\u20143:43\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>([[Busta Rhymes]] remix)</small>\u20144:12\n\n* '''German CD single'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Got-It-My-Mama/dp/B000VKLVY8/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1334421563&sr=1-1 |title=I Got It From My Mama: Amazon.co.uk: Music |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(LP version)</small>\u20144:05\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Busta Rhymes remix)</small>\u20144:12\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Instrumental)</small>\u20144:05\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Music video)</small>\u20144:00\n\n* '''Digital download'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/i-got-it-from-my-mama-single/id261137169 |title=iTunes - Music - I Got It From My Mama - Single by will.i.am |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(LP version)</small>\u20144:05\n\n* '''Digital single'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/i-got-it-from-my-mama-single/id263308844 |title=iTunes - Music - I Got It from My Mama - Single by will.i.am |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Busta Rhymes remix)</small>\u20144:12\n\n* '''Digital video single'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/i-got-it-from-my-mama-single/id263950330 |title=iTunes - Music - I Got It From My Mama - Single by will.i.am |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2007-08-07 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Radio edit)</small>\u20143:58\n# \"I Got It from My Mama\" <small>(Music video)</small>\u20144:00\n\n==Charts==\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

From 8 July to 4 August, the 93 cyclists cycled 4488&nbsp;km (2,788&nbsp;mi) in fourteen stages around France.

The race was dominated at the start by [[\u00c9mile Georget]], who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.\n\n==Innovations==\nThe 1907 Tour de France incorporated 14 stages, which was one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included.<ref name=\"ASO\"/><ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]], that the western Alps were included in the race for the first time.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}\n\nThe 1907 race was also the first time that a car with bicycle repairmen drove behind the riders, to give assistance in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\nAs in 1906, the race was decided by a points system. At the end of every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\n==Participants==\n{{main list|List of cyclists in the 1907 Tour de France}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Pottier]], the winner of the [[1906 Tour de France]], did not defend his title because he had committed suicide in early 1907.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=36}} At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by [[Alcyon]] and the riders sponsored by [[Peugeot]] would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: [[Louis Trousselier]], [[Marcel Cadolle]] and [[L\u00e9on Georget]]; Peugeot counted on [[Emile Georget]].{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the ''coureurs de vitesse'' and the ''coureurs sur machines poin\u00e7onn\u00e9es''. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the ''poin\u00e7onn\u00e9e'' category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|2007|p=}} The ''coureurs de vitesse'' could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.{{sfn|Laget|Montgermont|Cazaban|Laget|2013|p=}}\n\nNot all cyclists were competing for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was [[Henri P\u00e9pin]]. P\u00e9pin had hired two riders, [[Jean Dargassies]] and [[Henri Gauban]], to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find.{{sfn|Chany|Cazeneuve|1985|p=}} Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, [[Jean-Marie Teychenne]], lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped P\u00e9pin.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}{{sfn|Dauncey|Hare|2003|p=73}}\n\n==Race overview==\n\n{{main|1907 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 7|1907 Tour de France, Stage 8 to Stage 14}}\n\nEarly in the race, Trousselier, [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] and Emile Georget were the main contenders.<ref name=\"ASO\"/> Trousselier, winner of the [[1905 Tour de France]] and eager to win again, won the first stage.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany.

The race was dominated at the start by [[\u00c9mile Georget]], who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and [[Lucien Petit-Breton]] became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.\n\n==Changes from the previous Tour==\nThe 1907 Tour de France incorporated 14 stages, which was one more than in 1906. For the first time, roads in Switzerland were included.<ref name=\"ASO\"/><ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> The mountain stages in 1906 had been so successful, according to the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]], that the western Alps were included in the race for the first time.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}\n\nThe 1907 race was also the first time that a car with bicycle repairmen drove behind the riders, to give assistance in solving mechanical problems on bicycles.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\nAs in 1906, the race was decided by a points system. At the end of every stage, the winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/>\n\n==Participants==\n{{main list|List of cyclists in the 1907 Tour de France}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Pottier]], the winner of the [[1906 Tour de France]], did not defend his title because he had committed suicide in early 1907.<ref name=\"mdc1907\"/> Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=36}} At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by [[Alcyon]] and the riders sponsored by [[Peugeot]] would compete for the overall victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: [[Louis Trousselier]], [[Marcel Cadolle]] and [[L\u00e9on Georget]]; Peugeot counted on [[Emile Georget]].{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nAs in the previous years, there were two classes of cyclists, the ''coureurs de vitesse'' and the ''coureurs sur machines poin\u00e7onn\u00e9es''. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the ''poin\u00e7onn\u00e9e'' category, which meant that they had to finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|2007|p=}} The ''coureurs de vitesse'' could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.{{sfn|Laget|Montgermont|Cazaban|Laget|2013|p=}}\n\nNot all cyclists were competing for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was [[Henri P\u00e9pin]]. P\u00e9pin had hired two riders, [[Jean Dargassies]] and [[Henri Gauban]], to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending the night in the best hotels they could find.{{sfn|Chany|Cazeneuve|1985|p=}} Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists in the history of the Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, [[Jean-Marie Teychenne]], lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped P\u00e9pin.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}}{{sfn|Dauncey|Hare|2003|p=73}}\n\n==Race overview==\n\n{{main|1907 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 7|1907 Tour de France, Stage 8 to Stage 14}}\n\nEarly in the race, Trousselier, [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] and Emile Georget were the main contenders.<ref name=\"ASO\"/> Trousselier, winner of the [[1905 Tour de France]] and eager to win again, won the first stage.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} In the second stage, the Tour passed the French-German border to finish in Metz, which was then part of Germany. The German authorities allowed the cyclists to finish there, but did not allow the French flag to be flown or the cars of race officials to enter the city.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=68}} At the end of the stage, Emile Georget seemingly beat Trousselier with a very small margin. After inquiry, Desgrange, the Tour's organiser, decided to put both cyclists in first place,{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=9}} to keep both sponsors satisfied.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\nIn the third stage, the Tour returned to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs officers and the delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} During the stage in the Alps, \u00c9mile Georget was better than his competitors; he won the stage and became leader of the general classification.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} Georget won five of the first eight stages, and had a commanding lead.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=19\u201322}} In the seventh stage, [[Marcel Cadolle]], at that time in second place,<ref>{{cite web|title=5\u00e8me Tour de France 1907 \u2013 6\u00e8me \u00e9tape |url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114635/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1907_6.php |archivedate=3 May 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 April 2009 }}</ref> fell and his handlebar penetrated his knee, after which he had to give up.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}}\n\n[[File:Lucien Mazan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucien Petit-Breton]], the winner of the 1907 Tour de France|alt=A man on a bicycle, riding on an outdoor velodrome.]]During the ninth stage, when Georget was leading the race, he broke the frame of his bicycle{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=}} at a checkpoint.

In 1905, sponsors had not been so enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poin\u00e7onn\u00e9es category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them.

Blyth.JPG|thumb|250px|Blyth in 1953.]]\n'''Reginald Horace Blyth''' (3 December 1898 \u2013 28 October 1964) was an English author and devotee of [[Japanese culture]]. He is most famous for his writings on [[Zen]] and on [[haiku]] poetry.\n\n==Early life==\nBlyth was born in [[Essex]], England, the son of a railway clerk. He was the only child of Horace and Henrietta Blyth. He attended Cleveland Road Primary School, in Ilford, then the County High School (later [[Ilford County High School]]). In 1916, at the height of [[World War I]], he was imprisoned at [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]], as a [[conscientious objector]], before working on the [[Home Office]] Scheme at [[Princetown]] Work Centre in the former and future [[Dartmoor Prison]]. After the war he attended the [[University of London]], where he read English and from which he graduated in 1923, with honours.\n\nHe adopted a vegetarian lifestyle which he maintained throughout his life. Blyth played the [[flute]], made musical instruments, and taught himself several European languages. He was particularly fond of the music of [[J.S. Bach]]. In 1924, he received a teaching certificate from [[London Day Training College]]. The same year, he married Anna Bercovitch, a university friend. Some accounts say they moved to [[India]], where he taught for a while until he became unhappy with British colonial rule, other scholars dismiss this episode, claiming it to have been invented or misunderstood by Blyth's mentor [[D. T. Suzuki|Daisetz T. Suzuki]].<ref>Pinnington 1994, p254; Kirkup 1994, p5; Suzuki, dust jacket Blyth, Zen Classics Vol. 4</ref>\n\n==Korea (1925\u20131935)==\nIn 1925, the Blyths moved to [[Korea]] (then under Japanese rule), where Blyth became Assistant Professor of English at [[Keijo University]] in [[Seoul]]. While in Korea, Blyth began to learn Japanese and Chinese, and studied [[Zen]] under the [[Zen master|master]] Hanayama Taigi of [[My\u014dshin-ji]] Keijo Betsuin ([[Seoul]]). In Korea he started to read [[D. T. Suzuki]]'s books about Zen. In 1933, he informally adopted a Korean student, paying for his studies in Korea and later at London University. His wife parted from him in 1934 and Blyth took one-year absence from the university in 1935, following her to England. After the divorce, Blyth returned to Korea in early 1936, leaving the adopted son with his ex-wife. The adopted son returned after World War II to Korea. In 1947 he was captured by North Korean soldiers; when he returned to the South, he was shot as a traitor by the South Korean army.<ref>Pinnington 1994, p254; Kirkup 1994, p6</ref>\n\n==Japan (1936\u20131964)==\nHaving returned to Seoul in 1936, Blyth remarried in 1937, to a Japanese woman named Kijima Tomiko<ref>UEDA Munakata Kuniyoshi, A Short Introduction to R.H. Blyth p5 ; in: The Bulletin of the International Society for Harmonization of Cultures & Civilizations No.20, 2014, Nihon University [http://atlantic.gssc.nihon-u.ac.jp/~ISHCC/bulletin/20/b004_Ueda_Blyth.pdf]</ref>, with whom he later had two daughters, Nana Blyth and Harumi Blyth. 1940 they moved to [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]], D. T. Suzuki's home town, in Japan, and Blyth took a job as English teacher at the Fourth Higher School (later [[Kanazawa University]]).\n\nWhen Britain declared war on Japan in December 1941, following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], bringing Japan into [[World War II]], Blyth was [[internment|interned]] as a British [[enemy alien]]. Although he expressed his sympathy for Japan and sought Japanese [[citizenship]], this was denied. During his internment his extensive library was destroyed in an air raid. In the internment camp in Kobe he finished his first book ''Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics'' and wrote parts of his books about haiku and senryu. He also met in the camp [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], later Roshi of the Diamond Sangha in Honolulu.\n\nAfter the war, Blyth worked diligently with the authorities, both Japanese and American, to ease the transition to peace. Blyth functioned as [[wiktionary:liaison|liaison]] to the [[Imperial Household Agency|Japanese Imperial Household]], and his close friend, [[Harold Gould Henderson]], was on General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s staff. Together, they helped draft the declaration<ref>Dower 1999, p310</ref> ''[[Ningen Sengen]]'', by which Emperor [[Hirohito]] declared himself to be a human being, and not [[divinity|divine]].\n\nBy 1946, Blyth had become Professor of English at [[Gakushuin University]], and became private tutor to the Crown Prince (later emperor) [[Akihito]] until the end of his [Blyth's] life.<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.3, p70</ref> He did much to popularise [[Zen]] philosophy and [[Japanese poetry]] (particularly ''[[haiku]]'') in the West. In 1954, he was awarded a doctorate in literature from [[Tokyo University]], and, in 1959, he received the ''[[Order of the Sacred Treasure|Zuih\u014dsh\u014d]]'' (Order of Merit) Fourth Grade.<ref>Pinnington 1994; Kirkup 1994</ref>\n\nBlyth died in 1964, probably of a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]] and [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] from [[pneumonia]], in the [[St. Luke's International Hospital|Seiroka Hospital]] in Tokyo. He was buried in the cemetery of the [[T\u014dkei-ji|Shokozan Tokei Soji Zenji Temple]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], next to his old friend, [[D. T. Suzuki]]. Blyth's posthumous Buddhist name is Bulaisu Kodo Shoshin Koju.\n[[File:Tomb of R. H. Blyth, Tokei-ji.JPG|thumb|Blyth's tomb in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].]]\nHe left the following [[death poem]]: \n:''Sazanka ni kokoro nokoshite tabidachinu''\n\n:I leave my heart\n:to the [[Camellia sasanqua|sasanqua]] flower\n:on the day of this journey\n\n== Work ==\nBlyth produced a series of work on Zen, Haiku & Senryu, and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature.\n\nHe wrote six books on Haiku (1949\u201352, 1963\u201364) and two books on Senryu (1949, 1960), four books on Humour in Asian and English Literature (1957, 1959(a), 1959(b), 1961), as well as seven books on Zen (1942, 1952, 1960\u201364; posthumous 1966, 1970).  Further publications include studies of English Literature (1942, 1957, 1959(b)) and a three fifth shortened version of  'A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers' by his favourite author [[Henry David Thoreau]], along with an introduction and explanatory notes.\n\nThe most significant publications being his four-volume Haiku Series (1949\u201352), his 'Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics'  and his five-volume Zen Series.\n\nNearly all of his books were published in Japan, by Hokuseido Press, Tokyo.\n\n== Blyth and Zen ==\nThe actual 5-volume 'Zen and Zen Classics' series is a modification by the publishers, caused by the unexpected death of Blyth, of the originally planned 8-volume project, which included a translation of the Hekiganroku (Piyenchi), a History of Korean Zen and of Japanese Zen (Dogen, Hakuin etc.) and a renewed edition of his 'Buddhist Sermons on Christian Texts' as Vol. 8; ( as a  result of the modification the already published Vol. 7 was reprinted as Vol. 5)<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.1, 2, 4 (dust jackets)</ref>. \n\nAccording to D.T. Suzuki the Zen-Series should have been \"the most complete work on Zen to be presented so far to the English-reading public\".<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.4 (dust jacket)</ref>\n\nThe First Volume presents a General Introduction from the Upanishads  to Huineng, Vol. Two and Three  a History of Zen from the  Seigen Branch to Nangaku Branch and Vol. Five Twenty-Five Zen Essays. In Vol. Four Blyth translates the Mumonkan (Wumenkuan). Blyth's Mumonkan was the third complete translation into English, but the first one which was accompanied by extensive interpretive commentaries on each case.\n\nBlyth's early publication \u2018Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics', published 1942 when he was interned in Japan during World War II,  and his Zen and Zen Classics Series exerted a significant influence on the Western Writers\u2019- and Zen-community, although nearly all of his books were published in Japan only.\n\nTo his \"Zen-audience\" belonged [[Aldous Huxley]],<ref>Huxley 1951, (1958)</ref> [[Henry Miller]] and [[Lawrence Durrell]],<ref>Durrell/Miller 1988, p285,364,377 and Miller 1962, p61</ref>[[J.

Next, the biggest bit of luck of all, Zen, through the books of Suzuki Daisetz ... Last but not least there appeared senryu, which might well be dignified by the term Senryu no Michi, the Way of Senryu, for it is an understanding of all things by laughing and smiling at them, and this means forgiving all things, ourselves and God included\".<ref>Blyth 1960, preface</ref> Blyth wrote six books on haiku and four books on humour and senryu, the genre sister of haiku: 'In haiku  things speak for themselves with the voice of a man, in senryu things do not speak; we speak and speak for ourselves'<ref>Blyth 1960, p269</ref>, in senryu the world is 'not seen as God made it' but 'as man sees it';<ref>Blyth, Senryu 1949, p41; Blyth 1960, p465</ref> 'to haiku, sex hardly exists; to senryu, it is all pervading ... a great many deal with the subject of the [[Yoshiwara]]...'<ref>Blyth, Senryu 1949, p37f</ref>\n\nAfter early [[Imagism|imagist]] interest in haiku the genre drew less attention in English, until after World War II, with the appearance of a number of influential volumes about Japanese haiku.\n\nIn 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of ''Haiku'', Blyth's four-volume work, haiku was introduced to the post-war Western world. His ''Haiku'' series (1949\u201352) was dealing mostly with pre-modern haiku, though including [[Masaoka Shiki|Shiki]]; later followed his two-volume ''History of Haiku'' (1963\u201364). Today he is best known as a major interpreter of haiku & senryu to English speakers.\n\nPresent-day attitudes to Blyth's work vary: On the one hand, he is appreciated as a populariser of Japanese culture; on the other, his portrayals of haiku and Zen have sometimes been criticised as one-dimensional. Many contemporary Western writers of haiku were introduced to the genre through his Zen-based haiku explanations. These include the San Francisco and [[Beat Generation]] writers, [[Gary Snyder]]<ref>Snyder 2005; Suiter 2002, p21, p47</ref>, [[Philip Whalen]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/whalen.html|title=Whalen 1923-2002}}</ref>  [[Jack Kerouac]]<ref>Kerouac 1958; (w. Gary Snyder as Japhy Ryder)</ref> and [[Allen Ginsberg]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terebess.hu/english/haiku/aginsberg.html|title=Collected Haiku}}</ref> as well as [[J. D. Salinger]] <small>('''\"...particularly haiku, but senryu, too...can be read with special satisfaction when R. H. Blyth was on them. Blyth is sometimes perilous, naturally, since he's a highhanded old poem himself, but he's also sublime\"''')</small><ref>Salinger (c.1955 and 1959;c.1963) 1991, p118, and p67; for 'poem himself'. quoting Milton, see Blyth 1942, p264; for Blyth's definition of 'sentimentality' see Blyth (1949-52) Vol.2, p229 and Updike 1961</ref> and [[E. E. Cummings]].<ref>Welch 1995</ref> Many members of the international \"haiku community\" also got their first views of haiku from Blyth's books, including American author [[James William Hackett|James W. Hackett]] (born 1929), Eric Amann, [[William J. Higginson]], Anita Virgil, Jane Reichhold, and Lee Gurga. The French philosopher and semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] read 1967 Blyth's 4 Vol. set, using his translations for lectures and seminars on haiku 1979.<ref>Barthes 2010, Sessions January 6, 1979 to February 24,1979 (in the Index Nominum see Robert (sic!) H. Blyth); Samoyault 2016, Chap. 12. For bibliographical confusions, Barthes 2010, p415n24</ref> \n\nSome noted Blyth's distaste for haiku on more modern themes, some his strong bias regarding a direct connection between haiku and Zen<ref>see also Suzuki 1959, Chap. VII, and Barthes 1970</ref>, a connection largely ignored by modern Japanese poets. Bash\u014d, in fact, felt that his devotion to haiku prevented him from realising enlightenment<ref>Makoto Ueda 1967; see also Blyth (1949-52) Vol.4, pp95</ref>; and classic Japanese haiku poets like [[Fukuda Chiyo-ni|Chiyo-ni]], [[Buson]], and [[Kobayashi Issa|Issa]] were [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] (Jodo) rather than Zen Buddhists<ref>see Blyth (1949-52) Vol.3, p231f., 433, 435f., Vol.2, 363</ref>. Some also noted, that Blyth did not view haiku by Japanese women favourably, that he was downplaying their contribution to the genre, especially during the [[Matsuo Bash\u014d|Bash\u014d]] era. In the chapter 'Women Haiku Writers' Blyth writes: \"Haiku for women, like Zen for women, - this subject makes us once more think about what haiku are, and a woman is\u2026Women are said to be intuitive, and as they cannot think, we may hope this is so, but intuition\u2026is not enough\u2026 [it] is doubtfull... whether women can write haiku\"<ref>Blyth (1963-64) Vol.1, p.207, p223</ref>   \n\nAlthough Blyth did not foresee the appearance of original haiku in languages other than Japanese when he began writing on the topic, and although he founded no school of verse, his works stimulated the writing of [[haiku in English]]. At the end of the second volume of his ''History of Haiku'', he remarked 1964 that \"The latest development in the history of haiku is one which nobody foresaw... the writing of haiku outside Japan, not in the Japanese language.\"<ref>Blyth (1963-64) Vol.2, p349</ref> He followed that comment with a number of original verses in English by Hackett with whom Blyth corresponded.\n\n<small>'''Blyth: \"How about my own [haiku] explanations? Some say they are better than many of the original haiku. Some say they should be omitted. I myself agree with both views\".'''<ref>Blyth (1963-64) Vol.2, p347</ref></small>\n\n== Blyth's Zen ==\n\n<blockquote>''\"Incidentally, I first heard the term \"Blyth's Zen\" ... when Roshi asked, \"Who was your Zen teacher?\" I told Soen Roshi that ... for incorporating Zen values in my haiku, I was a disciple of R. H. Blyth. To this, Roshi murmered a long \"Hmmmmmmm.....\", then said \"Blyth's Zen, eh?\"''<ref>Hackett 2002</ref>\n\n\n\n''\"We must never forget that the one thing in the world that is not a thing is Zen. International, transcendental, pure super-Zen has no existence.

It does not have, and does not want, the excuse to force people into Heaven\"<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.1, p20</ref>\n* \"A Zen society is unthinkable in so far as it consists of (celibate) monks. A sexless society is a contradiction in terms, and a Zen society of laymen and laywomen of the traditional type would be a return to (religious) feudalism... The Zen sect has always been, like Athens, a state of \"free\" men among slaves, living on them more or less, and with no desire to free them socially, politically or financially. It has no view of society, no idea of human progress, material or spiritual. It is always all things to all men, and will support any government, fascistic or communistic or democratic. Its organization is unchangeable feudalistic, though on special occasions it has an All Fools' Day when an absolute equality is de rigueur. The opinion of Zen adepts on world affairs has invariably been a patriotic opportunism dressed in Buddhist platitudes\u2026; the greatest happiness of the greatest number of people has been the least of its concerns\"<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.2, p179f</ref>\n* \"What was, is, and always will be wrong with Buddhism of course is the \u2013ism. A system of doctrine, rules of morality, and above all the Sangha itself means religious mass suicide\u2026the Indian hatred of women persisted; sex was omitted, and the monastery could not be self-subsisting, since new members were constantly needed. Thus the life of the Zen monastery, however earnest and active it may have once been, was always a farce\u2026Zen has not yet taught us how to be fathers and mothers and citizens. It is still a thing for monks, at least for men, and especially for old men\"<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.1, p18</ref>\n* \"The least admirable part of Buddhisms is its attitude to sex. The Buddha accepted women into the Sangha with the utmost unwillingness, and indeed prophesied that they would be the ruin of his system \u2026In actual fact one of the reasons for the decline of Buddhism in India was the resurgence of Tantrism with its female deities and esoteric eroticism ... This attitude has been continued in Zen, which is thus Buddhist in its defects as well as its virtues.

Blyth.JPG|thumb|250px|Blyth in 1953.]]\n'''Reginald Horace Blyth''' (3 December 1898 \u2013 28 October 1964) was an English author and devotee of [[Japanese culture]]. He is most famous for his writings on [[Zen]] and on [[haiku]] poetry.\n\n==Early life==\nBlyth was born in [[Essex]], England, the son of a railway clerk. He was the only child of Horace and Henrietta Blyth. He attended Cleveland Road Primary School, in Ilford, then the County High School (later [[Ilford County High School]]). In 1916, at the height of [[World War I]], he was imprisoned at [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]], as a [[conscientious objector]], before working on the [[Home Office]] Scheme at [[Princetown]] Work Centre in the former and future [[Dartmoor Prison]]. After the war he attended the [[University of London]], where he read English and from which he graduated in 1923, with honours.\n\nHe adopted a vegetarian lifestyle which he maintained throughout his life. Blyth played the [[flute]], made musical instruments, and taught himself several European languages. He was particularly fond of the music of [[J.S. Bach]]. In 1924, he received a teaching certificate from [[London Day Training College]]. The same year, he married Anna Bercovitch, a university friend. Some accounts say they moved to [[India]], where he taught for a while until he became unhappy with British colonial rule, other scholars dismiss this episode, claiming it to have been invented or misunderstood by Blyth's mentor [[D. T. Suzuki|Daisetz T. Suzuki]].<ref>Pinnington 1994, p254; Kirkup 1994, p5; Suzuki, dust jacket Blyth, Zen Classics Vol. 4</ref>\n\n==Korea (1925\u20131935)==\nIn 1925, the Blyths moved to [[Korea]] (then under Japanese rule), where Blyth became Assistant Professor of English at [[Keijo University]] in [[Seoul]]. While in Korea, Blyth began to learn Japanese and Chinese, and studied [[Zen]] under the [[Zen master|master]] Hanayama Taigi of [[My\u014dshin-ji]] Keijo Betsuin ([[Seoul]]). In Korea he started to read [[D. T. Suzuki]]'s books about Zen. In 1933, he informally adopted a Korean student, paying for his studies in Korea and later at London University. His wife parted from him in 1934 and Blyth took one-year absence from the university in 1935, following her to England. After the divorce, Blyth returned to Korea in early 1936, leaving the adopted son with his ex-wife. The adopted son returned after World War II to Korea. In 1947 he was captured by North Korean soldiers; when he returned to the South, he was shot as a traitor by the South Korean army.<ref>Pinnington 1994, p254; Kirkup 1994, p6</ref>\n\n==Japan (1936\u20131964)==\nHaving returned to Seoul in 1936, Blyth remarried in 1937, to a Japanese woman named Kijima Tomiko<ref>UEDA Munakata Kuniyoshi, A Short Introduction to R.H. Blyth p5 ; in: The Bulletin of the International Society for Harmonization of Cultures & Civilizations No.20, 2014, Nihon University [http://atlantic.gssc.nihon-u.ac.jp/~ISHCC/bulletin/20/b004_Ueda_Blyth.pdf]</ref>, with whom he later had two daughters, Nana Blyth and Harumi Blyth. 1940 they moved to [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]], D. T. Suzuki's home town, in Japan, and Blyth took a job as English teacher at the Fourth Higher School (later [[Kanazawa University]]).\n\nWhen Britain declared war on Japan in December 1941, following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], bringing Japan into [[World War II]], Blyth was [[internment|interned]] as a British [[enemy alien]]. Although he expressed his sympathy for Japan and sought Japanese [[citizenship]], this was denied. During his internment his extensive library was destroyed in an air raid. In the internment camp in Kobe he finished his first book ''Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics'' and wrote parts of his books about haiku and senryu. He also met in the camp [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], later Roshi of the Diamond Sangha in Honolulu.\n\nAfter the war, Blyth worked diligently with the authorities, both Japanese and American, to ease the transition to peace. Blyth functioned as [[wiktionary:liaison|liaison]] to the [[Imperial Household Agency|Japanese Imperial Household]], and his close friend, [[Harold Gould Henderson]], was on General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s staff. Together, they helped draft the declaration<ref>Dower 1999, p310</ref> ''[[Ningen Sengen]]'', by which Emperor [[Hirohito]] declared himself to be a human being, and not [[divinity|divine]].\n\nBy 1946, Blyth had become Professor of English at [[Gakushuin University]], and became private tutor to the Crown Prince (later emperor) [[Akihito]] until the end of his [Blyth's] life.<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.3, p70</ref> He did much to popularise [[Zen]] philosophy and [[Japanese poetry]] (particularly ''[[haiku]]'') in the West. In 1954, he was awarded a doctorate in literature from [[Tokyo University]], and, in 1959, he received the ''[[Order of the Sacred Treasure|Zuih\u014dsh\u014d]]'' (Order of Merit) Fourth Grade.<ref>Pinnington 1994; Kirkup 1994</ref>\n\nBlyth died in 1964, probably of a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]] and [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] from [[pneumonia]], in the [[St. Luke's International Hospital|Seiroka Hospital]] in Tokyo. He was buried in the cemetery of the [[T\u014dkei-ji|Shokozan Tokei Soji Zenji Temple]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], next to his old friend, [[D. T. Suzuki]]. Blyth's posthumous Buddhist name is Bulaisu Kodo Shoshin Koju.\n[[File:Tomb of R. H. Blyth, Tokei-ji.JPG|thumb|Blyth's tomb in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].]]\nHe left the following [[death poem]]: \n:''Sazanka ni kokoro nokoshite tabidachinu''\n\n:I leave my heart\n:to the [[Camellia sasanqua|sasanqua]] flower\n:on the day of this journey\n\n== Work ==\nBlyth produced a series of work on Zen, Haiku & Senryu, and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature.\n\nHe wrote six books on Haiku (1949\u201352, 1963\u201364) and two books on Senryu (1949, 1960), four books on Humour in Asian and English Literature (1957, 1959(a), 1959(b), 1961), as well as seven books on Zen (1942, 1952, 1960\u201364; posthumous 1966, 1970).  Further publications include studies of English Literature (1942, 1957, 1959(b)) and a three fifth shortened version of  'A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers' by his favourite author [[Henry David Thoreau]], along with an introduction and explanatory notes.\n\nThe most significant publications being his four-volume Haiku Series (1949\u201352), his 'Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics'  and his five-volume Zen Series.\n\nNearly all of his books were published in Japan, by Hokuseido Press, Tokyo.\n\n== Blyth and Zen ==\nThe actual 5-volume 'Zen and Zen Classics' series is a modification by the publishers, caused by the unexpected death of Blyth, of the originally planned 8-volume project, which included a translation of the Hekiganroku (Piyenchi), a History of Korean Zen and of Japanese Zen (Dogen, Hakuin etc.) and a renewed edition of his 'Buddhist Sermons on Christian Texts' as Vol. 8; ( as a  result of the modification the already published Vol. 7 was reprinted as Vol. 5)<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.1, 2, 4 (dust jackets)</ref>. \n\nAccording to D.T. Suzuki the Zen-Series should have been \"the most complete work on Zen to be presented so far to the English-reading public\".<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.4 (dust jacket)</ref>\n\nThe First Volume presents a General Introduction from the Upanishads  to Huineng, Vol. Two and Three  a History of Zen from the  Seigen Branch to Nangaku Branch and Vol. Five Twenty-Five Zen Essays. In Vol. Four Blyth translates the Mumonkan (Wumenkuan). Blyth's Mumonkan was the third complete translation into English, but the first one which was accompanied by extensive interpretive commentaries on each case.\n\nBlyth's early publication \u2018Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics', published 1942 when he was interned in Japan during World War II,  and his Zen and Zen Classics Series exerted a significant influence on the Western Writers\u2019- and Zen-community, although nearly all of his books were published in Japan only.\n\nTo his \"Zen-audience\" belonged [[Aldous Huxley]],<ref>Huxley 1951, (1958)</ref> [[Henry Miller]] and [[Lawrence Durrell]],<ref>Durrell/Miller 1988, p285,364,377 and Miller 1962, p61</ref>[[J.

Next, the biggest bit of luck of all, Zen, through the books of Suzuki Daisetz ... Last but not least there appeared senryu, which might well be dignified by the term Senryu no Michi, the Way of Senryu, for it is an understanding of all things by laughing and smiling at them, and this means forgiving all things, ourselves and God included\".<ref>Blyth 1960, preface</ref> Blyth wrote six books on haiku and four books on humour and senryu, the genre sister of haiku: 'In haiku  things speak for themselves with the voice of a man, in senryu things do not speak; we speak and speak for ourselves'<ref>Blyth 1960, p269</ref>, in senryu the world is 'not seen as God made it' but 'as man sees it';<ref>Blyth, Senryu 1949, p41; Blyth 1960, p465</ref> 'to haiku, sex hardly exists; to senryu, it is all pervading ... a great many deal with the subject of the [[Yoshiwara]]...'<ref>Blyth, Senryu 1949, p37f</ref>\n\nAfter early [[Imagism|imagist]] interest in haiku the genre drew less attention in English, until after World War II, with the appearance of a number of influential volumes about Japanese haiku.\n\nIn 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of ''Haiku'', Blyth's four-volume work, haiku was introduced to the post-war Western world. His ''Haiku'' series (1949\u201352) was dealing mostly with pre-modern haiku, though including [[Masaoka Shiki|Shiki]]; later followed his two-volume ''History of Haiku'' (1963\u201364). Today he is best known as a major interpreter of haiku & senryu to English speakers.\n\nPresent-day attitudes to Blyth's work vary: On the one hand, he is appreciated as a populariser of Japanese culture; on the other, his portrayals of haiku and Zen have sometimes been criticised as one-dimensional. Many contemporary Western writers of haiku were introduced to the genre through his Zen-based haiku explanations. These include the San Francisco and [[Beat Generation]] writers, [[Gary Snyder]]<ref>Snyder 2005; Suiter 2002, p21, p47</ref>, [[Philip Whalen]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/whalen.html|title=Whalen 1923-2002}}</ref>  [[Jack Kerouac]]<ref>Kerouac 1958; (w. Gary Snyder as Japhy Ryder)</ref> and [[Allen Ginsberg]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terebess.hu/english/haiku/aginsberg.html|title=Collected Haiku}}</ref> as well as [[J. D. Salinger]] <small>('''\"...particularly haiku, but senryu, too...can be read with special satisfaction when R. H. Blyth was on them. Blyth is sometimes perilous, naturally, since he's a highhanded old poem himself, but he's also sublime\"''')</small><ref>Salinger (c.1955 and 1959;c.1963) 1991, p118, and p67; for 'poem himself'. quoting Milton, see Blyth 1942, p264; for Blyth's definition of 'sentimentality' see Blyth (1949-52) Vol.2, p229 and Updike 1961</ref> and [[E. E. Cummings]].<ref>Welch 1995</ref> Many members of the international \"haiku community\" also got their first views of haiku from Blyth's books, including American author [[James William Hackett|James W. Hackett]] (born 1929), Eric Amann, [[William J. Higginson]], Anita Virgil, Jane Reichhold, and Lee Gurga. The French philosopher and semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] read 1967 Blyth's 4 Vol. set, using his translations for lectures and seminars on haiku 1979.<ref>Barthes 2010, Sessions January 6, 1979 to February 24,1979 (in the Index Nominum see Robert (sic!) H. Blyth); Samoyault 2016, Chap. 12. For bibliographical confusions, Barthes 2010, p415n24</ref> \n\nSome noted Blyth's distaste for haiku on more modern themes, some his strong bias regarding a direct connection between haiku and Zen<ref>see also Suzuki 1959, Chap. VII, and Barthes 1970</ref>, a connection largely ignored by modern Japanese poets. Bash\u014d, in fact, felt that his devotion to haiku prevented him from realising enlightenment<ref>Makoto Ueda 1967; see also Blyth (1949-52) Vol.4, pp95</ref>; and classic Japanese haiku poets like [[Fukuda Chiyo-ni|Chiyo-ni]], [[Buson]], and [[Kobayashi Issa|Issa]] were [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] (Jodo) rather than Zen Buddhists<ref>see Blyth (1949-52) Vol.3, p231f., 433, 435f., Vol.2, 363</ref>. Some also noted, that Blyth did not view haiku by Japanese women favourably, that he was downplaying their contribution to the genre, especially during the [[Matsuo Bash\u014d|Bash\u014d]] era. In the chapter 'Women Haiku Writers' Blyth writes: \"Haiku for women, like Zen for women, - this subject makes us once more think about what haiku are, and a woman is\u2026Women are said to be intuitive, and as they cannot think, we may hope this is so, but intuition\u2026is not enough\u2026 [it] is doubtfull... whether women can write haiku\"<ref>Blyth (1963-64) Vol.1, p.207, p223</ref>   \n\nAlthough Blyth did not foresee the appearance of original haiku in languages other than Japanese when he began writing on the topic, and although he founded no school of verse, his works stimulated the writing of [[haiku in English]]. At the end of the second volume of his ''History of Haiku'', he remarked 1964 that \"The latest development in the history of haiku is one which nobody foresaw... the writing of haiku outside Japan, not in the Japanese language.\"<ref>Blyth (1963-64) Vol.2, p349</ref> He followed that comment with a number of original verses in English by Hackett with whom Blyth corresponded.\n\n<small>'''Blyth: \"How about my own [haiku] explanations? Some say they are better than many of the original haiku. Some say they should be omitted. I myself agree with both views\".'''<ref>Blyth (1963-64) Vol.2, p347</ref></small>\n\n== Blyth's Zen ==\n\n<blockquote>''\"Incidentally, I first heard the term \"Blyth's Zen\" ... when Roshi asked, \"Who was your Zen teacher?\" I told Soen Roshi that ... for incorporating Zen values in my haiku, I was a disciple of R. H. Blyth. To this, Roshi murmered a long \"Hmmmmmmm.....\", then said \"Blyth's Zen, eh?\"''<ref>Hackett 2002</ref>\n\n\n\n''\"We must never forget that the one thing in the world that is not a thing is Zen. International, transcendental, pure super-Zen has no existence. Buddha's Zen, and Daruma's Zen, and Eno's Zen and Rinzai's and Suzuki's and even perhaps Blyth's Zen ... - but no Zen without them\"''<ref>Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.5, p54</ref></blockquote>\n\n\n'R.

Its organization is unchangeable feudalistic, though on special occasions it has an All Fools' Day when an absolute equality is de rigueur.

So much the worse for both.

Following the disqualifications after the [[1904 Tour de France]], there were changes in the rules, the most important one being the general classification not made by time but by points. The race saw the introduction of mountains in the Tour de France, and [[Ren\u00e9 Pottier]] excelled in the first mountain, although he could not finish the race.<ref name=\"letour\">{{cite web|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1905/histoire.html|title=The Tour - Year 1905|publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]]|accessdate=29 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717054319/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1905/histoire.html|archive-date=17 July 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nDue in part to some of the rule changes, the 1905 Tour de France had less cheating and sabotage than in previous years, though they were not completely eliminated. It was won by [[Louis Trousselier]], who also won four of the eleven stages.\n\n==Innovations==\n\nAfter the [[1904 Tour de France]], some cyclists were disqualified, most notably the top four cyclists of the original overall classification, [[Maurice Garin]], [[Lucien Pothier]], [[C\u00e9sar Garin]] and [[Hippolyte Aucouturier]]. Maurice Garin was originally banned for two years and Pothier for life, so they were ineligible to start the 1905 Tour de France. Of these four, only Aucouturier (who had been \"warned\" and had a \"reprimand inflicted\" on him), started the 1905 Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1904.php|title=The Tour is finished&nbsp;... |first=Tom|last=James|date=14 August 2003|accessdate=21 June 2010|publisher=VeloArchive}}</ref> They were disqualified by the [[Union V\u00e9locip\u00e9dique Fran\u00e7aise]], based on accusations of cheating when there were no race officials around. In 1904 Tour, it was difficult to observe the cyclists continuously, as significant portions of the race were run overnight, and the long stages made it difficult to have officials everywhere.\n\nBecause these disqualifications had almost put an end to the Tour de France, the 1905 event had been changed in important ways, to make the race easier to supervise:{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=14\u201316}}\n*The stages were shortened so that no night riding occurred.\n*The number of stages increased to 11 stages, almost double from the previous year.\n*The winner was selected on points, not time.<ref name=\"veloarchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1905.php|title=1905: A new formula is devised|publisher=VeloArchive|date=14 August 2003|accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref>\nThe first cyclist to cross the finish line received 1 point. Other cyclists received one point more than the cyclist who passed the line directly before him, plus an additional point for every five minutes between them, with a maximum of ten points.

This unofficial title is the precursor to the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]].{{sfn|Cleijne|2014|p=156}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe tour organisers liked the effect of the points system, and it remained active until the [[1912 Tour de France]], after which it was reverted to the time system. In [[1953 Tour de France|1953]], for the 50-years anniversary of the Tour de France, the points system was reintroduced as the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], and the winner was given a [[green jersey]]. This points classification has been active ever since.\n\nThe introduction of mountains in the Tour de France had also been successful. After the introduction of the Vosges in the 1905 Tour de France, in 1906 the [[Massif Central]] were climbed, followed by the [[Pyrenees]] in 1910 and the [[Alps]] in 1911.\n\nThe winner Trousselier received 6950 [[French Franc|Francs]] for his victory.
