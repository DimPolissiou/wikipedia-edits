The singles and albums chart featured in the magazine were featured as the Canadian lists in the Hits of the World section in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.  The charts were also published in newspapers via [[The Canadian Press]] and used in now-defunct chart shows like Countdown Canada, Canadian Countdown, and the Hot 30 Countdown.\n\n''The Record'' featured the following charts:\n* Retail Singles (1983-1996)\n* The Hits (1996-1997) - an all-format radio airplay chart\n* Contemporary Hit Radio\n* Pop Adult (also Adult Contemporary)\n* Country\n* Contemporary Album Radio (also Album-Oriented Rock)\n* Hot AC - beginning in the late-1990s\n* Top Albums\n\nThe airplay charts were based on reports from radio stations across the country from 1983 to 1997, when data from [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] was first employed.  From 1995 to 1997, the airplay charts were compiled from computer-generated playlists that were submitted to ''The Record''.  The sales charts (Retail Singles, and Top Albums) were based on manual reports from retailers and distributors across the country.

From 1995 to 1997, the airplay charts were compiled from computer-generated playlists that were submitted to ''The Record''.

{"title_page": "First Doctor comic stories", "text_new": "\n\n'''First Doctor comic stories''' refers to the [[List of Doctor Who comic stories|comic strips]] devoted to the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', using the likeness of the [[First Doctor]] [[William Hartnell]]. The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, believed these strips to have been written by the artists who drew them. Thus in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:01-00:07:24\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:01-00:07:24</ref> In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying, ''TVC'' strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:24-00:08:27\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:24-00:08:27</ref> Later research by Paul Scoones in ''The Comic Strip Companion: 1964-1979'' (2012) clarified some aspects of script production. In an overview, Scoones notes: 'Writers and artists were seldom named on the strips, which presents a challenge when trying to credit stories', and while all the artists have been identified, some of the writers 'unfortunately remain unknown'.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-14\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 14</ref> The first writer Scoones identifies is '''David Motton''' with the fifth story of the Neville Main tenure, and a couple more Main strips soon thereafter.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-43\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 43</ref> This information comes from Motton himself, as indicated in a footnote from Scoones regarding correspondence with the writer between March and May 2012.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-44\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 44</ref> Motton would go on to script another couple of stories the following year for the ''TVC Annual 1967'' (released September 1966). As these strips were produced earlier in the year, during the change over between the second and third artists Mevin and Canning, Motton ended up writing for all three of the First Doctor artists.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-90-2\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 90-91</ref> Scoones goes on to possibly identify a second writer, '''[[Tom Tully (writer)|Tom Tully]]''' from a third writer, '''[[Roger Noel Cook]]'''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-78-9\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 78-79</ref> During correspondence with Scoones between February and March 2010, Cook writes he took over the strip from 'a freelance scriptwriter called Tom - I can't for the life of me remember his last name'. Scoones goes on to suggest from further information given by Cook that this was 'Tully, a prolific comic strip writer', adding he later confirmed this with Motton.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-78-9\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 78-79</ref> However, it remains unknown which stories Tully may have written, and indeed if there were other writers involved in the Main and Mevin periods. With respect to Cook, he took over the scripting at the same time that Canning took over the artwork, this 'marking the beginning of a four year collaboration' for ''TVC'' on a number of strips.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-78-9\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 78-79</ref> And once again, just like Canning, Cook would go on to work on the Second Doctor run, beginning late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Of course, given the information above, we now know the stories were not by Main at all.\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA''). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-7\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 7</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n\n|style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''#'''{{ref label|TVC_a|a|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Title'''{{ref label|TVC_b|b|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Companions''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Featuring''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Pub.''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Issues''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Ep#''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Date''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Format''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Writer'''{{ref label|TVC_c1|c|}} || style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Artist'''{{ref label|TVC_c2|c|}}\n|-\n\n| 01 || \"The Klepton Parasites\" || Gillian/John || Kleptons || ''TVC'' ||674 - 683 || 10|| 14 Nov 1964 - 16 Jan 1965  || B&W || ?

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, believed these strips to have been written by the artists who drew them. Thus in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:01-00:07:24\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:01-00:07:24</ref> In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying, ''TVC'' strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:24-00:08:27\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:24-00:08:27</ref> Later research by Paul Scoones in ''The Comic Strip Companion: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Doctor Who in Comics: 1964-1979'' (2012) clarified some aspects of script production. In an overview, Scoones notes: 'Writers and artists were seldom named on the strips, which presents a challenge when trying to credit stories', and while all the artists have been identified, some of the writers 'unfortunately remain unknown'.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-14\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 14</ref> The first writer Scoones identifies is '''David Motton''' with the fifth story of the Neville Main tenure, and a couple more Main strips soon thereafter.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-43\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 43</ref> This information comes from Motton himself, as indicated in a footnote from Scoones regarding correspondence with the writer between March and May 2012.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-44\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 44</ref> Motton would go on to script another couple of stories the following year for the ''TVC Annual 1967'' (released September 1966). As these strips were produced earlier in the year, during the change over between the second and third artists Mevin and Canning, Motton ended up writing for all three of the First Doctor artists.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-90-2\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 90-91</ref> Scoones goes on to possibly identify a second writer, '''[[Tom Tully (writer)|Tom Tully]]''' from a third writer, '''[[Roger Noel Cook]]'''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-78-9\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 78-79</ref> During correspondence with Scoones between February and March 2010, Cook writes he took over the strip from 'a freelance scriptwriter called Tom - I can't for the life of me remember his last name'. Scoones goes on to suggest from further information given by Cook that this was 'Tully, a prolific comic strip writer', adding he later confirmed this with Motton.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-78-9\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 78-79</ref> However, it remains unknown which stories Tully may have written, and indeed if there were other writers involved in the Main and Mevin periods. With respect to Cook, he took over the scripting at the same time that Canning took over the artwork, this 'marking the beginning of a four year collaboration' for ''TVC'' on a number of strips.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-78-9\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 78-79</ref> And once again, just like Canning, Cook would go on to work on the Second Doctor run, beginning late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Of course, given the information above, we now know the stories were not by Main at all.\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

He attended Yarra Valley Grammar, where he discovered an interest in music production through listening to a school mates cassette tape edits. After visiting a studio in 1989, he became interested in production and began collecting synthesizers and drum machines. After a chance meeting with an old school mate, he began to DJ in and around Melbournes club scene, whilst producing tracks during the day.  Over the years Gough's records have made it into the playlists of the world's best DJ's like old school legends Sasha and Paul Oakenfold, and the more recent class of top DJ's like The Swedish House Mafia and Tiesto. Gough's records have also been getting regular plays on Pete Tong's influential Radio 1 show 'the essential selection' in the UK, with one of his TV Rock remixes (with Smillie) getting the coveted 'essential new tune'. He also has more releases (and remixes) to his name than any other Australian, with dozens of records and cds bearing his name. Over the years Gough has produced Progressive house, deep house, trance, electro and breaks, making arguably the first nu school breaks record in Australia with [[Phil K]] and Andy Page in 1997. He also ran the studio and produced for respected Australian Deep House label Zero Tolerance from 1999 to 2004. More recently he has turned his hand to writing and producing Big room house. Not only is he renowned for his enthusiasm, flair and technical prowess in the studio, but on the decks his legendary track selection and brand of main room tunes (often his own) has seen him tour nationally and internationally on a prolific basis.\n\nIn 2005 the song \"Someday\", co-written by Gough with [[Slinkee Minx]] and performed by [[Slinkee Minx]], reached No. 55 on the Aria Charts and No. 9 on the Aria Dance Charts.<ref name=\"Pandora Archive 2005\">{{cite news |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20051020-0000/issue813.pdf | title=Aria Charts | work=Aria charts |date=28 September 2005 |accessdate=30 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAs [[TV Rock]] with [[Grant Smillie]], Gough has had 11 No.1 dance tracks on the ARIA club chart, more than anyone else, and in 2006 their smash hit \"Flaunt It\" broke all the records. \"Flaunt It\" was the No. 1 highest selling dance single by any Australian Artist in 2006.<ref name=\"Aria End of Year Dance Singles Charts 2006\">[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/DanceSingles2006.htm]</ref> and the No. 2 highest selling Australian track in 2006.<ref name=\"Aria End of Year Australian Singles Charts 2006\">[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIACharts-EndofYearCharts-Top100Singles2006.htm]</ref>\n\nThe duo garnished 2 ARIA's for the track, selling more than 175,000 copies and going double platinum,<ref name=\"Aria End of Year Dance Singles Charts 2006 Accreditations\">[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIACharts-Accreditations-2006Singles.htm]</ref> as well as holding the record for the longest running Australian track in the ARIA top 10 ever. Gough and Smillie continued to dominate charts around the country and the world with their singles \"In The Air\" and \"Diamonds in the Sky\". Both featured Rudy on vocals and both hit No. 1 on the Australian club chart and were played by all the world's top DJ's.\n\n2012 and beyond sees Gough's latest record with Feenixpawl \"[[In My Mind (Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl song)|In My Mind]]\" all set to do serious business internationally. The melodic chords and sublime vocals, combined with a massive drop, have people already saying it will be one of the tracks of 2012. In fact Axwell liked it so much he signed the tune and even did a remix of it.\n\nGough and Andy James ([[Sgt Slick]]) have joined forces to create the newest powerhouse duo, L'Tric, and released their first single, \"This Feeling\". He has also co-produced and mixed many tracks for other artists including the huge hit \"Freaks\" for Timmy Trumpet, tracks for Nervo, and a host of others.\n\n==Singles==\n\n===As lead artist===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|[[Netherlands|NL]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|[[Belgium|BEL (Fl.)]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|[[Belgium|BEL (Wal.)]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|AUS\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[In My Mind (Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl song)|In My Mind]]\" ([[Axwell]] Mix)<br><small>(with [[Feenixpawl]] featuring [[Georgi Kay]])</small>\n| 2012\n| 37 || \u2014 || \u2014 || 29\n| ''[[Until Now (Swedish House Mafia album)|Until Now]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Kukatu\"<br><small>(with Jebu)</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2013\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n| rowspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Non-album singles}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Home\"<br><small>(featuring Walden and Jebu)<br />(featuring [[Penelope Austin]])</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Noxu\"<br><small>(with Jebu)</small>\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2014\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Boom!\"<br/><small>(featuring Stevie Mink and Steve Bleas)</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Hear Me\"<br/><small>(featuring [[Feenixpawl]] and [[Christine Hoberg]])</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Void\"<br><small>(with Jebu)</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2015\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Inside Your Arms\"<br><small>(with [[Kaz James]])</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:85%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes a title that did not chart or was not released.\n|}\n\n===As featured artist===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"|Peak Charts Position\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Canadian Hot 100|CAN]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Album\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Not Taking This No More\"<br/><small>([[NERVO]] featuring Ivan Gough and [[Beverley Knight]])</small>\n| 2013\n| \u2014\n| {{N/A|Non-album single}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"200 Years\"<br/><small>(Chloe Wilson featuring Neimy & Ivan Gough)</small>\n| 2020\n| \u2014\n| {{N/A|Non-album single}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a title that did not chart, or was not released in that territory.\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.tvrock.com.au/ TV Rock Official Website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gough, Ivan}}\n[[Category:APRA Award winners]]\n[[Category:ARIA Award winners]]\n[[Category:Australian DJs]]\n[[Category:Australian electronic musicians]]\n[[Category:Australian house musicians]]\n[[Category:Club DJs]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n[[Category:Electronic dance music DJs]]\n", "text_old": "{{BLP sources|date=August 2018}}\n{{EngvarB|date=December 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name        = Ivan Gough\n| image        = Ivan_Gough_Luke_Chable.jpg\n| caption       = Ivan Gough with Luke Chable as Digital Mind Control\n| image_size     = \n| birth_name     = \n| background     = non_performing_personnel\n| alias        = {{hlist|The Traveller|Van Gough}}\n| birth_date     = {{birth date and age|df=y|1969|05|19}}\n| death_date     = \n| origin       = [[Melbourne]], Australia\n| instrument     = \n| genre        = {{hlist|[[House music|House]]|[[progressive house]]}}\n| occupation     = {{hlist|Producer|songwriter|DJ}}\n| years_active    = 1994\u2013present\n| label        = {{hlist|Axtone Records|Neon Records}}\n| associated_acts   = {{hlist|Cleva Cleva|Dark Alley|Deep Funk Project|Digital Mind Control|Future Renegades|L'Tri\u0441|MI$FIT$|The Free Radicals|Traveller & Quest|[[TV Rock]]}}\n| website       = \n}}\n\n'''Ivan Gough''' (born {{birth date|df=y|1969|05|19}}) is an Australian [[house music]] producer and DJ.\n\nHis first release, a remix of Pendulums \"I Need You\" became an instant club anthem, being played by the likes of Paul Oakenfold and Pete Tong in the United Kingdom.

Not only is he renowned for his enthusiasm, flair and technical prowess in the studio, but on the decks his legendary track selection and brand of main room tunes (often his own) has seen him tour nationally and internationally on a prolific basis.\n\nIn 2005 the song \"Someday\", co-written by Gough with [[Slinkee Minx]] and performed by [[Slinkee Minx]], reached No. 55 on the Aria Charts and No. 9 on the Aria Dance Charts.<ref name=\"Pandora Archive 2005\">{{cite news |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20051020-0000/issue813.pdf | title=Aria Charts | work=Aria charts |date=28 September 2005 |accessdate=30 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAs [[TV Rock]] with [[Grant Smillie]], Gough has had 11 No.1 dance tracks on the ARIA club chart, more than anyone else, and in 2006 their smash hit \"Flaunt It\" broke all the records. \"Flaunt It\" was the No. 1 highest selling dance single by any Australian Artist in 2006.<ref name=\"Aria End of Year Dance Singles Charts 2006\">[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/DanceSingles2006.htm]</ref> and the No. 2 highest selling Australian track in 2006.<ref name=\"Aria End of Year Australian Singles Charts 2006\">[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIACharts-EndofYearCharts-Top100Singles2006.htm]</ref>\n\nThe duo garnished 2 ARIA's for the track, selling more than 175,000 copies and going double platinum,<ref name=\"Aria End of Year Dance Singles Charts 2006 Accreditations\">[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/ARIACharts-Accreditations-2006Singles.htm]</ref> as well as holding the record for the longest running Australian track in the ARIA top 10 ever. Gough and Smillie continued to dominate charts around the country and the world with their singles \"In The Air\" and \"Diamonds in the Sky\". Both featured Rudy on vocals and both hit No. 1 on the Australian club chart and were played by all the world's top DJ's.\n\n2012 and beyond sees Gough's latest record with Feenixpawl \"[[In My Mind (Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl song)|In My Mind]]\" all set to do serious business internationally. The melodic chords and sublime vocals, combined with a massive drop, have people already saying it will be one of the tracks of 2012. In fact Axwell liked it so much he signed the tune and even did a remix of it.\n\nGough and Andy James ([[Sgt Slick]]) have joined forces to create the newest powerhouse duo, L'Tric, and released their first single, \"This Feeling\". He has also co-produced and mixed many tracks for other artists including the huge hit \"Freaks\" for Timmy Trumpet, tracks for Nervo, and a host of others.\n\n==Singles==\n\n===As lead artist===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|[[Netherlands|NL]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|[[Belgium|BEL (Fl.)]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|[[Belgium|BEL (Wal.)]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:89%;\"|AUS\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[In My Mind (Ivan Gough and Feenixpawl song)|In My Mind]]\" ([[Axwell]] Mix)<br><small>(with [[Feenixpawl]] featuring [[Georgi Kay]])</small>\n| 2012\n| 37 || \u2014 || \u2014 || 29\n| ''[[Until Now (Swedish House Mafia album)|Until Now]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Kukatu\"<br><small>(with Jebu)</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2013\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n| rowspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Non-album singles}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Home\"<br><small>(featuring Walden and Jebu)<br />(featuring [[Penelope Austin]])</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Noxu\"<br><small>(with Jebu)</small>\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2014\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Boom!\"<br/><small>(featuring Stevie Mink and Steve Bleas)</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Hear Me\"<br/><small>(featuring [[Feenixpawl]] and [[Christine Hoberg]])</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Void\"<br><small>(with Jebu)</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2015\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Inside Your Arms\"<br><small>(with [[Kaz James]])</small>\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:85%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes a title that did not chart or was not released.\n|}\n\n===As featured artist===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"|Peak Charts Position\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Canadian Hot 100|CAN]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Album\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Not Taking This No More\"<br/><small>([[NERVO]] featuring Ivan Gough and [[Beverley Knight]])</small>\n| 2013\n| \u2014\n| {{N/A|Non-album single}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"200 Years\"<br/><small>(Chloe Wilson featuring Neimy & Ivan Gough)</small>\n| 2020\n| \u2014\n| {{N/A|Non-album single}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a title that did not chart, or was not released in that territory.\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.tvrock.com.au/ TV Rock Official Website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gough, Ivan}}\n[[Category:APRA Award winners]]\n[[Category:ARIA Award winners]]\n[[Category:Australian DJs]]\n[[Category:Australian electronic musicians]]\n[[Category:Australian house musicians]]\n[[Category:Club DJs]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n[[Category:Electronic dance music DJs]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Gough"}

In [[ancient philosophy]], any attenuated \"thin\" matter such as [[air]], [[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[fire]] or [[light]] was considered incorporeal.<ref>Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/212/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 212</ref> The ancient Greeks believed [[air (classical element)|air]], as opposed to solid [[earth (classical element)|earth]], to be incorporeal, in so far as it is less resistant to movement; and the ancient Persians believed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] to be incorporeal in that every soul was said to be produced from it.<ref>Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/232/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 235</ref> In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter.\n\nIn the [[problem of universals]], universals are separable from any particular embodiment in one sense, while in another, they seem inherent nonetheless. Aristotle offered a [[hylomorphic]] account of abstraction in contrast to Plato's world of [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. Aristotle used the Greek terms ''[[wikt:somatic|soma]]'' (body) and ''[[hyle]]'' (matter, literally \"wood\").\n\nThe notion that a causally effective incorporeal body is even coherent requires the belief that something can affect what's material, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal field of influence, or immaterial body could not perform these functions because they have no physical construction with which to perform these functions. Following Newton, it became customary to accept [[action at a distance]] as brute fact, and to overlook the philosophical problems involved in so doing.\n\n==In Philosophy==\n[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]] depicted by Raphael.]]On [[Empedocles]] and incorporeal, [[John Burnet (classicist)|Burnet]] writes:<blockquote>\"The Love and Strife of Empedokles are no incorporeal forces. They are active, indeed, but they are still corporeal. At the time, this was inevitable; nothing incorporeal had yet been dreamt of. Naturally, Aristotle is puzzled by this characteristic of what he regarded as efficient causes. \u201c The Love of Empedokles,\u201d he says is both an efficient cause, for it brings things together, and a material cause, for it is a part of the mixture.\u201d And Theophrastos expressed the same idea by saying that Empedokles sometimes gave an efficient power to Love and Strife, and sometimes put them on a level with the other four. The fragments leave no room for doubt that they were thought of as spatial and corporeal.

If \"the incorporeality of God\" means the denial that God is physical, then all three monotheistic religions accept the incorporeality of God. However, if we follow the etymology of the term and define \"incoporeality\" as \"without body\" (from the Latin ''incorporale''), Christianity takes exception to a strict adherence to belief in God's incorporeality when it comes to the Incarnation. According to traditional Christianity, in the Incarnation, the second member of the Trinity... became infleshed (the Latin meaning of ''incarnatus'') and thus, in a sense, came to be \"with body.\" While this pivotal claim about the union of God and man at the heart of Christianity marks a dramatic departure from a radical transcendent theology of God according to which any such union is metaphysically impossible, it does not commit Christians to denying God's immateriality. In traditional Christianity, God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son (apart from the Incarnation) are clearly understood as lacking material structure and composition. Because of the shared conviction that God is immaterial, Christians along with Jews and Muslims have historically opposed material conceptions of God or gods such as one finds in Stoicism, according to which God is a vast material being, a world soul or animal, and in polytheism, according to which there are hosts of material deities. God's immaterial reality has also been used to articulate an important difference between monotheism and versions of pantheism... according to which the material world either is God or a part of God.<ref name=\"Taliaferro2010\">{{cite book |first=C. |last=Taliaferro |first2=P. |last2=Draper |first3=P.L. |last3=Quinn |year=2010 |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion |series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781405163576 |lccn=2009037505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&pg=PA292 |page=292}}</ref>|[[Charles Taliaferro]]|\"Incorporeality\" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}\n\n===Theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n\nMembers of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Church of Jesus Christ) view the mainstream Christian belief in God's incorporeality as being founded upon a post-Apostolic departure from the traditional Judeo-Christian belief in an anthropomorphic, corporeal God.

In [[ancient philosophy]], any attenuated \"thin\" matter such as [[air]], [[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[fire]] or [[light]] was considered incorporeal.<ref>Priestley, Joseph.

[https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/232/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 235</ref> In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter.\n\nIn the [[problem of universals]], universals are separable from any particular embodiment in one sense, while in another, they seem inherent nonetheless. Aristotle offered a [[hylomorphic]] account of abstraction in contrast to Plato's world of [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. Aristotle used the Greek terms ''[[wikt:somatic|soma]]'' (body) and ''[[hyle]]'' (matter, literally \"wood\").\n\nThe notion that a causally effective incorporeal body is even coherent requires the belief that something can affect what's material, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal field of influence, or immaterial body could not perform these functions because they have no physical construction with which to perform these functions. Following Newton, it became customary to accept [[action at a distance]] as brute fact, and to overlook the philosophical problems involved in so doing.\n\n==In Philosophy==\n[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]] depicted by Raphael.]]On [[Empedocles]] and incorporeal, [[John Burnet (classicist)|Burnet]] writes:<blockquote>\"The Love and Strife of Empedokles are no incorporeal forces.

Naturally, Aristotle is puzzled by this characteristic of what he regarded as efficient causes. \u201c The Love of Empedokles,\u201d he says is both an efficient cause, for it brings things together, and a material cause, for it is a part of the mixture.\u201d And Theophrastos expressed the same idea by saying that Empedokles sometimes gave an efficient power to Love and Strife, and sometimes put them on a level with the other four. The fragments leave no room for doubt that they were thought of as spatial and corporeal. All the six are called \u201c equal.\u201d Love is said to be \u201c equal in length and breadth \u201d to the others, and Strife is described as equal to each of them in weight (fr. 17).\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Greek Philosophy|last=Burnet|first=John|publisher=A. & C.

In other words, the soul is neither diffused throughout the universe as God is or as a world-soul would be, nor is it distributed throughout a space in such a way that it can be divided.<br><br>If incorporeality makes the soul imperceptible to the senses, it is even more important that incorporeality allows the soul to apprehend other things that are imperceptible to the senses. The idea that like perceives like goes back to the Greek Presocratics, and in the medieval Latin iterations, it did not have to carry strictly Platonic connotations. Yet principally from Augustine's early dialogues and ''De Trinitate'', Alcuin and other Carolingian thinkers inherited many rational demonstrations of theological doctrines, worked out according to a method of argumentation that combined Neoplatonist metaphysics with Aristotelian logic. Within this mode of discourse, it was exceedingly useful to have recourse to the concept of true incorporeality, and to be able to attribute true incorporeality to the unitary, rational ''anima'', with all of the ontological and epistemological implications that it entails.<ref name=\"Lockett2011\">{{cite book |first=L. |last=Lockett |year=2011 |title=Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions |series=Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781442642171 |lccn=2011378491 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVycdqSh28C&pg=PA288 |pages=287\u2013289}}</ref>|Leslie Lockett|\"Why Must the Soul Be Incorporeal?\" in ''Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions''}}\n\n{{quote|Traditional forms of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam each conceive of God as an immaterial, nonphysical reality. If \"the incorporeality of God\" means the denial that God is physical, then all three monotheistic religions accept the incorporeality of God. However, if we follow the etymology of the term and define \"incoporeality\" as \"without body\" (from the Latin ''incorporale''), Christianity takes exception to a strict adherence to belief in God's incorporeality when it comes to the Incarnation. According to traditional Christianity, in the Incarnation, the second member of the Trinity... became infleshed (the Latin meaning of ''incarnatus'') and thus, in a sense, came to be \"with body.\" While this pivotal claim about the union of God and man at the heart of Christianity marks a dramatic departure from a radical transcendent theology of God according to which any such union is metaphysically impossible, it does not commit Christians to denying God's immateriality. In traditional Christianity, God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son (apart from the Incarnation) are clearly understood as lacking material structure and composition. Because of the shared conviction that God is immaterial, Christians along with Jews and Muslims have historically opposed material conceptions of God or gods such as one finds in Stoicism, according to which God is a vast material being, a world soul or animal, and in polytheism, according to which there are hosts of material deities. God's immaterial reality has also been used to articulate an important difference between monotheism and versions of pantheism... according to which the material world either is God or a part of God.<ref name=\"Taliaferro2010\">{{cite book |first=C. |last=Taliaferro |first2=P. |last2=Draper |first3=P.L. |last3=Quinn |year=2010 |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion |series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781405163576 |lccn=2009037505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&pg=PA292 |page=292}}</ref>|[[Charles Taliaferro]]|\"Incorporeality\" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}\n\n===Theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n\nMembers of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Church of Jesus Christ) view the mainstream Christian belief in God's incorporeality as being founded upon a post-Apostolic departure from the traditional Judeo-Christian belief in an anthropomorphic, corporeal God.

There are two [[refrain]]s and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately at the end of each subsequent stanza until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a [[fixed verse|fixed verse form]]. The word derives from [[Latin]], then [[Italian language|Italian]], and is related to the initial subject of the form being the [[pastoral]].\n\nThe form started as a simple [[ballad]]-like song with no fixed form; this fixed quality would only come much later, from the poem \"Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)\" (1606) by [[Jean Passerat]]. From this point, its evolution into the \"fixed form\" used in the present day is debated. Despite its French origins, the majority of villanelles have been written in English, a trend which began in the late nineteenth century. The villanelle has been noted as a form that frequently treats the subject of obsessions, and one which appeals to outsiders; its defining feature of repetition prevents it from having a conventional tone.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''villanelle'' derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''villanella'', referring to a rustic song or dance,<ref name=\"Preminger 1993 p. 1358\" /> and which comes from ''villano'', meaning peasant or [[Serfdom#Villeins|villein]].<ref name=oed>{{cite dictionary|title=Villanelle|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=villanelle&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> ''Villano'' derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''villanus'', meaning a \"farmhand\".<ref name=oed2>{{cite dictionary|title=Villain|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=villain&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> The etymology of the word relates to the fact that the form's initial distinguishing feature was the [[pastoral]] subject.<ref name=\"Preminger 1993 p. 1358\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe villanelle originated as a simple [[ballad]]-like song\u2014in imitation of peasant songs of an [[Oral literature|oral tradition]]\u2014with no fixed poetic form.

Painting by {{Interlanguage link|Ferdinand Chaigneau|fr}}, 19th century.]]\nA '''villanelle''', also known as '''villanesque''',<ref name=\"Kaster 1903 p. 279\">Kastner 1903 p. 279</ref> is a nineteen-line [[poetry|poetic]] form consisting of five [[tercet]]s followed by a [[quatrain]]. There are two [[refrain]]s and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately at the end of each subsequent stanza until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a [[fixed verse|fixed verse form]]. The word derives from [[Latin]], then [[Italian language|Italian]], and is related to the initial subject of the form being the [[pastoral]].\n\nThe form started as a simple [[ballad]]-like song with no fixed form; this fixed quality would only come much later, from the poem \"Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)\" (1606) by [[Jean Passerat]]. From this point, its evolution into the \"fixed form\" used in the present day is debated. Despite its French origins, the majority of villanelles have been written in English, a trend which began in the late nineteenth century. The villanelle has been noted as a form that frequently treats the subject of obsessions, and one which appeals to outsiders; its defining feature of repetition prevents it from having a conventional tone.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''villanelle'' derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''villanella'', referring to a rustic song or dance,<ref name=\"Preminger 1993 p. 1358\" /> and which comes from ''villano'', meaning peasant or [[Serfdom#Villeins|villein]].<ref name=oed>{{cite dictionary|title=Villanelle|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=villanelle&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> ''Villano'' derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''villanus'', meaning a \"farmhand\".<ref name=oed2>{{cite dictionary|title=Villain|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=villain&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> The etymology of the word relates to the fact that the form's initial distinguishing feature was the [[pastoral]] subject.<ref name=\"Preminger 1993 p. 1358\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe villanelle originated as a simple [[ballad]]-like song\u2014in imitation of peasant songs of an [[Oral literature|oral tradition]]\u2014with no fixed poetic form. These poems were often of a rustic or pastoral subject matter and contained refrains.<ref name=\"Kane 2003 p. 428\">Kane 2003 p. 428</ref><ref name=\"aap\" />\nPrior to the nineteenth century, the term would have simply meant ''country song'', with no particular form implied\u2014a meaning it retains in the vocabulary of early music.<ref name=\"French 2010 p. 245\">French 2010 p. 245</ref> According to Julie Kane, the refrain in each stanza indicates that the form descended from a \"choral dance song\" wherein a vocal soloist\u2014frequently female\u2014semi-improvised the \"unique\" lyrics of each stanza, while a ring of dancers\u2014all female, or male and female mixed\u2014chimed in with the repetitive words of the refrain as they danced around her in a circle.\"<ref>Kane, Julie. \"Introduction.\" ''Villanelles,'' ed. by Annie Finch and Marie-Elizabeth Mali.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n |align = right\n |bgcolor = Cornsilk\n |width = 300px\n |font = Times\n |title = '''\"Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)\"'''\n |tstyle = text-align: right;\n |quote  =\n<poem>\nJ'ay perdu ma Tourterelle:\nEst-ce point celle que j'oy?\nJe veus aller apr\u00e9s elle.\n\nTu regretes ta femelle,\nHelas! aussi fai-je moy,\nJ'ay perdu ma Tourterelle.\n\n(I have lost my turtledove:\nIsn't that her gentle coo?\nI will go and find my love.\n\nHere you mourn your mated love;\nOh, God\u2014I am mourning too:\nI have lost my turtledove.)\n</poem>\n |source = The first two stanzas of \"Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)\" by [[Jean Passerat]] (1534 \u2013 1602), which established the modern villanelle form.<ref name=\"French 2004 pp. 7\u20138\">French 2004 pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n |qalign = right\n}}\n\nThe fixed-form villanelle, containing the nineteen-line dual-refrain, derives from [[Jean Passerat]]'s poem \"Villanelle (J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle)\", published in 1606.<ref name=\"French 2003 p. 1\">French 2003 p. 1</ref> The ''New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (1993) suggests that this became the standard \"villanelle\" when [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodists]] such as [[C\u00e9sar-Pierre Richelet]] based their definitions of the form on that poem.<ref name=\"Preminger 1993 p. 1358\">Preminger 1993 p. 1358</ref> This conclusion is refuted by Kane, however, who argues that it was instead Pierre-Charles Berthelin's additions to Richelet's ''Dictionnaire de rimes'' that first fixed the form, followed a century later by the poet [[Th\u00e9odore de Banville]];<ref name=\"Kane 2003 pp. 440-41\">Kane 2003 pp.&nbsp;440\u201341</ref> his creation of a parody to Passerat's \"J'ay perdu&nbsp;...\" would lead [[Wilhelm T\u00e9nint]] and others to think that the villanelle was an antique form.<ref name=\"French 2004 p. 30\">French 2004 p. 30</ref>\n\nDespite its classification and origin as a French poetic form, by far the majority of villanelles have been written in English.<ref name=\"aap\" /> Subsequent to the publication of Th\u00e9odore de Banville's treatise on prosody \"Petit trait\u00e9 de po\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise\" (1872), the form became popularised in England through [[Edmund Gosse]] and [[Henry Austin Dobson|Austin Dobson]].<ref name=\"Kane 2003 p. 441\">Kane 2003 p. 441</ref> Gosse, Dobson, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Andrew Lang]] and [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] were among the first English practitioners\u2014theirs and other works were published in Gleeson White's ''Ballades and Rondeaus, Chants Royal, Sestinas, Villanelles, &c.

He notes the possibility for the form to evoke, through the relationship between the repeated lines, a feeling of dislocation and a \"paradigm for [[schizophrenia]]\".<ref name=\"Jason 1980 p. 141\"/> This repetition of lines has been considered to prevent villanelles from possessing a \"conventional tone\"<ref name=\"Strand et al. 2001, p. 8\">Strand et al. 2001, p. 8</ref> and that instead they are closer in form to a song or [[lyric poetry]].<ref name=\"Strand et al. 2001, p. 8\"/> [[Stephen Fry]] opines that the villanelle \"is a form that seems to appeal to outsiders, or those who might have cause to consider themselves as such\", having a \"playful artifice\" which suits \"rueful, ironic reiteration of pain or fatalism\".<ref name=\"Fry 2007, p. 228\">Fry 2007, p. 228</ref> (In spite of this, the villanelle has also often been used for [[Light poetry|light verse]], as for instance [[Louis Untermeyer]]'s \"Lugubrious Villanelle of Platitudes\".<ref name=\"Cohen 1922\">{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Helen |title=Lyric Forms from France: Their History and Their Use |url=https://archive.org/details/lyricformsfromf01cohegoog |publisher=Harcourt Brace and Company }}</ref><ref name=\"French 2004 p. 147\">French 2004 p. 147</ref>)\n\nOn the relationship between form and content, [[Anne Ridler]] notes in an introduction to her own poem \"Villanelle for the Middle of the Way\" a point made by [[T.

[[Sinn F\u00e9in]] emerged as the largest party, in their first general election. They adopted a policy of [[Abstentionism#Before partition|abstention]] from the House of [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. Instead they took their election as a mandate for independence and established a revolutionary parliament known as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], with its members known as [[Teachta D\u00e1la|Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] or TDs. It met for the first time on 21 January 1919 in [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in [[Dublin]]. The majority of Sinn F\u00e9in's MPs were imprisoned at the time so only 27 elected representatives attended the initial meeting of the First D\u00e1il. The First D\u00e1il lasted 892 days. Those elected for the remaining Irish seats, from the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] and the [[Irish Unionist Alliance|Irish Unionist Party]], for the most part ignored the invitation to attend the [[First D\u00e1il]]. [[Thomas Harbison]], elected for the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] for [[North East Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Tyrone]], did acknowledge the invitation, but \"stated he should decline for obvious reasons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1919-01-22/2/|title=ROLL CALL.|website=Houses of the Oireachtas |date=22 January 1919|access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnder this [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory, all 105 MPs were members of the D\u00e1il, and their names were called out on the roll of membership.

[[Sinn F\u00e9in]] emerged as the largest party, in their first general election. They adopted a policy of [[Abstentionism#Before partition|abstention]] from the House of [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. Instead they took their election as a mandate for independence and established a revolutionary parliament known as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], with its members known as [[Teachta D\u00e1la|Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] or TDs. It met for the first time on 21 January 1919 in [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in [[Dublin]]. The majority of Sinn F\u00e9in's MPs were imprisoned at the time so only 27 elected representatives attended the initial meeting of the First D\u00e1il. The First D\u00e1il lasted 892 days. Those elected for the remaining Irish seats, from the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] and the [[Irish Unionist Alliance|Irish Unionist Party]], for the most part ignored the invitation to attend the [[First D\u00e1il]]. [[Thomas Harbison]], elected for the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] for [[North East Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Tyrone]], did acknowledge the invitation, but \"stated he should decline for obvious reasons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1919-01-22/2/|title=ROLL CALL.|website=Houses of the Oireachtas |date=22 January 1919|access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnder this [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory, all 105 MPs were members of the D\u00e1il, and their names were called out on the roll of membership.
