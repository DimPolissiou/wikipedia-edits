Alfred P. Sloan, GM's Chairman of the Board, developed the concept for four new GM marques brands - LaSalle, Marquette, Viking and Pontiac - paired with already established brands to fill price gaps he perceived in the General Motors product portfolio. Sloan created LaSalle as a companion marque for Cadillac. LaSalle automobiles were manufactured by Cadillac, but were priced lower than Cadillac-branded automobiles, were smaller, and were marketed as the second-most prestigious marque in the General Motors portfolio. LaSalles were titled as LaSalles, and not as Cadillacs.\n\nLike Cadillac - named after [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]]- the LaSalle brand name was based on that of another French explorer, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==General Motors companion marque strategy==\nThe LaSalle had its beginnings when General Motors' CEO [[Alfred P. Sloan]] noticed that his carefully crafted market segmentation program was beginning to develop price gaps in which General Motors had no products to sell.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In an era when automotive brands were somewhat restricted to building a specific car per model year, Sloan surmised that the best way to bridge the gaps was to develop \"companion\" marques that could be sold through the current sales network.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nAs originally developed by Sloan, General Motors' market-segmentation strategy placed each of the company's individual automobile marques into specific price ranges, called the [[General Motors Companion Make Program]]. The [[Chevrolet]] was designated as the entry-level product. Next, (in ascending order), came the [[Pontiac]], [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland]], [[Oldsmobile]], [[Viking (automobile)|Viking]], [[Marquette (automobile)|Marquette]], [[Buick]], LaSalle, and [[Cadillac]]. By the 1920s, certain General Motors products began to shift out of the plan as the products improved and engine advances were made.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nUnder the companion marque strategy, the gap between the Chevrolet and the Oakland would be filled by a new marque named [[Pontiac]], a quality six-cylinder car designed to sell for the price of a four-cylinder. The wide gap between Oldsmobile and Buick would be filled by two companion marques: Oldsmobile was assigned the up-market [[V8 engine]] [[Viking (automobile)|Viking]] and Buick was assigned the more compact six-cylinder [[Marquette automobile|Marquette]]. Cadillac, which had seen its base prices soar in the heady 1920s, was assigned the LaSalle as a companion marque to fill the gap that existed between it and Buick.<ref name=einstein>{{cite book |last1=Einstein |first1=Arthur W., Jr. |title=Ask the Man Who Owns One: An Illustrated History of Packard Advertising |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mRJh2RFlW4C |accessdate=July 29, 2013 |date=September 10, 2010 |publisher=McFarland & Co. |isbn=9780786447732 |page=123 |quote=The LaSalle was introduced in 1927, and no secret was made of the fact that it was a lower priced Cadillac.

GM used a European theme in its ads that year in an attempt to build the image that the LaSalle was a worldly vehicle, fashionable in all settings and places.]]\nWhat emerged as the LaSalle in 1927 was introduced on the [[GM C platform]] with Cadillac. The 1927 LaSalle was designed by [[Harley Earl]], who had a 30-year career at General Motors, eventually gaining control of all design and styling at General Motors.\n\nPrior to the 1927 LaSalle, automobile design essentially followed a set pattern, with design changes driven principally by engineering needs. For example, the [[Ford Model T]] evolved only slightly over its production run; A 1927 Model T was almost identical to a 1910 Model T.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nEarl, who had been hired by Cadillac's General Manager, Lawrence P. Fisher, conceived the LaSalle not as a junior Cadillac, but as something more agile and stylish. Influenced by the rakish [[Hispano-Suiza]] roadsters of the time, Earl's LaSalle emerged as a smaller, yet elegant, counterpoint to Cadillac's larger cars, unlike anything else built by an American automotive manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==1927\u20131933==\n[[File:La Salle Phaaeton 1928.jpg|thumb|right|1928 LaSalle Series 303 Phaeton]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1930.jpg|right|thumb|1930 LaSalle Series 340, photographed in Perth, Western Australia]]\n\nBuilt by Cadillac to its high standards, the LaSalle soon emerged as a trend-setting automobile. Earl was then placed in charge of overseeing the design of all of General Motors' vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe LaSalle was offered in a full range of body styles, including [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] and [[Fleetwood Metal Body]]-built custom designs. The open cars could also be ordered in tri-tone color combinations, at a time when dark colors like black and navy blue were still the most familiar colors produced by manufacturers. Earl's design even included a nod to the inspirational [[Hispano-Suiza]], with the marque's circled trademark \"LaS\" cast into the horizontal tie bar between the front lights.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}ri\n\nWheelbases ranged between {{convert|128|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|134|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The LaSalles of this era were equipped with Cadillac's \"Ninety Degree V-8\", making the car fast, while its smaller size made it sportier and more agile.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nOn June 20, 1927, a LaSalle driven by Willard Rader, along with Gus Bell, on the track at the [[Milford Proving Grounds]], achieved {{convert|952|mi|km}}, averaging {{convert|95.2|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, with only seven minutes given over to refueling and tire changes. In comparison, the average speed at that year's [[Indianapolis 500]] was {{convert|97.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The test at Milford would have continued, but a problem in the oil system drew the test to an early close, approaching the 9:45 mark.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nLater, the [[Great Depression]], combined with LaSalle's stalling sales numbers, caused Cadillac to rethink its companion make. Both Buick and Oldsmobile had eliminated the Marquette and the Viking in 1930, their second model year. Cadillac also saw sales of its cars losing ground, as confirmed Cadillac buyers tried to trim pennies by buying the less expensive LaSalle. LaSalle sales also were falling, from a high of 22,691 models in 1929 to a low of 3,290 in 1932.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==1934\u20131938==\n[[File:LaSalle 1934 Sedan in Worthington, Ohio, by Sohio Gas Station in 1939.jpg|thumb|left|1934 LaSalle Series 50]]\n[[File:LaSalle Roadster 1936.jpg|thumb|LaSalle Roadster, 1936]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1938 Series 38-5027 Coup\u00e9.jpg|right|thumb|1937 LaSalle Series 50 coupe]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1938 Model 5019 Four-Door Touring Sedan .jpg|left|thumb|1938 LaSalle Series 50]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1937 Series 37-5011 Two-Door Touring Sedan.jpg|thumb|right|1937 LaSalle Series 50 2-door Touring Sedan]]\nBeginning with the 1934 model year, a significant portion of the LaSalle was more closely related to the [[Oldsmobile]] than to senior [[Cadillac]]s.  This was marked by a shift to the Oldsmobile- and Buick-based [[GM B platform|B platform]]. Again, [[Harley Earl|Earl]]'s work with the LaSalle resulted in a graceful vehicle, led by an elegant and thin radiator grille. Earl's other contribution was the modern, airplane-styled, semi-shielded portholes along the side of the hood. All bodies were now made by [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]].<ref name=kimes1996>{{cite book |last1=Kimes |first1=Beverly R. |editor1-first=Henry A. |editor1-last=Clark |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1945 |year=1996 |publisher=Kraus Publications |isbn=0873414284}}</ref>\n\nThis new LaSalle was now priced $1,000 below the least expensive Cadillac. Its mission was not to fill a price gap, but to keep the luxury-car division out of the red. But as the economy began to recover, the LaSalle did not, at least not commensurate with the economy. Sales were 7,195 in 1934, 8,651 in 1935 and 13,004 in 1936.<ref name=kimes1996/>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Packard One-Twenty]] had been introduced in 1935 and was very successful. The LaSalle had additional competition from the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]], introduced in 1936. For 1937, Cadillac made the LaSalle its own again, giving it the {{convert|322|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]] of the [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]], new styling, a lower price range, and a heavy promotion emphasizing that the car was completely Cadillac-built. It was too late. Model year sales of 32,000 LaSalles was a great improvement, but it remained far behind the Packard.<ref name=kimes1996/>\n\nA 1934 LaSalle Model 350 was chosen as the [[Pace Car]] for the [[Indianapolis 500]], and a 1937 LaSalle Series 50 convertible also served as an [[List of Indianapolis 500 pace cars|Indy 500 Pace Car]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==1939\u20131940==\n[[File:LaSalle 1939 50 - V8.jpg|right|thumb|1939 LaSalle Series 50 4-door convertible]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1940 (5768339279).jpg|thumb|left|1940 LaSalle Special Series 52 4-door sedan]]\nIn its final years, the LaSalle once again became more [[Cadillac|Cadillac-like]] in its appearance and details. The narrow radiator grille opening was retained and was flanked by additional side grille work. Headlights, which had moved down and been secured to the body between the grille and the fender, were again attached to the radiator shell. LaSalle also added a [[sunroof]], marketed as the \"Sunshine Turret Top\". Sales climbed from 15,501 in 1938 to 23,028 in 1939.<ref name=kimes1996/>\n\nThe final 1940 LaSalles were introduced in October 1939 with a full array of semi-custom body styles, as it had in its first year, including a convertible sedan. Earl oversaw this redesign. The LaSalle emerged with a smooth-flowing design, its thin radiator flanked by a series of thin chrome slots.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In its final year, sales of the LaSalle reached the second-highest level ever at 24,133.<ref name=kimes1996/> In addition to the Series 50, there was also the lower, wider Special Series 52 using General Motors' new [[GM C platform (1936)|\"Torpedo\"-style body]].\n\n==1941==\nBy the time the decision was made to drop the LaSalle, at least three wood-and-metal mockups had been made for potential 1941 LaSalle models. One was based on the [[notchback]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|GM C platform]], which ended up being shared by the [[Cadillac Series 62]], the [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile 90]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Custom Torpedo]]. A second was based on the [[fastback]] [[GM B platform]], which was eventually shared by the [[Cadillac Series 61]], the [[Buick Century]] and [[Buick Special|Special]], the [[Oldsmobile Series 70|Oldsmobile 70]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo]]. A third was a modified notchback design, derived from the fastback B-body, but described as \"[[GM A platform|A-body]]-like,\" that was finally used by the [[Cadillac Series 61|Cadillac Series 63]]. Any or all of these could have ended up being part of the next LaSalle line. However, it is widely believed that of the three, the third design was most likely to have been a LaSalle, with that platform being assigned exclusively to LaSalle, and that the second design, whose platform was shared with the Series 61, was the next-most-likely. In 1941, sales of the Cadillac Series 61 and 63 were 29,258 and 5,030, respectively.<ref name=kimes1996/><ref name=\"SIA1997\">{{cite journal|journal=Special Interest Autos |issue=#159 May\u2013June 1997 |title=1941 Cadillac Series 63: The Last LaSalle}}</ref>\n\nLaSalle sales had consistently exceeded Cadillac's since 1933, but since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively. It was decided to fold the LaSalle into the more prestigious Cadillac marque.<ref name=\"SIA1997\"/> LaSalle did not have the time to develop a prestigious name before the onset of the Great Depression and did not have the opportunity afterward.<ref name=kimes1996/>\n\n==LaSalle concept vehicles==\n\nIn his 2013 article, \"GM's Road Not Taken\", Robert Cumberford reviewed the restoration of GM's 1955 [[Motorama]] La Salle II Roadster.<ref name=\"warhoops\">{{cite web\n  | title = Joe Bortz and the 1955 LaSalle II Roadster Dream Car\n  | publisher = Chubb Collector Car Insurance, December 19, 2012, Jeff Walker\n  | url = http://www.chubbcollectorcar.com/classic-car-blog/2012/11/07/joe-bortz-and-1955-lasalle-ii-roadster-dream-car}}</ref> Cumberford likened the Roadster to a harbinger of GM's future.

The year 1955 saw two [[Motorama]] concept cars, the LaSalle II four-door hardtop and the LaSalle II Roadster.

Influenced by the rakish [[Hispano-Suiza]] roadsters of the time, Earl's LaSalle emerged as a smaller, yet elegant counterpoint to Cadillac's larger cars, unlike anything else built by an American automotive manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==1927\u20131933==\n[[File:La Salle Phaaeton 1928.jpg|thumb|right|1928 LaSalle Series 303 Phaeton]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1930.jpg|right|thumb|1930 LaSalle Series 340, photographed in Perth, Western Australia]]\n\nBuilt by Cadillac to its high standards, the LaSalle soon emerged as a trend-setting automobile. Earl was then placed in charge of overseeing the design of all of General Motors' vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe LaSalle was offered in a full range of body styles, including [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] and [[Fleetwood Metal Body]]-built custom designs. The open cars could also be ordered in tri-tone color combinations, at a time when dark colors like black and navy blue were still the most familiar colors produced by manufacturers. Earl's design even included a nod to the inspirational [[Hispano-Suiza]], with the marque's circled trademark \"LaS\" cast into the horizontal tie bar between the front lights.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}ri\n\nWheelbases ranged between {{convert|128|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|134|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The LaSalles of this era were equipped with Cadillac's \"Ninety Degree V-8\", making the car fast, while its smaller size made it sportier and more agile.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nOn June 20, 1927, a LaSalle driven by Willard Rader, along with Gus Bell, on the track at the [[Milford Proving Grounds]], achieved {{convert|952|mi|km}}, averaging {{convert|95.2|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, with only seven minutes given over to refueling and tire changes. In comparison, the average speed at that year's [[Indianapolis 500]] was {{convert|97.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The test at Milford would have continued; however, a problem in the oil system drew the test to an early close, approaching the 9:45 mark.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nLater, the [[Great Depression]], combined with LaSalle's stalling sales' numbers, caused Cadillac to rethink its companion make. Both Buick and Oldsmobile had eliminated the Marquette and the Viking in 1930, their second model year. Cadillac also saw sales of its cars losing ground, as confirmed Cadillac buyers tried to trim pennies by buying the less expensive LaSalle. LaSalle sales also were falling, from a high of 22,691 models in 1929 to a low of 3,290 in 1932.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==1934\u20131938==\n[[File:LaSalle 1934 Sedan in Worthington, Ohio, by Sohio Gas Station in 1939.jpg|thumb|left|1934 LaSalle Series 50]]\n[[File:LaSalle Roadster 1936.jpg|thumb|LaSalle Roadster, 1936]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1938 Series 38-5027 Coup\u00e9.jpg|right|thumb|1937 LaSalle Series 50 coupe]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1938 Model 5019 Four-Door Touring Sedan .jpg|left|thumb|1938 LaSalle Series 50]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1937 Series 37-5011 Two-Door Touring Sedan.jpg|thumb|right|1937 LaSalle Series 50 2-door Touring Sedan]]\nBeginning with the 1934 model year, a significant portion of the LaSalle was more closely related to the [[Oldsmobile]], than to senior [[Cadillac]]s.  This was marked by a shift to the Oldsmobile and Buick-based [[GM B platform|B platform]]. Again, [[Harley Earl|Earl]]'s work with the LaSalle resulted in a graceful vehicle, led by an elegant and thin radiator grille. Earl's other contribution was the modern, airplane-styled, semi-shielded portholes along the side of the hood. All bodies were now made by [[Fleetwood Metal Body|Fleetwood]].<ref name=kimes1996>{{cite book |last1=Kimes |first1=Beverly R. |editor1-first=Henry A. |editor1-last=Clark |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1945 |year=1996 |publisher=Kraus Publications |isbn=0873414284}}</ref>\n\nThis new LaSalle was now priced $1,000 less than the least expensive Cadillac, its mission was not to fill a price gap, but to keep the luxury car division out of the red. But as the economy began to recover, the LaSalle did not, at least not commensurate with the economy. Sales were 7,195 in 1934, 8,651 in 1935 and 13,004 in 1936.<ref name=kimes1996/>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Packard One-Twenty]] had been introduced in 1935 and was very successful. The LaSalle had additional competition from the [[Lincoln-Zephyr]], introduced in 1936. For 1937, Cadillac made the LaSalle its own again, giving it the {{convert|322|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]] of the [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]], new styling, a lower price range, and a heavy promotion, emphasizing the car was completely Cadillac built. It was too late. Model year sales of 32,000 LaSalles was a great improvement, but it remained far behind the Packard.<ref name=kimes1996/>\n\nA 1934 LaSalle Model 350 was chosen as the [[Pace Car]] for the [[Indianapolis 500]] and a 1937 LaSalle Series 50 convertible also served as an [[List of Indianapolis 500 pace cars|Indy 500 Pace Car]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==1939\u20131940==\n[[File:LaSalle 1939 50 - V8.jpg|right|thumb|1939 LaSalle Series 50 4-door convertible]]\n[[File:LaSalle 1940 (5768339279).jpg|thumb|left|1940 LaSalle Special Series 52 4-door sedan]]\nIn its final years, the LaSalle once again became more [[Cadillac|Cadillac-like]] in its appearance and details. The narrow radiator grille opening was retained and was flanked by additional side grille work. Headlights, which had moved down and been secured to the body between the grille and the fender, were again attached to the radiator shell. LaSalle also added a [[sunroof]], marketed as the \"Sunshine Turret Top\". Sales climbed up from 15,501 in 1938 to 23,028 in 1939.<ref name=kimes1996/>\n\nThe final 1940 LaSalles were introduced in October 1939 with, as it had in its first year, a full array of semi-custom body styles, including a convertible sedan. Earl oversaw this redesign. The LaSalle emerged with a smooth-flowing design, its thin radiator flanked by a series of thin chrome slots.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In its final year, sales of the LaSalle reached the second highest level ever at 24,133.<ref name=kimes1996/> In addition to the Series 50, there was also the lower, wider Special Series 52 using General Motors' new [[GM C platform (1936)|\"Torpedo\"-style body]].\n\n==1941==\nBy the time the decision was made to drop the LaSalle at least three wood and metal mockups had been made for potential 1941 LaSalle models. One was based on the [[notchback]] [[GM C platform (RWD)|GM C platform]] which ended up being shared by the [[Cadillac Series 62]], [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile 90]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Custom Torpedo]]. A second was based on the [[fastback]] [[GM B platform]] which ended up being shared by the [[Cadillac Series 61]], the [[Buick Century]] and [[Buick Special|Special]], the [[Oldsmobile Series 70|Oldsmobile 70]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo|Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo]]. A third was a modified notchback design, derived from the fastback B-body, but described as \"[[GM A platform|A-body]]-like\", that ended up being used by the [[Cadillac Series 61|Cadillac Series 63]]. Any or all of these could have ended up being part of the next LaSalle line. However, it has been inferred that of the three, the third design was most likely to have been a LaSalle, with that platform being assigned exclusively to LaSalle, and that the second design, whose platform was shared with the Series 61, was the next most likely. In 1941 sales of the Cadillac Series 61 and 63 were 29,258 and 5,030 respectively.<ref name=kimes1996/><ref name=\"SIA1997\">{{cite journal|journal=Special Interest Autos |issue=#159 May\u2013June 1997 |title=1941 Cadillac Series 63: The Last LaSalle}}</ref>\n\nLaSalle sales had consistently exceeded Cadillac's since 1933, but since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively.

The executive producer is [[John Battsek]].\n\nThe film is a drama-documentary-animation hybrid which stars [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as a man living alone in the devastated world of 2055, watching archival film and asking \"Why didn't we stop [[global warming|climate change]] when we had the chance?\"\n\nThe makers of ''The Age of Stupid'' were among the first to use the [[crowdfunding]] model and pioneered a new [[film distribution|distribution]] system, [[Indie Screenings]], which allows anyone, anywhere, to hold a [[Film screening|screening]] of the film and keep the profits for themselves.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indie Screenings| url=http://www.indiescreenings.net/ | work=[[Indie Screenings]] }}</ref>{{Better source|reason=That's the Indie Screenings site; we would need a third-party reliable source to state that the model works.|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in 2055, in a world ravaged by catastrophic climate change; [[London]] is flooded, [[Sydney]] is burning, [[Las Vegas]] has been swallowed up by desert, the [[Amazon rainforest]] has burnt up, snow has vanished from the [[Alps]], and nuclear war has laid waste to [[India]]. An unnamed archivist ([[Pete Postlethwaite]]) is entrusted with the safekeeping of humanity's surviving store of art and knowledge. Alone in his vast repository off the coast of the largely ice-free [[Arctic]], he reviews archival footage from back \"when we could have saved ourselves\", trying to discern where it all went wrong.\n\nAmid news reports of the gathering [[Effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] and global civilisation teetering towards destruction, he alights on six stories of individuals whose lives in the early years of the 21st century seem to illustrate aspects of the impending catastrophe. These six stories take the form of interweaving documentary segments that report on the lives of real people around the year 2008 and switch the film's narrative form from fiction to fact.
