It remains the western frontier of present-day [[Pakistan]], extending from the [[Pamir Knot]] in the north to the Koh-i-Malik Siah in the west,<ref>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 2</ref> and separating the modern Pakistani frontier regions of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] (renamed as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] from neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] in the west. The borderline between is officially known as the [[Durand Line]] and divides [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] inhabitants of these provinces from Pashtuns in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe two main gateways on the North West Frontier are the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Bolan Pass]]es. Since ancient times, the Indian subcontinent has been repeatedly invaded through these northwestern routes. With the expansion of the [[Russian Empire]] into [[Central Asia]] in the twentieth century, stability of the Frontier and control of Afghanistan became cornerstones of defensive strategy for British India.\n\nMuch of the Frontier was occupied by [[Ranjit Singh]] in the early 19th century, and then taken over by the [[East India Company]] when it annexed the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp10>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 10</ref>\n\nBetween 1849 and 1947 the military history of the frontier was a succession of punitive expeditions against offending [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] (or ''Pathan'') tribes, punctuated by three wars against Afghanistan. Many British officers who went on to distinguished command in the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] learnt their soldiering on the North-West Frontier, which they called the ''Grim''.<ref>Wilkinson-Latham, pp. 3 & 38</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\n{{Further|History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa}}\n{{See also|Military history of Pakistan}}\n\n===Afghanistan===\nIn 1747 when Ahmad Kh\u0101n Abd\u0101l\u012b seized control of [[Kandahar]], [[Kabul]], and [[Peshawar]], and, as '''[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]''', was proclaimed [[Shah]] of the [[Pashtun people|Afghans]].<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp8>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 8</ref> He went on to conquer [[Herat]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]], and established an empire from the [[Oxus]] to the [[Indus]].<ref>Barthorp 2002, p. 14</ref> On his death in 1773, the Afghan domain included [[Baluchistan]], [[Sindh]], the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and [[Kashmir]].<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp8/> Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son [[Timur Shah Durrani]], whose rule of twenty years saw the Afghan tide begin to ebb. Timur left many sons but no heir, and the resultant internecine struggles for the throne lasted more than thirty years. During this period the Punjab was effectively ceded to its erstwhile governor [[Ranjit Singh]], Iran recovered Khorassan, and Sindh broke away.<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp8/> In 1813 [[Sikh]] forces from the Punjab crossed the Indus and seized the old [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] fort at [[Attock]]. In 1819 Kashmir was lost, and west of the Indus [[Derajat]] also. Four years later the winter capital at Peshawar came under attack.<ref name=Barthorpp15-8>Barthorp 2002, pp. 15-18</ref>\n\n{{further|Durrani Empire}}\n\nIn 1826 '''[[Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Dost Mohammad Khan]]''' emerged as undisputed ruler in Kabul, and was there proclaimed [[Emir]].<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp9>''Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 9</ref> He defeated a further attempt to oust him by his exiled rival [[Shuja Shah Durrani]] in 1833; however the Sikhs seized all of Peshawar the following year. In 1837 Dost Mohammad launched a counter-attack through the Khyber, but the Afghan force was halted at [[Jamrud Fort]].<ref name=Barthorpp18>Barthorp 2002, p. 18</ref> Dost Mohammad had sought assistance from the [[East India Company]] against the resurgent Punjab, but was rebuffed. So Dost Mohammad turned to [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] for help.<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp9/>\n\n{{further|Emirate of Afghanistan}}\n{{see also|European influence in Afghanistan}}\n\n===Sikh Empire (1799\u20131849)===\n{{Main|Sikh Empire}}\n[[File:Overview of Afghanistan and the Countries on the Northwest Border of India WDL217.png|thumb|Overview of Afghanistan and the Countries on the Northwest Border of India 1842]]\n[[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] (Punjabi: \u0a2e\u0a39\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a1c\u0a3e \u0a30\u0a23\u0a1c\u0a40\u0a24 \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a18 ), (1780\u20131839) was a Sikh ruler of the sovereign country of Punjab and the Sikh Empire. His Samadhi is located in Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nHe then spent the following years fighting the Afghans, driving them out of western Punjab, taking opportunity of the Afghans being embroiled in civil war. The deposed Afghan king [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]] rallied a significant number of tribes and received British backing in the form of the Sikh army against the [[Barakzai]] king [[Dost Mohammad Barakzai|Dost Muhammad]]. The civil war in Afghanistan coupled with a British backed assault meant that the Sikhs could virtually walk into Peshawar. They managed to capture Pashtun territory including Peshawar which was under direct British supervision and control.\n\n===British East India Company===\n[[File:HILL TRIBESMEN SNIPING A BRITISH FORCE ON THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER..gif|thumb|Hill Tribes men sniping a British Force]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, the [[East India Company]] controlled southern India, [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]], and [[Odisha|Orissa]] (modern Odisha). Dominance was gained at the expense of its French equivalent, the ''[[Compagnie des Indes]]''. Britain and France were at [[Napoleonic Wars|war]], and the [[Franco-Persian alliance]] of 1807, followed the same year by the Franco-Russian [[Treaty of Tilsit]], alerted the ''HEIC'' to the external threat posed from the north-west.<ref>Barthorp 2002, p. 19</ref>\n\nBy 1819 only [[Sindh]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] remained outside the Company's control. [[Napoleon]] was vanquished, but the [[Russian Empire|Empire of the Tsars]] had begun to expand south and east. Russian influence grew likewise, and by the early 1830s [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Ir\u0101n]] was within the Tsar's sphere. Attempts by Ir\u0101n to recover [[Herat]] in 1834, and again in 1837, raised the spectre of Russian armies on the road to [[Kandahar]], whence direct access to India through the [[Khojak Pass|Khojak]] and [[Bolan Pass|Bolan]] passes.<ref>Barthorp 2002, p. 29</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the conflict between Afghanistan and the Punjab focused on the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber route]]. Dost Mohammad appealed to the HEIC for aid in recovering Peshawar, but the Company could not help him without alienating its treaty ally Ranjit Singh. When Dost Mohammad redirected his appeal to Russia, the [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]] resolved to depose Dost Mohammad, and replace him with Shuja Shah Durrani. Restored to his throne in Kabul, the exiled former ruler would accept the Sikh gains west of the Indus, and the Company controlling his foreign policy. The agreement was formalised with the '''Treaty of Simla''' signed in June 1838 between Shah Shuja, the HEIC, and Ranjit Singh.<ref>Barthorp 2002, pp. 30-31</ref>\n\n{{further|Company rule in India}}\n {{see also|East India Company}}\n\n===British Indian Empire===\n{{main|British Raj}}\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===1800\u20131837 (Afghan-Sikh Wars)===\n*[[Battle of Attock]] (1813)\n*[[Battle of Multan]] (1818)\n*[[Battle of Shopian]] (1819)\n*[[Battle of Nowshera]] (1823)\n*[[Battle of Jamrud]] (1837)\n\n===1838\u201348 (First Afghan War to Second Sikh War)===\n\n*[[First Anglo-Afghan War]] (1838\u20131842)\n*[[Sindh#British Raj|Sindh Campaign]] (1843)\n*[[First Anglo-Sikh War]] (1845\u201346)\n*[[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] (1848\u201349)\n\n===1849\u201358 (Second Sikh War to Sepoy Revolt)===\n\nIn the period following the [[Punjab Province (British India)#History|annexation of the Punjab]] in 1849 until the [[Sepoy Mutiny of 1857]], several expeditions were undertaken against almost every tribe along the whole of the North-West Frontier, most notably under [[Charles James Napier|Sir Charles Napier]] and [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], under orders from the governor-general, [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]]. Disgusted at being instructed to burn Pathan villages, first Napier and then Campbell resigned and returned to England. Campbell had already decided that the best method of dealing with the tribesmen on the frontier was through bribery.<ref>Greenwood, ch.6</ref>\n\nWhen the '''Sepoy Rebellion''' broke out Amir [[Dost Mohammad Khan]] came under internal pressure to seize the advantage and attack India. However he stood by his treaty obligations.

The following year Sher Ali signed a treaty with Russia. India sent a mission anyway, but the mission and its armed escort were denied passage through the Khyber Pass. India threatened to invade, and when no apology was forthcoming, did so. Sher Ali died while fleeing to Russian territory, and his son [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan|Yakub]] succeeded him. On May 26, 1879, '''Amir Yakub''' signed the '''[[Treaty of Gandamak]]''', whereby Afghanistan surrendered its foreign policy to India, which in turn promised protection from aggression. Afghanistan ceded some territory and accepted a [[British Resident]] in Kabul.<ref>Wilkinson-Latham, p. 14-15</ref>\n\nIn September 1879, some six weeks after establishing his residency, [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Sir Louis Cavagnari]] and his escort were murdered. Hostilities promptly resumed. Yakub's army was defeated in September 1880, and his throne was offered to, and accepted by, '''[[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]]''', who agreed to surrender all claims on the Khyber, the [[Kurram Valley|Kurram]], [[Sibi]], and [[Pishin District|Pishin]].<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp11>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 11</ref>\n\n*'''[[Second Afghan War]]''' (1878\u20131880)\n*[[Zakka Khel Expeditions (1878\u20139)]]\n*[[Operations against the Mohmands (1878\u201380)]]<ref>Includes the Expedition to Kam Dakka.</ref>\n*[[Operations against the Zaimukht (1878\u20139)]]\n*[[Operations against the Marris (1880)]]\n*[[Mahsud-Waziri Expedition (1881)]]\n*[[Expedition to the Takht-i-Suliman (1883)]]\n*[[Third Black Mountain Expedition]] (1888)\n*[[Operations in the Zhob Valley (1890\u20131)]]\n*[[Fourth Black Mountain Expedition]] (1891)\n*[[Miranzai Expeditions (1891)]]\n*[[Hunza-Nagar Expedition]] (1891)\n*[[Mahsud Expedition (1894\u20135)]]\n*[[Chitral expedition]] (1895)\n*[[Tochi Expedition|Tochi Valley Expedition (1897)]]\n*[[Siege of Malakand]] (1897)\n*[[Operations of the Buner Field Force (1897-1898)]]<ref>Includes the action at Laudakai and the capture of the Tanga Pass</ref>\n*[[Tirah Campaign]] (1897)\n*[[Mohmand campaign of 1897\u201398|First Mohmand campaign (1897-1898)]]\n\n===1898\u20131914 (Frontier Revolt to Great War)===\n*[[Mahsud Waziri blockade]] (1900\u20131902)\n*[[Kabul Khel#1902 war|Kabul Khel Expedition (1902)]]\n*[[Bazar Valley campaign]] (1908)\n*[[Mohmand Expedition of 1908]]\n\n===1914\u20131918 (First World War)===\n[[File:WarMemorialBangalore.jpg|thumb|right| Madras Regiment War Memorial, [[Bangalore]], mentions lives lost in the North West Frontier by the [[Madras Engineer Group|Madras Sappers]]]]\nIn support of the British war effort, the [[Indian Army (1895-1947)|Indian Army]] deployed [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary forces]]  to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East Africa]], [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai and Palestine]].<ref>Sumner, p. 6</ref> India was thus vulnerable to hostile attention from Afghanistan.

With India's Army de-mobilising, and its Government preoccupied with violent unrest in western India, Amanullah sent his troops across the Frontier in early May. At the end of the month he sought an armistice, which was granted on June 3.<ref>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 50</ref> By the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]] signed in August, Afghanistan gained control of its foreign affairs, and in turn, recognised the [[Durand Line]] as its border with India.<ref>Robson, ''Crisis on the Frontier'' pp. 136\u20137</ref>\n\nThe short-lived war had long-term consequences in [[Waziristan]], where tribesmen rallied to Amanullah's cause. The western militia [[Military base|posts]] were abandoned. Many of the militia deserted, taking their modern weapons and joining their fellow tribesmen in attacking the remaining posts. As a result, the Indian Army's ''Waziristan Force'' was fully engaged in re-establishing the posts and restoring the lines of communication from November until May 1920.

In 1921 work began on the southern road up the [[Tank Zam]] from [[Jandola]], under the protection of the Waziristan Force. The following year work on the northern road from the [[Tochi Valley|Tochi]] began at [[Idak]], shielded by the ''Razmak Force'' advancing to its objective.

[[Harry Burnett Lumsden|Harry Lumsden]], and later based at '''Hoti [[Mardan]]'''.<ref name=IALJ19p964>''Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919'', p. 964</ref> Originally one [[troop]] of cavalry and two [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of infantry,<ref name=IndiasArmyp85>Jackson, p. 85</ref> the cavalry component later expanded to 2\u00bd [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]], and the infantry to 4\u00bd companies.<ref name=IALJ19p964/> Two further infantry [[battalion]]s were raised in 1917.<ref>''Quarterly Indian Army List January 1919'', pp. 968 & 970</ref>\n\nFrom its inception the corps was clothed in native style, with smock, baggy trousers and turban of home-spun cotton, and jerkin of sheepskin. The cotton was dyed grey with a derivative of a [[dwarf palm]] known as ''mazari'', while the leather was dyed '''[[khaki (color)|khaki]]''' with [[mulberry]] juice. Thus was military dress first coloured khaki for its [[camouflage]] effect, and the Guides were the first troops to wear it.<ref>Jackson p. 537</ref> The drab colour is well suited to the barren rocky terrain of the North-West Frontier, and all but one of the other Punjab frontier units soon followed the Guides example.<ref>Jackson, p. 538</ref>\n\nIn 1848 the [[Second Sikh War]] broke out and the corps won its first [[battle honours]]; 'M<small>OOLTAN</small>', [[Battle of Gujrat|'G<small>OOJERAT</small>']], and 'P<small>UNJAUB</small>'. Thereafter the Guides were engaged in most frontier affairs, and from 1857 the corps was included in the '''[[Punjab Irregular Force]]''', and subsequently in the '''Punjab Frontier Force'''.\n\nThat same year the Corps of Guides was ordered to Delhi, covering the 930&nbsp;km from Mardan in twenty-two days and famously going into action on arrival.<ref name=Gaylorp171>Gaylor, p. 171</ref> They were duly honoured with [[Siege of Delhi|D<small>ELHI</small> 1857]].<ref name=Rogerp55/>\n\nAt the beginning of the '''[[Second Afghan War]]''' in 1878, the Guides Infantry, together with the 1st Sikh Infantry, PFF, took part in forcing the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]], and were prominent in seizing the fortress of [[Ali Masjid]].<ref>Jackson, p. 90</ref> For this and subsequent efforts the Corps of Guides was awarded the battle honours [[Battle of Ali Masjid|A<small>LI</small> M<small>ASJID</small>]], [[Battle of Kabul (1879)|K<small>ABUL</small> 1879]], and A<small>FGHANISTAN</small> 1878\u201380.\n\nThe last decade of the 19th century saw the Guides employed in the [[Chitral Expedition|Chitral campaign]] of 1895, and the [[Punjab Frontier Revolt]] of 1897\u20138. Thus was the corps awarded the battle honours 'C<small>HITRAL</small>', [[Siege of Malakand|'M<small>ALAKAND</small>']], and 'P<small>UNJAB</small> F<small>RONTIER</small>'.\n\nThe reforms of 1903 gave to the '''[[Queen's Own Corps of Guides (Lumsden's)]]''' a subsidiary title in the form of its founders name, but left it numberless. In 1911 the corps took up  '''Frontier Force''' as its first subsidiary title.<ref name=IALJ19p964/>\n\nDuring the First World War the cavalry branch of the Corps was deployed overseas to [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], but not before winning a further honour in its own territory; 'N.W.

The expression 'Scouts' was a militarily neutral term, conveying neither the \"crack\" reputation associated with the word 'Rifles' (cf.: 60th Rifles [HM], Gurkha Rifles [IA], etc.), nor the rather second-rate expectations of the term 'Militia'. As General Baden-Powell noted, when he was looking, many years later, for a suitably inspiring term to adopt for his youth movement to train young boys in fieldcraft and other 'para-military' activities, the word Scouts encapsulated a spirit of 'dash' (enthusiasm), expertise - within a defined set of skills- and familiarity with both the local conditions. Similarly, the Scouts of the Frontier Corps understood both the local terrain and the local political minefields, that is, who could be trusted (e.g. the Turi), and who could never (almost invariably, this would mean the Mahsuds); who was currently nursing a grievance and therefore best avoided, and who had just had a claim settled to their satisfaction and might be uncharacteristically friendly.\n\nLike many things British, the development of the units of Scouts into the Frontier Corps was organic, unplanned and initially unsystematic. It began, in the British manner, as an improvisation to meet a need; it was maintained because it guaranteed certain unique skills at an acceptable price (the great Empire may have vaunted its 'pomp and circumstance' to wow the impressionable, but behind the scenes the deciding factor was often simply the acceptability or otherwise to HM Treasury) and only then was the principle regularised, standardised and systemised (cf. the development of the Frontier Force, from irregulars to a corps d'elite).\n\n====Chronology====\n\n* 1878: the [[Khyber Rifles]]<ref>First raised as the Khyber Jezailchis.

It remains the western frontier of present-day [[Pakistan]], extending from the [[Pamir Knot]] in the north to the Koh-i-Malik Siah in the west,<ref>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 2</ref> and separating the modern Pakistani frontier regions of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] (renamed as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] from neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] in the west. The borderline between is officially known as the [[Durand Line]] and divides [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] inhabitants of these provinces from Pashtuns in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe two main gateways on the North West Frontier are the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Bolan Pass]]es. Since ancient times, the Indian subcontinent has been repeatedly invaded through these northwestern routes. With the expansion of the [[Russian Empire]] into [[Central Asia]] in the twentieth century, stability of the Frontier and control of Afghanistan became cornerstones of defensive strategy for British India.\n\nMuch of the Frontier was occupied by [[Ranjit Singh]] in the early 19th century, and then taken over by the [[East India Company]] when it annexed the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp10>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 10</ref>\n\nBetween 1849 and 1947 the military history of the frontier was a succession of punitive expeditions against offending [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] (or ''Pathan'') tribes, punctuated by three wars against Afghanistan. Many British officers who went on to distinguished command in the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] learnt their soldiering on the North-West Frontier, which they called the ''Grim''.<ref>Wilkinson-Latham, pp. 3 & 38</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\n{{Further|History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa}}\n{{See also|Military history of Pakistan}}\n\n===Afghanistan===\nIn 1747 when Ahmad Kh\u0101n Abd\u0101l\u012b seized control of [[Kandahar]], [[Kabul]], and [[Peshawar]], and, as '''[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]''', was proclaimed [[Shah]] of the [[Pashtun people|Afghans]].<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp8>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p. 8</ref> He went on to conquer [[Herat]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]], and established an empire from the [[Oxus]] to the [[Indus]].<ref>Barthorp 2002, p. 14</ref> On his death in 1773, the Afghan domain included [[Baluchistan]], [[Sindh]], the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and [[Kashmir]].<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp8/> Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son [[Timur Shah Durrani]], whose rule of twenty years saw the Afghan tide begin to ebb. Timur left many sons but no heir, and the resultant internecine struggles for the throne lasted more than thirty years. During this period the Punjab was effectively ceded to its erstwhile governor [[Ranjit Singh]], Iran recovered Khorassan, and Sindh broke away.<ref name=3rdAfghanWarp8/> In 1813 [[Sikh]] forces from the Punjab crossed the Indus and seized the old [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] fort at [[Attock]]. In 1819 Kashmir was lost, and west of the Indus [[Derajat]] also.

His Samadhi is located in Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nHe then spent the following years fighting the Afghans, driving them out of western Punjab, taking opportunity of the Afghans being embroiled in civil war. The deposed Afghan king [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]] rallied a significant number of tribes and received British backing in the form of the Sikh army against the [[Barakzai]] king [[Dost Mohammad Barakzai|Dost Muhammad]]. The civil war in Afghanistan coupled with a British backed assault meant that the Sikhs could virtually walk into Peshawar. They managed to capture Pashtun territory including Peshawar which was under direct British supervision and control.\n\n===British East India Company===\n[[File:HILL TRIBESMEN SNIPING A BRITISH FORCE ON THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER..gif|thumb|Hill Tribes men sniping a British Force]]\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, the [[East India Company]] controlled southern India, [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]], and [[Odisha|Orissa]] (modern Odisha). Dominance was gained at the expense of its French equivalent, the ''[[Compagnie des Indes]]''. Britain and France were at [[Napoleonic Wars|war]], and the [[Franco-Persian alliance]] of 1807, followed the same year by the Franco-Russian [[Treaty of Tilsit]], alerted the ''HEIC'' to the external threat posed from the north-west.<ref>Barthorp 2002, p. 19</ref>\n\nBy 1819 only [[Sindh]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] remained outside the Company's control. [[Napoleon]] was vanquished, but the [[Russian Empire|Empire of the Tsars]] had begun to expand south and east. Russian influence grew likewise, and by the early 1830s [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Ir\u0101n]] was within the Tsar's sphere. Attempts by Ir\u0101n to recover [[Herat]] in 1834, and again in 1837, raised the spectre of Russian armies on the road to [[Kandahar]], whence direct access to India through the [[Khojak Pass|Khojak]] and [[Bolan Pass|Bolan]] passes.<ref>Barthorp 2002, p. 29</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the conflict between Afghanistan and the Punjab focused on the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber route]]. Dost Mohammad appealed to the HEIC for aid in recovering Peshawar, but the Company could not help him without alienating its treaty ally Ranjit Singh. When Dost Mohammad redirected his appeal to Russia, the [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]] resolved to depose Dost Mohammad, and replace him with Shuja Shah Durrani. Restored to his throne in Kabul, the exiled former ruler would accept the Sikh gains west of the Indus, and the Company controlling his foreign policy.

The expression 'Scouts' was a militarily neutral term, conveying neither the \"crack\" reputation associated with the word 'Rifles' (cf.: 60th Rifles [HM], Gurkha Rifles [IA], etc.), nor the rather second-rate expectations of the term 'Militia'. As General Baden-Powell noted, when he was looking, many years later, for a suitably inspiring term to adopt for his youth movement to train young boys in fieldcraft and other 'para-military' activities, the word Scouts encapsulated a spirit of 'dash' (enthusiasm), expertise - within a defined set of skills- and familiarity with both the local conditions. Similarly, the Scouts of the Frontier Corps understood both the local terrain and the local political minefields, that is, who could be trusted (e.g. the Turi), and who could never (almost invariably, this would mean the Mahsuds); who was currently nursing a grievance and therefore best avoided, and who had just had a claim settled to their satisfaction and might be uncharacteristically friendly.\n\nLike many things British, the development of the units of Scouts into the Frontier Corps was organic, unplanned and initially unsystematic. It began, in the British manner, as an improvisation to meet a need; it was maintained because it guaranteed certain unique skills at an acceptable price (the great Empire may have vaunted its 'pomp and circumstance' to wow the impressionable, but behind the scenes the deciding factor was often simply the acceptability or otherwise to HM Treasury) and only then was the principle regularised, standardised and systemised (cf. the development of the Frontier Force, from irregulars to a corps d'elite).\n\n====Chronology====\n\n* 1878: the [[Khyber Rifles]]<ref>First raised as the Khyber Jezailchis.

He says, \"This one is for the masses, for youngsters, for those who loved part one and enjoyed its crazy hilarity.\" He concludes \"''KYAA SUPER KOOL HAIN HUM'' offers entertainment, entertainment and only entertainment in large doses!\"<ref name=\"Review 1\"/> Sonia Chopra of Sify gave the movie 3/5 stars, concluding that \"Director Sachin Yardi tells the story in his usual, unapologetic style. One would call the film clumsy, had it not been funny. But humorous it is, even if in parts. Worth a watch, if you're not very high-brow or prudish when it comes to humour.\"<ref name=\"Review 2\" /> Martin D'Souza of Glamsham gave 3/5 stars, commenting that \"Ceetis and taalis are bound to accompany a few scenes and the first three days will tell if it has crossed the Rs 100-crore mark, which I'm afraid it might.\"<ref name=\"Review 3\" /> Madhureeta Mukherjee of ''Times of India'' gave the movie 3/5 stars, stating that \"If you were sex (comedy) starved after Kyaa Kool Hai Hum, this sequel force-feeds you a double dose. This one's for teens who get a 'boner' out of bad jokes, but it may get a rise out of some adults too. Watch at your own 'risque'.\"<ref name=\"Review 4\"/>\n\nMansha Rastogi of Now Running gave the movie 2.5/5 stars, saying that \"To sum it up, Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum makes for a time pass one time watch. However, if for a better second half, the film would've worked more!\"<ref name=\"Review 5\" /> Roshni Devi of Koimoi gave 2.5/5 stars, concluding that \"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum has some laughs, which may be enough for the producers to laugh their way to the bank.\"<ref name=\"Review 6\" /> Vinayak Chakravorthy of India Today gave the movie 2.5/5 stars, stating that \"Director Sachin Yardi almost deliberately plays dumb with his narrative. His effort is a randy, satirical punch on almost every trick that defines Bollywood's 100-crore club. The film makes you snigger, and then you snigger at yourself for doing as much at something so obviously silly and raunchy. You realise there is reason behind the mindless mayhem that just unfolded before your eyes as the end credits roll. It's called box-office moolah, and this film is going to make lots of it.\"<ref name=\"Review 7\" /> Kunal Guha of Yahoo! gave the movie 2/5 stars, commenting that \"'Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum' is surely a school of sickeningly dirty jokes that will shock, disgust and scandalize but ensure that you have a good time. So don't leave your brains (or any other organs) at home, you will need it to dig out the implied meaning in every line.\"<ref name=\"Review 8\" /> Aniruddha Guha of DNA India gave the movie 2/5 stars, saying that \"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum amuses you intermittently but largely leaves your brains in a tangle, and the mind gasping for breath. In other words, dimaag ki macho deta hai.\"<ref name=\"Review 9\" /> Deboshree Ghosh of Bollywood Life gave the movie 2/5 stars, concluding that \"We would have had thought of giving this film a thumbs-up if Tusshar Kapoor had not shown off his rear in the film, supposedly imitating John Abraham in Dostana. That simply made us pucker our lips and turn our noses up in extreme distaste. Ew!\"<ref name=\"Review 10\" /> Shomini Sen of Zee News gave the movie 2/5 stars, stating that \"KSKHH is an assault to your brain to say the least. But we know you will watch it nevertheless. After all don't we go to the movies to get entertained and not take on more stress? Go on, watch it but do carry a bottle of painkillers with you. Might come in handy later.\"<ref name=\"Review 11\" />\n\nAnupama Chopra of ''Hindustan Times'' gave 1.5/5 stars, commenting that \"Writer-director Sachin Yardi is too lazy to create a plot, so the film is just a series of gags that allow him to bung in as many puerile sexual innuendos as possible. Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum becomes a drag within the first twenty minutes and then continues for another two hours or so.\"<ref name=\"Review 12\" /> Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 1.5/5 stars, saying that \"I'm going with one-and-a-half out of five for 'Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum'. It's not that the humor's adult that is the issue here, it's that it doesn't make you laugh!\"<ref name=\"Review 13\" /> Mayank Shekhar of Daily Bhaskar gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, stating that \"All the humour is in the lines. The dialogue writer of this film is a decent chutkula writer, suited best for stand-up comedies or hasya kavitas. You know at some point the jokes will dry up. They'll start exhausting you with their only meaning; let alone the double meaning. The film will lose energy too, given there wasn't much of a plot to keep it going for this long.\"<ref name=\"Review 14\" /> Raja Sen of Rediff gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, stating that \"Sachin Yardi's Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum is, an A-rated film that feels the need to shy away from swearwords and put big, forbidding 'Adults' stickers onto even copulating canines. The film wants to be racy, but has television-friendliness forced onto its very being: which explains actors dropping their jaws at the (suggested) mention of genitalia and constantly hiding behind clumsy innuendo.\"<ref name=\"Review 15\" /> Blessy Chettiar of DNA India gave the movie 1/5 stars, commenting that \"Tawdry innuendos, racial slurs, repugnant gibes at the gay community and overall cheap humour define the 'kool' of KSKHH. Sorry boss, we define our own cool, and KSKHH figures nowhere close.\"<ref name=\"Review 16\" /> [[Karan Anshuman]] of Mumbai Mirror gave 1/5 stars, saying that \"There are sex comedies. Then there are bad sex comedies. Then there is just bad. And then finally \u2013 right at the bottom of this pile \u2013 there is KSKHH. It has innuendos so obvious, swearing so uninhibited, and gestures so lewd, that you can only imagine what must be going on in the writers' minds to distill this from their imaginations.\"<ref name=\"Review 17\" /> Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the movie 1/5 stars, concluding that \"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum strives very hard indeed to be a worthy adult comedy, a poor Indian country cousin of American Pie, but all it manages to be is a juvenile and clunky ride through unending yards of the kind of laboured gags that went out of vogue with Dada Kondke. The film is ostensibly targeted at the teen segment and it might even find some takers there. But it barely passes muster as a sex comedy. It's crude, crass and completely clueless.\"<ref name=\"Review 18\" /> Janhavi Samant of Mid-Day gave the movie 0.5/5 stars, stating that \"The whole film is pretty much avoidable. Neither vulgar enough to denounce, nor gross enough to outrage, nor absurd enough to be funny, just plain indifferent and insipid.\"<ref name=\"Review 19\" /> Subhash K Jha of Indicine gave the movie 0/5 stars, commenting that \"So is risque sexy? Is raunchy cool? You decide. As far as I am concerned I am still too numbed by the ceaseless torrent of verbal obscenity to figure out if a barrage of dirty puns and phallic objects being stuck into every conceivable hole, strung together in a succession of gags and episodes can be called a film.\"<ref name=\"Review 20\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 27 July 2012\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Super Cassettes Industries T-Series|T-Series]]\n| producer   = [[Ekta Kapoor]]\n| prev_title = '\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Chittagong (film)|Chittagong]]\n| next_year  = 2012\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Sachin-Jigar]]\n | type       = Soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya]]\n | prev_year  = 2012\n | title      = Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum\n | year       = 2012\n | next_title = [[ABCD: Any Body Can Dance]]\n | next_year  = 2013\n}}\n}}\nDil Garden Garden Ho Gaya were composed by [[Sachin - Jigar]] and written by [[Mayur Puri]] while the rest of all songs are by [[Meet Bros Anjjan]].\n\n===Track Listings===\n{{track listing\t \n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| title1 = Dil Garden Garden Ho Gaya\n| extra1 = [[Vishal Dadlani]]\n| music1 = [[Sachin - Jigar]]\n| lyrics1 = [[Mayur Puri]]\n| length1 = 3:18\n| title2 = Shirt Da Button\n| extra2 = [[Sonu Nigam]], [[Meet Bros Anjjan]], Asad Abbas\n| music2 = [[Meet Bros Anjjan]]\n| lyrics2 = [[Kumaar]]\n| length2 = 6:48\n| title3 = Hum Toh Hain Cappucino\n| extra3 = [[Daler Mehndi]], [[Sukhwinder Singh]], [[Riteish Deshmukh]]\n| music3 = [[Meet Bros Anjjan]]\n| lyrics3 =\n| length3 = 5:30\n| title4 = Volume High Karle\n| extra4 = [[Neeraj Shridhar]]\n| music4 = [[Meet Bros Anjjan]]\n| lyrics4 =\n| length4 = 5:30\n| title5 = Shirt Da Button (Version 2)\n| extra5 = [[Kailash Kher]], [[Meet Bros Anjjan]]\n| music5 = [[Meet Bros Anjjan]]\n| lyrics5 =\n| length5 = 6:38\n| title6 = Dil Garden Garden Ho Gaya\n| extra6 = [[Vishal Dadlani]]\n| music6 = [[Sachin - Jigar]] \n| lyrics6 = [[Mayur Puri]]\n| note6 = Remix\n| length6 = 3:42\n| title7 = Volume High Karle\n| extra7 = [[Neeraj Shridhar]]\n| music7 =  [[Meet Bros Anjjan]]\n| lyrics7 =\n| note7 = Remix\n| length7 = 3:42\n}}\n\n==Box office==\n\n===Domestic===\n\n''Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum'' opened very well at multiplexes with collections around the 60-70% mark.

He says, \"This one is for the masses, for youngsters, for those who loved part one and enjoyed its crazy hilarity.\" He concludes \"''KYAA SUPER KOOL HAIN HUM'' offers entertainment, entertainment and only entertainment in large doses!\"<ref name=\"Review 1\"/> Sonia Chopra of Sify gave the movie 3/5 stars, concluding that \"Director Sachin Yardi tells the story in his usual, unapologetic style. One would call the film clumsy, had it not been funny. But humorous it is, even if in parts. Worth a watch, if you're not very high-brow or prudish when it comes to humour.\"<ref name=\"Review 2\" /> Martin D'Souza of Glamsham gave 3/5 stars, commenting that \"Ceetis and taalis are bound to accompany a few scenes and the first three days will tell if it has crossed the Rs 100-crore mark, which I'm afraid it might.\"<ref name=\"Review 3\" /> Madhureeta Mukherjee of ''Times of India'' gave the movie 3/5 stars, stating that \"If you were sex (comedy) starved after Kyaa Kool Hai Hum, this sequel force-feeds you a double dose. This one's for teens who get a 'boner' out of bad jokes, but it may get a rise out of some adults too. Watch at your own 'risque'.\"<ref name=\"Review 4\"/>\n\nMansha Rastogi of Now Running gave the movie 2.5/5 stars, saying that \"To sum it up, Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum makes for a time pass one time watch. However, if for a better second half, the film would've worked more!\"<ref name=\"Review 5\" /> Roshni Devi of Koimoi gave 2.5/5 stars, concluding that \"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum has some laughs, which may be enough for the producers to laugh their way to the bank.\"<ref name=\"Review 6\" /> Vinayak Chakravorthy of India Today gave the movie 2.5/5 stars, stating that \"Director Sachin Yardi almost deliberately plays dumb with his narrative. His effort is a randy, satirical punch on almost every trick that defines Bollywood's 100-crore club. The film makes you snigger, and then you snigger at yourself for doing as much at something so obviously silly and raunchy. You realise there is reason behind the mindless mayhem that just unfolded before your eyes as the end credits roll. It's called box-office moolah, and this film is going to make lots of it.\"<ref name=\"Review 7\" /> Kunal Guha of Yahoo! gave the movie 2/5 stars, commenting that \"'Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum' is surely a school of sickeningly dirty jokes that will shock, disgust and scandalize but ensure that you have a good time. So don't leave your brains (or any other organs) at home, you will need it to dig out the implied meaning in every line.\"<ref name=\"Review 8\" /> Aniruddha Guha of DNA India gave the movie 2/5 stars, saying that \"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum amuses you intermittently but largely leaves your brains in a tangle, and the mind gasping for breath. In other words, dimaag ki macho deta hai.\"<ref name=\"Review 9\" /> Deboshree Ghosh of Bollywood Life gave the movie 2/5 stars, concluding that \"We would have had thought of giving this film a thumbs-up if Tusshar Kapoor had not shown off his rear in the film, supposedly imitating John Abraham in Dostana. That simply made us pucker our lips and turn our noses up in extreme distaste. Ew!\"<ref name=\"Review 10\" /> Shomini Sen of Zee News gave the movie 2/5 stars, stating that \"KSKHH is an assault to your brain to say the least. But we know you will watch it nevertheless. After all don't we go to the movies to get entertained and not take on more stress? Go on, watch it but do carry a bottle of painkillers with you. Might come in handy later.\"<ref name=\"Review 11\" />\n\nAnupama Chopra of ''Hindustan Times'' gave 1.5/5 stars, commenting that \"Writer-director Sachin Yardi is too lazy to create a plot, so the film is just a series of gags that allow him to bung in as many puerile sexual innuendos as possible. Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum becomes a drag within the first twenty minutes and then continues for another two hours or so.\"<ref name=\"Review 12\" /> Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 1.5/5 stars, saying that \"I'm going with one-and-a-half out of five for 'Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum'. It's not that the humor's adult that is the issue here, it's that it doesn't make you laugh!\"<ref name=\"Review 13\" /> Mayank Shekhar of Daily Bhaskar gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, stating that \"All the humour is in the lines. The dialogue writer of this film is a decent chutkula writer, suited best for stand-up comedies or hasya kavitas. You know at some point the jokes will dry up. They'll start exhausting you with their only meaning; let alone the double meaning. The film will lose energy too, given there wasn't much of a plot to keep it going for this long.\"<ref name=\"Review 14\" /> Raja Sen of Rediff gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, stating that \"Sachin Yardi's Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum is, an A-rated film that feels the need to shy away from swearwords and put big, forbidding 'Adults' stickers onto even copulating canines. The film wants to be racy, but has television-friendliness forced onto its very being: which explains actors dropping their jaws at the (suggested) mention of genitalia and constantly hiding behind clumsy innuendo.\"<ref name=\"Review 15\" /> Blessy Chettiar of DNA India gave the movie 1/5 stars, commenting that \"Tawdry innuendos, racial slurs, repugnant gibes at the gay community and overall cheap humour define the 'kool' of KSKHH. Sorry boss, we define our own cool, and KSKHH figures nowhere close.\"<ref name=\"Review 16\" /> [[Karan Anshuman]] of Mumbai Mirror gave 1/5 stars, saying that \"There are sex comedies. Then there are bad sex comedies. Then there is just bad. And then finally \u2013 right at the bottom of this pile \u2013 there is KSKHH. It has innuendos so obvious, swearing so uninhibited, and gestures so lewd, that you can only imagine what must be going on in the writers' minds to distill this from their imaginations.\"<ref name=\"Review 17\" /> Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the movie 1/5 stars, concluding that \"Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum strives very hard indeed to be a worthy adult comedy, a poor Indian country cousin of American Pie, but all it manages to be is a juvenile and clunky ride through unending yards of the kind of laboured gags that went out of vogue with Dada Kondke. The film is ostensibly targeted at the teen segment and it might even find some takers there. But it barely passes muster as a sex comedy. It's crude, crass and completely clueless.\"<ref name=\"Review 18\" /> Janhavi Samant of Mid-Day gave the movie 0.5/5 stars, stating that \"The whole film is pretty much avoidable.

As part of the [[NSWRL premiership]]'s gradual expansion into a national competition, a [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]-based club was admitted in 1988. The Knights have competed in every season of rugby league in Australia since.\n\n==1980s==\nA [[Newcastle rugby league team]] had been assembled from players in the [[Newcastle Rugby League]] to compete in various competitions for most of the 20th century. Newcastle had previously been invited to field a team in the NSWRL competition for the 1982 season, but declined, worried it would weaken [[Newcastle Rugby League|the area's local league competition]]. The [[Canberra Raiders]] were admitted to the 1982 competition in their place.\n\nThe Newcastle Knights, along with the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[Gold Coast Chargers#Gold Coast-Tweed Giants|Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]] entered the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSW Rugby League]] competition in 1988 as part of the League's plans for further national expansion. With [[Allan McMahon]] as coach, the team was a success from the start, becoming one of the most popular clubs in its first season.\n\n==1990s==\nBy 1990, the team was strong enough to enter a play-off for fifth spot.\n\nThe club won their first competition, the Nissan Sevens, in 1991 and made the playoffs in 1992, where they were beaten by the [[St. George Dragons]]. The Knights made the semi-finals again in 1995 when the competition became the [[Australian Rugby League]], and won the reserve grade premiership the same year.\n\nThe club stayed loyal to the Australian Rugby League when [[Rupert Murdoch]] started [[Super League war|Super League]] in an attempt to win pay television rights to rugby league\u2014this decision was very popular in the Newcastle and [[Hunter Region]] areas. [[News Limited]] formed the [[Hunter Mariners]] to compete with the Knights in the one and only season of Super League in Australia, but the Mariners failed to win much support in the area.\n\nFrom 1997\u20132003, the Knights made seven finals series in a row. The Knights won the [[1997 Australian Rugby League premiership]], defeating the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] 22\u201316 in the Grand Final, with [[Robbie O'Davis]] winning the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. The match is best remembered for its classic finish - [[Darren Albert]] breaking a 16 all deadlock with his try 7 seconds from full-time. This win was a huge morale boost to the district following the closure of the area's biggest employer, [[BHP]], being announced the same year. Seventy per cent of the winning squad were Newcastle juniors.\n\nThe following season, Knights players [[Robbie O'Davis]], [[Wayne Richards]] and [[Adam MacDougall]] tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs; however, all three maintained they started use after the Knights' 1997 victory. The three were suspended, despite O'Davis' claims the club was not notified his drug was banned until after his positive test, and MacDougall's medical reason for taking the steroids (his usage continued after he completed his suspension, now approved by the NRL). In addition, the Knights terminated Wayne Richards' contract.\n\n[[Image:NewcastleKnights.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Newcastle International Sports Centre]]]]\nIn 1998, the Knights finished equal on competition points with the [[Brisbane Broncos]], but finished second on points differential. In 1999, the Knights were in with a huge chance going into the final rounds only to lose their final two games of the regular season to finish 7th, before being knocked out a week later by Parramatta.\n\n==2000s==\nThe Knights came third in 2000, only to fall one game short of the Grand Final in a heartbreaking loss to the Roosters. However this was followed by a National Rugby League Premiership victory over the [[Parramatta Eels]] in 2001, with Andrew Johns winning the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. Newcastle were handed heavy underdog status, but shocked the Eels with a 24-0 halftime lead, and eventual 30\u201324 win. In 2002, the club finished equal with the [[New Zealand Warriors]] on competition points but, once again, finished second in the minor premiership due to inferior points differential.\n\nAndrew Johns won the [[Dally M Medal]] for best player in the National Rugby League twice in a row in 1998 and 1999, and won an unprecedented third Dally M Medal in 2002. In addition, Joey Johns also won the Provan-Summons Medal (the people's choice award for player of the year) four years in a row from 1998 to 2001\u2014the best performance by any player in the history of the award.\nIn 2004, injuries plagued the club, with [[Andrew Johns]] and Ben Kennedy out for extended periods of time. The club missed the finals, finishing 10th despite strong performances from [[Matthew Gidley]], [[Kurt Gidley]] and NSW [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] captain, [[Danny Buderus]].\n\nFollowing further injuries and a lack of experienced players, the club failed to win a single match in the first half of the 2005 premiership, losing 13 consecutive matches\u2014the worst start to a season by any club since the 1966 [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] team [[imperfect season|lost every game]] in an eighteen-game season. That losing streak finally came to an end with a win away from home over the [[Penrith Panthers]] when they came from 14-0 down at halftime to win 28\u201324. In a tribute to the club's followers, crowds remained high throughout the losing streak, and while the Knights were unable to avoid finishing last, fans were rewarded for their stoicism as the team managed to win eight of their last eleven games, including a six-game winning streak brought to an end in round 26 by the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]].\n\n2006 boded well for the Novocastrians, with the side recruiting Great Britain and Irish winger [[Brian Carney (rugby)|Brian Carney]] and former Raider [[Luke Davico]], as well as re-signing 2005 recruit [[Milton Thaiday]] and managing to retain the many promising young juniors (led by the likes of Brad Tighe, Jarrod Mullen, Reegan Tanner, and Riley Brown) that have come through in the club's worst ever season. Newcastle ultimately finished the season in fourth position, a stunning reversal in form, but were eliminated from the finals after losing 50\u20136 in the semi-final to the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nPrior to the 2006 season kick-off it was announced that the club's longest serving coach, Michael Hagan would depart the club following the 2006 season to begin a three-year contract with the [[Parramatta Eels]]. Ironically, during the week of the 2006 season-opening game against Parramatta, the Knights confirmed Parramatta coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] would take over coaching duties in 2007.\n\n2007 was a year of turmoil for the club both on and off the field. After making a promising start to the season with victories over contenders such as the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] - the club and rugby league world was rocked by the shock retirement of [[Andrew Johns]]. The departure of their captain and most influential player had an obvious effect on the team, and although they managed to stay in touch with the top eight until the last third of the season, their season was irreparably damaged by his absence. In addition to this - the Knights endured the worst injury toll in the 2007 season - fielding thirty seven players in first grade by season's end.\n\nThe club also struggled off-field, with Brian Smith's decision to release players such as [[Clint Newton]], [[Kirk Reynoldson]], and [[Josh Perry]] meeting with displeasure from the Sydney media and some sections of the Newcastle support base. Newton's defection to Melbourne and Reynoldson's threats of legal action over the club refusing to play him in the fifteen games required to trigger his fourth contract year saw the club's reputation dragged through the mud. The [[Daily Telegraph]] campaigned strongly for the sacking of Smith whilst [[Bluetongue brewery|Bluetongue]] owner [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]] also threatened legal action after the releases lead to a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign being cancelled. To cap it all off, Andrew Johns again made the press late in the season after being arrested for ecstasy possession in the United Kingdom and confessing to having been a drug addict for the entirety of his playing career.\n\nBefore the final round of 2007, Tab Sportsbet's Glenn Munsie was reported in The Daily Telegraph saying that the Knights were certainties for the wooden spoon and \"it was pointless taking money on the wooden spoon gong given Newcastle would be firmly planted at the bottom of the ladder by the end of the weekend\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22329871-5001023,00.html |title=TAB hands Knights the spoon &#124; The Daily Telegraph |publisher=News.com.au |author=Christian Nicolussi |date=August 30, 2007<!-- 12:00am -->|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref>\nDespite these pressures, the Knights managed to avoid a second wooden spoon in three years - offloading the dreaded piece of 'silverware' to the [[Penrith Panthers]] with a last round victory over the [[Wests Tigers]].\n\n2008 was a resurgence year for the Knights. They were unlucky to miss out on the finals, going down to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24\u20132 in the final round of the competition, which allowed the [[New Zealand Warriors]] (who easily overcame the [[Parramatta Eels]]) to take 8th place.\n\nThe Knights started the 2009 season convincingly, they were placed 2nd in the ladder at round 10. During the season the Knights equalled their best home winning streak record with 9 wins, equalling the previous 9 wins recorded in 1995. Towards the end of the season coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] announced he was leaving the Knights to join the troubled [[Sydney Roosters]] in 2010 after their horrific season. Over the next few weeks assistant coach [[Rick Stone]] was announced as the new coach of the Knights. The Knights toward the end of the season lost 3 games in a row, which put them in doubt for the finals, which they had looked like making all year. They then had an outstanding comeback to beat eventual grand finalists, [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] up the ladder. They finished the year 7th out of 16 after losing to the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in week one of the finals. The Knights signed front rower [[Evarn Tuimavave]] for 2010. [[Rick Stone]] said he was looking forward to his first off-season in charge. On 16 December 2009 it was announced player [[Danny Wicks]] was involved in a drug bust involving amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy. He was stood down. Eventually Wicks terminated his own contract as he did not want to keep bringing shame the club and sponsors.\n\n==2010s==\nNewcastle signed [[McDonald's]] and [[Coca-Cola]] as major sponsors for the 2010 season.\n\nIn March 2010 [[Chris Houston (rugby league)|Chris Houston]] was served with notice to attend court on charges of supplying [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/knights-chris-houston-to-face-drug-supply-charges-20100301-pd3y.html|title=Knights' Chris Houston to face drug supply charges |last=Proudman|first=Dan|date=1 March 2010|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref> He was stood down indefinitely.\n\nJune 2010 capped of a good period for the Knights after they confirmed the signings of 2009 [[National Youth Competition (rugby league)|Toyota Cup]] Player of the Year [[Beau Henry]] on a 3-year deal, 2009 [[National Youth Competition (rugby league)|Toyota Cup]] Centre of the Year [[Siuatonga Likiliki]] on a 2-year deal and former [[Australian]] international prop [[Antonio Kaufusi]] on a 2-year deal. In the next few days, the Knights also confirmed the signings of current [[Queensland Maroons]] star [[Neville Costigan]] on a 3-year deal and promising, young backrower [[Kyle O'Donnell]] on a 2-year deal.\n\nThe Knights finished 11th in the 2010 season. While the club did not play in the finals, [[Adam Macdougall]] recorded the most tries for the club and [[Akuila Uate]] equalled the most tries in a season marking an otherwise forgetful year for the Knights.\n\nIn December 2010, former Knight [[Chris Houston (rugby league)|Chris Houston]] was cleared of all drug charges and re-signed with the club for 2 years.\n\nOn 31 March 2011, the Knights were officially taken over by mining magnate [[Nathan Tinkler]] after a member's vote in which Tinkler won by 97%.\n\nOn 12 April 2011, the Knights confirmed the signing of 'supercoach' [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]]. They finished 8th in 2011, being eliminated in the first week of the finals. After the 2011 season, the Knights cleaned out 15 players, as well as signing 9, including club legends [[Danny Buderus]] and [[Timana Tahu]], Kangaroos winger [[Darius Boyd]] and Kangaroos forward [[Kade Snowden]].\n\nThe Knights celebrated 25 years in the NRL competition in 2012. However, the season was a forgettable one. Captain Kurt Gidley succumbed to a shoulder injury early in the season which resulted in him missing the remainder of the year. The team failed to click and won only 10 of their 24 games to finish 12th. During the year, the club signed [[Willie Mason]] and [[Dane Gagai]] and both proved to be rare highlights in a poor season.\n\nIn 2013 the Knights in Round 1 started off with a strong win against the Tigers and then slacking off against the Sea Eagles in Round 2.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/jarrod-mullen-admits-newcastle-knights-took-it-easy-against-manly-sea-eagles/story-e6frexnr-1226602813533|title=Jarrod Mullen admits Newcastle Knights took it easy against Manly Sea Eagles |last=Toohey|first=Barry|date=22 March 2013|work=dailytelegraph.com.au|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> Despite that they were consistent all year and finished 7th on the ladder, qualifying for the finals. The Knights then eliminated Canterbury-Bankstown before upsetting the [[Melbourne Storm]] by 2 points in Melbourne, but bowing out against the Sydney Roosters one game short of the grand final.\n\nNewcastle weren't able to replicate their good 2013 season in 2014 and remained constantly in the bottom four before finishing 12th. During the season Wayne Bennett announced that he would leave the club at the end of the 2014 season to eventually coach the Brisbane Broncos from 2015 onwards.\n\n== Miscellaneous History ==\n===Knights Team Of The Era===\nIn August 2007 the Knights announced their team of 20 years.

As part of the [[NSWRL premiership]]'s gradual expansion into a national competition, a [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]-based club was admitted in 1988. The Knights have competed in every season of rugby league in Australia since.\n\n==1980s==\nA [[Newcastle rugby league team]] had been assembled from players in the [[Newcastle Rugby League]] to compete in various competitions for most of the 20th century. Newcastle had previously been invited to field a team in the NSWRL competition for the 1982 season, but declined, worried it would weaken [[Newcastle Rugby League|the area's local league competition]]. The [[Canberra Raiders]] were admitted to the 1982 competition in their place.\n\nThe Newcastle Knights, along with the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[Gold Coast Chargers#Gold Coast-Tweed Giants|Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]] entered the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSW Rugby League]] competition in 1988 as part of the League's plans for further national expansion. With [[Allan McMahon]] as coach, the team was a success from the start, becoming one of the most popular clubs in its first season.\n\n==1990s==\nBy 1990, the team was strong enough to enter a play-off for fifth spot.\n\nThe club won their first competition, the Nissan Sevens, in 1991 and made the playoffs in 1992, where they were beaten by the [[St. George Dragons]]. The Knights made the semi-finals again in 1995 when the competition became the [[Australian Rugby League]], and won the reserve grade premiership the same year.\n\nThe club stayed loyal to the Australian Rugby League when [[Rupert Murdoch]] started [[Super League war|Super League]] in an attempt to win pay television rights to rugby league\u2014this decision was very popular in the Newcastle and [[Hunter Region]] areas. [[News Limited]] formed the [[Hunter Mariners]] to compete with the Knights in the one and only season of Super League in Australia, but the Mariners failed to win much support in the area.\n\nFrom 1997-2003, the Knights made seven finals series in a row. The Knights won the [[1997 Australian Rugby League premiership]], defeating the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] 22-16 in the Grand Final, with [[Robbie O'Davis]] winning the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. The match is best remembered for its classic finish - [[Darren Albert]] breaking a 16 all deadlock with his try 7 seconds from full-time. This win was a huge morale boost to the district following the closure of the area's biggest employer, [[BHP]], being announced the same year. Seventy per cent of the winning squad were Newcastle juniors.\n\nThe following season, Knights players [[Robbie O'Davis]], [[Wayne Richards]] and [[Adam MacDougall]] tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs; however, all three maintained they started use after the Knights' 1997 victory. The three were suspended, despite O'Davis' claims the club was not notified his drug was banned until after his positive test, and MacDougall's medical reason for taking the steroids (his usage continued after he completed his suspension, now approved by the NRL). In addition, the Knights terminated Wayne Richards' contract.\n\n[[Image:NewcastleKnights.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Newcastle International Sports Centre]]]]\nIn 1998, the Knights finished equal on competition points with the [[Brisbane Broncos]], but finished second on points differential. In 1999, the Knights were in with a huge chance going into the final rounds only to lose their final two games of the regular season to finish 7th, before being knocked out a week later by Parramatta.\n\n==2000s==\nThe Knights came third in 2000, only to fall one game short of the Grand Final in a heartbreaking loss to the Roosters. However this was followed by a National Rugby League Premiership victory over the [[Parramatta Eels]] in 2001, with Andrew Johns winning the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. Newcastle were handed heavy underdog status, but shocked the Eels with a 24-0 halftime lead, and eventual 30-24 win. In 2002, the club finished equal with the [[New Zealand Warriors]] on competition points but, once again, finished second in the minor premiership due to inferior points differential.\n\nAndrew Johns won the [[Dally M Medal]] for best player in the National Rugby League twice in a row in 1998 and 1999, and won an unprecedented third Dally M Medal in 2002. In addition, Joey Johns also won the Provan-Summons Medal (the people's choice award for player of the year) four years in a row from 1998 to 2001\u2014the best performance by any player in the history of the award.\nIn 2004, injuries plagued the club, with [[Andrew Johns]] and Ben Kennedy out for extended periods of time. The club missed the finals, finishing 10th despite strong performances from [[Matthew Gidley]], [[Kurt Gidley]] and NSW [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] captain, [[Danny Buderus]].\n\nFollowing further injuries and a lack of experienced players, the club failed to win a single match in the first half of the 2005 premiership, losing 13 consecutive matches\u2014the worst start to a season by any club since the 1966 [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] team [[imperfect season|lost every game]] in an eighteen-game season. That losing streak finally came to an end with a win away from home over the [[Penrith Panthers]] when they came from 14-0 down at halftime to win 28-24. In a tribute to the club's followers, crowds remained high throughout the losing streak, and while the Knights were unable to avoid finishing last, fans were rewarded for their stoicism as the team managed to win eight of their last eleven games, including a six-game winning streak brought to an end in round 26 by the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]].\n\n2006 boded well for the Novocastrians, with the side recruiting Great Britain and Irish winger [[Brian Carney (rugby)|Brian Carney]] and former Raider [[Luke Davico]], as well as re-signing 2005 recruit [[Milton Thaiday]] and managing to retain the many promising young juniors (led by the likes of Brad Tighe, Jarrod Mullen, Reegan Tanner, and Riley Brown) that have come through in the club's worst ever season. Newcastle ultimately finished the season in fourth position, a stunning reversal in form, but were eliminated from the finals after losing 50-6 in the semi-final to the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nPrior to the 2006 season kick-off it was announced that the club's longest serving coach, Michael Hagan would depart the club following the 2006 season to begin a three-year contract with the [[Parramatta Eels]]. Ironically, during the week of the 2006 season-opening game against Parramatta, the Knights confirmed Parramatta coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] would take over coaching duties in 2007.\n\n2007 was a year of turmoil for the club both on and off the field. After making a promising start to the season with victories over contenders such as the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] - the club and rugby league world was rocked by the shock retirement of [[Andrew Johns]]. The departure of their captain and most influential player had an obvious effect on the team, and although they managed to stay in touch with the top eight until the last third of the season, their season was irreparably damaged by his absence. In addition to this - the Knights endured the worst injury toll in the 2007 season - fielding thirty seven players in first grade by season's end.\n\nThe club also struggled off-field, with Brian Smith's decision to release players such as [[Clint Newton]], [[Kirk Reynoldson]], and [[Josh Perry]] meeting with displeasure from the Sydney media and some sections of the Newcastle support base. Newton's defection to Melbourne and Reynoldson's threats of legal action over the club refusing to play him in the fifteen games required to trigger his fourth contract year saw the club's reputation dragged through the mud. The [[Daily Telegraph]] campaigned strongly for the sacking of Smith whilst [[Bluetongue brewery|Bluetongue]] owner [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]] also threatened legal action after the releases lead to a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign being cancelled. To cap it all off, Andrew Johns again made the press late in the season after being arrested for ecstasy possession in the United Kingdom and confessing to having been a drug addict for the entirety of his playing career.\n\nBefore the final round of 2007, Tab Sportsbet's Glenn Munsie was reported in The Daily Telegraph saying that the Knights were certainties for the wooden spoon and \"it was pointless taking money on the wooden spoon gong given Newcastle would be firmly planted at the bottom of the ladder by the end of the weekend\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22329871-5001023,00.html |title=TAB hands Knights the spoon &#124; The Daily Telegraph |publisher=News.com.au |author=Christian Nicolussi |date=August 30, 2007<!-- 12:00am -->|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref>\nDespite these pressures, the Knights managed to avoid a second wooden spoon in three years - offloading the dreaded piece of 'silverware' to the [[Penrith Panthers]] with a last round victory over the [[Wests Tigers]].\n\n2008 was a resurgence year for the Knights. They were unlucky to miss out on the finals, going down to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24-2 in the final round of the competition, which allowed the [[New Zealand Warriors]] (who easily overcame the [[Parramatta Eels]]) to take 8th place.\n\nThe Knights started the 2009 season convincingly, they were placed 2nd in the ladder at round 10. During the season the Knights equalled their best home winning streak record with 9 wins, equalling the previous 9 wins recorded in 1995. Towards the end of the season coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] announced he was leaving the Knights to join the troubled [[Sydney Roosters]] in 2010 after their horrific season. Over the next few weeks assistant coach [[Rick Stone]] was announced as the new coach of the Knights. The Knights toward the end of the season lost 3 games in a row, which put them in doubt for the finals, which they had looked like making all year. They then had an outstanding comeback to beat eventual grand finalists, [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] up the ladder. They finished the year 7th out of 16 after losing to the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in week one of the finals. The Knights signed front rower [[Evarn Tuimavave]] for 2010. [[Rick Stone]] said he was looking forward to his first off-season in charge. On 16 December 2009 it was announced player [[Danny Wicks]] was involved in a drug bust involving amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy. He was stood down. Eventually Wicks terminated his own contract as he did not want to keep bringing shame the club and sponsors.\n\n==2010s==\nNewcastle signed [[McDonald's]] and [[Coca-Cola]] as major sponsors for the 2010 season.\n\nIn March 2010 [[Chris Houston (rugby league)|Chris Houston]] was served with notice to attend court on charges of supplying [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/knights-chris-houston-to-face-drug-supply-charges-20100301-pd3y.html|title=Knights' Chris Houston to face drug supply charges |last=Proudman|first=Dan|date=1 March 2010|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref> He was stood down indefinitely.\n\nJune 2010 capped of a good period for the Knights after they confirmed the signings of 2009 [[National Youth Competition (rugby league)|Toyota Cup]] Player of the Year [[Beau Henry]] on a 3-year deal, 2009 [[National Youth Competition (rugby league)|Toyota Cup]] Centre of the Year [[Siuatonga Likiliki]] on a 2-year deal and former [[Australian]] international prop [[Antonio Kaufusi]] on a 2-year deal. In the next few days, the Knights also confirmed the signings of current [[Queensland Maroons]] star [[Neville Costigan]] on a 3-year deal and promising, young backrower [[Kyle O'Donnell]] on a 2-year deal.\n\nThe Knights finished 11th in the 2010 season. While the club did not play in the finals, [[Adam Macdougall]] recorded the most tries for the club and [[Akuila Uate]] equalled the most tries in a season marking an otherwise forgetful year for the Knights.\n\nIn December 2010, former Knight [[Chris Houston (rugby league)|Chris Houston]] was cleared of all drug charges and re-signed with the club for 2 years.\n\nOn 31 March 2011, the Knights were officially taken over by mining magnate [[Nathan Tinkler]] after a member's vote in which Tinkler won by 97%.\n\nOn 12 April 2011, the Knights confirmed the signing of 'supercoach' [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]]. They finished 8th in 2011, being eliminated in the first week of the finals. After the 2011 season, the Knights cleaned out 15 players, as well as signing 9, including club legends [[Danny Buderus]] and [[Timana Tahu]], Kangaroos winger [[Darius Boyd]] and Kangaroos forward [[Kade Snowden]].\n\nThe Knights celebrated 25 years in the NRL competition in 2012. However, the season was a forgettable one. Captain Kurt Gidley succumbed to a shoulder injury early in the season which resulted in him missing the remainder of the year. The team failed to click and won only 10 of their 24 games to finish 12th. During the year, the club signed [[Willie Mason]] and [[Dane Gagai]] and both proved to be rare highlights in a poor season.\n\nIn 2013 the Knights in Round 1 started off with a strong win against the Tigers and then slacking off against the Sea Eagles in Round 2.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/jarrod-mullen-admits-newcastle-knights-took-it-easy-against-manly-sea-eagles/story-e6frexnr-1226602813533|title=Jarrod Mullen admits Newcastle Knights took it easy against Manly Sea Eagles |last=Toohey|first=Barry|date=22 March 2013|work=dailytelegraph.com.au|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> Despite that they were consistent all year and finished 7th on the ladder, qualifying for the finals. The Knights then eliminated Canterbury-Bankstown before upsetting the [[Melbourne Storm]] by 2 points in Melbourne, but bowing out against the Sydney Roosters one game short of the grand final.\n\nNewcastle weren't able to replicate their good 2013 season in 2014 and remained constantly in the bottom four before finishing 12th. During the season Wayne Bennett announced that he would leave the club at the end of the 2014 season to eventually coach the Brisbane Broncos from 2015 onwards.\n\n== Miscellaneous History ==\n===Knights Team Of The Era===\nIn August 2007 the Knights announced their team of 20 years.

{"title_page": "History of the New York Rangers", "text_new": "The '''history of the New York Rangers''' hockey team began in 1926 when the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) granted a franchise to [[Tex Rickard]], the founder of the team. The [[New York Rangers]] experienced early success, winning the [[Stanley Cup]] in only their second season of existence, and would go on to win two more in the next 12 years.\n\nAfter their Stanley Cup win in 1940, the Rangers then suffered through one of the longest championship droughts in NHL history, which became known as the [[Curse of 1940]]. The 54-year drought ended with a Stanley Cup win in 1994 by a team led by captain [[Mark Messier]], [[Brian Leetch]], [[Adam Graves]] and [[Mike Richter]], all of whose numbers have since been retired by the team.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Early years and the Original Six era (1926\u20131967)==\nIn [[1925\u201326 NHL season|1925]], the [[New York Americans]] joined the NHL, playing in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. The \"Amerks\" proved to be a greater success than expected, leading Garden president [[Tex Rickard]] to seek his own franchise for the Garden, despite promising the Amerks they would be the only hockey team to play there.\n[[File:Tex Rickard.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Tex Rickard]], president of [[Madison Square Garden]], was awarded the Rangers in 1926.]]\n[[Tex Rickard]] was granted a franchise, which he originally planned to name the \"New York Giants\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} By the time the franchise was granted in April 1926, the name \"New York Rangers Professional Hockey Club\" was the official name.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Charles |title=Trail of the Stanley Cup, vol. 1 |year=1966}}</ref> The origin of the name Rangers, as in \"Tex's Rangers\", is variously attributed to Rickard himself or the New York press.<ref>{{cite news |work=Daily Globe |date=December 31, 1935 |location=Ironwood, Michigan}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |last=Woolf |first=Craig |date=June 12, 1994}}</ref> Rickard managed to get future legendary [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner [[Conn Smythe]] to assemble the team.\n\nAt the time, there was no [[expansion draft]] in the NHL to help new teams ice competitive rosters, which in any other year would have made assembling a playoff contender extremely difficult. However, 1926 also happened to be the year the NHL's last major rival of its early era (the [[Western Canada Hockey League|Western Hockey League]]) went out of business, so there was an abundance of top-caliber hockey talent searching for new clubs. The owners of the Rangers' expansion cousins (the [[Detroit Cougars (NHL)|Detroit Cougars]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]) opted to purchase entire WHL rosters (the [[Victoria Cougars]] and [[Portland Rosebuds (ice hockey)|Portland Rosebuds]] respectively) to stock their teams. Smythe eschewed this approach, opting instead to sign who he felt were the best players from the remaining four WHL teams as well as a few NHL castaways he felt the other teams had misjudged.\n\nSmythe had a falling-out with Rickard's hockey man, [[John S. Hammond|Col. John S. Hammond]], and was fired as manager-head coach on the eve of the first season; he was paid a then-hefty $10,000 to leave.<ref>Smythe and Young, pp. 84-85</ref> Smythe was replaced by [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] co-founder [[Lester Patrick]], who kept all of the players Smythe had assembled. Smythe's approach to building the team paid quick dividends, as Rangers turned out to be a winner. The Rangers won the American Division title their first year, but lost to the [[Boston Bruins]] in the playoffs. The team's early success led to players becoming minor celebrities and fixtures in New York City's \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\" nightlife. It was also during this time, playing at the Garden on 48th Street, blocks away from [[Times Square]], the Rangers obtained their now-famous nickname \"The Broadway Blueshirts\".\n\nIn only their [[1927\u201328 NHL season|second season]], the Rangers won the Stanley Cup, defeating the [[Montreal Maroons]] three games to two. One of the most memorable stories that emerged from the Finals involved Patrick playing in goal at age 44. At the time, teams were not required to dress a backup [[goaltender]], so when the Rangers' starting goaltender [[Lorne Chabot]] left a game with an [[eye injury]], Maroons head coach [[Eddie Gerard]] vetoed his original choice for a replacement (who was [[Alex Connell]], another NHL goaltender of the old [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] who was in attendance for the game). An angry Patrick lined up between the pipes for two periods in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals, allowing one goal to Maroons center [[Nels Stewart]]. [[Frank Boucher]] would score the game-winning goal in overtime for New York. An [[expansion team]] would not come this far this fast in North American [[professional sports]] until the [[Philadelphia Atoms]] won the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] title in their first year of existence.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:The Bread Line.jpg|thumb|The Bread Line was the Rangers' first notable [[Line (ice hockey)|line]]. Consisting of [[Bill Cook]], [[Bun Cook]] and [[Frank Boucher]], they played together from 1926 to 1937.]]\nAfter a loss to the Boston Bruins in the [[1928\u201329 NHL season|1928\u201329]] finals and a few mediocre seasons in the early 1930s, the Rangers, led by brothers [[Bill Cook|Bill]] and [[Bun Cook]] on the right and left wings, respectively, and Frank Boucher at center, would defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the [[1932\u201333 NHL season|1932\u201333]] best-of-five finals, three games to one, to win their second Stanley Cup, exacting revenge on the Leafs' \"Kid line\" of [[Busher Jackson]], [[Joe Primeau]] and [[Charlie Conacher]]. The Rangers would spend the rest of the 1930s playing close to .500 hockey until their next Stanley Cup win. Lester Patrick stepped down as head coach and was replaced by Frank Boucher.\n\nIn [[1939\u201340 NHL season|1939\u201340]], the Rangers finished the regular season in second place behind the Boston Bruins. The two teams would meet in the first round of the playoffs. The Bruins gained a two-games-to-one series lead from the Rangers until they recovered to win three straight games, defeating the first-place Bruins four games to two. The Rangers' first-round victory gave them a bye until the finals. The [[Detroit Red Wings]] disposed of the [[New York Americans]] in their first round best-of-three series two games to one (even as the Americans had analytical and notorious ex-Bruins star [[Eddie Shore]]) and the Toronto Maple Leafs ousted the Chicago Black Hawks two games to none. The Maple Leafs and Red Wings would play a best-of-three series to determine who would go on to play the Rangers in the Cup Finals. The Maple Leafs swept the Red Wings and the Finals match-up was determined. The [[1940 Stanley Cup Finals]] started in Madison Square Garden in New York. The first two games went to the Rangers. In Game 1, the Rangers needed overtime to gain a 1\u20130 series lead, but they won Game 2 more easily with a 6\u20132 victory. The series then headed to Toronto where the Maple Leafs won the next two games, tying the series 2\u20132. In Games 5 and 6, the Rangers won in overtime, taking the series four games to two to earn their third Stanley Cup.\n\n===Original Six era (1942\u20131967)===\n[[File:There's no action like hockey action by Louis Jaques.jpg|thumb|A game between the Rangers and the [[Montreal Canadiens]], 1962.]]\nThe Rangers would collapse by the mid-1940s, losing games by as much as 15\u20130 and having one goaltender with a 6.20 [[goals against average]]. They would miss the playoffs for five consecutive seasons before squeaking into the fourth and final playoff spot in [[1947\u201348 NHL season|1948]]. They lost in the first round and would miss the playoffs again in [[1948\u201349 NHL season|1949]]. In the [[1950 Stanley Cup Finals|1950 finals]], the Rangers were forced to play all of their games on the road (home games in Toronto) while the circus was at the Garden. They would end up losing to the Detroit Red Wings in overtime in the seventh game of the finals, despite a stellar first-round performance as underdogs to the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nDuring this time, Red Wings owner [[James E. Norris]] became the largest stockholder in the Garden.  However, he did not buy [[controlling interest]] in the arena, which would have violated the NHL's rule against one person owning more than one team. Nonetheless, he had enough support on the board of directors to exercise ''de facto'' control.\n\n==Expansion era (1967\u20131993)==\nThe Rangers missed the playoffs in 12 of the next 16 seasons. However, the team was rejuvenated in the late 1960s, symbolized by moving into a newly-rebuilt [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1968. A year earlier, they had made the playoffs for the first time in five years on the strength of rookie goaltender [[Eddie Giacomin]] and acquired 1950s Montreal Canadiens star right wing [[Bernie Geoffrion|Bernie \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion]].\n\nThe Rangers made the Finals twice in the 1970s, but lost both times to two 1970s powerhouses; in six games to the Boston Bruins in [[1972 Stanley Cup Finals|1972]], who were led by such stars as [[Bobby Orr]], [[Phil Esposito]], [[Ken Hodge]], [[Johnny Bucyk]] and [[Wayne Cashman]]; and in five games to the Canadiens in [[1979 Stanley Cup Finals|1979]], who had [[Bob Gainey]], [[Guy Lafleur]], [[Larry Robinson]], [[Ken Dryden]], [[Guy Lapointe]] and [[Serge Savard]]. This time the Rangers had Esposito, but it didn't matter, as the Canadiens were dominant.\n[[File:Jean Ratelle 1972.JPG|upright|left|thumb|[[Jean Ratelle]] played with the Rangers from 1960 to 1975, helping the Rangers reach the playoffs during the [[History of the National Hockey League (1967\u20131992)|expansion era]].]]\nBy [[1971\u201372 NHL season|1972]], the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals despite losing high-scoring center [[Jean Ratelle]] (who had been on pace over Bruin Phil Esposito to become the first Ranger since [[Bryan Hextall]] in 1942 to lead the NHL in scoring) to injury during the stretch drive of the regular season. The strength of players like [[Brad Park]], Ratelle, [[Vic Hadfield]] and [[Rod Gilbert]] (the last three constructing the famed \"[[GAG line]]\", meaning \"goal-a-game\") would still carry them through the playoffs. They would defeat the defending-champion Canadiens in the first round and the Chicago Blackhawks in the second, but lost to the Bruins in the finals.\n\nThe Rangers played a legendary semi-final series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1973\u201374]] playoffs. This series was noted for a Game 7 fight between [[Dale Rolfe]] of the Rangers and [[Dave Schultz (ice hockey)|Dave Schultz]] of the Flyers. Schultz pummeled Rolfe without anyone on the Rangers lifting a finger to protect him (the GAG line was on the ice at the time). This led to the belief the Rangers of that period were soft, especially when taking into account the bullying endured by the Rangers during the 1972 finals. One example is Gilbert's beating at the hands of [[Derek Sanderson]] of the Bruins.\n\nTheir new rivals, the [[New York Islanders]], who entered the NHL in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972]] after paying a huge territorial fee \u2014 some $4 million \u2014 to the Rangers, were their first-round opponent in [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1975]]. After splitting the first two games, the Islanders defeated the more-established Rangers 11 seconds into overtime of the deciding Game 3, establishing a rivalry that continued to grow for years.\n\nAfter some off years in the mid-to-late 1970s, they picked up Esposito and [[Carol Vadnais]] from the Bruins for Park, Ratelle, and [[Joe Zanussi]] in [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975]]. Swedish stars [[Anders Hedberg]] and [[Ulf Nilsson (ice hockey)|Ulf Nilsson]] jumped to the Rangers from the maverick [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA). In [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1979]], they defeated the surging Islanders in the semi-finals and would return to the finals again before bowing out to the Canadiens. However, the Islanders got their revenge, eliminating the Rangers in four consecutive playoff series starting in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1981]] ''en route'' to their second of four consecutive Stanley Cup titles.\n[[File:Marcel Dionne 1987 (2).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Marcel Dionne]] with the Rangers, 1987. He signed with the Rangers in the 1986 off-season.]]\nThe Rangers stayed competitive through the 1980s and early 1990s, making the playoffs each year save for one, but never going very far. An exception was [[1985\u201386 NHL season|1985\u201386]], when the Rangers, behind rookie goaltender [[John Vanbiesbrouck]], upended the [[Patrick Division]]-winning Flyers in five games followed by a six-game win over the [[Washington Capitals]] in the Patrick Division Finals. Montreal disposed of the Rangers in the [[Wales Conference]] Finals behind a rookie goaltender of their own, [[Patrick Roy]]. The Rangers then acquired superstar center [[Marcel Dionne]] after almost 12 years as a [[Los Angeles Kings|Los Angeles King]] [[1986\u201387 NHL season|the next year]]. In 1988, Dionne moved into third place in career goals scored (since bettered by [[Brett Hull]]). But Dionne's always-churning legs started to slow the next year, thereby ensuring that his goals came further and further apart. \"Because you love the game so much, you think it will never end,\" said Dionne, who spent nine games in the minors before retiring in 1989. He would only play 49 playoff games in 17 seasons with the Rangers, Kings and Detroit Red Wings.\n\nThe many playoff failures convinced Rangers fans that this was a manifestation of the [[Curse of 1940]], which is said to either have begun when the Rangers management burnt the mortgage to Madison Square Garden in the bowl of the Stanley Cup after the 1940 victory or by [[Red Dutton]] following the collapse of the New York Americans franchise. In the early 1980s, Islander fans began chanting \"1940! 1940!\" to taunt the Rangers. Fans in other cities soon picked up the chant.\n\nFrustration was at its peak when the [[1991\u201392 NHL season|1991\u201392]] squad captured the [[Presidents' Trophy]]. They took a 2\u20131 series lead on the defending champion [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and then faltered in three straight (most observers note a [[Ron Francis]] slapshot from the blue line that eluded Mike Richter as the series' turning point). The following year, injuries and a 1\u201311 finish landed the Rangers in the cellar of the Patrick Division after being in a playoff position for much of the season. Head coach [[Roger Neilson]] did not finish the season. The off-season hiring of controversial head coach [[Mike Keenan]] was criticized by many who pointed out Keenan's 0\u20133 record in the finals.\n\nDuring this period, the Rangers were owned by [[Gulf+Western]], which was renamed to [[Gulf+Western#Paramount Communications Inc.|Paramount Communications]] in 1989, and sold to [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] in 1994. Viacom then sold the team to [[ITT Corporation]] and [[Cablevision]], and several years later, ITT sold their ownership stake to Cablevision, who still owns the team today\n\n==Modern era (1993\u2013present)==\n===Stanley Cup: the ending of the curse 1993\u20131994===\nThe [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]] was a successful one for Rangers fans, as Mike Keenan led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup championship in 54 years.<ref name=\"Rangers Cup\">{{Cite news|last=Vecsey|first=George|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-houston-finally-has-an-edge.html|title=Sports of The Times; Houston Finally Has an Edge|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=June 24, 1994|accessdate=2008-06-17|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref> Two years prior, they acquired center [[Mark Messier]], who was a part of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]' Stanley Cup-winning teams. [[Adam Graves]], who also came from the Oilers, joined the Rangers as well. Other ex-Oilers on the Rangers included [[Esa Tikkanen]] and trade deadline acquisitions Oilers captain [[Craig MacTavish]] and [[Glenn Anderson]] from the Toronto Maple Leafs. Graves would set a team record with 52 goals, breaking the old record of 50 held by [[Vic Hadfield]]. This record would later be broken by [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]] on April 8, 2006, against the Boston Bruins.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jagr Scores To Set Record And Sets Up Winning Goal|last=Diamos|first=Jason|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2006|page=8.1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/sports/hockey/09rangers.html?fta=y&pagewanted=print}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers clinched the Presidents' Trophy by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 52\u201324\u20138, setting a franchise record with 112 points. Their winning of the inaugural [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] title was only one of three times that the division title was not won by two of their biggest rivals, the [[Devils\u2013Flyers rivalry|New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia Flyers]].\n\nThe Rangers successfully made it past the first two rounds of the playoffs, sweeping the New York Islanders, who were seeded eighth in the first round, and then breezed by the Washington Capitals, seeded seventh, in five. However, matters got interesting in the Conference Finals against the third-seeded [[New Jersey Devils]]. The Rangers lost the series opener at home in double overtime, but won the next two games before the Devils beat the New York offense and defeated them 3\u20131 and 4\u20131. The series headed back to the [[Meadowlands Arena|Meadowlands]] for the next game, but the day before that sixth game, Rangers captain Mark Messier stepped up and guaranteed a win.

Despite of a strong 8\u20132 start to the season, the Rangers appeared to play inconsistently with numerous losing streaks. By March 2010, the Rangers were in danger of falling out of the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|2010 playoff]] race entirely, but they registered a respectable 7\u20131\u20132 record to finish the season. The final two games of the season were a home-and-home against the Philadelphia Flyers. The first was April 9, 2010, in New York, and the Rangers skated away with the victory, keeping their post-season hopes alive. The final game of the season would become the deciding game to determine who would make the playoffs. The Flyers peppered Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist with 47 shots, but scored only once. The game went to a shootout, and the Flyers prevailed to move on to the playoffs despite the strong overall finish to the season by the Rangers.\n\nFor the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|2010\u201311 season]], the Rangers waived defenseman [[Wade Redden]] and brought in several players to achieve more balanced scoring. They also wore a third jersey for the first time in several years. On November 12, the Rangers unveiled the new Heritage Jersey for the first time at the rink at Rockefeller Center in a special ceremony featuring Rangers alumni and current players discussing the history of the storied franchise. The club wore the jersey for the first time on November 17 when they played the Boston Bruins at Madison Square Garden. The jersey was to be worn every time the Rangers play an [[Original Six]] team, or on a Sunday afternoon game at home. The Rangers' fate of making or missing the playoffs would come down to the final day of the regular season for the second-straight year. The team defeated the New Jersey Devils on the final day of the season to finish with 93 points on the year. However, in order to qualify for the [[2011 Stanley Cup playoffs|2011 playoffs]], they needed the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] to lose their final game of the season, as Carolina owned the tiebreaker as both teams finished with the same number of points. Carolina lost its final game to Tampa Bay, 6\u20132, putting the Rangers in the playoffs after missing-out the previous season. The Rangers then faced Washington in the first round. After blowing a 3\u20130 third period lead in Game 4, with Washington ahead in the best-of-seven series two games to one, the Rangers lost the series in five games. It was the second time in three years that the Capitals eliminated the Rangers from the playoffs.\n[[File:Ryan Callahan 2011.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Ryan Callahan]] was named the captain of the New York Rangers in September 2011.]]\nOn May 13, 2011, [[Derek Boogaard]], a player whom the Rangers signed the previous off-season for four years, was found dead in his [[Minnesota]] apartment.<ref name=\"http://ca.news.yahoo.com/york-rangers-forward-derek-boogaard-dead-28-025813197.html\">{{cite web | url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/york-rangers-forward-derek-boogaard-dead-28-025813197.html | title=New York Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard found dead at 28 | accessdate=May 16, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518044517/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/york-rangers-forward-derek-boogaard-dead-28-025813197.html | archivedate=May 18, 2011 }}</ref> On June 29, 2011, the Rangers bought out captain Chris Drury's contract, and July 2, [[Brad Richards]], an unrestricted free agent who had played with the [[Dallas Stars]] during the prior season, signed a nine-year, $60&nbsp;million contract with the Rangers.<ref name=\"http://nypostonline.com/p/sports/rangers/rangers_sign_richards_for_itM1BhegVldhoWKStLQHWJ\">{{cite news | url=http://nypostonline.com/p/sports/rangers/rangers_sign_richards_for_itM1BhegVldhoWKStLQHWJ | title=Rangers sign Richards to nine-year, $58.5M contract | date=2011-07-02 | first=Larry | last=Brooks | work=New York Post | accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> On September 12, 2011, [[Ryan Callahan]] was named the 26th captain in New York Rangers history.<ref name=NYTCaptainCally>{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Jeff Z.|last2=Belson|first2=Ken|title=Callahan Fills Drury's Role as Captain of Rangers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/sports/hockey/ryan-callahan-is-named-rangers-26th-captain.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=12 September 2011}}</ref> He became the fifth-youngest captain in team history.<ref name=BRCapCally>{{cite web|last1=Urtz Jr.|first1=Tom|title=New York Rangers: Where Could Ryan Callahan Rank in Lineage of Ranger Captains?|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/858722-ny-rangers-where-could-ryan-callahan-rank-amongst-the-teams-25-captains|publisher=Bleacher Report|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=20 September 2011}}</ref> Brad Richards and [[Marc Staal]] were named alternate captains on the same day.\n\nIn the [[2011\u201312 NHL season|2011\u201312 season]], the Rangers finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Going 51\u201324\u20137, the team finished with 109 points for the regular season. Their leading scorer for the regular season was Marian Gaborik, who finished the season with 41 goals and 76 points while playing all 82 games. However, the Rangers missed-out on the Presidents' Trophy on the final day of the season to the Vancouver Canucks after a 4\u20131 loss to Washington. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rangers faced the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. After falling behind 3\u20132 in the series, the Rangers bounced back to win Game 6 in [[Ottawa]], as well as the deciding Game 7 at home, propelling them to the Conference Semi-finals. In the Semi-finals, the Rangers faced the Capitals. In Game 3, Gaborik received a pass from Brad Richards to seal a victory 14:41 into the third overtime, giving the Rangers a 2\u20131 lead in the series. Washington then came back to tie the series 2\u20132 in Game 4. The Rangers avoided going down 3\u20132 in the series when Richards tied Game 5 at 2\u20132 with just 6.6 seconds left in the third period. The goal was scored on a power-play as a result of a high-sticking double-minor committed by Washington's [[Joel Ward (ice hockey)|Joel Ward]] on Rangers' forward [[Carl Hagelin]]. Then, in overtime, Rangers defenseman Marc Staal scored on the second penalty of the double-minor just 1:35 into overtime, giving the Rangers a 3\u20132 series lead. The Rangers went on to win the series 4\u20133, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1997. In the Conference Finals, they faced the New Jersey Devils, a major divisional rival. After leading the series 2\u20131, the Rangers lost three games in a row, losing Game 6 in New Jersey with a goal by Devils forward [[Adam Henrique]] at 1:03 in overtime, giving the Devils a 4\u20132 series win and ending the Rangers' season.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, the Rangers traded [[Brandon Dubinsky]], [[Artem Anisimov]], [[Tim Erixon]] and a [[2013 NHL Entry Draft|2013 first-round draft pick]] to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in exchange for [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star]] [[Rick Nash]], [[Steven Delisle]] and a 2013 conditional third-round pick.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nash traded to Rangers in five-player deal |first=Dave |last=Lozo |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=638429|publisher=NHL.com |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2015 }}</ref> At the 2013 [[NHL trade deadline]] on April 3, the Rangers then traded Marian Gaborik, Steven Delisle and [[Blake Parlett]] to Columbus in exchange for [[Derick Brassard]], [[Derek Dorsett]], [[John Moore (ice hockey)|John Moore]] and a [[2014 NHL Entry Draft|2014]] sixth-round draft pick.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rangers trade Marian Gaborik |first=Katie |last=Strang |url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/9130225/marian-gaborik-traded-new-york-rangers-columbus-blue-jackets |publisher=ESPNNewYork.com |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2015 }}</ref> After the Rangers were eliminated from the second round of the playoffs by Boston, management fired head coach [[John Tortorella]], and on June 21, 2013, GM Glen Sather formally introduced ex-Canucks head coach [[Alain Vigneault]] as Tortorella's replacement, becoming the 35th head coach in franchise history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rangers hire new coach Vigneault with 5-year deal |first=Ira |last=Podell |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports-content/hockey/nhl/article/20130622033103718540808/ |agency=Associated Press |publisher=CBC.com |date=June 22, 2013 |accessdate=June 9, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====Return to the Final (2013\u20132014)====\n[[File:Martin St Louis 140328.png|thumb|upright|[[Martin St. Louis]] with the Rangers, several weeks after being acquired from the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], March 2014.]]\nOn March 5, 2014, the Rangers traded captain Ryan Callahan, a first-round draft pick in [[2015 NHL Entry Draft|2015]], a conditional second-round pick in 2014 (which later became a first-round pick) and a conditional seventh-round pick in 2015 in exchange for Tampa Bay captain [[Martin St. Louis]] and a conditional second-round pick in 2015. The trade occurred in large part after the Rangers and Callahan were unable to reach a contract extension in the days leading up to the deadline. During the regular season, the Rangers won 25 road games, setting a then-franchise record. In the first round of the [[2014 Stanley Cup playoffs|2014 playoffs]], New York defeated Philadelphia in seven games, and in the next round, the Rangers rallied from a 3\u20131 series deficit for the first time in their history to defeat Pittsburgh in seven games. They then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games to become the Eastern Conference champions, moving on to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 20 years. In the Finals, they faced the Los Angeles Kings, the Western Conference champions and champions in [[2012 Stanley Cup Finals|2012]]. The Rangers led the first two games by two goals and eventually fell in overtime, and were then shut-out at home 3\u20130 in Game 3.

In the [[2014\u201315 NHL season|2014\u201315 season]], the Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy for the third time in franchise history and their seventh division title by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 53\u201322\u20137. The 53 wins and 113 points both set franchise records. The division title was the Rangers' first in the [[Metropolitan Division]], which was created during the NHL's realignment in the 2013 off-season. The team won 28 road games in the regular season, breaking the franchise record set the previous season. Over the course of the season, the Rangers agreed to terms on a contract extension with goaltender [[Cam Talbot]], Marc Staal and [[Mats Zuccarello]]. In the playoffs, the Rangers dispatched the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the first round. The Rangers then came back from a 3\u20131 series deficit to win their second-round series against the Capitals in seven games, becoming the first team in NHL history to battle back from a 3\u20131 deficit in back-to-back seasons and sending the Rangers to the Eastern Conference Final for the third time in four years. However, after winning the first game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Rangers lost Game 2 by four goals. The two teams split the first four games of the series, but the Rangers lost Game 5 2\u20130 at home, which gave the Lightning an opportunity to clinch the Conference Finals in Tampa Bay.

The nickname came from the original color of those seats before the first Garden renovation in the early 1990s. In the 1970s, \"blue-seaters\" would heckle opposing players, and also heckle the \"red-seaters\", down below.  This led to the perception that the blue seats were also home to a great deal of profanity, or \"blue language.\" The seats in the 400-level at MSG were redone in teal during the 1990 renovation of the Garden, but fans continued to refer to them as \"the blues\". \n\nFollowing the three-year transformation at the Garden that began in 2011, the blue seats now occupy only one end zone of the west side of the arena where the Rangers shoot twice. Because of the new balcony added above, these seats are considered \"limited view\"; they remain the cheapest seats in the building.\n\n==== Dancing Larry ====\nDancing Larry, whose real name was Larry Goodman,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/gay-fans-cite-a-hostile-garden-atmosphere/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=Gay Fans Cite Hostile Garden Atmosphere | date=2008-03-21}}</ref> has been a Rangers season ticket holder since 1988, and his famous dance routine began in the mid-to-late 1990s, when he danced in the aisle between sections 406 and 407. After the most recent MSG renovation, he now dances in the portal between sections 223 and 224. The dance usually occurs during the last TV timeout of the third period to get the crowd and the team pumped up. Larry dances to the song ''[[Strike It Up]]'' by [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]] which is cued up on the Madison Square Garden [[loud speakers]] by the technical staff.\n\n==== The Chief ====\nThe Chief, whose real name was Robert Comas, was a fan of the Rangers who donned an Indian headdress complete with Ranger facepaint from 1971 to 1995. He became an unofficial mascot, \"wandering around Madison Square Garden shaking hands, whooping and doing a war dance.\" Comas retired from his role as The Chief in 1995, one year after the Rangers won the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn 1998, Comas ran for public office as the Republican Party candidate for the State Senate in the 21st District, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Mill Basin and other parts of southern Brooklyn. When he was unable to gather enough signatures to make the ballot, the Republican party had no candidate in the contest. Comas did run on the Conservative line.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/nyregion/neighborhood-report-sheepshead-bay-chief-finds-new-arena-politics.html | work=The New York Times | first=Edward | last=Lewine | title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SHEEPSHEAD BAY; 'Chief' Finds New Arena: Politics | date=1998-10-25}}</ref> He managed to gather 3,255 votes, or 7.64% of the total votes counted, losing to incumbent [[Carl Kruger]], who was convicted on federal bribery charges in 2011.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.ourcampaigns.com/pages/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=90957\n| title      = NY State Senate 21\n| work       = ourcampaigns.com\n| accessdate = 2015-12-27\n}}</ref> Shortly after his bid for the New York State Senate failed, the Chief moved to Florida, where he resided until his death on September 17, 2009. He was 62.\n\n===Music===\n==== Goal song ====\nWhen the Rangers score a goal at Madison Square Garden the \"Slapshot\" (aka \"The New York Rangers [[Goal Song]]\") song is played following three blasts of a NYC Fire Engine horn.  The song made its debut on January 20, 1995, the night the 1994 Stanley Cup Champion Banner was raised to the rafters.  It was written by [[Ray Castoldi]], the Music Director at Madison Square Garden. \n\n==== National anthem singers ====\nJohn Amirante was the long-time national anthem singer at Madison Square Garden. He first performed the national anthem at the Garden ice in October 1980, and has also sung for the Knicks and Yankees. In 2009, when Amirante was 74, he was singing the anthem at about half of the Rangers' home games. On April 18, 2015, after a 35-year run, Amirante sang what was thought to be his last National Anthem before Game 2 in Round 1 of the 2015 playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins.<ref>https://nymag.com/daily/sports/2009/10/john_amirante_on_performing_th.html</ref> The following day, after a negative reaction from fans regarding the decision to forcibly retire Amirante, the Garden announced Amirante would be invited to be a guest anthem singer from time-to-time.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/rangers/rangers-bring-back-john-amirante-sing-national-anthem-article-1.2234104\n| title      = Rangers bring back John Amirante to sing national anthem before Game 5 vs. Lightning\n| work       = NEW YORK DAILY NEWS\n| date       = 2015-05-24\n| accessdate = 2015-07-19\n}}</ref> On April 17 2018, Amirante passed away at the age of 83.\n\n==== Victory song ====\nAfter every home victory the \"New York Rangers Victory Song\" is played. It was written in 1940 by [[J. Fred Coots]] (an avid Rangers fan and [[New York City|New Yorker]]) to pay tribute to the then-Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers. The music for the song can be heard [http://downloads.rangers.nhl.com/audio/RangersVictorySong.mp3 here].\n\n=== Salute the crowd ===\n[[File:Rangerssalute.jpg|thumb|right|Rangers saluting the crowd at [[Madison Square Garden]].]]\nAfter every Rangers home win, the team gathers at center ice and raise their sticks in the air to salute the Rangers supporters. The salute (the idea of defenseman [[Darius Kasparaitis]]) began in the early part of the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]], and has proved extremely popular with both the players and fans alike.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe salute to the fans is typically done only after home victories. However, after the Rangers fell to the rival New Jersey Devils in a four-game sweep in the first round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs]], the fans' cheers at the conclusion of an otherwise outstanding breakout season caused the players to stay on the ice after the loss and give the fans one final salute for the year. The Rangers have saluted the crowd on several occasions since after being eliminated from the playoffs at home.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[National Hockey League rivalries]]\n\n== References ==\n* ''Losing the Edge: The Rise and Fall of the Stanley Cup Champion New York Rangers'' by Barry Meisel (1995) ({{ISBN|0-684-81519-2}})\n* ''New York Rangers: Millennium Memories'' by the [[New York Daily News|NY Daily News]] (2000) ({{ISBN|1-58261-147-5}})\n* ''New York Rangers: Seventy-Five Years'' by John Halligan (2000) ({{ISBN|0-7607-2298-6}})\n* ''The New York Rangers: Broadway's Longest Running Hit'' by John Kreiser and Lou Friedman (1997) ({{ISBN|1-57167-041-6}})\n* ''The New York Rangers (Images of Sports)'' by John Halligan (2003) ({{ISBN|0-7385-1228-1}})\n* ''The Rangers'' by [[Brian McFarlane]] (1997) ({{ISBN|0-7737-6007-5}})\n* ''Thin Ice: A Season in Hell With the New York Rangers'' by Larry Sloman (1981) ({{ISBN|0-440-18571-8}})\n* ''Rangers' Biggest Trades Since 1990'' (October 6, 2006)\n* {{cite book|last=Smythe|first=Conn|last2=Young|first2=Scott|title=Conn Smythe: If you can't beat 'em in the alley |year=1981 |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |location=Toronto, Ontario |isbn=0-7710-9078-1}}\n* {{cite book|last=Morrison|first=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Canada: My Greatest Day|year=2008|publisher=Key Porter Books|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55470-086-8|authorlink=Scott Morrison (journalist)|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mygreatestday50p0000morr}}\n; Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.nypress.com/the-best-kept-sports-secret-in-new-york/  The Best Kept Sports Secret in New York]\n\n{{New York Rangers}}\n{{NHL team history}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The New York Rangers}}\n[[Category:History of the New York Rangers| ]]\n[[Category:National Hockey League history by team|New York Rangers]]\n", "text_old": "The '''history of the New York Rangers''' hockey team began in 1926 when the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) granted a franchise to [[Tex Rickard]], the founder of the team. The [[New York Rangers]] experienced early success, winning the [[Stanley Cup]] in only their second season of existence, and would go on to win two more in the next 12 years.\n\nAfter their Stanley Cup win in 1940, the Rangers then suffered through one of the longest championship droughts in NHL history, which became known as the [[Curse of 1940]]. The 54-year drought ended with a Stanley Cup win in 1994 by a team led by captain [[Mark Messier]], [[Brian Leetch]], [[Adam Graves]] and [[Mike Richter]], all of whose numbers have since been retired by the team.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Early years and the Original Six era (1926\u20131967)==\nIn [[1925\u201326 NHL season|1925]], the [[New York Americans]] joined the NHL, playing in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. The \"Amerks\" proved to be a greater success than expected, leading Garden president [[Tex Rickard]] to seek his own franchise for the Garden, despite promising the Amerks they would be the only hockey team to play there.\n[[File:Tex Rickard.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Tex Rickard]], president of [[Madison Square Garden]], was awarded the Rangers in 1926.]]\n[[Tex Rickard]] was granted a franchise, which he originally planned to name the \"New York Giants\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} By the time the franchise was granted in April 1926, the name \"New York Rangers Professional Hockey Club\" was the official name.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Charles |title=Trail of the Stanley Cup, vol. 1 |year=1966}}</ref> The origin of the name Rangers, as in \"Tex's Rangers\", is variously attributed to Rickard himself or the New York press.<ref>{{cite news |work=Daily Globe |date=December 31, 1935 |location=Ironwood, Michigan}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |last=Woolf |first=Craig |date=June 12, 1994}}</ref> Rickard managed to get future legendary [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner [[Conn Smythe]] to assemble the team.\n\nAt the time, there was no [[expansion draft]] in the NHL to help new teams ice competitive rosters, which in any other year would have made assembling a playoff contender extremely difficult. However, 1926 also happened to be the year the NHL's last major rival of its early era (the [[Western Canada Hockey League|Western Hockey League]]) went out of business, so there was an abundance of top-caliber hockey talent searching for new clubs. The owners of the Rangers' expansion cousins (the [[Detroit Cougars (NHL)|Detroit Cougars]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]) opted to purchase entire WHL rosters (the [[Victoria Cougars]] and [[Portland Rosebuds (ice hockey)|Portland Rosebuds]] respectively) to stock their teams. Smythe eschewed this approach, opting instead to sign who he felt were the best players from the remaining four WHL teams as well as a few NHL castaways he felt the other teams had misjudged.\n\nSmythe had a falling-out with Rickard's hockey man, [[John S. Hammond|Col. John S. Hammond]], and was fired as manager-head coach on the eve of the first season; he was paid a then-hefty $10,000 to leave.<ref>Smythe and Young, pp. 84-85</ref> Smythe was replaced by [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] co-founder [[Lester Patrick]], who kept all of the players Smythe had assembled. Smythe's approach to building the team paid quick dividends, as Rangers turned out to be a winner. The Rangers won the American Division title their first year, but lost to the [[Boston Bruins]] in the playoffs. The team's early success led to players becoming minor celebrities and fixtures in New York City's \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\" nightlife. It was also during this time, playing at the Garden on 48th Street, blocks away from [[Times Square]], the Rangers obtained their now-famous nickname \"The Broadway Blueshirts\".\n\nIn only their [[1927\u201328 NHL season|second season]], the Rangers won the Stanley Cup, defeating the [[Montreal Maroons]] three games to two. One of the most memorable stories that emerged from the Finals involved Patrick playing in goal at age 44. At the time, teams were not required to dress a backup [[goaltender]], so when the Rangers' starting goaltender [[Lorne Chabot]] left a game with an [[eye injury]], Maroons head coach [[Eddie Gerard]] vetoed his original choice for a replacement (who was [[Alex Connell]], another NHL goaltender of the old [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] who was in attendance for the game). An angry Patrick lined up between the pipes for two periods in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals, allowing one goal to Maroons center [[Nels Stewart]]. [[Frank Boucher]] would score the game-winning goal in overtime for New York. An [[expansion team]] would not come this far this fast in North American [[professional sports]] until the [[Philadelphia Atoms]] won the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] title in their first year of existence.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:The Bread Line.jpg|thumb|The Bread Line was the Rangers' first notable [[Line (ice hockey)|line]]. Consisting of [[Bill Cook]], [[Bun Cook]] and [[Frank Boucher]], they played together from 1926 to 1937.]]\nAfter a loss to the Boston Bruins in the [[1928\u201329 NHL season|1928\u201329]] finals and a few mediocre seasons in the early 1930s, the Rangers, led by brothers [[Bill Cook|Bill]] and [[Bun Cook]] on the right and left wings, respectively, and Frank Boucher at center, would defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the [[1932\u201333 NHL season|1932\u201333]] best-of-five finals, three games to one, to win their second Stanley Cup, exacting revenge on the Leafs' \"Kid line\" of [[Busher Jackson]], [[Joe Primeau]] and [[Charlie Conacher]]. The Rangers would spend the rest of the 1930s playing close to .500 hockey until their next Stanley Cup win. Lester Patrick stepped down as head coach and was replaced by Frank Boucher.\n\nIn [[1939\u201340 NHL season|1939\u201340]], the Rangers finished the regular season in second place behind the Boston Bruins. The two teams would meet in the first round of the playoffs. The Bruins gained a two-games-to-one series lead from the Rangers until they recovered to win three straight games, defeating the first-place Bruins four games to two. The Rangers' first-round victory gave them a bye until the finals. The [[Detroit Red Wings]] disposed of the [[New York Americans]] in their first round best-of-three series two games to one (even as the Americans had analytical and notorious ex-Bruins star [[Eddie Shore]]) and the Toronto Maple Leafs ousted the Chicago Black Hawks two games to none. The Maple Leafs and Red Wings would play a best-of-three series to determine who would go on to play the Rangers in the Cup Finals. The Maple Leafs swept the Red Wings and the Finals match-up was determined. The [[1940 Stanley Cup Finals]] started in Madison Square Garden in New York. The first two games went to the Rangers. In Game 1, the Rangers needed overtime to gain a 1\u20130 series lead, but they won Game 2 more easily with a 6\u20132 victory. The series then headed to Toronto where the Maple Leafs won the next two games, tying the series 2\u20132. In Games 5 and 6, the Rangers won in overtime, taking the series four games to two to earn their third Stanley Cup.\n\n===Original Six era (1942\u20131967)===\n[[File:There's no action like hockey action by Louis Jaques.jpg|thumb|A game between the Rangers and the [[Montreal Canadiens]], 1962.]]\nThe Rangers would collapse by the mid-1940s, losing games by as much as 15\u20130 and having one goaltender with a 6.20 [[goals against average]]. They would miss the playoffs for five consecutive seasons before squeaking into the fourth and final playoff spot in [[1947\u201348 NHL season|1948]]. They lost in the first round and would miss the playoffs again in [[1948\u201349 NHL season|1949]]. In the [[1950 Stanley Cup Finals|1950 finals]], the Rangers were forced to play all of their games on the road (home games in Toronto) while the circus was at the Garden. They would end up losing to the Detroit Red Wings in overtime in the seventh game of the finals, despite a stellar first-round performance as underdogs to the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nDuring this time, Red Wings owner [[James E. Norris]] became the largest stockholder in the Garden.  However, he did not buy [[controlling interest]] in the arena, which would have violated the NHL's rule against one person owning more than one team. Nonetheless, he had enough support on the board of directors to exercise ''de facto'' control.\n\n==Expansion era (1967\u20131993)==\nThe Rangers missed the playoffs in 12 of the next 16 seasons. However, the team was rejuvenated in the late 1960s, symbolized by moving into a newly-rebuilt [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1968. A year earlier, they had made the playoffs for the first time in five years on the strength of rookie goaltender [[Eddie Giacomin]] and acquired 1950s Montreal Canadiens star right wing [[Bernie Geoffrion|Bernie \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion]].\n\nThe Rangers made the Finals twice in the 1970s, but lost both times to two 1970s powerhouses; in six games to the Boston Bruins in [[1972 Stanley Cup Finals|1972]], who were led by such stars as [[Bobby Orr]], [[Phil Esposito]], [[Ken Hodge]], [[Johnny Bucyk]] and [[Wayne Cashman]]; and in five games to the Canadiens in [[1979 Stanley Cup Finals|1979]], who had [[Bob Gainey]], [[Guy Lafleur]], [[Larry Robinson]], [[Ken Dryden]], [[Guy Lapointe]] and [[Serge Savard]]. This time the Rangers had Esposito, but it didn't matter, as the Canadiens were dominant.\n[[File:Jean Ratelle 1972.JPG|upright|left|thumb|[[Jean Ratelle]] played with the Rangers from 1960 to 1975, helping the Rangers reach the playoffs during the [[History of the National Hockey League (1967\u20131992)|expansion era]].]]\nBy [[1971\u201372 NHL season|1972]], the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals despite losing high-scoring center [[Jean Ratelle]] (who had been on pace over Bruin Phil Esposito to become the first Ranger since [[Bryan Hextall]] in 1942 to lead the NHL in scoring) to injury during the stretch drive of the regular season. The strength of players like [[Brad Park]], Ratelle, [[Vic Hadfield]] and [[Rod Gilbert]] (the last three constructing the famed \"[[GAG line]]\", meaning \"goal-a-game\") would still carry them through the playoffs. They would defeat the defending-champion Canadiens in the first round and the Chicago Blackhawks in the second, but lost to the Bruins in the finals.\n\nThe Rangers played a legendary semi-final series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1973\u201374]] playoffs. This series was noted for a Game 7 fight between [[Dale Rolfe]] of the Rangers and [[Dave Schultz (ice hockey)|Dave Schultz]] of the Flyers. Schultz pummeled Rolfe without anyone on the Rangers lifting a finger to protect him (the GAG line was on the ice at the time). This led to the belief the Rangers of that period were soft, especially when taking into account the bullying endured by the Rangers during the 1972 finals. One example is Gilbert's beating at the hands of [[Derek Sanderson]] of the Bruins.\n\nTheir new rivals, the [[New York Islanders]], who entered the NHL in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972]] after paying a huge territorial fee \u2014 some $4 million \u2014 to the Rangers, were their first-round opponent in [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1975]]. After splitting the first two games, the Islanders defeated the more-established Rangers 11 seconds into overtime of the deciding Game 3, establishing a rivalry that continued to grow for years.\n\nAfter some off years in the mid-to-late 1970s, they picked up Esposito and [[Carol Vadnais]] from the Bruins for Park, Ratelle, and [[Joe Zanussi]] in [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975]]. Swedish stars [[Anders Hedberg]] and [[Ulf Nilsson (ice hockey)|Ulf Nilsson]] jumped to the Rangers from the maverick [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA). In [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1979]], they defeated the surging Islanders in the semi-finals and would return to the finals again before bowing out to the Canadiens. However, the Islanders got their revenge, eliminating the Rangers in four consecutive playoff series starting in [[1980\u201381 NHL season|1981]] ''en route'' to their second of four consecutive Stanley Cup titles.\n[[File:Marcel Dionne 1987 (2).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Marcel Dionne]] with the Rangers, 1987. He signed with the Rangers in the 1986 off-season.]]\nThe Rangers stayed competitive through the 1980s and early 1990s, making the playoffs each year save for one, but never going very far. An exception was [[1985\u201386 NHL season|1985\u201386]], when the Rangers, behind rookie goaltender [[John Vanbiesbrouck]], upended the [[Patrick Division]]-winning Flyers in five games followed by a six-game win over the [[Washington Capitals]] in the Patrick Division Finals. Montreal disposed of the Rangers in the [[Wales Conference]] Finals behind a rookie goaltender of their own, [[Patrick Roy]]. The Rangers then acquired superstar center [[Marcel Dionne]] after almost 12 years as a [[Los Angeles Kings|Los Angeles King]] [[1986\u201387 NHL season|the next year]]. In 1988, Dionne moved into third place in career goals scored (since bettered by [[Brett Hull]]). But Dionne's always-churning legs started to slow the next year, thereby ensuring that his goals came further and further apart. \"Because you love the game so much, you think it will never end,\" said Dionne, who spent nine games in the minors before retiring in 1989. He would only play 49 playoff games in 17 seasons with the Rangers, Kings and Detroit Red Wings.\n\nThe many playoff failures convinced Rangers fans that this was a manifestation of the [[Curse of 1940]], which is said to either have begun when the Rangers management burnt the mortgage to Madison Square Garden in the bowl of the Stanley Cup after the 1940 victory or by [[Red Dutton]] following the collapse of the New York Americans franchise. In the early 1980s, Islander fans began chanting \"1940! 1940!\" to taunt the Rangers. Fans in other cities soon picked up the chant.\n\nFrustration was at its peak when the [[1991\u201392 NHL season|1991\u201392]] squad captured the [[Presidents' Trophy]]. They took a 2\u20131 series lead on the defending champion [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and then faltered in three straight (most observers note a [[Ron Francis]] slapshot from the blue line that eluded Mike Richter as the series' turning point). The following year, injuries and a 1\u201311 finish landed the Rangers in the cellar of the Patrick Division after being in a playoff position for much of the season. Head coach [[Roger Neilson]] did not finish the season. The off-season hiring of controversial head coach [[Mike Keenan]] was criticized by many who pointed out Keenan's 0\u20133 record in the finals.\n\nDuring this period, the Rangers were owned by [[Gulf+Western]], which was renamed to [[Gulf+Western#Paramount Communications Inc.|Paramount Communications]] in 1989, and sold to [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] in 1994. Viacom then sold the team to [[ITT Corporation]] and [[Cablevision]], and several years later, ITT sold their ownership stake to Cablevision, who still owns the team today\n\n==Modern era (1993\u2013present)==\n===Stanley Cup: the ending of the curse 1993\u20131994===\nThe [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]] was a successful one for Rangers fans, as Mike Keenan led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup championship in 54 years.<ref name=\"Rangers Cup\">{{Cite news|last=Vecsey|first=George|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-houston-finally-has-an-edge.html|title=Sports of The Times; Houston Finally Has an Edge|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=June 24, 1994|accessdate=2008-06-17|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref> Two years prior, they acquired center [[Mark Messier]], who was a part of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]' Stanley Cup-winning teams. [[Adam Graves]], who also came from the Oilers, joined the Rangers as well.

Graves would set a team record with 52 goals, breaking the old record of 50 held by [[Vic Hadfield]]. This record would later be broken by [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]] on April 8, 2006, against the Boston Bruins.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jagr Scores To Set Record And Sets Up Winning Goal|last=Diamos|first=Jason|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2006|page=8.1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/sports/hockey/09rangers.html?fta=y&pagewanted=print}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers clinched the Presidents' Trophy by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 52\u201324\u20138, setting a franchise record with 112 points. Their winning of the inaugural [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] title was only one of three times that the division title was not won by two of their biggest rivals, the [[Devils\u2013Flyers rivalry|New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia Flyers]].\n\nThe Rangers successfully made it past the first two rounds of the playoffs, sweeping the New York Islanders, who were seeded eighth in the first round, and then breezed by the Washington Capitals, seeded seventh, in five. However, matters got interesting in the Conference Finals against the third-seeded [[New Jersey Devils]]. The Rangers lost the series opener at home in double overtime, but won the next two games before the Devils beat the New York offense and defeated them 3\u20131 and 4\u20131. The series headed back to the [[Meadowlands Arena|Meadowlands]] for the next game, but the day before that sixth game, Rangers captain Mark Messier stepped up and guaranteed a win. Keenan said of the guarantee: {{cquote|Mark was sending a message to his teammates that he believed together we could win. He put on an amazing performance to make sure it happened.<ref>{{harvnb|Morrison|2008|page=106}}</ref>}}\n\nIn Game 6, Messier rose to the occasion and [[Hat trick#Hockey|scored three times]] in the final period to lead the Rangers to a 4\u20132 win and set up a seventh game back at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers won Game 7 2\u20131, when [[St\u00e9phane Matteau|Stephane Matteau]] scored a goal in double overtime, leading the team to the finals for the first time since {{scfy|1979}}.\n\nUp against the [[Vancouver Canucks]], the [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] team from the west, the Rangers again lost the series opener at home in overtime. [[Brian Leetch]] hit the crossbar at one end, and the Canucks going down to score the winner at the other on a shot from [[Greg Adams (ice hockey born 1963)|Greg Adams]]. The Rangers then bounced back and they won the next three games, allowing the Canucks just four goals. That set the stage for a game-five Stanley Cup celebration at home, the first time the team had ever been in a position to win a Cup at the Garden.\n\nThat night, the Canucks were leading 3\u20130 by the third minute of the third period. Even though the Rangers pulled even by the midway point, Vancouver took the lead 29 seconds later and cruised to a 6\u20133 win. New York's parade hopes were given another jolt two nights later when the Canucks put together a 4\u20131 win. Keenan said of playing Game 7: {{cquote|Even though we were up 3\u20131 in the series and had to play a seventh game, the team was very confident and very poised.

Linden scored a power play goal early in the third, but the Rangers managed to hang on 3\u20132 as the Garden erupted in cheers and tears.

The following off-season saw the departures of captain Jaromir Jagr to the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL), and alternate captains Martin Straka and Brendan Shanahan, who returned to play in the Czech Republic and with the New Jersey Devils, respectively. Following these departures, Chris Drury was named captain on October 3, 2008.\n\nThe Rangers were one of four NHL teams to open their 2008\u201309 season in Europe, being featured in the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] final, defeating the European Champions Cup winner [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland.

On June 30, 2009, the Rangers traded Scott Gomez, [[Tom Pyatt]] and [[Michael Busto]] to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for [[Chris Higgins (ice hockey)|Chris Higgins]], [[Ryan McDonagh]], [[Pavel Valentenko]] and [[Doug Janik]]. With Gomez's contract and salary cap hit gone, the Rangers then signed superstar [[Mari\u00e1n G\u00e1bor\u00edk|Marian Gaborik]] on July 1, the first day of free agency.\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 NHL season|2009\u201310 season]], the Rangers failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years. There was some criticism that the off-season acquisition of Gaborik, among other top-tier players, had not paid off. However, Gaborik scored 42 goals and 86 points in the season, an impressive return for the team. Despite of a strong 8\u20132 start to the season, the Rangers appeared to play inconsistently with numerous losing streaks. By March 2010, the Rangers were in danger of falling out of the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|2010 playoff]] race entirely, but they registered a respectable 7\u20131\u20132 record to finish the season. The final two games of the season were a home-and-home against the Philadelphia Flyers. The first was April 9, 2010, in New York, and the Rangers skated away with the victory, keeping their post-season hopes alive. The final game of the season would become the deciding game to determine who would make the playoffs. The Flyers peppered Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist with 47 shots, but scored only once. The game went to a shootout, and the Flyers prevailed to move on to the playoffs despite the strong overall finish to the season by the Rangers.\n\nFor the [[2010\u201311 NHL season|2010\u201311 season]], the Rangers waived defenseman [[Wade Redden]] and brought in several players to achieve more balanced scoring. They also wore a third jersey for the first time in several years. On November 12, the Rangers unveiled the new Heritage Jersey for the first time at the rink at Rockefeller Center in a special ceremony featuring Rangers alumni and current players discussing the history of the storied franchise. The club wore the jersey for the first time on November 17 when they played the Boston Bruins at Madison Square Garden. The jersey was to be worn every time the Rangers play an [[Original Six]] team, or on a Sunday afternoon game at home. The Rangers' fate of making or missing the playoffs would come down to the final day of the regular season for the second-straight year. The team defeated the New Jersey Devils on the final day of the season to finish with 93 points on the year. However, in order to qualify for the [[2011 Stanley Cup playoffs|2011 playoffs]], they needed the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] to lose their final game of the season, as Carolina owned the tiebreaker as both teams finished with the same number of points. Carolina lost its final game to Tampa Bay, 6\u20132, putting the Rangers in the playoffs after missing-out the previous season. The Rangers then faced Washington in the first round.

The Rangers avoided going down 3\u20132 in the series when Richards tied Game 5 at 2\u20132 with just 6.6 seconds left in the third period.

In the [[2014\u201315 NHL season|2014\u201315 season]], the Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy for the third time in franchise history and their seventh division title by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 53\u201322\u20137. The 53 wins and 113 points both set franchise records. The division title was the Rangers' first in the [[Metropolitan Division]], which was created during the NHL's realignment in the 2013 off-season. The team won 28 road games in the regular season, breaking the franchise record set the previous season. Over the course of the season, the Rangers agreed to terms on a contract extension with goaltender [[Cam Talbot]], Marc Staal and [[Mats Zuccarello]]. In the playoffs, the Rangers dispatched the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the first round. The Rangers then came back from a 3\u20131 series deficit to win their second-round series against the Capitals in seven games, becoming the first team in NHL history to battle back from a 3\u20131 deficit in back-to-back seasons and sending the Rangers to the Eastern Conference Final for the third time in four years. However, after winning the first game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Rangers lost Game 2 by four goals. The two teams split the first four games of the series, but the Rangers lost Game 5 2\u20130 at home, which gave the Lightning an opportunity to clinch the Conference Finals in Tampa Bay.

The nickname came from the original color of those seats before the first Garden renovation in the early 1990s. In the 1970s, \"blue-seaters\" would heckle opposing players, and also heckle the \"red-seaters\", down below.  This led to the perception that the blue seats were also home to a great deal of profanity, or \"blue language.\" The seats in the 400-level at MSG were redone in teal during the 1990 renovation of the Garden, but fans continued to refer to them as \"the blues\". \n\nFollowing the three-year transformation at the Garden that began in 2011, the blue seats now occupy only one end zone of the west side of the arena where the Rangers shoot twice. Because of the new balcony added above, these seats are considered \"limited view\"; they remain the cheapest seats in the building.\n\n==== Dancing Larry ====\nDancing Larry, whose real name was Larry Goodman,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/gay-fans-cite-a-hostile-garden-atmosphere/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=Gay Fans Cite Hostile Garden Atmosphere | date=2008-03-21}}</ref> has been a Rangers season ticket holder since 1988, and his famous dance routine began in the mid-to-late 1990s, when he danced in the aisle between sections 406 and 407. After the most recent MSG renovation, he now dances in the portal between sections 223 and 224. The dance usually occurs during the last TV timeout of the third period to get the crowd and the team pumped up. Larry dances to the song ''[[Strike It Up]]'' by [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]] which is cued up on the Madison Square Garden [[loud speakers]] by the technical staff.\n\n==== The Chief ====\nThe Chief, whose real name was Robert Comas, was a fan of the Rangers who donned an Indian headdress complete with Ranger facepaint from 1971 to 1995. He became an unofficial mascot, \"wandering around Madison Square Garden shaking hands, whooping and doing a war dance.\" Comas retired from his role as The Chief in 1995, one year after the Rangers won the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn 1998, Comas ran for public office as the Republican Party candidate for the State Senate in the 21st District, which includes Sheepshead Bay, Mill Basin and other parts of southern Brooklyn. When he was unable to gather enough signatures to make the ballot, the Republican party had no candidate in the contest. Comas did run on the Conservative line.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/nyregion/neighborhood-report-sheepshead-bay-chief-finds-new-arena-politics.html | work=The New York Times | first=Edward | last=Lewine | title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SHEEPSHEAD BAY; 'Chief' Finds New Arena: Politics | date=1998-10-25}}</ref> He managed to gather 3,255 votes, or 7.64% of the total votes counted, losing to incumbent [[Carl Kruger]], who was convicted on federal bribery charges in 2011.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.ourcampaigns.com/pages/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=90957\n| title      = NY State Senate 21\n| work       = ourcampaigns.com\n| accessdate = 2015-12-27\n}}</ref> Shortly after his bid for the New York State Senate failed, the Chief moved to Florida, where he resided until his death on September 17, 2009. He was 62.\n\n===Music===\n==== Goal song ====\nWhen the Rangers score a goal at Madison Square Garden the \"Slapshot\" (aka \"The New York Rangers [[Goal Song]]\") song is played following three blasts of a NYC Fire Engine horn.  The song made its debut on January 20, 1995, the night the 1994 Stanley Cup Champion Banner was raised to the rafters.  It was written by [[Ray Castoldi]], the Music Director at Madison Square Garden. \n\n==== National anthem singers ====\nJohn Amirante was the long-time national anthem singer at Madison Square Garden. He first performed the national anthem at the Garden ice in October 1980, and has also sung for the Knicks and Yankees. In 2009, when Amirante was 74, he was singing the anthem at about half of the Rangers' home games. On April 18, 2015, after a 35-year run, Amirante sang what was thought to be his last National Anthem before Game 2 in Round 1 of the 2015 playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins.<ref>https://nymag.com/daily/sports/2009/10/john_amirante_on_performing_th.html</ref> The following day, after a negative reaction from fans regarding the decision to forcibly retire Amirante, the Garden announced Amirante would be invited to be a guest anthem singer from time-to-time.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/rangers/rangers-bring-back-john-amirante-sing-national-anthem-article-1.2234104\n| title      = Rangers bring back John Amirante to sing national anthem before Game 5 vs. Lightning\n| work       = NEW YORK DAILY NEWS\n| date       = 2015-05-24\n| accessdate = 2015-07-19\n}}</ref> On April 17 2018, Amirante passed away at the age of 83.\n\n==== Victory song ====\nAfter every home victory the \"New York Rangers Victory Song\" is played. It was written in 1940 by [[J. Fred Coots]] (an avid Rangers fan and [[New York City|New Yorker]]) to pay tribute to the then-Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers. The music for the song can be heard [http://downloads.rangers.nhl.com/audio/RangersVictorySong.mp3 here].\n\n=== Salute the crowd ===\n[[File:Rangerssalute.jpg|thumb|right|Rangers saluting the crowd at [[Madison Square Garden]].]]\nAfter every Rangers home win, the team gathers at center ice and raise their sticks in the air to salute the Rangers supporters. The salute (the idea of defenseman [[Darius Kasparaitis]]) began in the early part of the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]], and has proved extremely popular with both the players and fans alike.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe salute to the fans is typically done only after home victories. However, after the Rangers fell to the rival New Jersey Devils in a four-game sweep in the first round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs]], the fans' cheers at the conclusion of an otherwise outstanding breakout season caused the players to stay on the ice after the loss and give the fans one final salute for the year. The Rangers have saluted the crowd on several occasions since after being eliminated from the playoffs at home.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[National Hockey League rivalries]]\n\n== References ==\n* ''Losing the Edge: The Rise and Fall of the Stanley Cup Champion New York Rangers'' by Barry Meisel (1995) ({{ISBN|0-684-81519-2}})\n* ''New York Rangers: Millennium Memories'' by the [[New York Daily News|NY Daily News]] (2000) ({{ISBN|1-58261-147-5}})\n* ''New York Rangers: Seventy-Five Years'' by John Halligan (2000) ({{ISBN|0-7607-2298-6}})\n* ''The New York Rangers: Broadway's Longest Running Hit'' by John Kreiser and Lou Friedman (1997) ({{ISBN|1-57167-041-6}})\n* ''The New York Rangers (Images of Sports)'' by John Halligan (2003) ({{ISBN|0-7385-1228-1}})\n* ''The Rangers'' by [[Brian McFarlane]] (1997) ({{ISBN|0-7737-6007-5}})\n* ''Thin Ice: A Season in Hell With the New York Rangers'' by Larry Sloman (1981) ({{ISBN|0-440-18571-8}})\n* ''Rangers' Biggest Trades Since 1990'' (October 6, 2006)\n* {{cite book|last=Smythe|first=Conn|last2=Young|first2=Scott|title=Conn Smythe: If you can't beat 'em in the alley |year=1981 |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |location=Toronto, Ontario |isbn=0-7710-9078-1}}\n* {{cite book|last=Morrison|first=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Canada: My Greatest Day|year=2008|publisher=Key Porter Books|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55470-086-8|authorlink=Scott Morrison (journalist)|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mygreatestday50p0000morr}}\n; Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.nypress.com/the-best-kept-sports-secret-in-new-york/  The Best Kept Sports Secret in New York]\n\n{{New York Rangers}}\n{{NHL team history}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The New York Rangers}}\n[[Category:History of the New York Rangers| ]]\n[[Category:National Hockey League history by team|New York Rangers]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePost-lockout revival (2005\u20132014):Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2-1 \u2192 2\u20131", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_New_York_Rangers"}
