Scott says they have tried and will keep trying, but Limbo is still sealed off. [[Amanda Sefton]] has been unable to break the seal, [[Doctor Strange]] is nowhere to be found, and Warren has scientists looking into it, but this is magic and there is nothing more they can do. Colossus says he cannot accept it.<ref name=\"XInfernus#1\">''X-Infernus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile in Limbo, Magik attacks various other demons looking for her [[Soulsword]] and the original Bloodstone amulet. This does not go unnoticed by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], [[Satannish]], [[Dormammu]], and [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Belasco's daughter, [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] appears during the meeting and reveals that she is the current owner of the original amulet. She vows to take her father's place as ruler of Limbo and to kill Magik.<ref name=\"XInfernus#1\"/>\n\nBack at the X-Men's base in San Francisco, [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] and [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] are watching Kurt and [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] train. Kurt brings up her Soul Dagger in conversation, which Megan is not pleased to hear about. Kurt points out that people have noticed that when she uses it, her personality changes. Pixie begins to cry and summons her Soul Dagger; her personality changes and she stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. Mercury and Rockslide, who are watching the session, rush in and pull her away from Kurt. Beast enters and is shocked at what he finds. Pixie's Soul Dagger is stuck in Kurt's chest and when she removes it, she accidentally discovers where Magik's Soulsword is hidden, inside Nightcrawler. Sensing the Soulsword, Magik teleports into the X-Men's base to reclaim it.<ref name=\"XInfernus#1\"/>\n\n===Chapter Two: This Mortal Coil===\nMagik stands before Pixie, Mercury, Rockslide and Beast, demanding Pixie hand over her Soulsword. She takes out Mercury, Rockslide and Beast, and engages Pixie in combat. Pixie refuses to hand over the sword, but Magik overpowers her and regains her sword. As soon as she gets hold of it, her appearance changes and she becomes more human than demon. At that moment, Colossus, [[Armor (comics)|Armor]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], and [[Emma Frost]] enter. Magik strikes Colossus when he calls her 'Snowflake' but senses something is wrong when she doesn't feel anything. She teleports back to Limbo, telling her brother that he can't save her; she has to save herself. The X-Men gather the wounded, and Pixie attempts to go after Magik but Kurt stops her. Pixie breaks out in tears and apologizes for stabbing him.<ref name=\"XInfernus#2\">''X-Infernus'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn Limbo, Witchfire learns that Magik has left Limbo and assumes control. She stabs [[S'ym]] in the chest, seriously wounding him. Magik teleports in to find him chained to the throne. She asks what happened and he informs her that Belasco's daughter, Witchfire, has taken control in her absence. Illyana is shocked to hear Belasco had a daughter, and Witchfire steps out of the shadows and attacks Magik.<ref name=\"XInfernus#2\"/>\n\nPeter says he is going after Illyana. The other [[X-Men]] have a way to get to Limbo (through Pixie). Scott agrees with him and puts together a team consisting of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], Pixie, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Mercury and Rockslide, with Kurt in charge due to Pixie and Pete's personal stake in the mission. Pixie then teleports them into Limbo only to find they are surrounded by many hostile demons.<ref name=\"XInfernus#2\"/>\n\n===Chapter Three: What You Wish For===\nMagik confronts Witchfire at her castle. Witchfire claims everything Belasco ever owned, including Magik's soul, and after a quick battle, Magik is taken down by Witchfire, who claims the second Bloodstone amulet. Witchfire stabs Magik in the chest, injuring her and knocking her out. Witchfire takes Pixie's Bloodstone and adds it to the original amulet, giving her four Bloodstones and a more demonic appearance.<ref name=\"XInfernus#3\">''X-Infernus'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElsewhere in Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine are fighting their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide are horrified at how brutal the older X-Men are towards the demons. An octopus-type creature attacks Kurt until Pixie jumps in and kills it with her soul dagger. Colossus shatters Rockslide, who reforms from Limbo rock, and Wolverine is stabbed in the chest with a sword that sends him into a berserker rage and he kills all the demons that stand in their way. After Colossus removes the sword from Wolverine, they stumble upon Belasco's castle. After trying to decide how to get there, Pixie senses the darkness within her suddenly growing and she teleports off to the castle by herself.<ref name=\"XInfernus#3\"/>\n\nAfter arriving at the castle, Pixie happens upon a mirror that shows herself transformed into a demon. Pixie freaks out and runs into the throne room where she finds Magik chained up and Witchfire. Witchfire grabs Pixie by the throat and forces her to become her new apprentice and begins forging a new Bloodstone from Pixie's soul.<ref name=\"XInfernus#3\"/>\n\nHearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, Witchfire turns Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt notices Illyana chained to a pillar. She asks him to stab her with the Pixie's soul dagger, as it is the only way to free her, and he is the only one to do it because he is attuned to magic. She apologizes and he stabs her. At that moment, Colossus punches Kurt and Witchfire finished making her fifth and final Bloodstone from a partially demonic Pixie.<ref name=\"XInfernus#3\"/>\n\n===Chapter Four: Soul's End===\nKurt, discovering that Colossus' punch is far from lethal, slips past him and Wolverine to remove the Soul Dagger from Illyana, retrieving her Soulsword and using them both to free his teammates from their enchantment. He then sees Witchfire finish making the fifth Bloodstone out of Pixie's soul and slices off Witchfire's hand. But she brushes him away with a magic blast and re-grows a demonic 3-fingered hand while Kurt consoles Pixie and tells her to use the dagger to free Illyana because of their mutual connection. Witchfire uses the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods to her aid, but Illyana and her friends interrupt her summoning. While the X-Men battle the Elder Gods, Illyana fights Witchfire, who blasts her. But Illyana is sheathed inside [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]]'s magic-resistant skin, and they slash Witchfire and strip her of the amulet containing the Bloodstones. Illyana and Pixie use their blades to smash the amulet, but Witchfire escapes the crumbling castle with four Bloodstones into the Elder Gods' dimension. Pixie is despondent over losing more of her soul and tries to attack Magik with her Soul Dagger, but the glowing stone in its blade indicates that the stolen piece of her soul is inside it. Pixie flies away in tears.<ref name=\"XInfernus#4\">''X-Infernus'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIllyana is upset that she failed to recover her soul and fears for her humanity. Kurt consoles her by telling her of his half-demonic parentage and how he has decided he has a soul regardless of that. Peter also tries to console his sister, but when he sees the horns still on her head, she fearfully teleports all of them back to the X-Men's compound and then tries to leave. Peter, her old friends from the [[New Mutants]], and Cyclops finally convince her to stay.<ref name=\"XInfernus#4\"/>\n\n==Collected editions==\nThe series has been collected into a single [[trade paperback (comics)|volume]]:\n\n* ''X-Infernus'' (152 pages, July 2009, {{ISBN|0-7851-3947-8}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{gcdb series|id=32971|title=''X-Infernus''}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=title|id=21321|title=''X-Infernus''}}\n* [http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120803-X-Infernus.html X-Infernus: Setting the Stage With CB Cebulski], [[Newsarama]], December 3, 2008\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comic book title <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \n|title               = X-Infernus\n|image               = \n|caption             = Art from cover to X-Infernus #1.

Scott says they have tried and will keep trying, but Limbo is still sealed off. [[Amanda Sefton]] has been unable to break the seal, [[Doctor Strange]] is nowhere to be found, and Warren has scientists looking into it, but this is magic and there is nothing more they can do. Colossus says he cannot accept it.<ref name=\"XInfernus#1\">''X-Infernus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile in Limbo, Magik attacks various other demons looking for her [[Soulsword]] and the original Bloodstone amulet. This does not go unnoticed by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], [[Satannish]], [[Dormammu]], and [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Belasco's daughter, [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] appears during the meeting and reveals that she is the current owner of the original amulet. She vows to take her father's place as ruler of Limbo and to kill Magik.<ref name=\"XInfernus#1\"/>\n\nBack at the X-Men's base in San Francisco, [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] and [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] are watching Kurt and [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] train. Kurt brings up her Soul Dagger in conversation, which Megan is not pleased to hear about. Kurt points out that people have noticed that when she uses it, her personality changes. Pixie begins to cry and summons her Soul Dagger; her personality changes and she stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. Mercury and Rockslide, who are watching the session, rush in and pull her away from Kurt. Beast enters and is shocked at what he finds. Pixie's Soul Dagger is stuck in Kurt's chest and when she removes it, she accidentally discovers where Magik's Soulsword is hidden, inside Nightcrawler. Sensing the Soulsword, Magik teleports into the X-Men's base to reclaim it.<ref name=\"XInfernus#1\"/>\n\n===Chapter Two: This Mortal Coil===\nMagik stands before Pixie, Mercury, Rockslide and Beast, demanding Pixie hand over her Soulsword. She takes out Mercury, Rockslide and Beast, and engages Pixie in combat. Pixie refuses to hand over the sword, but Magik overpowers her and regains her sword. As soon as she gets hold of it, her appearance changes and she becomes more human than demon. At that moment, Colossus, [[Armor (comics)|Armor]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], and [[Emma Frost]] enter. Magik strikes Colossus when he calls her 'Snowflake' but senses something is wrong when she doesn't feel anything. She teleports back to Limbo, telling her brother that he can't save her; she has to save herself. The X-Men gather the wounded, and Pixie attempts to go after Magik but Kurt stops her. Pixie breaks out in tears and apologizes for stabbing him.<ref name=\"XInfernus#2\">''X-Infernus'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn Limbo, Witchfire learns that Magik has left Limbo and assumes control. She stabs [[S'ym]] in the chest, seriously wounding him. Magik teleports in to find him chained to the throne. She asks what happened and he informs her that Belasco's daughter, Witchfire, has taken control in her absence. Illyana is shocked to hear Belasco had a daughter, and Witchfire steps out of the shadows and attacks Magik.<ref name=\"XInfernus#2\"/>\n\nPeter says he is going after Illyana. The other [[X-Men]] have a way to get to Limbo (through Pixie). Scott agrees with him and puts together a team consisting of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], Pixie, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Mercury and Rockslide, with Kurt in charge due to Pixie and Pete's personal stake in the mission. Pixie then teleports them into Limbo only to find they are surrounded by many hostile demons.<ref name=\"XInfernus#2\"/>\n\n===Chapter Three: What You Wish For===\nMagik confronts Witchfire at her castle. Witchfire claims everything Belasco ever owned, including Magik's soul, and after a quick battle, Magik is taken down by Witchfire, who claims the second Bloodstone amulet. Witchfire stabs Magik in the chest, injuring her and knocking her out. Witchfire takes Pixie's Bloodstone and adds it to the original amulet, giving her four Bloodstones and a more demonic appearance.<ref name=\"XInfernus#3\">''X-Infernus'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElsewhere in Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine are fighting their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide are horrified at how brutal the older X-Men are towards the demons. An octopus-type creature attacks Kurt until Pixie jumps in and kills it with her soul dagger. Colossus shatters Rockslide, who reforms from Limbo rock, and Wolverine is stabbed in the chest with a sword that sends him into a berserker rage and he kills all the demons that stand in their way. After Colossus removes the sword from Wolverine, they stumble upon Belasco's castle. After trying to decide how to get there, Pixie senses the darkness within her suddenly growing and she teleports off to the castle by herself.<ref name=\"XInfernus#3\"/>\n\nAfter arriving at the castle, Pixie happens upon a mirror that shows herself transformed into a demon. Pixie freaks out and runs into the throne room where she finds Magik chained up and Witchfire. Witchfire grabs Pixie by the throat and forces her to become her new apprentice and begins forging a new Bloodstone from Pixie's soul.<ref name=\"XInfernus#3\"/>\n\nHearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room.

Owned by [[Nexstar Media Group]], it is [[sister station|sister]] to two [[Class A television service|Class A]] stations: [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WBRL-CD]] (channel 21, which WGMB [[simulcast]]s on its second [[digital subchannel]]) and [[independent station (North America)|independent]] [[KZUP-CD]] (channel 19); Nexstar also operates [[NBC]] affiliate [[WVLA-TV]] (channel 33) under [[local marketing agreement|joint sales]] and [[shared services]] agreements (JSA/SSA) with owner [[White Knight Broadcasting]]. The four stations share studios on Perkins Road in Baton Rouge and transmitter facilities near [[Addis, Louisiana]]. On [[cable television|cable]], WGMB is available on [[Cox Communications]] channel 6 in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], and on [[digital cable|digital]] channel 1006 in [[high-definition television|high definition]], as well as [[AT&T U-verse]] channels 44 and 1044. The station is also seen via [[satellite television|satellite]] through [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on August 11, 1991, making Baton Rouge the last of the Top 100 Nielsen [[Designated Market Area]]s to receive a Fox affiliate. The station was originally owned by the Galloway family, whose broadcast holdings operated under the [[Communications Corporation of America]] banner. It took five years to bring Fox to Baton Rouge, as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) assigned channel 44 to Baton Rouge in 1983 and several potential buyers sought a license. One company, Parish Family Television expressed an interest in broadcasting an independent station affiliated with the network in 1986 with the call letters WPFT. Delays occurred as Southwest Multimedia of [[Houston]] expressed an ownership interest in Parish Family Television and rival company Louisiana Super Communications objected to this sale. After Southwest Multimedia bowed out of the ownership stake, Thomas Galloway of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] purchased the license from PFTV in November 1990. The station installed an antenna on WVLA's tower, bought from future sister station [[WNTZ]]'s parent company at the time, Delta Media Corporation. From April 1990 to February 1991, local NBC affiliate WVLA aired week-delayed episodes of Fox shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', and ''[[In Living Color]]''.\n\nIn addition to its Fox affiliation, WGMB also carried several syndicated [[feature film|movie]] packages including [[Columbia Pictures]]' ''Night at the Movies'' and [[Universal Television]]'s ''[[Action Pack (Universal Television)|Action Pack]]'' and was a secondary affiliate of [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] in its early years of operation. In 1996, WGMB became a sister station of WVLA when Thomas Galloway's son, Sheldon, purchased the NBC affiliate from businessman Cyril Vetter. Sheldon had previously held a stake in WGMB but sold it to his father to make it easier for him to buy WVLA.<ref>Deal struck to sell TV Channel 33, The Advocate, February 10, 1996</ref>\n\nThe station originally broadcast from Florida Boulevard, until the Galloways purchased WVLA. In 1999, WGMB, along with WVLA, WBBR (now WBRL), and WZUP (now KZUP), moved to their current studios on Perkins Road in Baton Rouge.\n\nIn June 2006, owner ComCorp filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] protection. ComCorp said in a press release viewers and staff would see no changes at the station.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/1229288951.html?dids=1229288951:1229288951&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+8%2C+2007&author=TED+GRIGGS&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=1&desc=TV+station+parents+told+to+file+reorganization TV station parents told to file reorganization<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com/articles/2007/11/06/daily.7/?promo Tvnewsday - Comcorp Ready For Its Next Chapter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.theind.com/news3.asp?CID=306408159 TheInd.com - News | Business | Culture - Weekly - Lafayette LA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.businessreport.com/news/2007/sep/04/wvla-wgmb-getting-new-owners/ :: Baton Rouge Business Report :: WVLA, WGMB getting new owners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn April 24, 2013, ComCorp announced the sale of its entire group, including WGMB-TV, to the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]].<ref>https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101552312&qnum=5040&copynum=1&exhcnum=1</ref> The [[local marketing agreement]] for WVLA-TV (which was to be sold to [[Mission Broadcasting]], but it was later withdrawn) is included in the deal.

One locally-produced show was ''Fox Rox Saturday'', which aired in the late 1990s on Saturday mornings. WGMB also aired one [[high school football]] game each week during the fall from the Baton Rouge area in the early 2000s.\n\nSince the station upgraded to digital, WGMB has rebroadcast the signal of the low-power WB and CW affiliate [[WBRL-CD]] on its second subchannel. On January 25, 2018, WGMB added [[Cozi TV]] to its third subchannel.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of [[Chicago]]-based [[Tribune Media]] for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal\u2014which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019\u2014would give the WGMB/WVLA/WBRL/KZUP virtual quadropoly [[sister station]]s in Tribune's legal duopoly of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WGNO]] and CW affiliate [[WNOL-TV]] in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Acquisition of Tribune Media Company|url=https://www.nexstar.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nexstar-Tribune-Investor-Presentation-FINAL-12-3-18.pdf|website=[[Nexstar Media Group]]|format=[[PDF]]|date=December 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nexstar Buying Tribune Media For $6.4 Billion|url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/top-news/226264/nexstar-buying-tribune-media-6-4-billion/|author=Mark K.

Owned by [[Nexstar Media Group]], it is [[sister station|sister]] to two [[Class A television service|Class A]] stations: [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WBRL-CD]] (channel 21, which WGMB [[simulcast]]s on its second [[digital subchannel]]) and [[independent station (North America)|independent]] [[KZUP-CD]] (channel 19); Nexstar also operates [[NBC]] affiliate [[WVLA-TV]] (channel 33) under [[local marketing agreement|joint sales]] and [[shared services]] agreements (JSA/SSA) with owner [[White Knight Broadcasting]]. The four stations share studios on Perkins Road in Baton Rouge and transmitter facilities near [[Addis, Louisiana]]. On [[cable television|cable]], WGMB is available on [[Cox Communications]] channel 6 in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], and on [[digital cable|digital]] channel 1006 in [[high-definition television|high definition]], as well as [[AT&T U-verse]] channels 44 and 1044. The station is also seen via [[satellite television|satellite]] through [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]].\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on August 11, 1991, making Baton Rouge the last of the Top 100 Nielsen [[Designated Market Area]]s to receive a Fox affiliate. The station was originally owned by the Galloway family, whose broadcast holdings operated under the [[Communications Corporation of America]] banner. It took five years to bring Fox to Baton Rouge, as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) assigned channel 44 to Baton Rouge in 1983 and several potential buyers sought a license. One company, Parish Family Television expressed an interest in broadcasting an independent station affiliated with the network in 1986 with the call letters WPFT. Delays occurred as Southwest Multimedia of [[Houston]] expressed an ownership interest in Parish Family Television and rival company Louisiana Super Communications objected to this sale. After Southwest Multimedia bowed out of the ownership stake, Thomas Galloway of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] purchased the license from PFTV in November 1990. The station installed an antenna on WVLA's tower, bought from future sister station [[WNTZ]]'s parent company at the time, Delta Media Corporation. From April 1990 to February 1991, local NBC affiliate WVLA aired week-delayed episodes of Fox shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', and ''[[In Living Color]]''.\n\nIn addition to its Fox affiliation, WGMB also carried several syndicated [[feature film|movie]] packages including [[Columbia Pictures]]' ''Night at the Movies'' and [[Universal Television]]'s ''[[Action Pack (Universal Television)|Action Pack]]'' and was a secondary affiliate of [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] in its early years of operation. In 1996, WGMB became a sister station of WVLA when Thomas Galloway's son, Sheldon, purchased the NBC affiliate from businessman Cyril Vetter. Sheldon had previously held a stake in WGMB but sold it to his father to make it easier for him to buy WVLA.<ref>Deal struck to sell TV Channel 33, The Advocate, February 10, 1996</ref>\n\nThe station originally broadcast from Florida Boulevard, until the Galloways purchased WVLA. In 1999, WGMB, along with WVLA, WBBR (now WBRL), and WZUP (now KZUP), moved to their current studios on Perkins Road in Baton Rouge.\n\nIn June 2006, owner ComCorp filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] protection. ComCorp said in a press release viewers and staff would see no changes at the station.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/theadvocate/access/1229288951.html?dids=1229288951:1229288951&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+8%2C+2007&author=TED+GRIGGS&pub=Advocate&edition=&startpage=1&desc=TV+station+parents+told+to+file+reorganization TV station parents told to file reorganization<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com/articles/2007/11/06/daily.7/?promo Tvnewsday - Comcorp Ready For Its Next Chapter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.theind.com/news3.asp?CID=306408159 TheInd.com - News | Business | Culture - Weekly - Lafayette LA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.businessreport.com/news/2007/sep/04/wvla-wgmb-getting-new-owners/ :: Baton Rouge Business Report :: WVLA, WGMB getting new owners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn April 24, 2013, ComCorp announced the sale of its entire group, including WGMB-TV, to the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]].<ref>https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101552312&qnum=5040&copynum=1&exhcnum=1</ref> The [[local marketing agreement]] for WVLA-TV (which was to be sold to [[Mission Broadcasting]], but it was later withdrawn) is included in the deal.

One locally-produced show was ''Fox Rox Saturday'', which aired in the late 1990s on Saturday mornings. WGMB also aired one [[high school football]] game each week during the fall from the Baton Rouge area in the early 2000s.\n\nSince the station upgraded to digital, WGMB has rebroadcast the signal of the low-power WB and CW affiliate [[WBRL-CD]] on its second subchannel. On January 25, 2018, WGMB added [[Cozi TV]] to its third subchannel.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of [[Chicago]]-based [[Tribune Media]] for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The deal\u2014which would make Nexstar the largest television station operator by total number of stations upon its expected closure late in the third quarter of 2019\u2014would give the WGMB/WVLA/WBRL/KZUP virtual quadropoly [[sister station]]s in Tribune's legal duopoly of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WGNO]] and CW affiliate [[WNOL-TV]] in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Acquisition of Tribune Media Company|url=https://www.nexstar.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nexstar-Tribune-Investor-Presentation-FINAL-12-3-18.pdf|website=[[Nexstar Media Group]]|format=[[PDF]]|date=December 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nexstar Buying Tribune Media For $6.4 Billion|url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/top-news/226264/nexstar-buying-tribune-media-6-4-billion/|author=Mark K.

most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Conceived by writer/illustrator [[Rob Liefeld]], the team first appeared in ''[[New Mutants#New Mutants Vol. 1|New Mutants]]'' #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series called ''X-Force''. The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team, the [[New Mutants]].\n\nX-Force's first leader was the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. An offshoot of the [[X-Men]], X-Force takes a more [[Militant (word)|militant]] and aggressive approach towards its enemies compared to the X-Men.\n\nAn alternate incarnation of X-Force appears in the 2018 film ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' as part of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]. A planned X-Force film adaption by [[20th Century Fox]] was in production as of 2018; however, as of now production was stopped after [[Disney]] bought 20th Century Fox.\n\n==Publication history==\n===Publication===\nThe ''X-Force'' series was successful in the early 1990s, but its popularity waned after Liefeld left, which caused Marvel to implement several reforms to the title from 1995 until 2001 with varying degrees of success. Low sales on the ''X-Force'' series eventually prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self-interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X-Force. ''X-Force'' was canceled with #129 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]],'' which coincided with a similar rebranding of the team in the story. After ''X-Statix'' was canceled with #26, Marvel reunited the original X-Force team for a six-issue 2004 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] plotted and drawn by Liefeld.\n\nIn 2007\u20132008, during the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]], a new version of the X-Force team was formed with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] leading a more militaristic [[black ops]] branch of the X-Men. This squad would form the basis for a new X-Force series starting February 2008 by writers [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]], plus [[Clayton Crain]] as the artist. The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the [[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]] storyline that ran through various X-titles. The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' with [[Rick Remender]] and [[Jerome Ope\u00f1a]] as the creative team and Wolverine, [[Psylocke]], [[Deadpool]], [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Fantomex]], and [[Fantomex|E.V.A.]] as the initial roster.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/comics/news/a243865/marvel-reveals-uncanny-x-force-team.html |title=Comics \u2013 News \u2013 Marvel reveals 'Uncanny X-Force' team |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Uncanny X-Force'' series ended at issue #35 in 2012 and was once again relaunched as ''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 as part of [[Marvel NOW!]], with a new team led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and Psylocke, written by Sam Humphries. A concurrent X-Force book written by Dennis Hopeless, ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'', was released at the same time, bringing Cable back into the X-Force fold. The two series ended in 2014 after a crossover between the two titled \"Vendetta\". A new ''X-Force'' (vol. 4), was launched featuring a black ops squad composed of Cable, Psylocke, Fantomex and [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], written by ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' writer [[Simon Spurrier]].<ref name=\"ComicBookResources\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48983 |title=Spurrier, Kim's Adjectiveless \"X-Force\" Launches in February |publisher=ComicBookResources |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 1: 1991\u20132001===\n\n====Liefeld period====\nX-Force was created by illustrator Rob Liefeld after he started penciling ''[[The New Mutants]]'' comic book in 1989 with #86. The popularity of Liefeld's art led to him taking over the plotting duties on the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} With help from writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], who provided the dialogue for Liefeld's plots, Liefeld transformed the New Mutants into X-Force in ''New Mutants'' #100, the book's final issue. Liefeld and Nicieza launched ''X-Force'' in August 1991. Rob Liefeld obtained the name for the series from an unknown artist at a convention a few months prior to its release. With the aid of a multiple-variant poly-bagged card, the book sold a record 5 million copies{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, and remains the second-highest selling American comic book of all time, surpassed only by Jim Lee's X-Men book that same summer with 8 million copies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The original line-up of the team included [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] (Son of Cyclops and Jean grey), [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] (believed to be an External), [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] (sister of  Thornn of X-Factor), [[Shatterstar]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] (Brother of Thunderbird of the X-men); [[Siryn]] (Daughter of Banshee of the X-men) was added to the team in the third issue.\n\nThe main opponents of X-Force during its first year were the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[Mutant Liberation Front]], led by [[Stryfe]], a masked mutant with a mysterious link to Cable. Early issues also featured the wise-cracking mercenary [[Deadpool]], the immortal [[Externals]], and a new version of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].\n\nPropelled by Liefeld's art, ''X-Force'' became one of Marvel's bestselling comic books immediately after its debut. The series rivaled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''Uncanny X-Men'' in popularity, particularly with the adolescent demographic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Toy Biz]] responded to X-Force's popularity by introducing an X-Force action figure line alongside its X-Men action figure line. Liefeld illustrated the series up to #9 and stopped plotting it after #11, as he had become increasingly frustrated with not owning characters he created and that his art was being used on a variety of [[Product (business)|merchandise]] while he allegedly received little [[royalties]]. Along with six other popular Marvel artists, Liefeld left Marvel Comics in 1992 to form [[Image Comics]].\n\n====Nicieza period====\n''X-Force'' continued with Nicieza taking over creative control of the series. Nicieza soon had the team break away from Cable and moved them to a new base in the ruins of Warpath's childhood home at the Camp Verde reservation; he also had former New Mutants [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Rictor]] join the team. The series crossed over with most other X-Men related books in the fall of 1992 with the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' storyline, co-plotted by Nicieza (who was also writing ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men vol. 2]]''). In that story, Stryfe frames Cable for an assassination attempt on the X-Men's founder [[Professor X]], leading to a clash between the X-Men and X-Force. The crossover boosted Cable's popularity, despite the character's apparent death in ''X-Force'' #18, leading to his own solo series being launched in 1993.\n\nAfter ''X-Cutioner's Song'', ''X-Force'' continued under Nicieza with new artist [[Greg Capullo]]. With Cannonball taking over as leader, X-Force develop an identity of their own as an independent team. Cable would return in the ''Fatal Attractions'' crossover, with a less hardline leadership stance. Capullo departed from the series at this point, first succeeded by Matt Broome and then [[Tony Daniel]]. The team grew into a dysfunctional family, and the title regularly combined soap opera plot threads, such as romance and Siryn's alcoholism, with violent action. Nicieza fleshed out previously unknown elements of each character's history, including Siryn's family in Ireland,<ref>''X-Force'' #31 (February 1994)</ref> Rictor's in Mexico,<ref>''X-Force'' #34 (May 1994)</ref> Cannonball's in Kentucky,<ref>''X-Force'' #37 (August 1994)</ref> and Shatterstar's in Mojoworld.<ref>''X-Force'' #29\u201330 (December 1993 \u2013 January 1994)</ref> This period also saw reappearances of characters from the group's New Mutants days, such as [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]],<ref>''X-Force'' #24 (July 1993)</ref> [[Danielle Moonstar]],<ref>''X-Force'' #27 & 43 and ''X-Force 1994 Annual''<!--dates needed--></ref> and [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]].<ref>''X-Force'' #38 (September 1994)</ref> In issue #40 the team moved to a new underground base beneath Manhattan, formerly belonging to the supervillain Arcade. A long-simmering sub-plot about [[Reignfire]] and the disappearance of Sunspot came to a climax just as the book went on hiatus for the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' crossover event in 1995, ending on a cliffhanger.\n\n====Loeb period====\n''X-Force'' was radically overhauled in the wake of ''Age of Apocalypse'' from issue #44, with a new creative team of writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and illustrator [[Adam Pollina]]. The in-progress Reignfire story was apparently resolved off-panel between issues, and the team's Manhattan base was abruptly blown up in the ''X-Men Prime'' one-shot special. As part of a general editorial push to more closely integrate the various X-Men books, Loeb had the team move in with the X-Men at the [[X-Mansion]] and effectively become the X-Men's junior team, complete with introducing new uniforms modelled on the X-Men. Loeb's first issue also saw Cannonball and Rictor written out of the series, with Cannonball \u201cgraduating\u201d to the X-Men and Rictor quitting; [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a super-strong [[albinism|albino]] mutant who possessed the mind of a child, joined the team. Stories in this period generally toned down the series' levels of action and violence. The character Boomer (formerly Boom-Boom) also changed her codename to Meltdown and adopted a new aggressive attitude. Loeb's final story, the three-part ''Shatterstar Saga'', brought Rictor back to the team; it also ambiguously retconned Shatterstar's origins in a manner that was generally regarded as unnecessarily confusing.\n\n====Moore period====\nIn 1997, writer [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] took over the series and began revisiting plot developments that had been left ignored throughout Loeb's run, including Dani Moonstar infiltrating the MLF and the true perpetrator of the Camp Verde massacre. Following the ''Operation Zero Tolerance'' storyline, the team effectively disbanded in issue #70, and Cable, Caliban, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar were written out of the series. The next year's worth of issues followed the remaining cast members Meltdown, Siryn, Sunspot, Warpath and Danielle Moonstar on a road trip across America. During this time James Proudstar was able to get closure on the massacre of his tribe, and subsequently stopped using the codename Warpath. The Reignfire story was also followed up on, with a new and more complete explanation for what had actually happened during Sunspot's disappearance. Former team members Cable, Cannonball, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar all made one-off reappearances, as did New Mutants characters Karma and Skids.\n\nIn 1998, Moore and new artist [[Jim Cheung]] had X-Force move into new headquarters in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], returned Cannonball and later Domino to the team, and added [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]], a mutant who could disrupt electronic equipment; they also gained a new ally in sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]]. A new major antagonist came to prominence in the Damocles Foundation, an organisation founded by rogue Deviants, Eternals and humans. Former New Mutant Magma also reappeared as an antagonist. Dani Moonstar acquired new superpowers, being able to manipulate quantum energies. Towards the end of the run, Siryn and Sunspot left the team and continued as recurring guests. The 1999 annual centred around Rictor and Shatterstar, showing what they had been doing since leaving the team together.\n\nSales steadily declined throughout this period, falling from selling over 100,000 copies per issue<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/1996/1996-12.html</ref> to between forty and fifty thousand by the end of Moore's run with issue #100.<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2000/2000-01.html</ref> A similar sales decline was observed in other ancillary X-Men titles including ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man''.\n\n====Counter-X====\nWriter [[Warren Ellis]], known for his dark, cynical style, was put in charge of revamping ''X-Force'' along with ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man'' under the branding '''Counter-X''', as part of the '''[[Revolution (Marvel Comics)|Revolution]]''' revamp of the various X-Men titles in 2000. Ellis' stint on ''X-Force'' over issues #102\u2013115, co-written by [[Ian Edginton]] and illustrated by [[Whilce Portacio]], saw Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown, and Warpath become a [[Covert operation|covert ops]] superhero team under the leadership of [[Pete Wisdom]], a British mutant and former intelligence agent who could shoot burning blades of energy from his fingers. Despite the changes in creators, sales continued to decline at the same rate.<ref>[http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 CBGXtra.com \u2013 Comics Sales Charts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027110315/http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 |date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref> The run concluded with Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown and Warpath all appearing to die in an explosion, although all were revealed to be alive soon after.\n\nIn early 2001, the ''X-Force'' title was completely reimagined by writer [[Peter Milligan]] and artist [[Mike Allred]], who replaced the existing incarnation of the team with an entirely different group of mutants using the X-Force name. Issue #116 saw the introduction of a new, sardonically toned X-Force consisting of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants put together and marketed to be media superstars. ''X-Force'' was canceled with issue #129 in late 2002 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]]'' in late 2002.\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 2: 2004-2005===\nIn 2004, Marvel released a new six-issue ''X-Force''.

The trail leads back to the Purifiers, led by [[Matthew Risman]] and the mysterious [[Eli Bard]]. They attach Bastion's head to the body of a Nimrod unit, to use the revived Bastion in their \"holy war\" against mutantkind. Bastion retrieves an offspring of the technarch [[Magus (Marvel Comics)|Magus]] from the ocean floor and revives several deceased X-Men villains, including [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Graydon Creed]], by infecting their corpses with the Technarch Transmode Virus. The virus allows Bastion a degree of mental control over the revived corpses. He also infects two living subjects with the virus: [[Donald Pierce]] and the [[Leper Queen]].\n\nDuring X-Force's raid on a Purifer base, Risman holds Wolfsbane hostage. While Wolverine calls for the team to stand down, X-23 decides Risman is bluffing and activates a concealed detonator that sets off a series of powerful explosives. The explosion brings most of the base down around them, but Risman is able to escape with Wolfsbane during the chaos. Wolverine later admonishes Laura for being so reckless with the lives of her teammates and for allowing Rahne to be kidnapped. After interrogating and killing numerous Purifiers, X-Force finds Rahne held in a warehouse, barely alive. Angel retrieves Elixir to heal Rahne, who wakes up soon after. Laura then catches the scent of Elixir's and Angel's blood, and runs off to help them. She reaches the room just in time to see Wolfsbane standing above Angel with his severed wings in her jaws. While in the Purifiers' custody, Rahne had been brainwashed by her deranged father, Reverend Craig, causing her to go berserk at the sight of an angelic figure. Wolfsbane savagely attacks Laura before handing over Angel's wings to the Purifiers.\n\nElixir heals both his and Angel's wounds, then discovers that Angel's wings aren't organic and can't be regrown. Angel transforms into [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], complete with metallic wings. Archangel wounds Wolverine and X-23 before taking off toward the Purifiers' base, sensing his old wings. Meanwhile, the Purifiers use samples of Angel's stolen wings to develop techno-organic wings for their soldiers, giving them similar abilities to Archangel. The group of Purifiers given wings is dubbed \"The Choir\". X-Force pursues Archangel to the Purifiers' base and slaughters most of The Choir, while Risman discovers Eli Bard absorbing the Technarch offspring into his hand. X-23 kills Risman with a headshot, and briefly fights Eli. Eli overpowers her, but is prevented from killing her when Warpath stabs him, causing him to flee. Wolverine takes on Bastion, who deems the threat posed by Wolverine \"unacceptable\" and retreats. Afterwards, X-Force finds Archangel unconscious and in human form, complete with feathered wings. Wolverine informs Cyclops of the turn of events, and Cyclops asks which of X-Force's targets should be next.<ref>X-Force #1\u20136</ref>\n\n====Old Ghosts====\nOnce X-Force regroups at Angel's Aerie, they test the reactions of Rahne and Angel to one another. Rahne reverts to full feral form upon seeing Angel, who responds by transforming into Archangel. Wolverine and Elixir restrain Wolfsbane while Cyclops talks down Archangel, who has trouble controlling his Apocalypse-like mentality while in his transformed state. Laura calls in the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] to erase Elixir's memories of X-Force, to help them remain covert. Before they do so, Angel informs them of a live telecast featuring Graydon Creed, who claims an L.M.D. was assassinated in his place and publicly denounces mutants once more. Cyclops assembles X-Force, including Elixir, and unexpectedly declares the Vanisher as their next target.\n\nIt is revealed that [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], a former Marauder, contacted Cyclops about a break-in at an old lab of [[Mister Sinister]]'s that held an altered version of the [[Legacy Virus]]. While in pursuit of the Vanisher, the team runs into Domino, who joins forces with them to recover the Legacy Virus. After cornering Vanisher and inducing an inoperable brain tumor (courtesy of Elixir) to ensure his cooperation, Vanisher reveals he lost the virus while escaping from a horde of Marauder clones that were awakened after the death of Sinister. X-Force returns to the lab and kill the cloned Marauders inside. Domino retrieves the virus, only to be confronted by [[The Right (comics)|The Right]]'s shocktroopers, who have come to take the virus for themselves. X-23 is injected with the virus while doing battle, and runs toward a nearby molten vat to destroy herself (thus destroying the virus). Elixir catches Laura as she jumps, and uses his healing powers to purge her of the virus, declaring that his purpose in X-Force is to ensure no more of his friends will die. With Vanisher in tow, X-Force returns home.<ref>X-Force #7\u201310</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Warpath returns to his tribe's reservation at Camp Verde to visit his brother's grave, but discovers the empty graves of his entire tribe before being violently attacked by the [[Demon Bear]]. Just as he's about to be killed, Warpath is saved by [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], who offers to teach him how to kill a demon. After engaging the Demon Bear in battle once more, Ghost Rider realizes the demon is reacting to pain caused by a dagger embedded in its body. Once Warpath removes the dagger, the demon is revealed to be the spirit guides of Warpath's tribe, corrupted by the black magic of the dagger. These spirits grant Warpath a vision that reveals the history of the man responsible for digging up the graves of his tribe: Eli Bard. Warpath returns home and tells X-Force what the spirits showed him, which ends with the revelation that Eli is using the Technarch Transmode Virus to revive dead mutants as an offering to his queen, [[Selene (comics)|Selene]].<ref>X-Force #11</ref>\n\nSoon after, [[Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]] mysteriously dies after losing control of her powers and killing hundreds of civilians. Cyclops realizes this was likely caused by the mutated Legacy Virus, and assembles X-Force to deal with the situation. Cyclops also reveals he's in the process of tracking down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and gives each of them a time-travel device that will be remotely activated when [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] determines Cable's exact location in the timestream. [[Morlocks (comics)|Fever Pitch]] loses control of his powers soon after, resulting in a similar massacre. While escaping the explosion, Archangel spots the Leper Queen and informs Cyclops. Once [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] and [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] are kidnapped, the Stepford Cuckoos use [[Cerebro|Cerebra]] to track them down. Hellion and Surge are injected with the altered Legacy Virus and teleported out just as X-Force storm the Leper Queen's base. As Wolverine questions the Leper Queen, Cyclops informs him that Cable has been found and X-Force is being sent after him. Despite Wolverine's protests, Cyclops activates the time-travel devices, sending X-Force forward in time before they can kill the Leper Queen.<ref>X-Force #12\u201313</ref>\n\n====Messiah War====\n{{See also|Messiah War}}\nX-Force is involuntarily sent to the future to retrieve [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Hope. The landscape is a barren, ravaged area, and the team quickly encounters danger. [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] has been defeated, and [[Stryfe]] controls this future. X-Force and Cable struggle to save Hope from Bishop and Stryfe.\n\n====Not Forgotten====\n''Not Forgotten'' takes place directly after X-Force's return to the present. X-23 emerges from the timestream just in time to save [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]] from being killed by the [[Leper Queen]]. Seconds after she kills the Leper Queen, both she and Boom-Boom are taken into custody by agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. At the United Nations, Hellion and Surge are rescued from the Sapien League by Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir. Boom-Boom is freed from H.A.M.M.E.R. custody by Warpath, while X-23 is returned to The Facility. She wakes up to find her left arm severed by [[Kimura (character)|Kimura]], wielding a chain saw. Before she can cut off the right arm, Kimura is shot by Agent Morales. Agent Young is revealed to be a member of The Facility that infiltrated H.A.M.M.E.R. to acquire the intel that Morales had on X-23. When Young tries to recruit Morales into The Facility, she rejects his offer by beating him unconscious. In the present, X-23 and Morales make their way to a Facility lab that holds mass amounts of the chemical trigger that forces X-23 to kill. While inside the room, X-23 cuts the claws out of her severed arm and gives them to Morales for safekeeping. She lights a Molotov cocktail of sorts which sets the sprinkler system off. The Facility soldiers finish cutting through to Laura just as Kimura realizes the sprinklers are spraying the Trigger Scent everywhere. X-23 goes feral and kills all the soldiers in her way. She gets to the Facility head's office just as the sprinklers start spraying water, washing away the scent. Kimura manages to club Laura from behind and then kills the Facility head, planning on framing Laura for it. Agent Morales arrives and sets Kimura on fire to distract her while she and Laura make her escape. Morales reveals she rigged the place to explode and they get out in time. The rest of X-Force arrives and takes Laura and her severed claws home, leading into the events of Necrosha.\n\n====Necrosha====\n{{main|Necrosha}}\nX-Force is involved in the battle against Selene's resurrected mutant forces on Utopia, until Cyclops sends them to Genosha to kill Selene.\n\nThey arrive at Necrosha and manage to rescue Warpath, who then leads them in battle against a god-like Selene, and manage to kill her using an old ritual of Warpath's tribe. Wolverine tells Cyclops that Warpath, X-23, Wolfsbane and Elixir are out of the team, but Cyclops insists that X-Force will be needed more than ever in the time ahead.\n\n====X-Men: Second Coming====\n{{main|X-Men: Second Coming}}\nX-Force is joined by Cable and Cypher on a time-traveling mission to stop an invasion of Nimrods sent from a possible dystopian future. As Cable only has one use remaining on his time-traveling device, it is believed to be a one-way suicide mission. After they complete their mission and Cable sacrifices himself to return X-Force to the present, Hope's mutant powers emerge and she destroys Bastion. After the battle, Logan is confronted by Storm about X-Force. She tells Logan that he never should have involved James, Rahne and Laura, and Logan tells her that he never wanted them involved, but doesn't regret what they did. Logan tells Laura that she's out and to figure out what she wants from life. Afterward, Logan discusses the future of X-Force with Cyclops, who decides to disband the team. Logan meets with his new team a short time later, consisting of himself, Archangel, Fantomex, Psylocke and Deadpool, deciding to run a new X-Force team without the knowledge of Cyclops or the other X-Men.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Volume 4===\n====Dirty/Tricks====\nThe new X-force consists of Cable, Marrow (who despite losing her powers during M-Day is repowered using a psychic headband), Psylocke, Fantomex, and Dr. Nemesis. They are investigating an explosion in Alexandria that put Hope Summers into a coma and find a new mutant nicknamed Meme, since she can only communicate through computers, as her body is comatose. They discover Russian billionaire Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga is behind Alexandria explosion and the kidnapping. He has been kidnapping mutants and supercharging them with kinetic energy and making them into human bombs. While in Paris, they pretend to kill a mutant that can read the minds of cats, so the French secret mutant forces, Le Bureaus Discret, will come to investigate, then they kidnap Le Necrogateur, a mutant that can read the minds of the deceased. Using his powers they find Volga's headquarters and that Volga found a mutant that can teleport between dimensions. Threatening the death of his family, they force the teleporting mutant to bring back a powerful weapon from Earth 1287, that creates super soldiers but greatly decreases their lifespan. During the attack on Volga's base Marrow discovers that she was pregnant during M-Day and volunteered to get her powers back, but at the cost of her pregnancy. She has a mental breakdown and X-Force is captured. It seems all is lost when Cable is super-charged and blown up by Volga. It turns out that Cable was present at Alexandria and it was him and Hope that caused the explosion when he was supercharged by Volga's henchman. Hope mimicked his powers and the chemicals caused her to fall into a coma. Cable survived the explosions since he wasn't really there\u2014Dr. Nemesis keeps Cable locked in stasis and creates a clone of him everyday and uploads his memories. The Cable and Dr. Nemesis attack Volga's base again and teleports his supercharged henchmen into outer space and then Volga seems to commit suicide by super-charging himself and killing the Cable clone again, but Marrow creates a bone shield to protect the team. Volga's spirit survives the explosion and another Cable clone emerges from the X-Force base to mourn over Hope, who was able to manifest herself in a digital avatar by copying the powers of a brain-dead mutant, Meme. Psylocke is able to discover the switch with her psychic powers, but promises Hope that she won't tell Cable.\n\n====Hide/Fear====\nCable and the X-Force who have barely survived their ordeal with Volga, track a team of British special forces into the desert. The team is tracking terrorists known as the Quaddees. It turns out Volga sold his tech to both the British and the Quaddees. X-Force begins abducting the team, but are attacked by [[Pete Wisdom]], [[Meggan]], and [[Faiza Hussain|Excalibur]] from [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]].<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 8</ref> Soon the Quaddees kidnap one member of the team, so the three groups decide to work together. Psylocke is able to find out that the super-powered British Special forces team will all die soon from Volga's tech, so the team sacrifices themselves so MI-13 and X-Force can escape. They also learn that there's a secret organization called the Yellow Eye spying on all mutants,<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 9</ref> who also kidnapped Domino.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 7</ref> This series also [[retcon]]s multiple X-Men backstories with the introduction of ForgetMeNot. His power is to immediately be forgotten by anybody who speaks with him and to be completely unnoticed by people around him unless he acknowledges them. Only Xavier knows of his existence\u2014even setting a psychic alarm clock to check in with ForgetMeNot every hour to remind him somebody remembers him. He hangs around the X-Mansion repelling attackers and saving the X-Men multiple times, without them realizing it and blaming it on dumb luck or [[deus ex machina]].<ref>X-Men Legacy Issue #300</ref> Dr. Nemesis, using an algorithm based on blurs in camera footage and missing toilet paper at the X-Mansion creates a teleporter to bring ForgetMeNot to the X-Force base on an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The team has great difficulty catching ForgetMeNot, since whenever he hides they forgot about him then take a coffee break, where a prerecorded video by Dr. Nemesis plays reminding them to find ForgetMeNot. This turns into a viscous cycle, almost like a [[time loop]], until ForgetMeNot realizes that he was brought here to trick the Yellow Eye spybots (which look like tiny gnats) into allowing himself to be tracked, place a reverse tracking beacon on one and then the drone will forget him immediately and not self-destruct. This plan works; however, Fantomex then kills ForgetMeNot. Stating that he knew about him all the time since he has three brains and nanobots in his brain. Fantomex says he does it because he is evil and bored. The ships cleaning bots sweep away ForgetMeNot's body and Dr. Nemesis forgets speaking with him and assumes he figured out how to track the spybots on his own.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 10</ref>\n\n====Ends/Means====\nThe team attacks the Yellow Eye base, but during the battle Meme/Hope Summers hacks into Fantomex's consciousness, thanks to his nanobot brain, in order to learn why he broke up with her. He then reveals that he knew Hope Summers was posing as Meme. He then betrays the team and plans to use the Yellow Eye tracking technology to find his missing clones (Cluster and Weapon XIII).<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11</ref> Luckily, it turns out Domino was brainwashed by the Yellow Eye, but Meme was able to hack into her and free her. She then shoots Fantomex in the head.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\"/> It turns out Yellow Eye is actually [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], who reveals that Meme is actually Hope Summers to the rest of the team. Cable debates using the Yellow Eye Technology, but Psylocke wants the facility destroyed. They don't have time to debate since the second clone of Cable was already at the facility with Dr. Nemesis tracking Volga during the prior fight. The team doesn't have time to debate the morality since Fantomex was able to recode Volga's super virus code when he died and E.V.A. reloaded the virus to give her unlimited superpowers.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12</ref> However, since his mind is still mechanical Meme hacked into him making him think he killed the team, while they actually escaped.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13</ref> Back at the base Cable tricks Fantomex into fighting him, but is actually getting Fantomex to destroy various spy agencies and evil organizations. ForgetMeNot also reveals himself to Hope Summers and explains that the original Meme is still alive and saved him by transferring his consciousness and then repaired his body with the ships clean up bots. He reveals that Meme is actually dying, and once she dies Hope will not be able to copy Meme's powers and communicate with the team using her hacking powers.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\"/> After Meme dies, ForgetMeNot reveals himself to the team and asks Marrow to touch Hope's body, then Hopes copies Marrow's healing factor and is able to temporarily heal herself enough to play a video showing how Cable has been manipulating the team. ForgetMeNot then pushes Psylocke into Hope, who then copies her psychic powers and reveals to the team her troubles childhood and how despite Cable saving her life by traveling between dimensions, she has outgrown him morally and doesn't look up to him. Marrow then kills the Cable clone. Hope also revealed their location to Fantomex, who is on his way to kill them.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14</ref> The team doesn't think they have a chance at stopping him, but Hope has a plan that will only work if they act as a team. Domino and Psylocke distract Fantomex while ForgetMeNot sneaks up to him and teleports him to Hope, who copies his super-powers, as well as the entire teams. She releases all the Cable clones against Fantomex.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\"/> Hope, using Dr. Nemesis's super intellect, then figures out that Fantomex doesn't believe he is imperfect, but reveals to him that perfect requires cracks and inadequacies and perfection is really being a team. Fantomex cannot comprehend this and has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psi-blade to scramble his mind. The team later reveals they \"fired\" Cable from the team.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15</ref>\n\n==''X-Force'' roster==\n\n===Volume 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"   \n|- \n!Issues !!

[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Fan Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for 1997.\n\n==The original X-Force==\nBefore the team best known as X-Force debuted, Marvel introduced an unrelated, little-known group also called X-Force. It was a short-lived group that was designed to replace [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. The members were not mutants, but received their powers artificially and were named after the X-Men. This group was organized by a government agency known as M Branch and only appeared in the pages of ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' #9\u201310 (1990).\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the alternate reality of the \"Days of Future Now\" storyline, the X-Force consists of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Black Tom Cassidy]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]] and [[Omega Red]].\n\nIn X-Men '92, X-Force members are: Cable, Domino, Deadpool, Psylocke, Archangel and Bishop.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Animation===\nX-Force is mentioned for the first time outside of the comics in the [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. In the second episode, [[Professor X]] briefly mentions that X-Force has encountered the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]]. No other information is given about the team, other than that they gave the X-Men all their intel about the villains.\n\nIn an early episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' the duo vandalize their neighbor's house by painting \"X-FORCE RULES\" on it.\n\n===Film===\n{{main|X-Men (film series)#Abandoned films}}\n[[20th Century Fox]] are developing a film version of ''X-Force''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/xforce-movie-in-the-works/|title='X-Force' movie in the works at Fox.|date=11 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whois.com/whois/x-forcemovie.com|title=Whois x-forcemovie.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/07/12/fox-to-use-comic-con-as-launching-pad-for-wider-x-men-universe-x-force-film-included/|title=Fox To Use Comic-Con As Launching Pad For Wider X-Men Movie Universe, X-Force Film Included|date=12 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> On July 11, 2013, it was reported that [[Jeff Wadlow]] has been hired to write and direct the adaptation.

All team members except Deadpool and Domino are killed off one by one, in humorously grisly fashion, briefly after the start of their very first mission, when they parachute into such obstacles as a bus (Bedlam), helicopter blades (Shatterstar), a wood-chipper (Zeitgeist), electric cables (the Vanisher) and being vomited on by Zeitgeist's mutant acid vomit (Peter). In the [[post-credits scene]], however, Deadpool uses Cable's time-travel device to travel back in time and successfully prevents Peter, who he has come to like, from meeting his gruesome end.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Deadpool 2'' in May 2018, co-writer [[Rhett Reese]] confirmed the ''X-Force'' movie will be an R-rated take on [[X-Men]] and will have \"all the sex, violence, and silliness one would expect from the Deadpool-skewed militarized mutant force\". Reese said \"they can get their hands dirty a little bit. There's more gray area. It'll be raunchier, it'll be rated R, I'm sure. We'll get to see an ensemble movie that's pushed, hopefully, as far as the Deadpool individual movie was pushed.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Jacob Oller|title=X-FORCE WILL BE R-RATED, 'RAUNCHIER' TAKE ON X-MEN SAYS DEADPOOL 2 WRITER|date=2018-05-18|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/x-force-will-be-r-rated-raunchier-take-on-x-men-says-deadpool-2-writer?__source=Blastr_Vayner_syfy_Facebook|accessdate=2018-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2019, Lauren Shuler Donner revealed that ''X-Force'', as well as the rest of the Fox Marvel films, were \"on hold\" until the Disney-Fox deal went through.\n\n===Video games===\nThe team (consisting of Domino, Fantomex and Archangel) appear in Deadpool's ending in ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''. They are shown celebrating Deadpool's victory over [[Galactus]] alongside Cable, [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]] and several Capcom characters.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nIn April 2010, the popular Web comic [[Homestar Runner]] featured a parody titled ''Xeriouxly Forxe'', in which all of the site's main characters except Homsar were re-designed to look like X-Men.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.com/comics/X-Men X-Men comics on Marvel.com]\n*[http://www.milehighcomics.com/firstlook/marvel/xforce1/ ''X-Force,'' vol. 2

[[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Conceived by writer/illustrator [[Rob Liefeld]], the team first appeared in ''[[New Mutants#New Mutants Vol. 1|New Mutants]]'' #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series called ''X-Force''. The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team, the [[New Mutants]].\n\nX-Force's first leader was the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. An offshoot of the [[X-Men]], X-Force takes a more [[Militant (word)|militant]] and aggressive approach towards its enemies compared to the X-Men.\n\nAn alternate incarnation of X-Force appears in the 2018 film ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' as part of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]. A planned X-Force film adaption by [[20th Century Fox]] was in production as of 2018; however, as of now production was stopped after [[Disney]] bought 20th Century Fox.\n\n==Publication history==\n===Publication===\nThe ''X-Force'' series was successful in the early 1990s, but its popularity waned after Liefeld left, which caused Marvel to implement several reforms to the title from 1995 until 2001 with varying degrees of success. Low sales on the ''X-Force'' series eventually prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self-interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X-Force. ''X-Force'' was canceled with #129 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]],'' which coincided with a similar rebranding of the team in the story. After ''X-Statix'' was canceled with #26, Marvel reunited the original X-Force team for a six-issue 2004 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] plotted and drawn by Liefeld.\n\nIn 2007\u20132008, during the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]], a new version of the X-Force team was formed with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] leading a more militaristic [[black ops]] branch of the X-Men. This squad would form the basis for a new X-Force series starting February 2008 by writers [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]], plus [[Clayton Crain]] as the artist. The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the [[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]] storyline that ran through various X-titles. The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' with [[Rick Remender]] and [[Jerome Ope\u00f1a]] as the creative team and Wolverine, [[Psylocke]], [[Deadpool]], [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Fantomex]], and [[Fantomex|E.V.A.]] as the initial roster.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/comics/news/a243865/marvel-reveals-uncanny-x-force-team.html |title=Comics \u2013 News \u2013 Marvel reveals 'Uncanny X-Force' team |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Uncanny X-Force'' series ended at issue #35 in 2012 and was once again relaunched as ''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 as part of [[Marvel NOW!]], with a new team led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and Psylocke, written by Sam Humphries. A concurrent X-Force book written by Dennis Hopeless, ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'', was released at the same time, bringing Cable back into the X-Force fold. The two series ended in 2014 after a crossover between the two titled \"Vendetta\". A new ''X-Force'' (vol. 4), was launched featuring a black ops squad composed of Cable, Psylocke, Fantomex and [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], written by ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' writer [[Simon Spurrier]].<ref name=\"ComicBookResources\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48983 |title=Spurrier, Kim's Adjectiveless \"X-Force\" Launches in February |publisher=ComicBookResources |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 1: 1991\u20132001===\n\n====Liefeld period====\nX-Force was created by illustrator Rob Liefeld after he started penciling ''[[The New Mutants]]'' comic book in 1989 with #86. The popularity of Liefeld's art led to him taking over the plotting duties on the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} With help from writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], who provided the dialogue for Liefeld's plots, Liefeld transformed the New Mutants into X-Force in ''New Mutants'' #100, the book's final issue. Liefeld and Nicieza launched ''X-Force'' in August 1991. Rob Liefeld obtained the name for the series from an unknown artist at a convention a few months prior to its release. With the aid of a multiple-variant poly-bagged card, the book sold a record 5 million copies{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, and remains the second-highest selling American comic book of all time, surpassed only by Jim Lee's X-Men book that same summer with 8 million copies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The original line-up of the team included [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] (Son of Cyclops and Jean grey), [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] (believed to be an External), [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] (sister of  Thornn of X-Factor), [[Shatterstar]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] (Brother of Thunderbird of the X-men); [[Siryn]] (Daughter of Banshee of the X-men) was added to the team in the third issue.\n\nThe main opponents of X-Force during its first year were the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[Mutant Liberation Front]], led by [[Stryfe]], a masked mutant with a mysterious link to Cable. Early issues also featured the wise-cracking mercenary [[Deadpool]], the immortal [[Externals]], and a new version of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].\n\nPropelled by Liefeld's art, ''X-Force'' became one of Marvel's bestselling comic books immediately after its debut. The series rivaled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''Uncanny X-Men'' in popularity, particularly with the adolescent demographic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Toy Biz]] responded to X-Force's popularity by introducing an X-Force action figure line alongside its X-Men action figure line. Liefeld illustrated the series up to #9 and stopped plotting it after #11, as he had become increasingly frustrated with not owning characters he created and that his art was being used on a variety of [[Product (business)|merchandise]] while he allegedly received little [[royalties]]. Along with six other popular Marvel artists, Liefeld left Marvel Comics in 1992 to form [[Image Comics]].\n\n====Nicieza period====\n''X-Force'' continued with Nicieza taking over creative control of the series. Nicieza soon had the team break away from Cable and moved them to a new base in the ruins of Warpath's childhood home at the Camp Verde reservation; he also had former New Mutants [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Rictor]] join the team. The series crossed over with most other X-Men related books in the fall of 1992 with the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' storyline, co-plotted by Nicieza (who was also writing ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men vol. 2]]''). In that story, Stryfe frames Cable for an assassination attempt on the X-Men's founder [[Professor X]], leading to a clash between the X-Men and X-Force. The crossover boosted Cable's popularity, despite the character's apparent death in ''X-Force'' #18, leading to his own solo series being launched in 1993.\n\nAfter ''X-Cutioner's Song'', ''X-Force'' continued under Nicieza with new artist [[Greg Capullo]]. With Cannonball taking over as leader, X-Force develop an identity of their own as an independent team. Cable would return in the ''Fatal Attractions'' crossover, with a less hardline leadership stance. Capullo departed from the series at this point, first succeeded by Matt Broome and then [[Tony Daniel]]. The team grew into a dysfunctional family, and the title regularly combined soap opera plot threads, such as romance and Siryn's alcoholism, with violent action. Nicieza fleshed out previously unknown elements of each character's history, including Siryn's family in Ireland,<ref>''X-Force'' #31 (February 1994)</ref> Rictor's in Mexico,<ref>''X-Force'' #34 (May 1994)</ref> Cannonball's in Kentucky,<ref>''X-Force'' #37 (August 1994)</ref> and Shatterstar's in Mojoworld.<ref>''X-Force'' #29\u201330 (December 1993 \u2013 January 1994)</ref> This period also saw reappearances of characters from the group's New Mutants days, such as [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]],<ref>''X-Force'' #24 (July 1993)</ref> [[Danielle Moonstar]],<ref>''X-Force'' #27 & 43 and ''X-Force 1994 Annual''<!--dates needed--></ref> and [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]].<ref>''X-Force'' #38 (September 1994)</ref> In issue #40 the team moved to a new underground base beneath Manhattan, formerly belonging to the supervillain Arcade. A long-simmering sub-plot about [[Reignfire]] and the disappearance of Sunspot came to a climax just as the book went on hiatus for the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' crossover event in 1995, ending on a cliffhanger.\n\n====Loeb period====\n''X-Force'' was radically overhauled in the wake of ''Age of Apocalypse'' from issue #44, with a new creative team of writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and illustrator [[Adam Pollina]]. The in-progress Reignfire story was apparently resolved off-panel between issues, and the team's Manhattan base was abruptly blown up in the ''X-Men Prime'' one-shot special. As part of a general editorial push to more closely integrate the various X-Men books, Loeb had the team move in with the X-Men at the [[X-Mansion]] and effectively become the X-Men's junior team, complete with introducing new uniforms modelled on the X-Men. Loeb's first issue also saw Cannonball and Rictor written out of the series, with Cannonball \u201cgraduating\u201d to the X-Men and Rictor quitting; [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a super-strong [[albinism|albino]] mutant who possessed the mind of a child, joined the team. Stories in this period generally toned down the series' levels of action and violence. The character Boomer (formerly Boom-Boom) also changed her codename to Meltdown and adopted a new aggressive attitude. Loeb's final story, the three-part ''Shatterstar Saga'', brought Rictor back to the team; it also ambiguously retconned Shatterstar's origins in a manner that was generally regarded as unnecessarily confusing.\n\n====Moore period====\nIn 1997, writer [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] took over the series and began revisiting plot developments that had been left ignored throughout Loeb's run, including Dani Moonstar infiltrating the MLF and the true perpetrator of the Camp Verde massacre. Following the ''Operation Zero Tolerance'' storyline, the team effectively disbanded in issue #70, and Cable, Caliban, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar were written out of the series. The next year's worth of issues followed the remaining cast members Meltdown, Siryn, Sunspot, Warpath and Danielle Moonstar on a road trip across America. During this time James Proudstar was able to get closure on the massacre of his tribe, and subsequently stopped using the codename Warpath. The Reignfire story was also followed up on, with a new and more complete explanation for what had actually happened during Sunspot's disappearance. Former team members Cable, Cannonball, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar all made one-off reappearances, as did New Mutants characters Karma and Skids.\n\nIn 1998, Moore and new artist [[Jim Cheung]] had X-Force move into new headquarters in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], returned Cannonball and later Domino to the team, and added [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]], a mutant who could disrupt electronic equipment; they also gained a new ally in sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]]. A new major antagonist came to prominence in the Damocles Foundation, an organisation founded by rogue Deviants, Eternals and humans. Former New Mutant Magma also reappeared as an antagonist. Dani Moonstar acquired new superpowers, being able to manipulate quantum energies. Towards the end of the run, Siryn and Sunspot left the team and continued as recurring guests. The 1999 annual centred around Rictor and Shatterstar, showing what they had been doing since leaving the team together.\n\nSales steadily declined throughout this period, falling from selling over 100,000 copies per issue<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/1996/1996-12.html</ref> to between forty and fifty thousand by the end of Moore's run with issue #100.<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2000/2000-01.html</ref> A similar sales decline was observed in other ancillary X-Men titles including ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man''.\n\n====Counter-X====\nWriter [[Warren Ellis]], known for his dark, cynical style, was put in charge of revamping ''X-Force'' along with ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man'' under the branding '''Counter-X''', as part of the '''[[Revolution (Marvel Comics)|Revolution]]''' revamp of the various X-Men titles in 2000. Ellis' stint on ''X-Force'' over issues #102\u2013115, co-written by [[Ian Edginton]] and illustrated by [[Whilce Portacio]], saw Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown, and Warpath become a [[Covert operation|covert ops]] superhero team under the leadership of [[Pete Wisdom]], a British mutant and former intelligence agent who could shoot burning blades of energy from his fingers. Despite the changes in creators, sales continued to decline at the same rate.<ref>[http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 CBGXtra.com \u2013 Comics Sales Charts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027110315/http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 |date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref> The run concluded with Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown and Warpath all appearing to die in an explosion, although all were revealed to be alive soon after.\n\nIn early 2001, the ''X-Force'' title was completely reimagined by writer [[Peter Milligan]] and artist [[Mike Allred]], who replaced the existing incarnation of the team with an entirely different group of mutants using the X-Force name. Issue #116 saw the introduction of a new, sardonically toned X-Force consisting of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants put together and marketed to be media superstars. ''X-Force'' was canceled with issue #129 in late 2002 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]]'' in late 2002.\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 2: 2004-2005===\nIn 2004, Marvel released a new six-issue ''X-Force''. Some controversy arose from Liefeld's insertion of over ten pages from previous unpublished comic books (''Weapon X'' and ''Cable: First Contact'') with word balloons edited to make them fit the ''X-Force'' storyline.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} It was subsequently followed with a four-issue prequel ''X-Force: Shatterstar'' [[miniseries]].\n\n[[Image:X-Force-1-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''X-Force'' vol. 3, #1 (April 2008); art by [[Clayton Crain]]]]\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 3: 2008\u20132010===\nA new ''X-Force'' ongoing series was launched in February 2008, written by [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]] and drawn by [[Clayton Crain]].\n\n[[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] forms a black ops incarnation of X-Force that uses lethal force to permanently deal with threats against mutants.

Yost had at one point stated that Deadpool would join the cast to bring more diversity to the team, but this did not happen until after his run and the launch of Uncanny X-Force.

The trail leads back to the Purifiers, led by [[Matthew Risman]] and the mysterious [[Eli Bard]]. They attach Bastion's head to the body of a Nimrod unit, to use the revived Bastion in their \"holy war\" against mutantkind. Bastion retrieves an offspring of the technarch [[Magus (Marvel Comics)|Magus]] from the ocean floor and revives several deceased X-Men villains, including [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Graydon Creed]], by infecting their corpses with the Technarch Transmode Virus. The virus allows Bastion a degree of mental control over the revived corpses. He also infects two living subjects with the virus: [[Donald Pierce]] and the [[Leper Queen]].\n\nDuring X-Force's raid on a Purifer base, Risman holds Wolfsbane hostage. While Wolverine calls for the team to stand down, X-23 decides Risman is bluffing and activates a concealed detonator that sets off a series of powerful explosives. The explosion brings most of the base down around them, but Risman is able to escape with Wolfsbane during the chaos. Wolverine later admonishes Laura for being so reckless with the lives of her teammates and for allowing Rahne to be kidnapped. After interrogating and killing numerous Purifiers, X-Force finds Rahne held in a warehouse, barely alive. Angel retrieves Elixir to heal Rahne, who wakes up soon after. Laura then catches the scent of Elixir's and Angel's blood, and runs off to help them. She reaches the room just in time to see Wolfsbane standing above Angel with his severed wings in her jaws. While in the Purifiers' custody, Rahne had been brainwashed by her deranged father, Reverend Craig, causing her to go berserk at the sight of an angelic figure. Wolfsbane savagely attacks Laura before handing over Angel's wings to the Purifiers.\n\nElixir heals both his and Angel's wounds, then discovers that Angel's wings aren't organic and can't be regrown. Angel transforms into [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], complete with metallic wings. Archangel wounds Wolverine and X-23 before taking off toward the Purifiers' base, sensing his old wings. Meanwhile, the Purifiers use samples of Angel's stolen wings to develop techno-organic wings for their soldiers, giving them similar abilities to Archangel. The group of Purifiers given wings is dubbed \"The Choir\". X-Force pursues Archangel to the Purifiers' base and slaughters most of The Choir, while Risman discovers Eli Bard absorbing the Technarch offspring into his hand. X-23 kills Risman with a headshot, and briefly fights Eli. Eli overpowers her, but is prevented from killing her when Warpath stabs him, causing him to flee. Wolverine takes on Bastion, who deems the threat posed by Wolverine \"unacceptable\" and retreats. Afterwards, X-Force finds Archangel unconscious and in human form, complete with feathered wings. Wolverine informs Cyclops of the turn of events, and Cyclops asks which of X-Force's targets should be next.<ref>X-Force #1\u20136</ref>\n\n====Old Ghosts====\nOnce X-Force regroups at Angel's Aerie, they test the reactions of Rahne and Angel to one another. Rahne reverts to full feral form upon seeing Angel, who responds by transforming into Archangel. Wolverine and Elixir restrain Wolfsbane while Cyclops talks down Archangel, who has trouble controlling his Apocalypse-like mentality while in his transformed state. Laura calls in the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] to erase Elixir's memories of X-Force, to help them remain covert. Before they do so, Angel informs them of a live telecast featuring Graydon Creed, who claims an L.M.D. was assassinated in his place and publicly denounces mutants once more. Cyclops assembles X-Force, including Elixir, and unexpectedly declares the Vanisher as their next target.\n\nIt is revealed that [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], a former Marauder, contacted Cyclops about a break-in at an old lab of [[Mister Sinister]]'s that held an altered version of the [[Legacy Virus]]. While in pursuit of the Vanisher, the team runs into Domino, who joins forces with them to recover the Legacy Virus. After cornering Vanisher and inducing an inoperable brain tumor (courtesy of Elixir) to ensure his cooperation, Vanisher reveals he lost the virus while escaping from a horde of Marauder clones that were awakened after the death of Sinister. X-Force returns to the lab and kill the cloned Marauders inside. Domino retrieves the virus, only to be confronted by [[The Right (comics)|The Right]]'s shocktroopers, who have come to take the virus for themselves. X-23 is injected with the virus while doing battle, and runs toward a nearby molten vat to destroy herself (thus destroying the virus). Elixir catches Laura as she jumps, and uses his healing powers to purge her of the virus, declaring that his purpose in X-Force is to ensure no more of his friends will die. With Vanisher in tow, X-Force returns home.<ref>X-Force #7\u201310</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Warpath returns to his tribe's reservation at Camp Verde to visit his brother's grave, but discovers the empty graves of his entire tribe before being violently attacked by the [[Demon Bear]]. Just as he's about to be killed, Warpath is saved by [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], who offers to teach him how to kill a demon. After engaging the Demon Bear in battle once more, Ghost Rider realizes the demon is reacting to pain caused by a dagger embedded in its body. Once Warpath removes the dagger, the demon is revealed to be the spirit guides of Warpath's tribe, corrupted by the black magic of the dagger. These spirits grant Warpath a vision that reveals the history of the man responsible for digging up the graves of his tribe: Eli Bard. Warpath returns home and tells X-Force what the spirits showed him, which ends with the revelation that Eli is using the Technarch Transmode Virus to revive dead mutants as an offering to his queen, [[Selene (comics)|Selene]].<ref>X-Force #11</ref>\n\nSoon after, [[Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]] mysteriously dies after losing control of her powers and killing hundreds of civilians. Cyclops realizes this was likely caused by the mutated Legacy Virus, and assembles X-Force to deal with the situation. Cyclops also reveals he's in the process of tracking down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and gives each of them a time-travel device that will be remotely activated when [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] determines Cable's exact location in the timestream. [[Morlocks (comics)|Fever Pitch]] loses control of his powers soon after, resulting in a similar massacre. While escaping the explosion, Archangel spots the Leper Queen and informs Cyclops. Once [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] and [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] are kidnapped, the Stepford Cuckoos use [[Cerebro|Cerebra]] to track them down. Hellion and Surge are injected with the altered Legacy Virus and teleported out just as X-Force storm the Leper Queen's base. As Wolverine questions the Leper Queen, Cyclops informs him that Cable has been found and X-Force is being sent after him. Despite Wolverine's protests, Cyclops activates the time-travel devices, sending X-Force forward in time before they can kill the Leper Queen.<ref>X-Force #12\u201313</ref>\n\n====Messiah War====\n{{See also|Messiah War}}\nX-Force is involuntarily sent to the future to retrieve [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Hope. The landscape is a barren, ravaged area, and the team quickly encounters danger. [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] has been defeated, and [[Stryfe]] controls this future. X-Force and Cable struggle to save Hope from Bishop and Stryfe.\n\n====Not Forgotten====\n''Not Forgotten'' takes place directly after X-Force's return to the present. X-23 emerges from the timestream just in time to save [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]] from being killed by the [[Leper Queen]]. Seconds after she kills the Leper Queen, both she and Boom-Boom are taken into custody by agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. At the United Nations, Hellion and Surge are rescued from the Sapien League by Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir. Boom-Boom is freed from H.A.M.M.E.R. custody by Warpath, while X-23 is returned to The Facility. She wakes up to find her left arm severed by [[Kimura (character)|Kimura]], wielding a chain saw. Before she can cut off the right arm, Kimura is shot by Agent Morales. Agent Young is revealed to be a member of The Facility that infiltrated H.A.M.M.E.R. to acquire the intel that Morales had on X-23. When Young tries to recruit Morales into The Facility, she rejects his offer by beating him unconscious. In the present, X-23 and Morales make their way to a Facility lab that holds mass amounts of the chemical trigger that forces X-23 to kill. While inside the room, X-23 cuts the claws out of her severed arm and gives them to Morales for safekeeping. She lights a Molotov cocktail of sorts which sets the sprinkler system off. The Facility soldiers finish cutting through to Laura just as Kimura realizes the sprinklers are spraying the Trigger Scent everywhere. X-23 goes feral and kills all the soldiers in her way. She gets to the Facility head's office just as the sprinklers start spraying water, washing away the scent. Kimura manages to club Laura from behind and then kills the Facility head, planning on framing Laura for it. Agent Morales arrives and sets Kimura on fire to distract her while she and Laura make her escape. Morales reveals she rigged the place to explode and they get out in time. The rest of X-Force arrives and takes Laura and her severed claws home, leading into the events of Necrosha.\n\n====Necrosha====\n{{main|Necrosha}}\nX-Force is involved in the battle against Selene's resurrected mutant forces on Utopia, until Cyclops sends them to Genosha to kill Selene.\n\nThey arrive at Necrosha and manage to rescue Warpath, who then leads them in battle against a god-like Selene, and manage to kill her using an old ritual of Warpath's tribe. Wolverine tells Cyclops that Warpath, X-23, Wolfsbane and Elixir are out of the team, but Cyclops insists that X-Force will be needed more than ever in the time ahead.\n\n====X-Men: Second Coming====\n{{main|X-Men: Second Coming}}\nX-Force is joined by Cable and Cypher on a time-traveling mission to stop an invasion of Nimrods sent from a possible dystopian future. As Cable only has one use remaining on his time-traveling device, it is believed to be a one-way suicide mission. After they complete their mission and Cable sacrifices himself to return X-Force to the present, Hope's mutant powers emerge and she destroys Bastion. After the battle, Logan is confronted by Storm about X-Force. She tells Logan that he never should have involved James, Rahne and Laura, and Logan tells her that he never wanted them involved, but doesn't regret what they did. Logan tells Laura that she's out and to figure out what she wants from life. Afterward, Logan discusses the future of X-Force with Cyclops, who decides to disband the team. Logan meets with his new team a short time later, consisting of himself, Archangel, Fantomex, Psylocke and Deadpool, deciding to run a new X-Force team without the knowledge of Cyclops or the other X-Men.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Volume 4===\n====Dirty/Tricks====\nThe new X-force consists of Cable, Marrow (who despite losing her powers during M-Day is repowered using a psychic headband), Psylocke, Fantomex, and Dr. Nemesis. They are investigating an explosion in Alexandria that put Hope Summers into a coma and find a new mutant nicknamed Meme, since she can only communicate through computers, as her body is comatose. They discover Russian billionaire Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga is behind Alexandria explosion and the kidnapping. He has been kidnapping mutants and supercharging them with kinetic energy and making them into human bombs. While in Paris, they pretend to kill a mutant that can read the minds of cats, so the French secret mutant forces, Le Bureaus Discret, will come to investigate, then they kidnap Le Necrogateur, a mutant that can read the minds of the deceased. Using his powers they find Volga's headquarters and that Volga found a mutant that can teleport between dimensions. Threatening the death of his family, they force the teleporting mutant to bring back a powerful weapon from Earth 1287, that creates super soldiers but greatly decreases their lifespan. During the attack on Volga's base Marrow discovers that she was pregnant during M-Day and volunteered to get her powers back, but at the cost of her pregnancy. She has a mental breakdown and X-Force is captured. It seems all is lost when Cable is super-charged and blown up by Volga. It turns out that Cable was present at Alexandria and it was him and Hope that caused the explosion when he was supercharged by Volga's henchman. Hope mimicked his powers and the chemicals caused her to fall into a coma. Cable survived the explosions since he wasn't really there\u2014Dr. Nemesis keeps Cable locked in stasis and creates a clone of him everyday and uploads his memories. The Cable and Dr. Nemesis attack Volga's base again and teleports his supercharged henchmen into outer space and then Volga seems to commit suicide by super-charging himself and killing the Cable clone again, but Marrow creates a bone shield to protect the team. Volga's spirit survives the explosion and another Cable clone emerges from the X-Force base to mourn over Hope, who was able to manifest herself in a digital avatar by copying the powers of a brain-dead mutant, Meme. Psylocke is able to discover the switch with her psychic powers, but promises Hope that she won't tell Cable.\n\n====Hide/Fear====\nCable and the X-Force who have barely survived their ordeal with Volga, track a team of British special forces into the desert. The team is tracking terrorists known as the Quaddees. It turns out Volga sold his tech to both the British and the Quaddees. X-Force begins abducting the team, but are attacked by [[Pete Wisdom]], [[Meggan]], and [[Faiza Hussain|Excalibur]] from [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]].<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 8</ref> Soon the Quaddees kidnap one member of the team, so the three groups decide to work together. Psylocke is able to find out that the super-powered British Special forces team will all die soon from Volga's tech, so the team sacrifices themselves so MI-13 and X-Force can escape. They also learn that there's a secret organization called the Yellow Eye spying on all mutants,<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 9</ref> who also kidnapped Domino.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 7</ref> This series also [[retcon]]s multiple X-Men backstories with the introduction of ForgetMeNot. His power is to immediately be forgotten by anybody who speaks with him and to be completely unnoticed by people around him unless he acknowledges them. Only Xavier knows of his existence\u2014even setting a psychic alarm clock to check in with ForgetMeNot every hour to remind him somebody remembers him. He hangs around the X-Mansion repelling attackers and saving the X-Men multiple times, without them realizing it and blaming it on dumb luck or [[deus ex machina]].<ref>X-Men Legacy Issue #300</ref> Dr. Nemesis, using an algorithm based on blurs in camera footage and missing toilet paper at the X-Mansion creates a teleporter to bring ForgetMeNot to the X-Force base on an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The team has great difficulty catching ForgetMeNot, since whenever he hides they forgot about him then take a coffee break, where a prerecorded video by Dr. Nemesis plays reminding them to find ForgetMeNot. This turns into a viscous cycle, almost like a [[time loop]], until ForgetMeNot realizes that he was brought here to trick the Yellow Eye spybots (which look like tiny gnats) into allowing himself to be tracked, place a reverse tracking beacon on one and then the drone will forget him immediately and not self-destruct. This plan works; however, Fantomex then kills ForgetMeNot. Stating that he knew about him all the time since he has three brains and nanobots in his brain. Fantomex says he does it because he is evil and bored. The ships cleaning bots sweep away ForgetMeNot's body and Dr. Nemesis forgets speaking with him and assumes he figured out how to track the spybots on his own.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 10</ref>\n\n====Ends/Means====\nThe team attacks the Yellow Eye base, but during the battle Meme/Hope Summers hacks into Fantomex's consciousness, thanks to his nanobot brain, in order to learn why he broke up with her. He then reveals that he knew Hope Summers was posing as Meme. He then betrays the team and plans to use the Yellow Eye tracking technology to find his missing clones (Cluster and Weapon XIII).<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11</ref> Luckily, it turns out Domino was brainwashed by the Yellow Eye, but Meme was able to hack into her and free her. She then shoots Fantomex in the head.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\"/> It turns out Yellow Eye is actually [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], who reveals that Meme is actually Hope Summers to the rest of the team. Cable debates using the Yellow Eye Technology, but Psylocke wants the facility destroyed. They don't have time to debate since the second clone of Cable was already at the facility with Dr. Nemesis tracking Volga during the prior fight. The team doesn't have time to debate the morality since Fantomex was able to recode Volga's super virus code when he died and E.V.A. reloaded the virus to give her unlimited superpowers.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12</ref> However, since his mind is still mechanical Meme hacked into him making him think he killed the team, while they actually escaped.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13</ref> Back at the base Cable tricks Fantomex into fighting him, but is actually getting Fantomex to destroy various spy agencies and evil organizations. ForgetMeNot also reveals himself to Hope Summers and explains that the original Meme is still alive and saved him by transferring his consciousness and then repaired his body with the ships clean up bots. He reveals that Meme is actually dying, and once she dies Hope will not be able to copy Meme's powers and communicate with the team using her hacking powers.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\"/> After Meme dies, ForgetMeNot reveals himself to the team and asks Marrow to touch Hope's body, then Hopes copies Marrow's healing factor and is able to temporarily heal herself enough to play a video showing how Cable has been manipulating the team. ForgetMeNot then pushes Psylocke into Hope, who then copies her psychic powers and reveals to the team her troubles childhood and how despite Cable saving her life by traveling between dimensions, she has outgrown him morally and doesn't look up to him. Marrow then kills the Cable clone. Hope also revealed their location to Fantomex, who is on his way to kill them.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14</ref> The team doesn't think they have a chance at stopping him, but Hope has a plan that will only work if they act as a team. Domino and Psylocke distract Fantomex while ForgetMeNot sneaks up to him and teleports him to Hope, who copies his super-powers, as well as the entire teams. She releases all the Cable clones against Fantomex.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\"/> Hope, using Dr. Nemesis's super intellect, then figures out that Fantomex doesn't believe he is imperfect, but reveals to him that perfect requires cracks and inadequacies and perfection is really being a team. Fantomex cannot comprehend this and has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psi-blade to scramble his mind. The team later reveals they \"fired\" Cable from the team.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15</ref>\n\n==''X-Force'' roster==\n\n===Volume 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"   \n|- \n!Issues !!

[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Fan Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for 1997.\n\n==The original X-Force==\nBefore the team best known as X-Force debuted, Marvel introduced an unrelated, little-known group also called X-Force. It was a short-lived group that was designed to replace [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. The members were not mutants, but received their powers artificially and were named after the X-Men. This group was organized by a government agency known as M Branch and only appeared in the pages of ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' #9\u201310 (1990).\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the alternate reality of the \"Days of Future Now\" storyline, the X-Force consists of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Black Tom Cassidy]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]] and [[Omega Red]].\n\nIn X-Men '92, X-Force members are: Cable, Domino, Deadpool, Psylocke, Archangel and Bishop.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Animation===\nX-Force is mentioned for the first time outside of the comics in the [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. In the second episode, [[Professor X]] briefly mentions that X-Force has encountered the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]]. No other information is given about the team, other than that they gave the X-Men all their intel about the villains.\n\nIn an early episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' the duo vandalize their neighbor's house by painting \"X-FORCE RULES\" on it.\n\n===Film===\n{{main|X-Men (film series)#Abandoned films}}\n[[20th Century Fox]] are developing a film version of ''X-Force''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/xforce-movie-in-the-works/|title='X-Force' movie in the works at Fox.|date=11 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whois.com/whois/x-forcemovie.com|title=Whois x-forcemovie.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/07/12/fox-to-use-comic-con-as-launching-pad-for-wider-x-men-universe-x-force-film-included/|title=Fox To Use Comic-Con As Launching Pad For Wider X-Men Movie Universe, X-Force Film Included|date=12 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> On July 11, 2013, it was reported that [[Jeff Wadlow]] has been hired to write and direct the adaptation.

Over time these tools have evolved, and are today constructed from hardened tool steel. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle which is attached to the tool surface by a metal ferrule. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements landing between 1mm and 14mm. The thickness and width of these tools is heavily dependent upon on the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stone work which they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools /flat bottomed\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\" \n\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\" and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. (In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction).\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip which allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the process of renewing the external part of mortar joints|Repointing}}\n\n[[Image:Tuck pointing Westminster.jpg|thumb|Brickwork of [[10 Downing Street]], showing fine white fillets in carefully matched dark mortar]]'''Tuckpointing''' [also called tuck pointing or tuck-pointing] is a way of using two contrasting colours of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[brickwork]], one colour matching the bricks themselves, to give an artificial impression that very fine joints have been made.

However professionals sometimes like a much shorter tool, for instance one 30&nbsp;mm long or 25 mm long which may be flat on the front or slightly pointed in order to get into hard to reach spots, for instance under window brick work and in corners. These shorter length tuckpointing tools are called \"stubnose\" and \"longnose\" tuckpointing tools respectively and they are now available in many different \"beaded\" or grooved profiles.

No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade.

Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these \"disguised restrictions on trade\" by, for instance, \"basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long.

Equally problematic, the model is not designed to assess the effect on trade from trade agreements \u2013 in fact, the model is profoundly ill suited for such an exercise. No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade. The reason is simple: if a model cannot predict the effects on the flows and profile of trade as a consequence of trade liberalisation, it is of no use at all.\"<ref name=\":30\"/> They add, \"In Capaldo\u2019s analysis, structural change and the emergence of new industries do not play a role at all. Capaldo implicitly assumes that an economy with its labour and capital does not respond and adjust to new circumstances. New competition only leads to new unemployment.

Busch and [[McGill University]] Professor Krzysztof J. Pelc note that modern trade deals are long and complex because they often tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]], such as different standards and regulations, in addition to [[tariff]]s. Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these \"disguised restrictions on trade\" by, for instance, \"basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long.

Regarding Warren's claim that trade advisers secretly \"whisper in the ear of our trade negotiators\", Lee wrote: \"while the direct meetings take place in private, committees still have to submit written reports to Congress and provide written recommendations and advice that are made public.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> Furthermore, Lee wrote, \"it is true that industry representatives make up a large number of the total membership, but it is worth noting that there is a labor committee in the second tier, labor representatives in the first tier and that the industry groups have a narrow focus (to give technical advice).\"<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nIn response to criticisms about transparency and the large representation from industry representatives, USTR announced it would create a Public Interest Trade Advisory Committee.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Non-compete clause ===\n[[Dean Baker]] argued that Article 18.78, under which countries should ensure that they protect [[trade secrets]] and impose criminal procedures for violators, could be used to enforce [[non-compete agreement]]s.<ref name=\":16\" /> Baker points out that [[California]]'s success can partly be attributed to the fact that the state did not allow for the enforcement of non-compete agreements, making it easy for tech workers to quit their jobs and start to work for another company.<ref name=\":16\">[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-baker/will-the-trans-pacific-pa_b_9878794.html Will the Trans-Pacific Partnership Turn Silicon Valley Into Detroit?] D.
