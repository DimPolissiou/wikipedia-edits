A teacher, experimenter and theorist, he made a lasting contribution to science in his lengthy career, throughout which he sought to encourage specialists in different fields to meet and share insights.\n\nPaul Weiss was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish couple, Carl S. Weiss, a businessman, and Rosalie Kohn Weiss. His background favoured music, poetry, and philosophy \u2013 Weiss himself was a violinist \u2013 but an uncle encouraged an interest in science. Weiss received his baccalaureate in 1916. In his younger years before all the science bullshit he was a major cum addict and spent most of his weekends giving blowjobs to the local fisherman of Vienna. His nickname from all the blowjobs he gave to the local fisherman was \"whale semen weiss\". Hes also famous for being raped by a gorilla and a bull at the same time. He permantly walked with a limp after that event. \n\nAfter the end of the [[First World War]], having served for three years as an officer in the artillery, he commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the [[Technische Hochschule]] in Vienna, (now [[Vienna University of Technology]]). He then shifted his focus to [[biology]] with a minor in [[physics]]. He absorbed the studies of Edmond B. Wilson, Edwin G. Concklin, and Theodor Bovari and completed his doctoral thesis in 1922 under [[Hans Leo Przibram]], then director of the Biological Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, on the responses of butterflies to light and gravity.\n\nAfter completing his thesis he traveled widely in Europe, becoming an assistant director of the Biological Research Institute of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. In 1926 he married Maria Helen Blaschka.\n\nHis studies of limb regeneration in [[newt]]s showed that a complete limb could regenerate even if particular tissue forms were removed from the stump: the required types of tissue would reform. He studied cell differentiation and the transplanting and reforming of connections in the nerves of limbs, using newts and frogs for his experiments. He went on to consider neurobiology and morphogenesis. He introduced the idea of the \"natural experiment\" \u2013 the quest for suggestive examples  from nature \u2013 and this became a favourite teaching device.\n\nIn 1930 a prospective post at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] was lost due to the depression and Weiss moved to the United States. In 1931, after studying developing cell cultures for some time, Weiss won a Sterling fellowship to work with [[Ross Granville Harrison]] at [[Yale]]. He took US citizenship in 1939, publishing his ''Principles of Development'' the same year.<ref>P.A. Weiss, ''Principles of Development'', Henry Holt and Company, 1939</ref> From 1933 to 1954, after working briefly at Yale, he taught at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn his work on tissue cultures Weiss outlined several features of cell proliferation: he showed how cell-patterns are affected by their substrate and, through grafts, proved that basic neural patterns of coordination were self-differentiating rather than learned, though higher vertebrates can \"retrain\" reflexes.\n\nDuring World War II he worked with the American government on nerve injury. In 1947 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1954 he became one of the first professors at the new [[Rockefeller University]] in New York, where he remained for fifteen years.

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War. The [[Japanese military yen]] become useless paper. Most people go to Pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With the support of government, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items.

The screen is tall enough to block passersby from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid embarrassment.\n\n==== Pawning counter ====\nThe counter of the pawn shop, which is behind the tall board, is typically higher than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to give their mortgaged properties upward to the pawning counter. This design shows the higher status of the pawnbrokers. Prices seem to be lower due to the psychological effect caused by this design{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for psychological effect|date=January 2018}}. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security. It is hard for passersby and clients to see the environment and workers inside the pawn shop.\n\n=== Names of pawn shops ===\nPawn shops are a traditional industry in China. The majority of the shops use names including words meaning harmonious (for example 'tung' (\u540c), 'wo' (\u548c)) and/or prosperous (for example 'chang' (\u660c), 'fat' (\u767c), 'fung' (\u8c50)).

In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War. The [[Japanese military yen]] become useless paper. Most people go to Pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With the support of government, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], and [[Kowloon]]. Because many jewelers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.<ref>\u65bc\u5f65\u5317. \u9999\u6e2f\u7576\u92ea\u4f55\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e45\u4e0d\u8870\uff1a\"\u62bc\"\u5b57\u62db\u724c\u540e\u6709\u4e7e\u5764 {{cite web |url=http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116213249/http://hm.people.com.cn/BIG5/42280/42458/42580/3134007.html |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Extracted on 3/4 November 2013</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=for entire paragraph|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn order to prevent the sale of stolen property in pawn shops, Hong Kong law stipulates that pawn shops must check the IDs of would-be clients looking to pawn items.

He rose to international fame with his role as [[Dominic Toretto]] in ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' franchise.\n\nDiesel began his career in 1990, but initially struggled to gain roles until he created and starred in the short film ''[[Multi-Facial]]'' (1995), which attracted the attention of [[Steven Spielberg]], who was developing the film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' at the time. Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear in it, which helped kick start his career. He subsequently voiced the titular character in ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining ''The Fast and the Furious'', the [[XXX (franchise)|''XXX'']] series, and [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|''The Chronicles of Riddick'']].\n\nLater in his career, Diesel also became known for lending his voice to the character of [[Groot]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), and voicing a cameo of the same character in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' (2018). He also founded the production company [[One Race Films]]. Away from action films, Diesel has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as in the comedy film ''[[The Pacifier]]'' (2005), while his performance in ''[[Find Me Guilty]]'' (2006) was praised.\n\nDiesel portrayed the comic book character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]] in its 2020 [[Bloodshot (film)|film adaptation]], and is slated to appear in the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' sequels.\n\n==Early life==\nDiesel was born Mark Sinclair<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/ | publisher=[[Press Association]] via [[The Press]] (Christchurch, New Zealand)| title=Diesel breaks silence over Walker| date= December 3, 2013| accessdate=March 21, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102309/http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/| archivedate=October 6, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> on July 18, 1967,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|title=Famous birthdays for July 18: Vin Diesel, Kristen Bell|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019|archivedate=July 19, 2019|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190719181941/https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|url-status=live|quote=Actor Vin Diesel in 1967 (age 52)}}</ref> in [[Alameda County, California]],<!--- He was born in Alameda County, California, where his mother was also born.

He rose to international fame with his role as [[Dominic Toretto]] in ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' franchise.\n\nDiesel began his career in 1990, but initially struggled to gain roles until he created and starred in the short film ''[[Multi-Facial]]'' (1995), which attracted the attention of director [[Steven Spielberg]], who was developing his film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' at the time. Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear in it, which helped kick start his career. He subsequently voiced the titular character in ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining ''The Fast and the Furious'', the [[XXX (franchise)|''XXX'']] series, and [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|''The Chronicles of Riddick'']].\n\nLater in his career, Diesel also became known for lending his voice to the character of [[Groot]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), and voicing a cameo of the same character in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' (2018). He also founded the production company [[One Race Films]]. Away from action films, Diesel has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as in the comedy film ''[[The Pacifier]]'' (2005), while his performance in ''[[Find Me Guilty]]'' (2006) was praised.\n\nDiesel will portray the comic book character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]] in its 2020 [[Bloodshot (film)|film adaptation]], and is slated to appear in the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' sequels.\n\n==Early life==\nDiesel was born Mark Sinclair<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/ | publisher=[[Press Association]] via [[The Press]] (Christchurch, New Zealand)| title=Diesel breaks silence over Walker| date= December 3, 2013| accessdate=March 21, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102309/http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/| archivedate=October 6, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> on July 18, 1967,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|title=Famous birthdays for July 18: Vin Diesel, Kristen Bell|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019|archivedate=July 19, 2019|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190719181941/https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|url-status=live|quote=Actor Vin Diesel in 1967 (age 52)}}</ref> in [[Alameda County, California]],<!--- He was born in Alameda County, California, where his mother was also born.

Called \"Taconnet\" after Chief Taconnet, the main village was located on the east bank of the Kennebec River at its confluence with the [[Sebasticook River]] at what is now [[Winslow, Maine|Winslow]]. Known as \"Ticonic\" by [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlers]], it was burned in 1692 during [[King William's War]], after which the Canibas tribe abandoned the area.

When residents on the west side of the Kennebec found themselves unable to cross the river to attend [[town meeting]]s, Waterville was founded from the western parts of Winslow and incorporated on June 23, 1802. In 1824 a bridge was built joining the communities. Early industries included [[fishing]], [[lumbering]], [[agriculture]] and [[ship building]], with larger boats launched in spring during [[freshet]]s. By the early 1900s, there were five shipyards in the community.<ref name=Coolidge>{{Cite book| last = Coolidge| first = Austin J.| author2=John B.

The Kennebec River and Messalonskee Stream provided [[water power]] for mills, including several [[sawmill]]s, a [[gristmill]], a [[window sash|sash]] and [[window shutter|blind]] factory, a furniture factory, and a shovel handle factory. There was also a carriage and sleigh factory, boot shop, [[brickmaking|brickyard]], and [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. On September 27, 1849, the [[Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad]] opened to Waterville. It would become part of the [[Maine Central Railroad]], which in 1870 established [[locomotive]] and car repair shops in the thriving [[mill town]]. West Waterville (renamed [[Oakland, Maine|Oakland]]) was set off as a town in 1873. Waterville was incorporated as a city on January 12, 1888.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Varney\n  | first = George J.\n  | title = Gazetteer of the state of Maine.

After a change of ownership in 1873, the company began construction on what would become the Lockwood Manufacturing Company, a [[cotton]] textile plant. A second mill was added, and by 1900 the firm dominated the riverfront and employed 1,300 workers. Lockwood Mills survived until the mid-1950s. The iron [[Two Cent Bridge|Waterville-Winslow Footbridge]] opened in 1901, as a means for Waterville residents to commute to Winslow for work in the [[Hollingsworth & Whitney Company|Hollingsworth & Whitney Co.]] and Wyandotte Worsted Co. mills, but in less than a year was carried away by the highest river level since 1832. Rebuilt in 1903, it would be called the Two Cent Bridge because of its [[toll road|toll]].<ref name=\"Plocher\"/> In 1902, the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style City Hall and Opera House designed by George Gilman Adams was dedicated.

In 1813, the [[Maine Literary and Theological Institution]] was established. It would be renamed Waterville College in 1821, then [[Colby College]] in 1867. [[Thomas College]] was established in 1894. The Latin School was founded in 1820 to prepare students to attend Colby and other colleges, and was subsequently named Waterville Academy, Waterville Classical Institute, and Coburn Classical Institute; the Institute merged with the Oak Grove School in [[Vassalboro, Maine|Vassalboro]] in 1970, and remained open until 1989.

Called \"Taconnet\" after Chief Taconnet, the main village was located on the east bank of the Kennebec River at its confluence with the [[Sebasticook River]] at what is now [[Winslow, Maine|Winslow]]. Known as \"Ticonic\" by [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlers]], it was burned in 1692 during [[King William's War]], after which the Canibas tribe abandoned the area. [[Fort Halifax (Maine)|Fort Halifax]] was built by General [[John Winslow (British Army officer)|John Winslow]] in 1754, and the last skirmish with indigenous peoples occurred on May 18, 1757.<ref name=\"Events in Waterville History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.watervillemaine.net/history/history.html|title=History in Waterville, Maine -|website=Watervillemaine.net|accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe township would be organized as Kingfield Plantation, then incorporated as [[Winslow, Maine|Winslow]] in 1771. When residents on the west side of the Kennebec found themselves unable to cross the river to attend [[town meeting]]s, Waterville was founded from the western parts of Winslow and incorporated on June 23, 1802. In 1824 a bridge was built joining the communities. Early industries included [[fishing]], [[lumbering]], [[agriculture]] and [[ship building]], with larger boats launched in spring during [[freshet]]s. By the early 1900s, there were five shipyards in the community.<ref name=Coolidge>{{Cite book| last = Coolidge| first = Austin J.| author2=John B.

The Kennebec River and Messalonskee Stream provided [[water power]] for mills, including several [[sawmill]]s, a [[gristmill]], a [[window sash|sash]] and [[window shutter|blind]] factory, a furniture factory, and a shovel handle factory. There was also a carriage and sleigh factory, boot shop, [[brickmaking|brickyard]], and [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. On September 27, 1849, the [[Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad]] opened to Waterville. It would become part of the [[Maine Central Railroad]], which in 1870 established [[locomotive]] and car repair shops in the thriving [[mill town]]. West Waterville (renamed [[Oakland, Maine|Oakland]]) was set off as a town in 1873. Waterville was incorporated as a city on January 12, 1888.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Varney\n  | first = George J.\n  | title = Gazetteer of the state of Maine.

After a change of ownership in 1873, the company began construction on what would become the Lockwood Manufacturing Company, a [[cotton]] textile plant. A second mill was added, and by 1900 the firm dominated the riverfront and employed 1,300 workers. Lockwood Mills survived until the mid-1950s. The iron [[Two Cent Bridge|Waterville-Winslow Footbridge]] opened in 1901, as a means for Waterville residents to commute to Winslow for work in the [[Hollingsworth & Whitney Company|Hollingsworth & Whitney Co.]] and Wyandotte Worsted Co. mills, but in less than a year was carried away by the highest river level since 1832. Rebuilt in 1903, it would be called the Two Cent Bridge because of its [[toll road|toll]].<ref name=\"Plocher\"/> In 1902, the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style City Hall and Opera House designed by George Gilman Adams was dedicated. In 2002, the [[C.F. Hathaway Company]], one of the last remaining factories in the United States producing high-end [[dress shirt]]s, was purchased by Warren Buffett's [[Berkshire Hathaway]] company and was closed after over 160 years of operation in the city.<ref name=\"Plocher\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waterville-me.gov/content/1233260491webhistory.pdf|author=Stephen Plocher|title=\"A Short History of Waterville, Maine\" (2007)|date=|website=Waterville-me.gov|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWaterville also developed as an educational center. In 1813, the [[Maine Literary and Theological Institution]] was established. It would be renamed Waterville College in 1821, then [[Colby College]] in 1867. [[Thomas College]] was established in 1894. The Latin School was founded in 1820 to prepare students to attend Colby and other colleges, and was subsequently named Waterville Academy, Waterville Classical Institute, and Coburn Classical Institute; the Institute merged with the Oak Grove School in [[Vassalboro, Maine|Vassalboro]] in 1970, and remained open until the 1980s.
