On foundation, the British settlement was bestowed the name Palmerston, in honour of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]], a former [[British Prime Minister]]. The suffix ''North'' was added in 1871 to distinguish the settlement from [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] in the [[South Island]]. Today, the name is often informally shortened to \"Palmy\".<ref>{{cite news|title=NZ towns putting themselves on the map|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2016/05/nz-towns-putting-themselves-on-the-map.html|accessdate=15 August 2017|work=Newshub|date=5 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nEarly Palmerston North relied on public works and sawmilling. The west coast railway was built in 1886, linking the town to Wellington, and Palmerston North benefited from a booming pastoral farming industry. [[Linton Military Camp]], [[Palmerston North Hospital]], and the establishment of [[Massey University]] (in 1927) have reduced the dependence on farming since the early 20th century. Popular attractions include [[Te Manawa]] (a museum and art gallery that includes the [[New Zealand Rugby Museum]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rugbymuseum.co.nz/|title=New Zealand Rugby Museum {{!}} All Blacks {{!}} Palmerston North|website=rugbymuseum.co.nz|language=en-US|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> and several performing arts venues.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}\n===Early settlement===\nNg\u0101ti Rangit\u0101ne were the local M\u0101ori iwi (''[[tangata whenua]]'') living in the area known as ''Te Ahu-\u0101-T\u016branga'',<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070712102821/http://citylibrary.pncc.govt.nz/search-site.html?search=true&search_id=2&query=Chapter1+pdf ]</ref> when a trader, Jack Duff, became the earliest known European to explore the area {{circa|1830}}. He came on a whaling ship and explored possibly as far inland as the site of Woodville. He reported his discovery on arrival back to Porirua. Colonel Wakefield heard of the potential that the Manawatu had for development and visited in 1840. In 1846 Charles Hartley, another trader, heard from ''tangata whenua'' of a clearing in the Papaioea forest and he proceeded through the dense bush and forest and discovered it for Europeans.<ref name=\"McKinnon\">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Manawat\u016b and Horowhenua places \u2013 Palmerston North |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/manawatu-and-horowhenua-places/page-5 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 November 2018 |date=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nIn 1858, the Government began negotiations with local iwi to purchase land in Manawatu. There was a dispute at the time between rival iwi Ng\u0101ti Rangit\u0101ne and Ng\u0101ti Raukawa as to who has the right to sell. The dispute is resolved in favour of Rangit\u0101ne. On a visit in 1859, [[John Tiffin Stewart]], an employee of the [[Wellington Province|Wellington Provincial Council]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/site/topics/show/218-john-tiffin-stewart|title=Topic: John Tiffin Stewart|publisher=Kete Horowhenua|accessdate=4 July 2008}}</ref> was shown the Papaioea clearing by Rangit\u0101ne chief, Te Hirawanu, and noted its suitability for a \"good site for a township\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourregion.co.nz/palmerston-north/ |title=Our Region |publisher=Ourregion.co.nz |date= |accessdate=19 June 2015}}</ref> In 1864, Te Ahu-a-Turanga Block was sold by Rangit\u0101ne to the Government for \u00a312,000, in an effort to open the Manawatu to settlement.\n\nStewart returned in 1866 on behalf of the Wellington Provincial Council (under whose jurisdiction the new purchase fell) and made the original survey and subdivision in the Papaioea forest clearing.<ref name=\"McKinnon\"/> The settlement, named Palmerston to commemorate the recently deceased [[Lord Palmerston|Prime Minister of Great Britain]], was laid out according to Stewart's plan consisting of a series of wide and straight streets in a rectangular pattern. The focal point was an open space of {{convert|17|acre|ha|0}} subsequently known as The Square. On 3 October 1866, Palmerston was formally endorsed after [[Isaac Earl Featherston]] (Wellington Provincial Superintendent) signed a proclamation defining the boundaries of the settlement. The first sections were sold after. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAmong the first settlers included Scandinavians, who arrived in 1871. They established settlements at Awapuni and Whakarongo/Stoney Creek. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nLater the same year, the suffix ''North'' was added to distinguish the [[Palmerston, New Zealand|settlement of the same name]] in [[Otago]]. In 1872 a petition was launched to change the name of the settlement. A public meeting in 1873 ends with no clear decision on the name.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe railway line was laid through the Square in 1875. The foundation stone for the original [[All Saints Church, Palmerston North|All Saints Church]] was laid by [[Louisa Snelson]] on 29 September 1875.<ref>{{cite news |title=All Saints' Church |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=MT19161028.2.36 |accessdate=18 June 2016 |work=Manawatu Times |volume=XL |issue=13536 |date=28 October 1916 |page=7}}</ref> By 1875 there were newspapers, a doctor and a post office.<ref name=\"McKinnon\"/>\n\nIn 1876, Palmerston North became a Local Board District, within the [[Wellington Provincial Council]]. This existed until the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] later the same year. Also in the same year, the council set aside land north of the Manawatu River for the purposes of a reserve. In 1890, this land was again set aside and would become in 1897, the ''Victoria Esplanade''.\n\n===Growing population===\n[[File:Post Office, Palmerston North (21271976892).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|View of the (Chief) Post Office in Palmerston North, (opened in 1906) with the business premises of G H Bennett (booksellers, stationers & newsagents) behind a hedge centre left.

Photograph taken by William A Price.]]\nBy 1877, when the Borough Council came into existence, Palmerston North was an isolated village in the midst of the native forest that covered inland Manawatu. By 1878, the population was approximately 800 people and sawmilling was the main industry of the district. {{Cn|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe arrival of the railway in 1886 saw an increase in the speed of growth and the town was at the centre of a lucrative agricultural district. {{Cn|date=February 2020}} The opening of the nearby Longburn Freezing Works provided employment, while the Borough Council instigated more infrastructural schemes such as the sewerage system. The Railway through the Manawatu Gorge to Napier was completed in 1891. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1893, Rangit\u0101ne sold the Hokowhitu block, increasing the area of land available for settlement. In the same year, the Public Hospital opened in a wooden building on Terrace Street (now Ruahine Street). The hospital required significant fundraising. At the end of the decade, the Boer War broke out in South Africa and men from Palmerston North were among the volunteers.<ref>[http://www.pncc.govt.nz/about/history/1890s/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209030624/http://www.pncc.govt.nz/about/history/1890s/ |date=9 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1900 the population had reached 6,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pncc.govt.nz/About/History/Detail.aspx?id=2043|title=1890s|publisher=Palmerston North City Council|accessdate=4 July 2008}}</ref> In the 1910s Palmerston North's growth was steady. The population in 1911 about 10,991 (excluding M\u0101ori).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pncc.govt.nz/About/History/Detail.aspx?id=2043|title=1910s|publisher=Palmerston North City Council|accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The city was affected by World War I, with Awapuni Racecourse being used as an army training camp in 1914. During the course of the war, the Borough Council renamed all German-sounding and foreign street names. When the war finished in 1918, celebrations were delayed due to the Influenza epidemic.\n\n===City status===\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=February 2020}}\nIn 1930, the population reached the 20,000 threshold and Palmerston North was officially proclaimed a city, the 7th in New Zealand.  Development was slow due to the [[great depression]] and [[World War II]]. An airport was established at Milson in 1936, which is now [[Palmerston North Airport]]. From 1938, the first Labour government (1935\u20131949) initiated state housing programmes in West End (Savage Crescent precinct) and Roslyn.\n\nIn 1941, the Manawatu River flooded again, having last flooded in 1902. Large parts of Hokowhitu and Awapuni were underwater, with residents evacuating to higher ground (peaked at 5.8m).\n\nIn 1940 the M\u0101ori Battalion was formed in Palmerston North and trained at the Showgrounds (now Arena Manawatu). In 1942, Linton Army Camp was established. After the war, the city's growth was rapid. By 1950, the city's boundaries had extended to include Milson and Kelvin Grove. In 1953, the boundaries would further extend to include Awapuni, which in the same year, was again flooded by the Manawatu River, along with Hokowhitu. It was the largest flood since 1902.\n\nAlthough work had started in 1926, it was not until 1959 the Milson Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk was opened. This meant future trains would pass to the north of the city, instead of through the Square. Later in 1963, the railway station at Tremaine Avenue opens. The last trains passed through the Square in 1964.\n\nIn 1961, the Highbury was added to the council area. In 1963, Massey University College of Manawatu was formed by the amalgamation of the Massey Agricultural College with the Palmerston North University College. In 1964, it becomes [[Massey University]], an autonomous tertiary learning institution with the power to grant its own degrees.\n\nIn 1967, city boundaries were again extended to include land in Aokautere, Kelvin Grove, Milson, Amberley (Westbrook) and Awapuni as part of future growth for the next 25 years.\n\nIn 1970, the [[New Zealand Rugby Museum]] was established and a tribute to the founding father of rugby in New Zealand, Charles Munro, was opened at Massey University.\n\nIn 1971, a competition to design a civic building for the vacant railway land at the Square, is won by Wellington architects, Maurice and John Patience. The resulting building was finished in 1979. In 1976, the Manawatu and Oroua rivers flood, 24-hour rainfall records in Feilding and Palmerston North are exceeded and some residents from both locations are evacuated.\n\nIn 1977, Palmerston North City Council celebrated its Centenary of Municipal government. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are among visitors to Palmerston North.\n\nOn 1 November 1989, New Zealand local government authorities were reorganised. Palmerston North City boundaries were extended to include [[Ashhurst]], [[Linton Army Camp|Linton]] and Turitea through amalgamation of parts of the former Kairanga County, Oroua County and Ashhurst Town Council.\n\nOn 1 July 2012, Bunnythorpe, Longburn, part of the area around Kairanga and an area around Ashhurst were joined to Palmerston North City Council area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Palmerston north city.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Looking southeast towards Palmerston North city centre from Palmerston North Hospital.

The occasional rise in elevation occurs further away from the river and is especially pronounced in the north and northeast, and also on the south side of the river.

It has been previously larger than now and formerly extended over the Manawatu River into the southern suburbs. A 2007 redraw transferred the southern suburbs to Rangit\u012bkei, in return for Kelvin Grove and Milson, making Palmerston North a completely urban electorate. Currently Palmerston North is surrounded by the Rangit\u012bkei electorate.\nSince 2008, the Palmerston North electorate has been held by [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] of [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]].\n\n;Rangit\u012bkei\nThe large electorate of [[Rangit\u012bkei (New Zealand electorate)|Rangit\u012bkei]] extends south to Palmerston North's southern and eastern parts, the mostly rural former [[Ashhurst-Fitzherbert ward]].

The section from Sanson forms the main route from the upper North Island, [[Taranaki]] and [[Whanganui]] into Palmerston North, while the section from Woodville forms the main route from the [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] into Palmerston North.\n*[[File:State Highway 57 NZ.svg|20px]] [[New Zealand State Highway 57|State Highway 57]] runs southwest\u2013northeast from [[New Zealand State Highway 1|SH 1]] at Ohau, south of [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]], through the southern outskirts of Palmerston North to SH 3 east of Ashhurst. It forms the main route from [[Wellington]] to southern and eastern Palmerston North.\n*[[File:State Highway 56 NZ.svg|20px]] [[New Zealand State Highway 56|State Highway 56]] runs southwest\u2013northeast from SH 57 at Makeura, northeast of [[Shannon, New Zealand]], to the intersection of Pioneer Highway and Maxwells Line in the suburb of Awapuni.

It provides an alternative route from the Upper North island into Palmerston North\n\n===Cycling===\nPalmerston North is perceived as being better for cycling than most New Zealand cities, with 2001 figures putting it a close second only to [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] in terms of bicycle [[modal share]].<ref>Hamilton Alternatives to Roading Study (HARTS).

The west coast railway was built in 1886, linking the town to Wellington, and Palmerston North benefited from a booming pastoral farming industry. [[Linton Military Camp]], [[Palmerston North Hospital]], and the establishment of [[Massey University]] (in 1927) have reduced the dependence on farming since the early 20th century.

He came on a whaling ship and explored possibly as far inland as the site of Woodville. He reported his discovery on arrival back to Porirua. Colonel Wakefield heard of the potential that the Manawatu had for development and visited in 1840. In 1846 Charles Hartley, another trader, heard from ''tangata whenua'' of a clearing in the Papaioea forest and he proceeded through the dense bush and forest and discovered it for Europeans.<ref name=\"McKinnon\">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Manawat\u016b and Horowhenua places \u2013 Palmerston North |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/manawatu-and-horowhenua-places/page-5 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 November 2018 |date=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nIn 1858, the Government began negotiations with local iwi to purchase land in Manawatu.

The focal point was an open space of {{convert|17|acre|ha|0}} subsequently known as The Square. On 3 October 1866, Palmerston was formally endorsed after [[Isaac Earl Featherston]] (Wellington Provincial Superintendent) signed a proclamation defining the boundaries of the settlement.

This existed until the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] later the same year. Also in the same year, the council set aside land north of the Manawatu River for the purposes of a reserve.

By 1878, the population was approximately 800 people and sawmilling was the main industry of the district. {{Cn|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe arrival of the railway in 1886 saw an increase in the speed of growth and the town was at the centre of a lucrative agricultural district. {{Cn|date=February 2020}} The opening of the nearby Longburn Freezing Works provided employment, while the Borough Council instigated more infrastructural schemes such as the sewerage system. The Railway through the Manawatu Gorge to Napier was completed in 1891. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1893, Rangit\u0101ne sold the Hokowhitu block, increasing the area of land available for settlement. In the same year, the Public Hospital opened in a wooden building on Terrace Street (now Ruahine Street). The hospital required significant fundraising. At the end of the decade, the Boer War broke out in South Africa and men from Palmerston North were among the volunteers.<ref>[http://www.pncc.govt.nz/about/history/1890s/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209030624/http://www.pncc.govt.nz/about/history/1890s/ |date=9 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1900 the population had reached 6,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pncc.govt.nz/About/History/Detail.aspx?id=2043|title=1890s|publisher=Palmerston North City Council|accessdate=4 July 2008}}</ref> In the 1910s Palmerston North's growth was steady.

During the course of the war, the Borough Council renamed all German-sounding and foreign street names. When the war finished in 1918, celebrations were delayed due to the Influenza epidemic.\n\n===City status===\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=February 2020}}\nIn 1930, the population reached the 20,000 threshold and Palmerston North was officially proclaimed a city, the 7th in New Zealand.  Development was slow due to the [[great depression]] and [[World War II]]. An airport was established at Milson in 1936, which is now [[Palmerston North Airport]]. From 1938, the first Labour government (1935\u20131949) initiated state housing programmes in West End (Savage Crescent precinct) and Roslyn.\n\nIn 1941, the Manawatu River flooded again, having last flooded in 1902. Large parts of Hokowhitu and Awapuni were underwater, with residents evacuating to higher ground (peaked at 5.8m).\n\nIn 1940 the M\u0101ori Battalion was formed in Palmerston North and trained at the Showgrounds (now Arena Manawatu). In 1942, Linton Army Camp was established. After the war, the city's growth was rapid. By 1950, the city's boundaries had extended to include Milson and Kelvin Grove. In 1953, the boundaries would further extend to include Awapuni, which in the same year, was again flooded by the Manawatu River, along with Hokowhitu. It was the largest flood since 1902.\n\nAlthough work had started in 1926, it was not until 1959 the Milson Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk was opened. This meant future trains would pass to the north of the city, instead of through the Square. Later in 1963, the railway station at Tremaine Avenue opens. The last trains passed through the Square in 1964.\n\nIn 1961, the Highbury was added to the council area. In 1963, Massey University College of Manawatu was formed by the amalgamation of the Massey Agricultural College with the Palmerston North University College. In 1964, it becomes [[Massey University]], an autonomous tertiary learning institution with the power to grant its own degrees.\n\nIn 1967, city boundaries were again extended to include land in Aokautere, Kelvin Grove, Milson, Amberley (Westbrook) and Awapuni as part of future growth for the next 25 years.\n\nIn 1970, the [[New Zealand Rugby Museum]] was established and a tribute to the founding father of rugby in New Zealand, Charles Munro, was opened at Massey University.\n\nIn 1971, a competition to design a civic building for the vacant railway land at the Square, is won by Wellington architects, Maurice and John Patience. The resulting building was finished in 1979. In 1976, the Manawatu and Oroua rivers flood, 24-hour rainfall records in Feilding and Palmerston North are exceeded and some residents from both locations are evacuated.\n\nIn 1977, Palmerston North City Council celebrated its Centenary of Municipal government. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are among visitors to Palmerston North.\n\nOn 1 November 1989, New Zealand local government authorities were reorganised. Palmerston North City boundaries were extended to include [[Ashhurst]], [[Linton Army Camp|Linton]] and Turitea through amalgamation of parts of the former Kairanga County, Oroua County and Ashhurst Town Council.\n\nOn 1 July 2012, Bunnythorpe, Longburn, part of the area around Kairanga and an area around Ashhurst were joined to Palmerston North City Council area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Palmerston north city.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Looking southeast towards Palmerston North city centre from Palmerston North Hospital.

People who were involved in the religious movement used the word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}). For further details, see the section below. Gradually, ''protestant'' became a general term, meaning any adherent of the Reformation in the German-speaking area. It was ultimately somewhat taken up by [[Lutherans]], even though [[Martin Luther]] himself insisted on ''Christian'' or ''evangelical'' as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ. [[Huguenots|French]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Protestants instead preferred the word ''reformed'' ({{lang-fr|r\u00e9form\u00e9}}), which became a popular, neutral, and alternative name for [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Evangelical===\n[[File:evangelischeVielfalt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Direction sign]]s showing ways to two different Protestant [[Church (building)|churches]] in the German city of [[Wiesbaden]].]]\nThe word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}), which refers to [[the gospel]], was widely used for those involved in the religious movement in the German-speaking area beginning in 1517.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |title=The Reformation: A History |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=2003 |author-link=Diarmaid MacCulloch |page=xx|title-link=The Reformation: A History }}</ref> Nowadays, ''evangelical'' is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations in the Lutheran, Calvinist, and United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed) traditions in Europe, and those with strong ties to them (e.g. [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]). Above all the term is used by Protestant bodies in the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking area]], such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. In continental Europe, an ''Evangelical'' is either a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or a United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed). The [[German language|German]] word ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' means Protestant, and is different from the German ''{{lang|de|evangelikal}}'', which refers to churches shaped by [[Evangelicalism]]. The English word ''evangelical'' usually refers to [[evangelical Protestant]] churches, and therefore to a certain part of Protestantism rather than to Protestantism as a whole. The English word traces its roots back to the [[Puritans]] in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.\n\nMartin Luther always disliked the term ''Lutheran'', preferring the term ''evangelical'', which was derived from ''euangelion'', a Greek word meaning \"good news\", i.e. \"[[The Gospel|gospel]]\".<ref name=OOE796>Esp\u00edn, Orlando O. and Nickoloff, James B. ''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies''. Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press, p. 796.</ref> The followers of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and other theologians linked to the [[Reformed tradition]] also began to use that term. To distinguish the two evangelical groups, others began to refer to the two groups as ''Evangelical Lutheran'' and ''Evangelical Reformed''. Nowadays, the word also pertains in the same way to some other mainline groups, for example ''Evangelical Methodist''. As time passed by, the word ''evangelical'' was dropped. Lutherans themselves began to use the term ''Lutheran'' in the middle of the 16th century, in order to distinguish themselves from other groups such as the [[Philippists]] and [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Reformational===\nThe German word ''{{lang|de|reformatorisch}}'', which roughly translates to English as \"reformational\" or \"reforming\", is used as an alternative for ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' in German, and is different from English ''reformed'' ({{lang-de|reformiert}}), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and other Reformed theologians. Being derived from the word \"Reformation\", the term emerged around the same time as ''evangelical'' (1517) and ''protestant'' (1529).\n\n==Theology==\n\n===Main principles===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|image1=Mikolow protestant church pulpit.jpg\n|caption1=Key figures of the Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther and John Calvin depicted on a church [[pulpit]].

The supreme authority of [[religious text|scripture]] is a fundamental principle of Protestantism.}}\n\nVarious experts on the subject tried to determine what makes a Christian denomination a part of Protestantism. A common consensus approved by most of them is that if a Christian denomination is to be considered Protestant, it must acknowledge the following three fundamental principles of Protestantism.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" />\n\n;Scripture alone:\n{{main|Sola Scriptura}}\nThe belief, emphasized by Luther, in the Bible as the [[Sola scriptura|highest source of authority]] for the church. The early churches of the Reformation believed in a critical, yet serious, reading of scripture and holding the Bible as a source of authority higher than that of [[Sacred Tradition|church tradition]]. The many abuses that had occurred in the Western Church before the Protestant Reformation led the Reformers to reject much of its tradition, though some{{who|date= November 2018}} would maintain tradition has been maintained and reorganized in the liturgy and in the confessions of the Protestant churches of the Reformation. In the early 20th century, a less critical reading of the Bible developed in the United States, leading to a \"fundamentalist\" reading of Scripture. Christian fundamentalists read the Bible as the \"inerrant, infallible\" Word of God, as do the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran churches, but interpret it in a literalist fashion without using the historical critical method.\n\n\"Biblical Christianity\" focused on a deep study of the Bible is characteristic of most Protestants as opposed to \"Church Christianity\", focused on performing rituals and good works, represented by Catholic and Orthodox traditions. However Quakers and Pentecostalists, emphasize the Holy Spirit and personal closeness to God.<ref>Woodhead, Linda. ''Christianity: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press, 2014) pp. 57\u201370</ref>\n\n;Justification by faith alone:\n{{main|Sola Fide}}\nThe belief that believers are [[justification (theology)|justified]], or pardoned for sin, solely on condition of faith in [[Jesus|Christ]] rather than a combination of faith and [[good works]]. For Protestants, good works are a necessary consequence rather than cause of justification.<ref name=\"SchaffHerzog\">Johann Jakob Herzog, Philip Schaff, Albert.

It is opposed to the hierarchical system which puts the essence and authority of the Church in an exclusive priesthood, and makes ordained priests the necessary mediators between God and the people.<ref name=\"SchaffHerzog\" /> It is distinguished from the concept of the priesthood of all believers, which did not grant individuals the right to interpret the Bible apart from the Christian community at large because universal priesthood opened the door to such a possibility.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Unitarianism and the Protestant Dilemma: The Conundrum of Biblical Authority|last=Willsky-Ciollo|first=Lydia|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2015|isbn=9780739188927|location=Lanham, MD|pages=9\u201310}}</ref> There are scholars who cite that this doctrine tends to subsume all distinctions in the church under a single spiritual entity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life|last=Chan|first=Simon|publisher=IVP Academic|year=1998|isbn=9780830815425|location=Downers Grove, IL|pages=105}}</ref> Calvin referred to the universal priesthood as an expression of the relation between the believer and his God, including the freedom of a Christian to come to God through Christ without human mediation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Church in the Theology of the Reformers|last=Avis|first=Paul|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2002|isbn=1592441009|location=Eugene, OR|pages=95}}</ref> He also maintained that this principle recognizes Christ as [[prophet]], priest, and king and that his priesthood is shared with his people.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Trinity===\n{{See also|Trinity|Nontrinitarianism}}\n[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief that God is one God in three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]), and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|God the Holy Spirit]].]]\nProtestants who adhere to the [[Nicene Creed]] believe in three [[person]]s ([[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]) as one God.\n\nMovements emerging around the time of the Protestant Reformation, but not a part of Protestantism, e.g. [[Unitarianism]] also reject the Trinity. This often serves as a reason for exclusion of the [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] and other movements from Protestantism by various observers. Unitarianism continues to have a presence mainly in Transylvania, England and the United States, as well as elsewhere.\n\n===Five solae===\n{{Main|Five solae}}\n{{Five solae}}\n\nThe Five ''{{lang|la|solae}}'' are five [[Latin]] phrases (or slogans) that emerged during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and summarize the reformers' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] of the day. The Latin word ''{{lang|la|sola}}'' means \"alone\", \"only\", or \"single\".\n\nThe use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation, based on the overarching principle of ''{{lang|la|[[sola scriptura]]}}'' (by scripture alone). This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible: that its teaching is needed for salvation (necessity); that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone (sufficiency); that everything taught in the Bible is correct (inerrancy); and that, by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin, believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself, though understanding is difficult, so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church (clarity).\n\nThe necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text.\n\nThe second main principle, ''{{lang|la|[[sola fide]]}}'' (by faith alone), states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation. Though argued from scripture, and hence logically consequent to ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'', this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers. Because ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'' placed the Bible as the only source of teaching, ''{{lang|la|sola fide}}'' epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to, namely the direct, close, personal connection between Christ and the believer, hence the reformers' contention that their work was Christocentric.\n\nThe other solas, as statements, emerged later, but the thinking they represent was also part of the early Reformation.\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Solus Christus]]}}'': ''Christ alone''\n: The Protestants characterize the dogma concerning the Pope as Christ's representative head of the Church on earth, the concept of works made meritorious by Christ, and the Catholic idea of a treasury of the merits of Christ and his saints, as a denial that Christ is the ''only'' mediator between [[God]] and man. Catholics, on the other hand, maintained the traditional understanding of Judaism on these questions, and appealed to the universal consensus of Christian tradition.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Matt.|16:18}}, {{Bibleref2|1Cor.|3:11||1 Cor. 3:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph.|2:20}}, {{Bibleref2|1Pet.|2:5\u20136||1 Pet. 2:5\u20136}}, {{Bibleref2|Rev.|21:14}}</ref>\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Sola Gratia]]}}'': ''Grace alone''\n: Protestants perceived Roman Catholic salvation to be dependent upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God on account of the change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one ''deserves'' salvation.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|7:21}}\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Soli Deo Gloria]]}}'': ''Glory to God alone''\n: All glory is due to God alone since salvation is accomplished solely through his will and action\u2014not only the gift of the all-sufficient [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus]] on [[Christian cross|the cross]] but also the gift of faith in that atonement, created in the heart of the believer by the [[Holy Spirit]]. The reformers believed that human beings\u2014even saints [[canonization|canonized]] by the Catholic Church, the popes, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy\u2014are not worthy of the glory.\n\n===Christ's presence in the Eucharist===\n{{Main|Eucharistic theology}}\n\n[[File:Abendmahl-1547-LC.jpg|thumb|A Lutheran depiction of the [[Last Supper]] by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1547.]]\nThe Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century. One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the [[Eucharist]]. Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic [[dogma]] of [[transubstantiation]], which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion.\n* Lutherans hold that within the [[Lord's Supper]] the consecrated elements of bread and wine are the true body and blood of Christ \"in, with, and under the form\" of bread and wine for all those who eat and drink it,{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:16|47}} {{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|11:20,27|47}}<ref>Engelder, T.E.W., [https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 ''Popular Symbolics''].

Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the [[sacrament]] but instead affirm that Christ is united to the believer through faith\u2014toward which the supper is an outward and visible aid. This is often referred to as ''dynamic presence''.\n* Anglicans and Methodists refuse to define the Presence, preferring to leave it a mystery.<ref name=\"Neal2014\">{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Gregory S.|title=Sacramental Theology and the Christian Life|date=19 December 2014|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781490860077|page=111|quote=For Anglicans and Methodists the reality of the presence of Jesus as received through the sacramental elements is not in question. Real presence is simply accepted as being true, its mysterious nature being affirmed and even lauded in official statements like ''This Holy Mystery: A United Methodist Understanding of Holy Communion.}}</ref> The Prayer Books describe the bread and wine as outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace which is the Body and Blood of Christ. However, the words of their liturgies suggest that one can hold to a belief in the Real Presence and Spiritual and Sacramental Present at the same time. For example, \"... and you have fed us with the spiritual food in the Sacrament of his body and Blood;\" \"...the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, and for assuring us in these holy mysteries...\" American Book of Common Prayer, 1977, pp.&nbsp;365\u2013366. Perhaps the best way to see it is that the Anglican view incorporates all three of the above positions and the Roman and Orthodox. The classic Anglican and Methodist view is that the bread and wine are instruments of God's Grace. Perhaps the closest that one can get to pinning down an Anglican view (they are notorious for refusing to so) are the words of St. John of Damascus, \"the bread and wine are visible symbols of a spiritual reality.\" The symbol is not empty but the visible to another reality present.\n* Anabaptists hold a popular simplification of the [[Theology of Huldrych Zwingli|Zwinglian view]], without concern for theological intricacies as hinted at above, may see the Lord's Supper merely as a symbol of the shared faith of the participants, a commemoration of the facts of the crucifixion, and a reminder of their standing together as the body of Christ (a view referred to as ''memorialism'').<ref name=\"Balmer2002\">{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall Herbert|last2=Winner|first2=Lauren F.|title=Protestantism in America|url=https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=9780231111300|page=[https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593/page/n42 26]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Protestantism}}\n\n===Pre-Reformation===\n{{See also|Proto-Protestantism|Girolamo Savonarola}}\n[[File:Muttich, Kamil Vladislav - Mistr Jan Hus na hranici v Kostnici 1415.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of [[Jan Hus]] in 1415.]]\n[[File:lollardmap.jpg|thumb|right|Spread of [[Lollardy]] in [[medieval England]] and [[medieval Scotland]].]]\n\nIn the late 1130s, [[Arnold of Brescia]], an Italian [[canon regular]] became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church. After his death, his teachings on [[apostolic poverty]] gained currency among [[Arnoldists]], and later more widely among [[Waldensians]] and the [[Spiritual Franciscans]], though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. In the early 1170s, [[Peter Waldo]] founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution. Despite that, the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy, as [[Waldensian Evangelical Church|a part of the wider Reformed tradition]].\n\nIn the 1370s, [[John Wycliffe]]\u2014later dubbed the \"Morning Star of Reformation\"\u2014started his activity as an English reformer. He rejected papal authority over secular power, [[Wycliffe's Bible|translated the Bible]] into [[vernacular]] [[English language|English]], and preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms.\n\nBeginning in the first decade of the 15th century, [[Jan Hus]]\u2014a Roman Catholic priest, Czech reformist and professor\u2014influenced by John Wycliffe's writings, founded the [[Hussite]] movement. He strongly advocated his reformist [[Bohemian]] religious denomination. He was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] and [[burned at the stake]] in [[Constance]], [[Bishopric of Constance]] in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy. After his execution, a revolt erupted. Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the [[Pope]].\n\nLater on, theological disputes caused a split within the Hussite movement. [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] maintained that both the bread and the wine should be administered to the people during the Eucharist. Another major faction were the [[Taborites]], who opposed the Utraquists in the [[Battle of Lipany]] during the [[Hussite Wars]]. There were two separate parties among the Hussites: moderate and radical movements. Other smaller regional Hussite branches in [[Bohemia]] included [[Adamites]], [[Orebites]], [[Sirotci|Orphans]] and Praguers.\n\nThe Hussite Wars concluded with the victory of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], his Catholic allies and moderate Hussites and the defeat of the radical Hussites. Tensions arose as the [[Thirty Years' War]] reached Bohemia in 1620. Both moderate and radical Hussitism was increasingly persecuted by Catholics and Holy Roman Emperor's armies.\n\nStarting in 1475, an Italian Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]] was calling for a Christian renewal. Later on, Martin Luther himself read some of the friar's writings and praised him as a martyr and forerunner whose ideas on faith and grace anticipated Luther's own doctrine of justification by faith alone.\n\nSome of Hus' followers founded the [[Unitas Fratrum]]\u2014\"Unity of the Brethren\"\u2014which was renewed under the leadership of [[Zinzendorf|Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf]] in [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]] in 1722 after its almost total destruction in the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]]. Today, it is usually referred to in English as the [[Moravian Church]] and in German as the [[Moravian Church|Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine]].\n\n===Reformation proper===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Distribution of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in [[Central Europe]] on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618).]]\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=vertical\n|width=200\n|image1=1491 Henry VIII.jpg\n|caption1=[[Henry VIII of England]], known for his role in the [[English Reformation|separation]] of the [[Church of England]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n|image2=JohnKnox.jpg\n|caption2=John Knox, who led the [[Reformation in Scotland]], founding [[Presbyterianism]].}}\n{{Reformation}}\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] began as an attempt to reform the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nOn 31 October 1517 ([[Halloween|All Hallows' Eve]]) [[Martin Luther]] allegedly nailed his [[Ninety-five Theses]] (Disputation on the Power of Indulgences) on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]] in [[Wittenberg]], Germany, detailing doctrinal and practical abuses of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], especially the selling of [[indulgence]]s. The theses debated and criticized many aspects of the Church and the papacy, including the practice of [[Purgatory#Protestantism|purgatory]], [[Particular judgment#Reformation concepts|particular judgment]], and the authority of the pope. Luther would later write works against the Catholic devotion to [[Virgin Mary]], the intercession of and devotion to the saints, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, good works, and the sacraments.<ref name=Schofield122>Schofield ''Martin Luther'' p. 122</ref>\n\nThe [[Reformation]] was a triumph of literacy and the new [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].<ref name=Cameron>Cameron ''European Reformation''{{page needed|date=March 2015}}</ref>{{efn|In the end, while the Reformation emphasis on Protestants reading the Scriptures was one factor in the development of literacy, the impact of printing itself, the wider availability of printed works at a cheaper price, and the increasing focus on education and learning as key factors in obtaining a lucrative post, were also significant contributory factors.<ref name=Pettegree543>Pettegree ''Reformation World'' p. 543</ref>}}  Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets.

After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the [[Bern]] reformer [[William Farel]], Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the city of [[Geneva]]. His ''Ordinances of 1541'' involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563.\n\nProtestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed [[Huguenots]]. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of [[Henry II of France]] in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when [[Henry IV of France]] issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official [[state religion]], and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV's]] [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg]] declared the [[Edict of Potsdam]], giving free passage to Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the [[C\u00e9vennes]] region.\n\nParallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the [[Swiss Confederation]] led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince [[Philip of Hesse]] saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the [[Colloquy of Marburg]], which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.\n\nIn 1534, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] put an end to all papal jurisdiction in [[England]], after the Pope failed to [[annul]] his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]];<ref>William P. Haugaard \"The History of Anglicanism I\" in ''The Study of Anglicanism'' Stephen Sykes and John Booty (eds) (SPCK 1987) pp. 6\u20137</ref> this opened the door to reformational ideas. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (''{{lang|la|via media}}'') between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the [[English Reformation]] came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as ''the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England''. Between 1535 and 1540, under [[Thomas Cromwell]], the policy known as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]. The [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.\n\nThe success of the [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritans|Puritan party]] dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the [[Elizabethan Age]]. The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The later Puritan movement, often referred to as [[dissenters]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations.\n\nThe [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560 decisively shaped the [[Church of Scotland]].<ref>Article 1, of the [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish Reformation'.</ref> The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation. The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament]] of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the [[Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560]], forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith. It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent [[Mary of Guise]], who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent [[Mary, Queen of Scots|daughter]].\n\nSome of the most important activists of the Protestant Reformation included [[Jacobus Arminius]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[Andreas von Carlstadt]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[William Farel]], [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]], [[Laurentius Petri]], [[Olaus Petri]], [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Menno Simons]], [[Louis de Berquin]], [[Primo\u017e Trubar]] and [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]].\n\nIn the course of this religious upheaval, the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524\u201325 swept through the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Thuringia]]n and [[Swabia]]n principalities. After the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the [[Low Countries]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]], the confessional division of the [[states of the Holy Roman Empire]] eventually erupted in the [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648. It devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25% and 40% of its population.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe \u2013 Demographics]\".

(the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'')\n* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.\n* The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power. [[Pope Innocent X]] declared the treaty \"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times\" in his bull ''{{lang|la|Zelo Domus Dei}}''. European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.<ref name=ODCCWestphalia>Cross, (ed.) \"Westphalia, Peace of\" ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = center\n | total_width = 700\n | direction = vertical\n\n | image1 = The Protestant Reformation.svg\n | caption1 = Peak of the Reformation & beginning of the Counter-Reformation (1545\u20131620)\n\n | image2 = The Counterreformation.svg\n | caption2 = End of the Reformation & Counter-Reformation (1648)\n\n | footer = Religious situation in Europe, late 16th & early to mid 17th century}}\n\n===Post-Reformation===\n{{See also|Great Awakenings|Azusa Street Revival}}\n{{Great awakenings}}\n\nThe Great Awakenings were periods of rapid and dramatic religious revival in Anglo-American religious history.\n\nThe [[First Great Awakening]] was an evangelical and revitalization movement that swept through Protestant Europe and [[British America]], especially the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on [[Protestantism in the United States|American Protestantism]]. It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism and hierarchy, it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref>\n\n[[File:1839-meth.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|1839 [[Methodist]] camp meeting during the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the U.S.]]\n\nThe [[Second Great Awakening]] began around 1790. It gained momentum by 1800. After 1820, membership rose rapidly among [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1840s. It has been described as a reaction against skepticism, [[deism]], and [[rationalism]], although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood.<ref>[[Nancy Cott]], \"Young Women in the Great Awakening in New England,\" Feminist Studies 3, no. 1/2 (Autumn 1975): 15.</ref> It enrolled millions of new members in existing [[evangelical]] denominations and led to the formation of new denominations.\n\nThe [[Third Great Awakening]] refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in [[American history]] and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century.<ref>William G.

It was affiliated with the [[Social Gospel]] Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]], [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]], and [[Christian Science]] movements.<ref name=Fogel>Robert William Fogel, ''The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe [[Fourth Great Awakening]] was a Christian religious awakening that some scholars\u2014most notably, [[Robert Fogel]]\u2014say took place in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while others look at the era following [[World War II]]. The terminology is controversial. Thus, the idea of a Fourth Great Awakening itself has not been generally accepted.<ref>Robert William Fogel (2000), ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism''; see the review by Randall Balmer, ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 2002 33(2): 322\u2013325</ref>\n\nIn 1814, [[R\u00e9veil|Le R\u00e9veil]] swept through Calvinist regions in Switzerland and France.\n\nIn 1904, a [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival|Protestant revival in Wales]] had tremendous impact on the local population. A part of British modernization, it drew many people to churches, especially Methodist and Baptist ones.\n\nA noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal movement]]. Sprung from Methodist and [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] roots, it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on [[Azusa Street]] in Los Angeles. From there it spread around the world, carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there. These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history, such as seen in the two Great Awakenings. Pentecostalism, which in turn birthed the [[Charismatic movement]] within already established denominations, continues to be an important force in [[Western Christianity]].\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere in the world, there has been a marked rise in the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical wing]] of Protestant denominations, especially those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream liberal churches]]. In the post\u2013[[World War I]] era, [[Liberal Christianity]] was on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the post\u2013[[World War II]] era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures.\n\nIn Europe, there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards [[secularism]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is largely responsible for the spread of secularism. Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism, attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant-majority countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2012/03/has-lutheranism-caused-secularism/|title=Has Lutheranism caused secularism?|last=Cranach|date=22 March 2012}}</ref> In North America, South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe. United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other [[developed countries]]. South America, historically Roman Catholic, has experienced a large [[Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n==Radical Reformation==\n{{Main|Radical Reformation}}\n[[File:T\u00e4uferdisputation 1525.jpg|thumb|Dissatisfaction with the outcome of a disputation in 1525 prompted [[Swiss Brethren]] to part ways with [[Huldrych Zwingli]].]]\n\nUnlike mainstream [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinist]] and Zwinglian movements, the [[Radical Reformation]], which had no state sponsorship, generally abandoned the idea of the \"Church visible\" as distinct from the \"Church invisible\". It was a rational extension of the state-approved Protestant dissent, which took the value of independence from constituted authority a step further, arguing the same for the civic realm. The Radical Reformation was non-mainstream, though in parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, a majority would sympathize with the Radical Reformation despite the intense persecution it faced from both Roman Catholics and Magisterial Protestants.<ref name=horsch>{{cite book|last=Horsch|first=John|authorlink=John Horsch|title=Mennonites in Europe|date=1995|publisher=Herald Press|isbn=978-0836113952|page=299}}</ref>\n\nThe early [[Anabaptists]] believed that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gonzalez, ''A History of Christian Thought'', 88.</ref> Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor by the use of the sword; [[Christianity]] was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Protestant ecclesial leaders such as [[Balthasar Hubmaier|Hubmaier]] and [[Melchior Hoffman|Hofmann]] preached the invalidity of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion ([[Believers baptism|\"believer's baptism\"]]) instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the [[Catharism|Albigenses]] in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] was involved in the [[German Peasants' War]]. [[Andreas Karlstadt]] disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers.<ref name=GAMEO-Karlstadt>{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Gerhard|title=Karlstadt, Andreas Rudolff-Bodenstein von (1486\u20131541)|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Karlstadt,_Andreas_Rudolff-Bodenstein_von_(1486-1541)|website=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> [[Kaspar Schwenkfeld]] and [[Sebastian Franck]] were influenced by [[German mysticism]] and [[spiritualism]].\n\nIn the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation, the [[Magisterial Reformation]] had not gone far enough. Radical Reformer, [[Andreas Karlstadt|Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt]], for example, referred to the Lutheran theologians at [[Wittenberg]] as the \"new papists\".<ref>[http://www.reformationhappens.com/movements/magisterial/ The Magisterial Reformation].</ref> Since the term \"magister\" also means \"teacher\", the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher. This is made evident in the prominence of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry. Because of their authority, they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes. A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of [[Hans Hut]], although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism.\n\nAnabaptism in shape of its various diversification such as the [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]] came out of the Radical Reformation. Later in history, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], and the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] would emerge in Anabaptist circles.\n\n==Denominations==\n{{See also|List of Christian denominations#Protestant|List of the largest Protestant churches}}\n[[File:Map of state religions (detailed).svg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Protestantism as [[state religion]]:\n{{legend|#062A87|[[Lutheranism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF2400|[[Anglicanism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF7F00|[[Calvinism]]}}\n{{legend|#FC0FC0|[[Methodism]]}}]]\n\nProtestants refer to specific groupings of congregations or churches that share in common foundational doctrines and the name of their groups as [[List of Christian Denominations#Protestant|denominations]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkhVtAEwZckC&pg=PA135|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 1996\u20131997|date=1996|publisher=Diane Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780788129056}}</ref> The term denomination (national body) is to be distinguished from branch (denominational family; tradition), communion (international body) and congregation (church).

Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland lost its position as a state church but gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], whose position, however, is not codified in the constitution.}} Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state, it is not described as a [[state religion]] in the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish Constitution]] or other laws passed by the [[Finnish Parliament]].<ref name=FinlandConstitution>[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html Finland \u2013 Constitution], Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html.</ref> In 2000, Sweden was the second Nordic country to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf|title=Maarit J\u00e4nter\u00e4-Jareborg: Religion and the Secular State in Sweden}}</ref>\n\n===United and uniting churches===\n{{Main|United and uniting churches}}\n{{See also|Continuing churches}}\n[[File:Union luthercalvin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Glass window in the town church of [[Wiesloch]] (''Stadtkirche [[Wiesloch]]'') with [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] commemorating the 1821 union of Lutheran and Reformed churches in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].]]\nUnited and uniting churches are churches formed from the merger or other form of union of two or more different Protestant denominations.\n\nHistorically, unions of Protestant churches were enforced by the state, usually in order to have a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern [[Christian ecumenism]] progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the [[United Protestant Church of France]] (2013) and the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] due to the rise of [[secularism]], [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among [[evangelical]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] and [[charismatic]] churches as new ones arise and plenty of them remain independent of each other.\n\nPerhaps the oldest official united church is found in [[Germany]], where the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] is a federation of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], United ([[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]]) and [[Reformed churches]], a union dating back to 1817. The first of the series of unions was at a synod in [[Idstein]] to form the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]] in August 1817, commemorated in naming the church of Idstein [[Unionskirche, Idstein|Unionskirche]] one hundred years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-jb-kirche.htm |title=Staatlicher Dirigismus und neue Gl\u00e4ubigkeit (Die Kirche im Herzogtum Nassau) |publisher= Nassau-info.de |language=German}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, each united or uniting church comprises a different mix of predecessor Protestant denominations. Trends are visible, however, as most united and uniting churches have one or more predecessors with heritage in the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]] and many are members of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].\n\n==Major branches==\nProtestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation, today regarded as branches. Some of these movements have a common lineage, sometimes directly spawning individual denominations. Due to the earlier stated multitude of [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]], this section discusses only the largest denominational families, or branches, widely considered to be a part of Protestantism. These are, in alphabetical order: [[Adventism|Adventist]], [[Anglican]], [[Baptist]], [[Calvinism|Calvinist (Reformed)]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Pentecostal]]. A small but historically significant [[Anabaptist]] branch is also discussed.\n\nThe chart below shows the mutual relations and historical origins of the main Protestant denominational families, or their parts. Due to factors such as [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]] and the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'', many people lived as [[Nicodemite]]s, where their professed religious affiliations were more or less at odds with the movement they sympathized with. As a result, the boundaries between the denominations do not separate as cleanly as this chart indicates. When a population was suppressed or persecuted into feigning an adherence to the dominant faith, over the generations they continued to influence the church they outwardly adhered to.\n\nBecause Calvinism was not specifically recognized in the Holy Roman Empire until the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, many Calvinists lived as [[Crypto-Calvinists]]. Due to Counter-Reformation related suppressions in Catholic lands during the 16th through 19th centuries, many Protestants lived as [[crypto-protestantism|Crypto-Protestants]]. Meanwhile, in Protestant areas, Catholics sometimes lived as [[crypto-papist]]s, although in continental Europe emigration was more feasible so this was less common.\n\n[[File:Protestant branches.svg|thumb|upright=2.95|center|Historical chart of the main Protestant branches.]]\n\n===Adventism===\n{{Main|Adventism}}\nAdventism began in the 19th century in the context of the [[Second Great Awakening]] revival in the [[United States]]. The name refers to belief in the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming (or \"Second Advent\") of Jesus Christ]]. [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as [[Millerism|Millerites]].\n\nAlthough the Adventist churches hold much in common, their [[Christian theology|theologies]] differ on whether the [[intermediate state]] is [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is [[annihilationism|annihilation]] or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of {{bibleverse ||Daniel|8|NKJV}} refers to the one in [[heavenly sanctuary|heaven]] or one on earth.<ref name=\"Handbook\">{{Citation | section = Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches | pages = 256\u2013276 | first1 = Frank S | last1 = Mead | first2 = Samuel S | last2 = Hill | first3 = Craig D | last3 = Atwood | title = Handbook of Denominations in the United States | edition = 12th | place = Nashville | publisher = Abingdon Press}}</ref> The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole [[Bible]], leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]].

The early members of this movement did not accept the name ''Anabaptist'', claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void, the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism. As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both [[Magisterial Reformation|Magisterial Protestants]] and [[Roman Catholics]].<ref group = \"lower-alpha\">{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}Since the middle of the 20th century, the German-speaking world no longer uses the term \"Wiedert\u00e4ufer\" (translation: \"Re-baptizers\") considering it biased. The term \"T\u00e4ufer\" (translation: \"Baptizers\") is now used, which is considered more impartial. From the perspective of their persecutors, the \"Baptizers\" baptized for the second time those \"who as infants had already been baptized\". Since the denigrative term ''Anabaptist'' signifies ''re-baptizing'', it is considered a polemic term and therefore has been dropped from use in modern German. However, in the English-speaking world it is still in use in order to distinguish the \"Baptizers\" more clearly from the \"Baptists\" who emerged later.</ref> While most Anabaptists adhered to a [[Sermon on the Mount#Analysis and interpretation|literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount]], which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise.<ref group = \"lower-alpha\">For example, the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion|followers of Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] and [[Balthasar Hubmaier]].</ref> They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Hutterites]] and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism.

Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the [[five points of Calvinism]], though these points identify the Calvinist view on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things\u2014in salvation but also in all of life.

Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the [[Apostolic Age]] of the [[early church]]. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term ''Apostolic'' or ''[[Full Gospel]]'' to describe their movement.\n\nPentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations, including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ, both in the United States and elsewhere. There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide, and the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the [[global South]]. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches through the [[Charismatic Movement]].

Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], such as does it the [[Charismatic Movement]], which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to [[Pentecostals]] into the various branches of Christianity. [[Neo-charismatic churches]] are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement.

Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include [[Bill Subritzky]].\n\nLarry Christenson, a Lutheran theologian based in [[San Pedro, California]], did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans. A very large annual conference regarding that matter was held in [[Minneapolis]]. Charismatic Lutheran congregations in Minnesota became especially large and influential; especially \"Hosanna!\" in Lakeville, and North Heights in St. Paul. The next generation of Lutheran charismatics cluster around the [[Alliance of Renewal Churches]]. There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach. [[Richard A.

His teachings held to the [[five solae]] of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and other [[Protestant Reformers]]. Jacobus Arminius was a student of [[Theodore Beza]] at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a [[soteriological]] diversification of [[Calvinism]].<ref>\"Chambers Biographical Dictionary,\" ed. Magnus Magnusson (Chambers: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 62.</ref> However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.<ref>Kenneth D. Keathley, \"The Work of God: Salvation,\" in ''A Theology for the Church'', ed. Daniel L. Akin (Nashville: B&H Academic, 2007), 703.</ref> Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the [[Baptists]] in the 16th century,<ref>Robert G. Torbet, ''A History of the Baptists'', third edition</ref> the [[Methodists]] in the 18th century and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in the 19th century.\n\nThe original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself are commonly defined as Arminianism, but more broadly, the term may embrace the teachings of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]], and others as well. [[Arminianism#Classical Arminianism|Classical Arminianism]] and [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]] are the two main schools of thought. Wesleyan Arminianism is often identical with Methodism. The two systems of Calvinism and Arminianism share both history and many doctrines, and the [[History of Christianity|history of Christian theology]]. However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine [[predestination]] and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. In short, the difference can be seen ultimately by whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion.  Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.<ref>Gonzalez, Justo L.

While declining as an identifiable Lutheran group, some of its theological tenets influenced Protestantism generally, inspiring the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest [[John Wesley]] to begin the [[Methodism|Methodist]] movement and [[Alexander Mack]] to begin the [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]] movement among [[Anabaptists]].\n\nThough Pietism shares an emphasis on personal behavior with the [[Puritan]] movement, and the two are often confused, there are important differences, particularly in the concept of the role of religion in government.<ref>Calvinist Puritans believed that government was ordained by God to enforce Christian behavior upon the world; pietists see the government as a part of the world, and believers were called to voluntarily live faithful lives independent of government.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Philipp Jakob Spener.jpg|[[Philipp Jakob Spener]], German pioneer and founder of Pietism.\nFile:Pietism.JPG|Pietism has been a strong cultural influence in Scandinavia.\nFile:Der breite und der schmale Weg 2008.jpg|''The Broad and the Narrow Way'', a popular German Pietist painting, 1866.\n</gallery>\n\n===Puritanism, English dissenters and nonconformists===\n{{Main|Puritanism|English Dissenters|Independent (religion)|Nonconformist (Protestantism){{!}}Nonconformism|English Presbyterianism|Ecclesiastical separatism|17th-century denominations in England}}\n\nThe Puritans were a group of English Protestants in the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th]] and [[Christianity in the 17th century|17th centuries]], which sought to purify the [[Church of England]] of what they considered to be [[Roman Catholic]] practices, maintaining that the church was only partially reformed. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some of the returning [[Marian exiles|clergy exiled under Mary I]] shortly after the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1558, as an activist movement within the [[Church of England]].\n\nPuritans were blocked from changing the established church from within, and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands (and later to New England), and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later into Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the [[Synod of Dort]] they were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted [[Puritan Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarianism]] in the 17th century, and were influenced by [[millennialism]].\n\nThey formed, and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of [[worship]] and [[doctrine]], as well as personal and group [[pietism|piety]]. Puritans adopted a [[Reformed theology]], but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva. In church polity, some advocated for separation from all other Christians, in favor of autonomous [[gathered church]]es. These separatist and [[independent (religion)|independent]] strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a [[Presbyterian polity]] in the [[Westminster Assembly]] were unable to forge a new English national church.\n\nNonconforming Protestants along with the Protestant refugees from continental Europe were the primary founders of the United States of America.\n<gallery>\nFile:John.Cotton.cropped.jpg|[[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]], who sparked the [[Antinomian Controversy]] with his [[free grace theology]].\nFile:Landing-Bacon.PNG|[[Pilgrim Fathers]] landing at [[Plymouth Rock]] in 1620.\nFile:OldShipEntrance.jpg|Built in 1681, the [[Old Ship Church]] in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] is the oldest church in America in continuous ecclesiastical use.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Butterfield | first = Fox | title = The Perfect New England Town | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/14/travel/the-perfect-new-england-village.html?sec=&spon= | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 14 May 1989 | accessdate = 30 May 2010}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-orthodoxy and paleo-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Neo-orthodoxy|Paleo-orthodoxy}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-1283-23A, Wuppertal, Evangelische Gesellschaft, Jahrestagung.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Karl Barth]], often regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian of the twentieth century<ref name = \"McGrath2011\">{{citation| first = Alister E | last = McGrath| title= Christian Theology: An Introduction |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bus5TyjTfxYC&pg=PA76 | date= 14 January 2011| publisher= John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9770-3 |page = 76}}</ref><ref name = \"BrownCollinson2012\">{{citation | first1 = Stuart | last1 = Brown | first2 = Diane | last2 = Collinson| first3 =Robert | last3 = Wilkinson | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz8OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA52 | date = 10 September 2012| publisher = Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-06043-1 | page = 52}}</ref>]]\nA non-fundamentalist rejection of liberal Christianity along the lines of the [[Christian existentialism]] of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], who attacked the [[Right Hegelians#Hegelian theologians|Hegelian]] state churches of his day for \"dead orthodoxy,\" neo-orthodoxy is associated primarily with [[Karl Barth]], [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]], and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]. Neo-orthodoxy sought to counter-act the tendency of liberal theology to make theological accommodations to modern scientific perspectives. Sometimes called \"crisis theology,\" in the existentialist sense of the word crisis, also sometimes called ''neo-evangelicalism'', which uses the sense of \"evangelical\" pertaining to continental European Protestants rather than American evangelicalism. \"Evangelical\" was the originally preferred label used by Lutherans and Calvinists, but it was replaced by the names some Catholics used to [[Labelling#Labelling in argumentation|label]] a heresy with the name of its founder.\n\n[[Paleo-orthodoxy]] is a movement similar in some respects to neo-evangelicalism but emphasizing the ancient Christian consensus of the undivided church of the first millennium AD, including in particular the early creeds and church councils as a means of properly understanding the scriptures. This movement is cross-denominational. A prominent theologian in this group is [[Thomas Oden]], a Methodist.\n\n===Christian fundamentalism===\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\nIn reaction to liberal Bible critique, [[fundamentalism]] arose in the 20th century, primarily in the United States, among those denominations most affected by Evangelicalism.\nFundamentalist theology tends to stress [[Biblical inerrancy]] and [[Biblical literalism]].\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some have tended to confuse evangelicalism and fundamentalism; however, the labels represent very distinct differences of approach that both groups are diligent to maintain, although because of fundamentalism's dramatically smaller size it often gets classified simply as an ultra-conservative branch of evangelicalism.\n\n===Modernism and liberalism===\n{{Main|Liberal Christianity}}\nModernism and liberalism do not constitute rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought into the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] within the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] in the 1920s.\n\n==Protestant culture==\n{{Main|Protestant culture}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=200\n|image1=2006 Berliner Dom Front.jpg\n|caption1=The [[Berlin Cathedral]], a [[United and uniting churches|United Protestant]] cathedral in [[Berlin]].\n|image2=Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]].''}}\n\nAlthough the Reformation was a religious movement, it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life: marriage and family, education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy, and the arts.<ref name=\"Karl Heussi 1956 pp. 317\u2013319\"/> Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" /> Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', p. 319</ref> Since about 1950, women have entered the ministry, and some have assumed leading positions (e.g. [[bishop]]s), in most Protestant churches.\n\nAs the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost.

Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology. As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other.

Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ([[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]).<ref>Heinrich Bornkamm, ''{{lang|de|Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums}}'' in ''{{lang|de|Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart}}'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937</ref> The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise ''On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture''; 1523).<ref>Original German title: ''{{lang|de|Dass eine christliche Versammlung oder Gemeine Recht und Macht habe, alle Lehre zu beurteilen und Lehrer zu berufen, ein- und abzusetzen: Grund und Ursach aus der Schrift}}''</ref> Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyter]]s) in his representative church government.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 4\u201310</ref> The [[Huguenot]]s added regional [[synod]]s and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other reformed churches<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', 11. Auflage, p. 325</ref> and was adopted by some Lutherans beginning with those in [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]] during the 17th century.\n\nPolitically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of [[democracy]]: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''{{lang|de|Evangelisches Soziallexikon}}'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). Thus he and his followers resisted political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', p. 10</ref> Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', pp. 396\u2013397</ref>\n\nConsistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[English Bill of Rights]], and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].<ref>Cf.

On the contrary, the visible unity of the ''catholic'' or ''universal church'' was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted.{{efn|For more on this, see [[crypto-paganism]] and the [[Great Apostasy#Overview|Great Apostasy]]. In some areas, pagan Europeans were forced to adopt Christianity at least outwardly, such as after being defeated in battle by Christians. However, outlawing their paganism didn't just make it go away. Rather, it persisted as crypto-paganism. For example, [[Philip Melanchthon]], in his 1537 [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] identified the mechanical character of [[ex opere operato]] sacraments as being a form of pagan [[Deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic philosophy]].}} Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. The Protestant Reformers formed a new and radically different theological opinion on ecclesiology, that the visible Church is \"catholic\" (lower-case \"c\") rather than \"Catholic\" (upper-case \"C\"). Accordingly, there is not an indefinite number of parochial, congregational or national churches, constituting, as it were, so many ecclesiastical individualities, but one great spiritual republic of which these various organizations form a part,{{efn|This is the position of the Protestants who believe the church is visible. For those who think the church is invisible, organizations are irrelevant, as only individual sinners can be saved.}} although they each have very different opinions. This was markedly far-removed from the traditional and historic Roman Catholic understanding that the Roman Catholic Church was the one true Church of Christ.{{efn|See [[Augustine of Hippo#Ecclesiology|Ecclesiology of Augustine of Hippo]] for an example of a church father who discussed the invisible church.}}\n\nYet in the Protestant understanding, the ''visible church'' is not a genus, so to speak, with so many species under it.{{efn|This is a reference to the [[Marks of the Church]] in Reformed theology. It is thus you may think of the State, but the visible church is a ''totum integrale'', it is an empire, with an ethereal emperor, rather than a visible one. The churches of the various nationalities constitute the provinces of this empire; and though they are so far independent of each other, yet they are so one, that membership in one is membership in all, and separation from one is separation from all.... This conception of the church, of which, in at least some aspects, we have practically so much lost sight, had a firm hold of the Scottish theologians of the seventeenth century. James Walker in ''The Theology of Theologians of Scotland.'' (Edinburgh: Rpt. Knox Press, 1982) Lecture iv. pp.95\u20136.}} In order to justify their departure{{efn|At least at first, Protestants did not depart per se. Rather, they were excommunicated such as in the 1520 ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' and the 1521 ''[[Edict of Worms]]''. Some Protestants avoided excommunication by living as [[crypto-Protestant]]s.}} from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument,{{efn|Some Protestants claim the church is visible today, this is a matter of dispute.}} saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a ''spiritual, invisible, and hidden church''\u2014this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nWherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received support from the ruling authorities, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole ''invisible church'', but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters,{{efn|The assertion of papal supremacy varied through history. For example, in 381 the [[First Council of Constantinople]] recognized the sees of Rome and Constantinople as being equal in authority. Papal supremacy continued to evolve after the Reformation with the [[First Vatican Council]].}} namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible [[ecclesiastical]] organization based on the 14th- and 15th-century [[Conciliarism|Conciliar movement]], rejecting the [[papacy]] and [[papal infallibility]] in favor of [[ecumenical council]]s, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the [[Council of Trent]].{{efn|Lutherans did not completely reject Trent. In fact, some attended it, although they were not given a vote. Instead, [[Martin Chemnitz]] on the basis that all councils are subject to examination, wrote the ''[[Examination of the Council of Trent]]'' in which some parts of Trent were accepted and others dissented from.}} Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action.\n\nThere are Protestants,{{efn|In history, Catholic sympathizing Protestants were termed [[crypto-papist]]s and lived as such because Catholicism was illegal in some areas under the legal principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''.

There are also ecumenical bodies at regional, national and local levels across the globe; but schisms still far outnumber unifications. One, but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement, has been the move to form united churches, such as the [[Church of South India]], the [[Church of North India]], the US-based [[United Church of Christ]], the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] and the [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines]] which have rapidly declining memberships. There has been a strong engagement of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0804/__P1T.HTM |title=Orthodox Church: text \u2013 IntraText CT |publisher=Intratext.com |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nA Protestant [[baptism]] is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize.

People who were involved in the religious movement used the word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}). For further details, see the section below. Gradually, ''protestant'' became a general term, meaning any adherent of the Reformation in the German-speaking area. It was ultimately somewhat taken up by [[Lutherans]], even though [[Martin Luther]] himself insisted on ''Christian'' or ''evangelical'' as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ. [[Huguenots|French]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Protestants instead preferred the word ''reformed'' ({{lang-fr|r\u00e9form\u00e9}}), which became a popular, neutral, and alternative name for [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Evangelical===\n[[File:evangelischeVielfalt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Direction sign]]s showing ways to two different Protestant [[Church (building)|churches]] in the German city of [[Wiesbaden]].]]\nThe word ''evangelical'' ({{lang-de|evangelisch}}), which refers to [[the gospel]], was widely used for those involved in the religious movement in the German-speaking area beginning in 1517.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |title=The Reformation: A History |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=2003 |author-link=Diarmaid MacCulloch |page=xx|title-link=The Reformation: A History }}</ref> Nowadays, ''evangelical'' is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations in the Lutheran, Calvinist, and United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed) traditions in Europe, and those with strong ties to them (e.g. [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]). Above all the term is used by Protestant bodies in the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking area]], such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. In continental Europe, an ''Evangelical'' is either a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or a United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed). The [[German language|German]] word ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' means Protestant, and is different from the German ''{{lang|de|evangelikal}}'', which refers to churches shaped by [[Evangelicalism]]. The English word ''evangelical'' usually refers to [[evangelical Protestant]] churches, and therefore to a certain part of Protestantism rather than to Protestantism as a whole. The English word traces its roots back to the [[Puritans]] in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.\n\nMartin Luther always disliked the term ''Lutheran'', preferring the term ''evangelical'', which was derived from ''euangelion'', a Greek word meaning \"good news\", i.e. \"[[The Gospel|gospel]]\".<ref name=OOE796>Esp\u00edn, Orlando O. and Nickoloff, James B. ''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies''. Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press, p. 796.</ref> The followers of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and other theologians linked to the [[Reformed tradition]] also began to use that term. To distinguish the two evangelical groups, others began to refer to the two groups as ''Evangelical Lutheran'' and ''Evangelical Reformed''. Nowadays, the word also pertains in the same way to some other mainline groups, for example ''Evangelical Methodist''. As time passed by, the word ''evangelical'' was dropped. Lutherans themselves began to use the term ''Lutheran'' in the middle of the 16th century, in order to distinguish themselves from other groups such as the [[Philippists]] and [[Calvinists]].\n\n===Reformational===\nThe German word ''{{lang|de|reformatorisch}}'', which roughly translates to English as \"reformational\" or \"reforming\", is used as an alternative for ''{{lang|de|evangelisch}}'' in German, and is different from English ''reformed'' ({{lang-de|reformiert}}), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and other Reformed theologians. Being derived from the word \"Reformation\", the term emerged around the same time as ''evangelical'' (1517) and ''protestant'' (1529).\n\n==Theology==\n\n===Main principles===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|image1=Mikolow protestant church pulpit.jpg\n|caption1=Key figures of the Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther and John Calvin depicted on a church [[pulpit]].

The supreme authority of [[religious text|scripture]] is a fundamental principle of Protestantism.}}\n\nVarious experts on the subject tried to determine what makes a Christian denomination a part of Protestantism. A common consensus approved by most of them is that if a Christian denomination is to be considered Protestant, it must acknowledge the following three fundamental principles of Protestantism.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" />\n\n;Scripture alone:\n{{main|Sola Scriptura}}\nThe belief, emphasized by Luther, in the Bible as the [[Sola scriptura|highest source of authority]] for the church. The early churches of the Reformation believed in a critical, yet serious, reading of scripture and holding the Bible as a source of authority higher than that of [[Sacred Tradition|church tradition]]. The many abuses that had occurred in the Western Church before the Protestant Reformation led the Reformers to reject much of its tradition, though some{{who|date= November 2018}} would maintain tradition has been maintained and reorganized in the liturgy and in the confessions of the Protestant churches of the Reformation. In the early 20th century, a less critical reading of the Bible developed in the United States, leading to a \"fundamentalist\" reading of Scripture. Christian fundamentalists read the Bible as the \"inerrant, infallible\" Word of God, as do the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran churches, but interpret it in a literalist fashion without using the historical critical method.\n\n\"Biblical Christianity\" focused on a deep study of the Bible is characteristic of most Protestants as opposed to \"Church Christianity\", focused on performing rituals and good works, represented by Catholic and Orthodox traditions. However Quakers and Pentecostalists, emphasize the Holy Spirit and personal closeness to God.<ref>Woodhead, Linda. ''Christianity: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press, 2014) pp. 57\u201370</ref>\n\n;Justification by faith alone:\n{{main|Sola Fide}}\nThe belief that believers are [[justification (theology)|justified]], or pardoned for sin, solely on condition of faith in [[Jesus|Christ]] rather than a combination of faith and [[good works]]. For Protestants, good works are a necessary consequence rather than cause of justification.<ref name=\"SchaffHerzog\">Johann Jakob Herzog, Philip Schaff, Albert.

It is opposed to the hierarchical system which puts the essence and authority of the Church in an exclusive priesthood, and makes ordained priests the necessary mediators between God and the people.<ref name=\"SchaffHerzog\" /> It is distinguished from the concept of the priesthood of all believers, which did not grant individuals the right to interpret the Bible apart from the Christian community at large because universal priesthood opened the door to such a possibility.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Unitarianism and the Protestant Dilemma: The Conundrum of Biblical Authority|last=Willsky-Ciollo|first=Lydia|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2015|isbn=9780739188927|location=Lanham, MD|pages=9\u201310}}</ref> There are scholars who cite that this doctrine tends to subsume all distinctions in the church under a single spiritual entity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spiritual Theology: A Systematic Study of the Christian Life|last=Chan|first=Simon|publisher=IVP Academic|year=1998|isbn=9780830815425|location=Downers Grove, IL|pages=105}}</ref> Calvin referred to the universal priesthood as an expression of the relation between the believer and his God, including the freedom of a Christian to come to God through Christ without human mediation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Church in the Theology of the Reformers|last=Avis|first=Paul|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2002|isbn=1592441009|location=Eugene, OR|pages=95}}</ref> He also maintained that this principle recognizes Christ as [[prophet]], priest, and king and that his priesthood is shared with his people.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Trinity===\n{{See also|Trinity|Nontrinitarianism}}\n[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief that God is one God in three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]), and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|God the Holy Spirit]].]]\nProtestants who adhere to the [[Nicene Creed]] believe in three [[person]]s ([[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]) as one God.\n\nMovements emerging around the time of the Protestant Reformation, but not a part of Protestantism, e.g. [[Unitarianism]] also reject the Trinity. This often serves as a reason for exclusion of the [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] and other movements from Protestantism by various observers. Unitarianism continues to have a presence mainly in Transylvania, England and the United States, as well as elsewhere.\n\n===Five solae===\n{{Main|Five solae}}\n{{Five solae}}\n\nThe Five ''{{lang|la|solae}}'' are five [[Latin]] phrases (or slogans) that emerged during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and summarize the reformers' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] of the day. The Latin word ''{{lang|la|sola}}'' means \"alone\", \"only\", or \"single\".\n\nThe use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation, based on the overarching principle of ''{{lang|la|[[sola scriptura]]}}'' (by scripture alone). This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible: that its teaching is needed for salvation (necessity); that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone (sufficiency); that everything taught in the Bible is correct (inerrancy); and that, by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin, believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself, though understanding is difficult, so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church (clarity).\n\nThe necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text.\n\nThe second main principle, ''{{lang|la|[[sola fide]]}}'' (by faith alone), states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation. Though argued from scripture, and hence logically consequent to ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'', this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers. Because ''{{lang|la|sola scriptura}}'' placed the Bible as the only source of teaching, ''{{lang|la|sola fide}}'' epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to, namely the direct, close, personal connection between Christ and the believer, hence the reformers' contention that their work was Christocentric.\n\nThe other solas, as statements, emerged later, but the thinking they represent was also part of the early Reformation.\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Solus Christus]]}}'': ''Christ alone''\n: The Protestants characterize the dogma concerning the Pope as Christ's representative head of the Church on earth, the concept of works made meritorious by Christ, and the Catholic idea of a treasury of the merits of Christ and his saints, as a denial that Christ is the ''only'' mediator between [[God]] and man. Catholics, on the other hand, maintained the traditional understanding of Judaism on these questions, and appealed to the universal consensus of Christian tradition.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Matt.|16:18}}, {{Bibleref2|1Cor.|3:11||1 Cor. 3:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph.|2:20}}, {{Bibleref2|1Pet.|2:5\u20136||1 Pet. 2:5\u20136}}, {{Bibleref2|Rev.|21:14}}</ref>\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Sola Gratia]]}}'': ''Grace alone''\n: Protestants perceived Roman Catholic salvation to be dependent upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God on account of the change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one ''deserves'' salvation.{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|7:21}}\n* ''{{lang|la|[[Soli Deo Gloria]]}}'': ''Glory to God alone''\n: All glory is due to God alone since salvation is accomplished solely through his will and action\u2014not only the gift of the all-sufficient [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus]] on [[Christian cross|the cross]] but also the gift of faith in that atonement, created in the heart of the believer by the [[Holy Spirit]]. The reformers believed that human beings\u2014even saints [[canonization|canonized]] by the Catholic Church, the popes, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy\u2014are not worthy of the glory.\n\n===Christ's presence in the Eucharist===\n{{Main|Eucharistic theology}}\n\n[[File:Abendmahl-1547-LC.jpg|thumb|A Lutheran depiction of the [[Last Supper]] by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1547.]]\nThe Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century. One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the [[Eucharist]]. Early Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic [[dogma]] of [[transubstantiation]], which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion.\n* Lutherans hold that within the [[Lord's Supper]] the consecrated elements of bread and wine are the true body and blood of Christ \"in, with, and under the form\" of bread and wine for all those who eat and drink it,{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:16|47}} {{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|11:20,27|47}}<ref>Engelder, T.E.W., [https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 ''Popular Symbolics''].

Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the [[sacrament]] but instead affirm that Christ is united to the believer through faith\u2014toward which the supper is an outward and visible aid. This is often referred to as ''dynamic presence''.\n* Anglicans and Methodists refuse to define the Presence, preferring to leave it a mystery.<ref name=\"Neal2014\">{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Gregory S.|title=Sacramental Theology and the Christian Life|date=19 December 2014|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781490860077|page=111|quote=For Anglicans and Methodists the reality of the presence of Jesus as received through the sacramental elements is not in question. Real presence is simply accepted as being true, its mysterious nature being affirmed and even lauded in official statements like ''This Holy Mystery: A United Methodist Understanding of Holy Communion.}}</ref> The Prayer Books describe the bread and wine as outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace which is the Body and Blood of Christ. However, the words of their liturgies suggest that one can hold to a belief in the Real Presence and Spiritual and Sacramental Present at the same time. For example, \"... and you have fed us with the spiritual food in the Sacrament of his body and Blood;\" \"...the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, and for assuring us in these holy mysteries...\" American Book of Common Prayer, 1977, pp.&nbsp;365\u2013366. Perhaps the best way to see it is that the Anglican view incorporates all three of the above positions and the Roman and Orthodox. The classic Anglican and Methodist view is that the bread and wine are instruments of God's Grace. Perhaps the closest that one can get to pinning down an Anglican view (they are notorious for refusing to so) are the words of St. John of Damascus, \"the bread and wine are visible symbols of a spiritual reality.\" The symbol is not empty but the visible to another reality present.\n* Anabaptists hold a popular simplification of the [[Theology of Huldrych Zwingli|Zwinglian view]], without concern for theological intricacies as hinted at above, may see the Lord's Supper merely as a symbol of the shared faith of the participants, a commemoration of the facts of the crucifixion, and a reminder of their standing together as the body of Christ (a view referred to as ''memorialism'').<ref name=\"Balmer2002\">{{cite book|last1=Balmer|first1=Randall Herbert|last2=Winner|first2=Lauren F.|title=Protestantism in America|url=https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=9780231111300|page=[https://archive.org/details/protestantismame00balm_593/page/n42 26]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Protestantism}}\n\n===Pre-Reformation===\n{{See also|Proto-Protestantism|Girolamo Savonarola}}\n[[File:Muttich, Kamil Vladislav - Mistr Jan Hus na hranici v Kostnici 1415.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of [[Jan Hus]] in 1415.]]\n[[File:lollardmap.jpg|thumb|right|Spread of [[Lollardy]] in [[medieval England]] and [[medieval Scotland]].]]\n\nIn the late 1130s, [[Arnold of Brescia]], an Italian [[canon regular]] became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Roman Catholic Church. After his death, his teachings on [[apostolic poverty]] gained currency among [[Arnoldists]], and later more widely among [[Waldensians]] and the [[Spiritual Franciscans]], though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. In the early 1170s, [[Peter Waldo]] founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution. Despite that, the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy, as [[Waldensian Evangelical Church|a part of the wider Reformed tradition]].\n\nIn the 1370s, [[John Wycliffe]]\u2014later dubbed the \"Morning Star of Reformation\"\u2014started his activity as an English reformer. He rejected papal authority over secular power, [[Wycliffe's Bible|translated the Bible]] into [[vernacular]] [[English language|English]], and preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms.\n\nBeginning in the first decade of the 15th century, [[Jan Hus]]\u2014a Roman Catholic priest, Czech reformist and professor\u2014influenced by John Wycliffe's writings, founded the [[Hussite]] movement. He strongly advocated his reformist [[Bohemian]] religious denomination. He was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] and [[burned at the stake]] in [[Constance]], [[Bishopric of Constance]] in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy. After his execution, a revolt erupted. Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the [[Pope]].\n\nLater on, theological disputes caused a split within the Hussite movement. [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] maintained that both the bread and the wine should be administered to the people during the Eucharist. Another major faction were the [[Taborites]], who opposed the Utraquists in the [[Battle of Lipany]] during the [[Hussite Wars]]. There were two separate parties among the Hussites: moderate and radical movements. Other smaller regional Hussite branches in [[Bohemia]] included [[Adamites]], [[Orebites]], [[Sirotci|Orphans]] and Praguers.\n\nThe Hussite Wars concluded with the victory of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], his Catholic allies and moderate Hussites and the defeat of the radical Hussites. Tensions arose as the [[Thirty Years' War]] reached Bohemia in 1620. Both moderate and radical Hussitism was increasingly persecuted by Catholics and Holy Roman Emperor's armies.\n\nStarting in 1475, an Italian Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]] was calling for a Christian renewal. Later on, Martin Luther himself read some of the friar's writings and praised him as a martyr and forerunner whose ideas on faith and grace anticipated Luther's own doctrine of justification by faith alone.\n\nSome of Hus' followers founded the [[Unitas Fratrum]]\u2014\"Unity of the Brethren\"\u2014which was renewed under the leadership of [[Zinzendorf|Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf]] in [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]] in 1722 after its almost total destruction in the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]].

The theses debated and criticized many aspects of the Church and the papacy, including the practice of [[Purgatory#Protestantism|purgatory]], [[Particular judgment#Reformation concepts|particular judgment]], and the authority of the pope. Luther would later write works against the Catholic devotion to [[Virgin Mary]], the intercession of and devotion to the saints, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, good works, and the sacraments.<ref name=Schofield122>Schofield ''Martin Luther'' p. 122</ref>\n\nThe [[Reformation]] was a triumph of literacy and the new [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]].<ref name=Cameron>Cameron ''European Reformation''{{page needed|date=March 2015}}</ref>{{efn|In the end, while the Reformation emphasis on Protestants reading the Scriptures was one factor in the development of literacy, the impact of printing itself, the wider availability of printed works at a cheaper price, and the increasing focus on education and learning as key factors in obtaining a lucrative post, were also significant contributory factors.<ref name=Pettegree543>Pettegree ''Reformation World'' p. 543</ref>}}  Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets.

After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the [[Bern]] reformer [[William Farel]], Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the city of [[Geneva]]. His ''Ordinances of 1541'' involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563.\n\nProtestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed [[Huguenots]]. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of [[Henry II of France]] in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when [[Henry IV of France]] issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official [[state religion]], and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV's]] [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg]] declared the [[Edict of Potsdam]], giving free passage to Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the [[C\u00e9vennes]] region.\n\nParallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the [[Swiss Confederation]] led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince [[Philip of Hesse]] saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the [[Colloquy of Marburg]], which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine.\n\nIn 1534, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] put an end to all papal jurisdiction in [[England]], after the Pope failed to [[annul]] his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]];<ref>William P. Haugaard \"The History of Anglicanism I\" in ''The Study of Anglicanism'' Stephen Sykes and John Booty (eds) (SPCK 1987) pp. 6\u20137</ref> this opened the door to reformational ideas. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (''{{lang|la|via media}}'') between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the [[English Reformation]] came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as ''the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England''. Between 1535 and 1540, under [[Thomas Cromwell]], the policy known as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]. The [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.\n\nThe success of the [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritans|Puritan party]] dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the [[Elizabethan Age]]. The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The later Puritan movement, often referred to as [[dissenters]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]], eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations.\n\nThe [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560 decisively shaped the [[Church of Scotland]].<ref>Article 1, of the [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish Reformation'.</ref> The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation. The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament]] of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the [[Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560]], forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith. It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent [[Mary of Guise]], who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent [[Mary, Queen of Scots|daughter]].\n\nSome of the most important activists of the Protestant Reformation included [[Jacobus Arminius]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[Andreas von Carlstadt]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[William Farel]], [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]], [[Laurentius Petri]], [[Olaus Petri]], [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Menno Simons]], [[Louis de Berquin]], [[Primo\u017e Trubar]] and [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]].\n\nIn the course of this religious upheaval, the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524\u201325 swept through the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Thuringia]]n and [[Swabia]]n principalities. After the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the [[Low Countries]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]], the confessional division of the [[states of the Holy Roman Empire]] eventually erupted in the [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648. It devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25% and 40% of its population.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe \u2013 Demographics]\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref> The main tenets of the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:\n* All parties would now recognise the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism. (the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'')\n* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.\n* The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power. [[Pope Innocent X]] declared the treaty \"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times\" in his bull ''{{lang|la|Zelo Domus Dei}}''. European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.<ref name=ODCCWestphalia>Cross, (ed.) \"Westphalia, Peace of\" ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = center\n | total_width = 700\n | direction = vertical\n\n | image1 = The Protestant Reformation.svg\n | caption1 = Peak of the Reformation & beginning of the Counter-Reformation (1545\u20131620)\n\n | image2 = The Counterreformation.svg\n | caption2 = End of the Reformation & Counter-Reformation (1648)\n\n | footer = Religious situation in Europe, late 16th & early to mid 17th century}}\n\n===Post-Reformation===\n{{See also|Great Awakenings|Azusa Street Revival}}\n{{Great awakenings}}\n\nThe Great Awakenings were periods of rapid and dramatic religious revival in Anglo-American religious history.\n\nThe [[First Great Awakening]] was an evangelical and revitalization movement that swept through Protestant Europe and [[British America]], especially the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on [[Protestantism in the United States|American Protestantism]]. It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism and hierarchy, it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref>\n\n[[File:1839-meth.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|1839 [[Methodist]] camp meeting during the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the U.S.]]\n\nThe [[Second Great Awakening]] began around 1790. It gained momentum by 1800. After 1820, membership rose rapidly among [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1840s. It has been described as a reaction against skepticism, [[deism]], and [[rationalism]], although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood.<ref>[[Nancy Cott]], \"Young Women in the Great Awakening in New England,\" Feminist Studies 3, no. 1/2 (Autumn 1975): 15.</ref> It enrolled millions of new members in existing [[evangelical]] denominations and led to the formation of new denominations.\n\nThe [[Third Great Awakening]] refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in [[American history]] and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century.<ref>William G.

It was affiliated with the [[Social Gospel]] Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]], [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]], and [[Christian Science]] movements.<ref name=Fogel>Robert William Fogel, ''The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism'' (2000)</ref>\n\nThe [[Fourth Great Awakening]] was a Christian religious awakening that some scholars\u2014most notably, [[Robert Fogel]]\u2014say took place in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while others look at the era following [[World War II]]. The terminology is controversial. Thus, the idea of a Fourth Great Awakening itself has not been generally accepted.<ref>Robert William Fogel (2000), ''The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism''; see the review by Randall Balmer, ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 2002 33(2): 322\u2013325</ref>\n\nIn 1814, [[R\u00e9veil|Le R\u00e9veil]] swept through Calvinist regions in Switzerland and France.\n\nIn 1904, a [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival|Protestant revival in Wales]] had tremendous impact on the local population. A part of British modernization, it drew many people to churches, especially Methodist and Baptist ones.\n\nA noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal movement]]. Sprung from Methodist and [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] roots, it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on [[Azusa Street]] in Los Angeles. From there it spread around the world, carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there. These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history, such as seen in the two Great Awakenings. Pentecostalism, which in turn birthed the [[Charismatic movement]] within already established denominations, continues to be an important force in [[Western Christianity]].\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere in the world, there has been a marked rise in the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical wing]] of Protestant denominations, especially those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream liberal churches]]. In the post\u2013[[World War I]] era, [[Liberal Christianity]] was on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the post\u2013[[World War II]] era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures.\n\nIn Europe, there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards [[secularism]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is largely responsible for the spread of secularism. Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism, attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant-majority countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2012/03/has-lutheranism-caused-secularism/|title=Has Lutheranism caused secularism?|last=Cranach|date=22 March 2012}}</ref> In North America, South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe. United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other [[developed countries]]. South America, historically Roman Catholic, has experienced a large [[Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n==Radical Reformation==\n{{Main|Radical Reformation}}\n[[File:T\u00e4uferdisputation 1525.jpg|thumb|Dissatisfaction with the outcome of a disputation in 1525 prompted [[Swiss Brethren]] to part ways with [[Huldrych Zwingli]].]]\n\nUnlike mainstream [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinist]] and Zwinglian movements, the [[Radical Reformation]], which had no state sponsorship, generally abandoned the idea of the \"Church visible\" as distinct from the \"Church invisible\". It was a rational extension of the state-approved Protestant dissent, which took the value of independence from constituted authority a step further, arguing the same for the civic realm. The Radical Reformation was non-mainstream, though in parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, a majority would sympathize with the Radical Reformation despite the intense persecution it faced from both Roman Catholics and Magisterial Protestants.<ref name=horsch>{{cite book|last=Horsch|first=John|authorlink=John Horsch|title=Mennonites in Europe|date=1995|publisher=Herald Press|isbn=978-0836113952|page=299}}</ref>\n\nThe early [[Anabaptists]] believed that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gonzalez, ''A History of Christian Thought'', 88.</ref> Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor by the use of the sword; [[Christianity]] was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Protestant ecclesial leaders such as [[Balthasar Hubmaier|Hubmaier]] and [[Melchior Hoffman|Hofmann]] preached the invalidity of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion ([[Believers baptism|\"believer's baptism\"]]) instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the [[Catharism|Albigenses]] in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] was involved in the [[German Peasants' War]]. [[Andreas Karlstadt]] disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers.<ref name=GAMEO-Karlstadt>{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Gerhard|title=Karlstadt, Andreas Rudolff-Bodenstein von (1486\u20131541)|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Karlstadt,_Andreas_Rudolff-Bodenstein_von_(1486-1541)|website=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> [[Kaspar Schwenkfeld]] and [[Sebastian Franck]] were influenced by [[German mysticism]] and [[spiritualism]].\n\nIn the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation, the [[Magisterial Reformation]] had not gone far enough. Radical Reformer, [[Andreas Karlstadt|Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt]], for example, referred to the Lutheran theologians at [[Wittenberg]] as the \"new papists\".<ref>[http://www.reformationhappens.com/movements/magisterial/ The Magisterial Reformation].</ref> Since the term \"magister\" also means \"teacher\", the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher. This is made evident in the prominence of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry. Because of their authority, they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes. A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of [[Hans Hut]], although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism.\n\nAnabaptism in shape of its various diversification such as the [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Hutterites]] came out of the Radical Reformation. Later in history, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], and the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] would emerge in Anabaptist circles.\n\n==Denominations==\n{{See also|List of Christian denominations#Protestant|List of the largest Protestant churches}}\n[[File:Map of state religions (detailed).svg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Protestantism as [[state religion]]:\n{{legend|#062A87|[[Lutheranism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF2400|[[Anglicanism]]}}\n{{legend|#FF7F00|[[Calvinism]]}}\n{{legend|#FC0FC0|[[Methodism]]}}]]\n\nProtestants refer to specific groupings of congregations or churches that share in common foundational doctrines and the name of their groups as [[List of Christian Denominations#Protestant|denominations]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkhVtAEwZckC&pg=PA135|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 1996\u20131997|date=1996|publisher=Diane Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780788129056}}</ref> The term denomination (national body) is to be distinguished from branch (denominational family; tradition), communion (international body) and congregation (church).

Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith, [[non-denominational]] groups and organizations are also considered Protestant.\n\nVarious [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical movements]] have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations, according to various models of union, but divisions continue to outpace unions, as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance, which can authoritatively define the faith.

As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia 1809\u20131917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and a state church separate from Sweden, later named the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], was established. It was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity when the new church law came to force in 1869. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919 and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922. Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland lost its position as a state church but gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], whose position, however, is not codified in the constitution.}} Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state, it is not described as a [[state religion]] in the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish Constitution]] or other laws passed by the [[Finnish Parliament]].<ref name=FinlandConstitution>[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html Finland \u2013 Constitution], Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html.</ref> In 2000, Sweden was the second Nordic country to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf|title=Maarit J\u00e4nter\u00e4-Jareborg: Religion and the Secular State in Sweden}}</ref>\n\n===United and uniting churches===\n{{Main|United and uniting churches}}\n{{See also|Continuing churches}}\n[[File:Union luthercalvin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Glass window in the town church of [[Wiesloch]] (''Stadtkirche [[Wiesloch]]'') with [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] commemorating the 1821 union of Lutheran and Reformed churches in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].]]\nUnited and uniting churches are churches formed from the merger or other form of union of two or more different Protestant denominations.\n\nHistorically, unions of Protestant churches were enforced by the state, usually in order to have a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern [[Christian ecumenism]] progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the [[United Protestant Church of France]] (2013) and the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] due to the rise of [[secularism]], [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among [[evangelical]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] and [[charismatic]] churches as new ones arise and plenty of them remain independent of each other.\n\nPerhaps the oldest official united church is found in [[Germany]], where the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] is a federation of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], United ([[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]]) and [[Reformed churches]], a union dating back to 1817. The first of the series of unions was at a synod in [[Idstein]] to form the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]] in August 1817, commemorated in naming the church of Idstein [[Unionskirche, Idstein|Unionskirche]] one hundred years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-jb-kirche.htm |title=Staatlicher Dirigismus und neue Gl\u00e4ubigkeit (Die Kirche im Herzogtum Nassau) |publisher= Nassau-info.de |language=German}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, each united or uniting church comprises a different mix of predecessor Protestant denominations. Trends are visible, however, as most united and uniting churches have one or more predecessors with heritage in the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]] and many are members of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].\n\n==Major branches==\nProtestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation, today regarded as branches. Some of these movements have a common lineage, sometimes directly spawning individual denominations. Due to the earlier stated multitude of [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]], this section discusses only the largest denominational families, or branches, widely considered to be a part of Protestantism. These are, in alphabetical order: [[Adventism|Adventist]], [[Anglican]], [[Baptist]], [[Calvinism|Calvinist (Reformed)]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Pentecostal]]. A small but historically significant [[Anabaptist]] branch is also discussed.\n\nThe chart below shows the mutual relations and historical origins of the main Protestant denominational families, or their parts. Due to factors such as [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]] and the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'', many people lived as [[Nicodemite]]s, where their professed religious affiliations were more or less at odds with the movement they sympathized with. As a result, the boundaries between the denominations do not separate as cleanly as this chart indicates. When a population was suppressed or persecuted into feigning an adherence to the dominant faith, over the generations they continued to influence the church they outwardly adhered to.\n\nBecause Calvinism was not specifically recognized in the Holy Roman Empire until the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, many Calvinists lived as [[Crypto-Calvinists]]. Due to Counter-Reformation related suppressions in Catholic lands during the 16th through 19th centuries, many Protestants lived as [[crypto-protestantism|Crypto-Protestants]]. Meanwhile, in Protestant areas, Catholics sometimes lived as [[crypto-papist]]s, although in continental Europe emigration was more feasible so this was less common.\n\n[[File:Protestant branches.svg|thumb|upright=2.95|center|Historical chart of the main Protestant branches.]]\n\n===Adventism===\n{{Main|Adventism}}\nAdventism began in the 19th century in the context of the [[Second Great Awakening]] revival in the [[United States]].

Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the [[five points of Calvinism]], though these points identify the Calvinist view on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] rather than summarizing the system as a whole.

The term ''Pentecostal'' is derived from [[Pentecost]], the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the Jewish [[Feast of Weeks]]. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] upon the followers of [[Jesus Christ]], as described in the [[Second Chapter of Acts|second chapter]] of the [[Book of Acts]].\n\nThis branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit\u2013filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of [[spiritual gift]]s such as [[speaking in tongues]] and [[divine healing]]\u2014two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the [[Apostolic Age]] of the [[early church]]. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term ''Apostolic'' or ''[[Full Gospel]]'' to describe their movement.\n\nPentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations, including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ, both in the United States and elsewhere. There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide, and the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the [[global South]]. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches through the [[Charismatic Movement]].

His teachings held to the [[five solae]] of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and other [[Protestant Reformers]]. Jacobus Arminius was a student of [[Theodore Beza]] at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a [[soteriological]] diversification of [[Calvinism]].<ref>\"Chambers Biographical Dictionary,\" ed. Magnus Magnusson (Chambers: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 62.</ref> However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.<ref>Kenneth D. Keathley, \"The Work of God: Salvation,\" in ''A Theology for the Church'', ed. Daniel L. Akin (Nashville: B&H Academic, 2007), 703.</ref> Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the [[Baptists]] in the 16th century,<ref>Robert G. Torbet, ''A History of the Baptists'', third edition</ref> the [[Methodists]] in the 18th century and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in the 19th century.\n\nThe original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself are commonly defined as Arminianism, but more broadly, the term may embrace the teachings of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Wesley]], and others as well. [[Arminianism#Classical Arminianism|Classical Arminianism]] and [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]] are the two main schools of thought. Wesleyan Arminianism is often identical with Methodism. The two systems of Calvinism and Arminianism share both history and many doctrines, and the [[History of Christianity|history of Christian theology]]. However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine [[predestination]] and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. In short, the difference can be seen ultimately by whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion.  Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.<ref>Gonzalez, Justo L.

While declining as an identifiable Lutheran group, some of its theological tenets influenced Protestantism generally, inspiring the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest [[John Wesley]] to begin the [[Methodism|Methodist]] movement and [[Alexander Mack]] to begin the [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]] movement among [[Anabaptists]].\n\nThough Pietism shares an emphasis on personal behavior with the [[Puritan]] movement, and the two are often confused, there are important differences, particularly in the concept of the role of religion in government.<ref>Calvinist Puritans believed that government was ordained by God to enforce Christian behavior upon the world; pietists see the government as a part of the world, and believers were called to voluntarily live faithful lives independent of government.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Philipp Jakob Spener.jpg|[[Philipp Jakob Spener]], German pioneer and founder of Pietism.\nFile:Pietism.JPG|Pietism has been a strong cultural influence in Scandinavia.\nFile:Der breite und der schmale Weg 2008.jpg|''The Broad and the Narrow Way'', a popular German Pietist painting, 1866.\n</gallery>\n\n===Puritanism, English dissenters and nonconformists===\n{{Main|Puritanism|English Dissenters|Independent (religion)|Nonconformist (Protestantism){{!}}Nonconformism|English Presbyterianism|Ecclesiastical separatism|17th-century denominations in England}}\n\nThe Puritans were a group of English Protestants in the [[Christianity in the 16th century|16th]] and [[Christianity in the 17th century|17th centuries]], which sought to purify the [[Church of England]] of what they considered to be [[Roman Catholic]] practices, maintaining that the church was only partially reformed. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some of the returning [[Marian exiles|clergy exiled under Mary I]] shortly after the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1558, as an activist movement within the [[Church of England]].\n\nPuritans were blocked from changing the established church from within, and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands (and later to New England), and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later into Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the [[Synod of Dort]] they were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted [[Puritan Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarianism]] in the 17th century, and were influenced by [[millennialism]].\n\nThey formed, and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of [[worship]] and [[doctrine]], as well as personal and group [[pietism|piety]]. Puritans adopted a [[Reformed theology]], but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva. In church polity, some advocated for separation from all other Christians, in favor of autonomous [[gathered church]]es. These separatist and [[independent (religion)|independent]] strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a [[Presbyterian polity]] in the [[Westminster Assembly]] were unable to forge a new English national church.\n\nNonconforming Protestants along with the Protestant refugees from continental Europe were the primary founders of the United States of America.\n<gallery>\nFile:John.Cotton.cropped.jpg|[[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]], who sparked the [[Antinomian Controversy]] with his [[free grace theology]].\nFile:Landing-Bacon.PNG|[[Pilgrim Fathers]] landing at [[Plymouth Rock]] in 1620.\nFile:OldShipEntrance.jpg|Built in 1681, the [[Old Ship Church]] in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] is the oldest church in America in continuous ecclesiastical use.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Butterfield | first = Fox | title = The Perfect New England Town | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/14/travel/the-perfect-new-england-village.html?sec=&spon= | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 14 May 1989 | accessdate = 30 May 2010}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Neo-orthodoxy and paleo-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Neo-orthodoxy|Paleo-orthodoxy}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-1283-23A, Wuppertal, Evangelische Gesellschaft, Jahrestagung.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Karl Barth]], often regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian of the twentieth century<ref name = \"McGrath2011\">{{citation| first = Alister E | last = McGrath| title= Christian Theology: An Introduction |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bus5TyjTfxYC&pg=PA76 | date= 14 January 2011| publisher= John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9770-3 |page = 76}}</ref><ref name = \"BrownCollinson2012\">{{citation | first1 = Stuart | last1 = Brown | first2 = Diane | last2 = Collinson| first3 =Robert | last3 = Wilkinson | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz8OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA52 | date = 10 September 2012| publisher = Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-06043-1 | page = 52}}</ref>]]\nA non-fundamentalist rejection of liberal Christianity along the lines of the [[Christian existentialism]] of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], who attacked the [[Right Hegelians#Hegelian theologians|Hegelian]] state churches of his day for \"dead orthodoxy,\" neo-orthodoxy is associated primarily with [[Karl Barth]], [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]], and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]. Neo-orthodoxy sought to counter-act the tendency of liberal theology to make theological accommodations to modern scientific perspectives. Sometimes called \"crisis theology,\" in the existentialist sense of the word crisis, also sometimes called ''neo-evangelicalism'', which uses the sense of \"evangelical\" pertaining to continental European Protestants rather than American evangelicalism. \"Evangelical\" was the originally preferred label used by Lutherans and Calvinists, but it was replaced by the names some Catholics used to [[Labelling#Labelling in argumentation|label]] a heresy with the name of its founder.\n\n[[Paleo-orthodoxy]] is a movement similar in some respects to neo-evangelicalism but emphasizing the ancient Christian consensus of the undivided church of the first millennium AD, including in particular the early creeds and church councils as a means of properly understanding the scriptures. This movement is cross-denominational. A prominent theologian in this group is [[Thomas Oden]], a Methodist.\n\n===Christian fundamentalism===\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\nIn reaction to liberal Bible critique, [[fundamentalism]] arose in the 20th century, primarily in the United States, among those denominations most affected by Evangelicalism.\nFundamentalist theology tends to stress [[Biblical inerrancy]] and [[Biblical literalism]].\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some have tended to confuse evangelicalism and fundamentalism; however, the labels represent very distinct differences of approach that both groups are diligent to maintain, although because of fundamentalism's dramatically smaller size it often gets classified simply as an ultra-conservative branch of evangelicalism.\n\n===Modernism and liberalism===\n{{Main|Liberal Christianity}}\nModernism and liberalism do not constitute rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought into the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] within the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] in the 1920s.\n\n==Protestant culture==\n{{Main|Protestant culture}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=200\n|image1=2006 Berliner Dom Front.jpg\n|caption1=The [[Berlin Cathedral]], a [[United and uniting churches|United Protestant]] cathedral in [[Berlin]].\n|image2=Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]].''}}\n\nAlthough the Reformation was a religious movement, it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life: marriage and family, education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy, and the arts.<ref name=\"Karl Heussi 1956 pp. 317\u2013319\"/> Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry.<ref name = \"Encyclopedia of Protestantism\" /> Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', p. 319</ref> Since about 1950, women have entered the ministry, and some have assumed leading positions (e.g. [[bishop]]s), in most Protestant churches.\n\nAs the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost.

As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other.

Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ([[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]).<ref>Heinrich Bornkamm, ''{{lang|de|Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums}}'' in ''{{lang|de|Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart}}'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937</ref> The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise ''On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture''; 1523).<ref>Original German title: ''{{lang|de|Dass eine christliche Versammlung oder Gemeine Recht und Macht habe, alle Lehre zu beurteilen und Lehrer zu berufen, ein- und abzusetzen: Grund und Ursach aus der Schrift}}''</ref> Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyter]]s) in his representative church government.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 4\u201310</ref> The [[Huguenot]]s added regional [[synod]]s and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other reformed churches<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', 11. Auflage, p. 325</ref> and was adopted by some Lutherans beginning with those in [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]] during the 17th century.\n\nPolitically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of [[democracy]]: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''{{lang|de|Evangelisches Soziallexikon}}'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). Thus he and his followers resisted political [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', p. 10</ref> Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Pierre Bayle]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''{{lang|de|Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte}}'', pp. 396\u2013397</ref>\n\nConsistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Milton]], [[John Locke]], the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[English Bill of Rights]], and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].<ref>Cf.

On the contrary, the visible unity of the ''catholic'' or ''universal church'' was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted.{{efn|For more on this, see [[crypto-paganism]] and the [[Great Apostasy#Overview|Great Apostasy]]. In some areas, pagan Europeans were forced to adopt Christianity at least outwardly, such as after being defeated in battle by Christians. However, outlawing their paganism didn't just make it go away. Rather, it persisted as crypto-paganism. For example, [[Philip Melanchthon]], in his 1537 [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] identified the mechanical character of [[ex opere operato]] sacraments as being a form of pagan [[Deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic philosophy]].}} Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. The Protestant Reformers formed a new and radically different theological opinion on ecclesiology, that the visible Church is \"catholic\" (lower-case \"c\") rather than \"Catholic\" (upper-case \"C\"). Accordingly, there is not an indefinite number of parochial, congregational or national churches, constituting, as it were, so many ecclesiastical individualities, but one great spiritual republic of which these various organizations form a part,{{efn|This is the position of the Protestants who believe the church is visible. For those who think the church is invisible, organizations are irrelevant, as only individual sinners can be saved.}} although they each have very different opinions. This was markedly far-removed from the traditional and historic Roman Catholic understanding that the Roman Catholic Church was the one true Church of Christ.{{efn|See [[Augustine of Hippo#Ecclesiology|Ecclesiology of Augustine of Hippo]] for an example of a church father who discussed the invisible church.}}\n\nYet in the Protestant understanding, the ''visible church'' is not a genus, so to speak, with so many species under it.{{efn|This is a reference to the [[Marks of the Church]] in Reformed theology. It is thus you may think of the State, but the visible church is a ''totum integrale'', it is an empire, with an ethereal emperor, rather than a visible one. The churches of the various nationalities constitute the provinces of this empire; and though they are so far independent of each other, yet they are so one, that membership in one is membership in all, and separation from one is separation from all.... This conception of the church, of which, in at least some aspects, we have practically so much lost sight, had a firm hold of the Scottish theologians of the seventeenth century. James Walker in ''The Theology of Theologians of Scotland.'' (Edinburgh: Rpt. Knox Press, 1982) Lecture iv. pp.95\u20136.}} In order to justify their departure{{efn|At least at first, Protestants did not depart per se. Rather, they were excommunicated such as in the 1520 ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' and the 1521 ''[[Edict of Worms]]''. Some Protestants avoided excommunication by living as [[crypto-Protestant]]s.}} from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument,{{efn|Some Protestants claim the church is visible today, this is a matter of dispute.}} saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a ''spiritual, invisible, and hidden church''\u2014this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nWherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received support from the ruling authorities, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole ''invisible church'', but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters,{{efn|The assertion of papal supremacy varied through history. For example, in 381 the [[First Council of Constantinople]] recognized the sees of Rome and Constantinople as being equal in authority. Papal supremacy continued to evolve after the Reformation with the [[First Vatican Council]].}} namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible [[ecclesiastical]] organization based on the 14th- and 15th-century [[Conciliarism|Conciliar movement]], rejecting the [[papacy]] and [[papal infallibility]] in favor of [[ecumenical council]]s, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the [[Council of Trent]].{{efn|Lutherans did not completely reject Trent. In fact, some attended it, although they were not given a vote. Instead, [[Martin Chemnitz]] on the basis that all councils are subject to examination, wrote the ''[[Examination of the Council of Trent]]'' in which some parts of Trent were accepted and others dissented from.}} Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action.\n\nThere are Protestants,{{efn|In history, Catholic sympathizing Protestants were termed [[crypto-papist]]s and lived as such because Catholicism was illegal in some areas under the legal principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''. However, outlawing Catholics didn't always force them to emigrate.

Since 1948, the [[World Council of Churches]] has been influential, but ineffective in creating a united church. There are also ecumenical bodies at regional, national and local levels across the globe; but schisms still far outnumber unifications. One, but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement, has been the move to form united churches, such as the [[Church of South India]], the [[Church of North India]], the US-based [[United Church of Christ]], the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] and the [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines]] which have rapidly declining memberships. There has been a strong engagement of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0804/__P1T.HTM |title=Orthodox Church: text \u2013 IntraText CT |publisher=Intratext.com |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nA Protestant [[baptism]] is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize. However, as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of [[apostolic succession]] and the disunity from Catholic Church, all other sacraments (except marriage) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid. Therefore, Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized (although they are confirmed) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the [[Catholic priesthood|priesthood]] after a period of study.\n\nIn 1999, the representatives of [[Lutheran World Federation]] and Catholic Church signed the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]], apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of [[Justification (theology)|justification]] which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation, although [[Confessional Lutheran]]s reject this statement.<ref name=WELS-JD>{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=6741 |website=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Justification |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |quote=A document which is aimed at settling differences needs to address those differences unambiguously.
