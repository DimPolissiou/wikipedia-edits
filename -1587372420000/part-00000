The 1960s he spent in Paris, France and Verona, Italy before finally settling down in the artists' town [[Pietrasanta]] in Tuscany from 1971. Despite developing a style far removed from his Danish contemporaries, Haugen S\u00f8rensen has always been highly present in his native country in exhibitions as well as in the in the artistic debate.<ref name=\"AKN\" />\n\n==Career==\n\nAfter his debut at  [[Charlottenborg Palace|Charlottenborg]]'s spring exhibition in 1953, he rapidly gained a reputation as a sculptor who crafted works of the human body and of animals with intense expressiveness and realism.

During the dramatic years of the [[Algerian War]], he settled in Paris creating figurative sculptures in bronze from 1959 to 1963. They depict scarred, torn organic forms reflecting a reality of cruelty, fear and sexuality. He traveled widely to Italy, Germany, Spain and Yugoslavia, developing a style which was far removed from Danish culture.<ref name=Helleland/> At the end of the 1960s, he often created compositions made up of several smaller sculptures, sometimes using materials such as plastic or textiles, occasionally borrowing elements from other sculptors.<ref name=Helleland/>\n\nAfter an interruption at the end of the 1960s when he turned to films, he returned to sculpture making use of marble, often combining different colours and finishes, as can be seen in his decorative work outside the School of Journalism in Aarhus. Other important works include the geometrical ''Huset der slikker solskin'' (The House which Licks Sunshine, 1980) for the Danish Institute in Rome, ''Dumhedens store flod'' (Stupidity's Great River, 1995) in [[Ribe]], and ''Sorg'' (Sorrow, 1990) for the French University in Istanbul.

Suffering from poor eyesight accentuated by a childhood eye injury, he was poor at other sports, but excelled on the track from an early age.\n\n==Professional career==\nBurrell was plagued by injuries and bad luck throughout his career, particularly around major championships. He won [[Gold medal|gold]] in the 100&nbsp;m ahead of Carl Lewis at the 1990 [[Goodwill Games]] in [[Seattle]]. He won the [[Silver medal|silver]] in the 100&nbsp;m behind Lewis at the [[1991 World Championships in Athletics|1991 World Championships]]. At the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Burrell false-started in the 100&nbsp;m final. When the race finally restarted, his reaction off the line was slow, and he finished fifth. He did manage to win a [[relay race|relay]] gold as part of the U.S. 4 \u00d7 100 m team.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOn May 19, 1990, Burrell ran a wind-assisted 200&nbsp;m at [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], Texas, in a time of 19.61 seconds. The wind speed was +4.0 m per second. This was the fastest time for the 200&nbsp;m for over six years until the 1996 Olympic final in Atlanta, where [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] ran 19.32 seconds.\n\nHe first set the world record in June 1991 with a time of 9.90&nbsp;seconds. This was broken that September by [[Carl Lewis]] who ran 9.86&nbsp;sec at the [[1991 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|1991 World Track and Field Championships]] where Burrell finished second in a new personal best time of 9.88&nbsp;sec. In July 1994, Burrell set the world record for the second time when he ran 9.85&nbsp;sec (a record that stood until the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] when [[Donovan Bailey]] ran 9.84&nbsp;sec).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nSince his [[retirement]] in 1998, Burrell has replaced his old college mentor, [[Tom Tellez]], as coach of the University of Houston's track team. Burrell has led UH to 14 men's [[Conference USA]] titles (nine indoor, five outdoor) and nine women's titles (four indoor, five outdoor). He was inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ttfca2.wixsite.com/txtfhalloffame/inductees |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116170038/http://ttfca2.wixsite.com/txtfhalloffame/inductees |archive-date=2017-01-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBurrell married [[Michelle Finn-Burrell|Michelle Finn]], also a sprinter, in 1994, and they have three sons: Cameron, a sprinter for the [[Houston Cougars]],<ref>{{cite web |title=In His Parents\u2019 Very Fast Footsteps |author=Jer\u00e9 Longman |date=May 23, 2013 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=April 28, 2019 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/sports/cameron-burrell-is-following-in-very-fast-footsteps.html}}</ref> Joshua, and Jaden.

Suffering from poor eyesight accentuated by a childhood eye injury, he was poor at other sports, but excelled on the track from an early age.\n\n==Professional career==\nBurrell was plagued by injuries and bad luck throughout his career, particularly around major championships. He won [[Gold medal|gold]] in the 100&nbsp;m ahead of Carl Lewis at the 1990 [[Goodwill Games]] in [[Seattle]]. He won the [[Silver medal|silver]] in the 100&nbsp;m behind Lewis at the [[1991 World Championships in Athletics|1991 World Championships]]. At the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Burrell false-started in the 100&nbsp;m final. When the race finally restarted, his reaction off the line was slow, and he finished fifth. He did manage to win a [[relay race|relay]] gold as part of the U.S. 4 \u00d7 100 m team.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOn May 19, 1990, Burrell ran a wind-assisted 200&nbsp;m at [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], Texas, in a time of 19.61 seconds. The wind speed was +4.0 m per second. This was the fastest time for the 200&nbsp;m for over six years until the 1996 Olympic final in Atlanta, where [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] ran 19.32 seconds. \n\nHe first set the world record in June 1991 with a time of 9.90&nbsp;seconds. This was broken that September by [[Carl Lewis]] who ran 9.86&nbsp;sec at the [[1991 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|1991 World Track and Field Championships]] where Burrell finished second in a new personal best time of 9.88&nbsp;sec. In July 1994, Burrell set the world record for the second time when he ran 9.85&nbsp;sec (a record that stood until the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] when [[Donovan Bailey]] ran 9.84&nbsp;sec).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nSince his [[retirement]] in 1998, Burrell has replaced his old college mentor, [[Tom Tellez]], as coach of the University of Houston's track team. Burrell has led UH to 14 men's [[Conference USA]] titles (nine indoor, five outdoor) and nine women's titles (four indoor, five outdoor).
