Numerous classical sources and later authors point to the incarnation of incest in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] monarchies of the [[Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] dynasties. Some of the earliest Greek references to non-royal incest are those by [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] in his book Magica, which [[Clement of Alexandria]] quoted as saying that [[Magi]] had sex with their mothers, daughters and sisters, and that [[Ctesias]] had mentioned a brother-sister marriage. [[Herodotus]] mentions that Cambyses lived with his sister, though the Persians had never been with their sisters before.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\" />\n\n=== Chinese ===\nA reference can be found in the Pahlavi-Chinese bilingual tomb inscriptions in Xi'an, in which the deceased woman, from the Surin family princes, is read in Chinese as \"wife\" but in Pahlavi's \"daughter\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Persian wedding]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in Iran]]\n[[Category:Incest]]\n[[Category:Zoroastrian behaviour and experience]]\n", "name_user": "Qayrawan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xwedodah"}
