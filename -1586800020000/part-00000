The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter [[John Gregory Dunne]], having spent eight years working on the script with his wife [[Joan Didion]], later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, titled ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]''.\n\nThe film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\", written by [[Diane Warren]] and performed by [[Celine Dion]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=August 2015}}\nSally \"Tally\" Atwater ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) is an ambitious, aspiring news reporter, who is hired by [[Miami]] local news director Warren Justice ([[Robert Redford]]) when she sends in a homemade audition tape. He carefully guides her career to new heights, all the while becoming increasingly attracted to her.\n\nTally soon rises through the ranks of network news to become successful, while Warren's once-stellar career sinks into mediocrity. Furthermore, Tally's ascension takes her away from Warren when she is forced to relocate to [[Philadelphia]]. Tally struggles at her new post, in no small part due to the hostility of veteran reporter Marcia McGrath ([[Stockard Channing]]), who jealously protects her position as the top reporter. Warren turns up to inspire Tally, and the two partners begin a new career together.\n\nHowever, on a routine assignment in a Philadelphia prison, Tally and her cameraman are taken hostage in a prison riot and forced to endure hours of intense violence. Tally covers the groundbreaking story from within the walls of the collapsing prison as Warren looks on from outside, guiding her through her first national broadcast. This incredible act of bravery leads to Tally's eagerly anticipated advancement to a national network newscaster position and the continuation of the dynamic duo's rise to fame - but shortly after, disaster strikes when Warren is killed during an assignment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Robert Redford]] as Warren Justice\n*[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Sally \"Tally\" Atwater\n*[[Stockard Channing]] as Marcia McGrath\n*[[Joe Mantegna]] as Bucky Terranova\n*[[Kate Nelligan]] as Joanna Kennelly\n*[[Glenn Plummer]] as Ned Jackson\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as John Merino\n*[[Scott Bryce]] as Rob Sullivan\n*[[Raymond Cruz]] as Fernando Buttanda\n*[[Dedee Pfeiffer]] as Luanne Atwater\n*[[Miguel Sandoval]] as Dan Duarte\n*[[Noble Willingham]] as Buford Sells\n*[[James Karen]] as Tom Orr\n*[[Brian Markinson]] as Vic Nash\n}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nIn the spring of 1988, [[John Gregory Dunne]] and [[Joan Didion]] began writing the script for a film entitled ''Golden Girl'', based on [[Alanna Nash]]'s biography of the late [[NBC News]] anchor and reporter [[Jessica Savitch]] and financed by [[The Walt Disney Company]].

The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter [[John Gregory Dunne]], having spent eight years working on the script with his wife [[Joan Didion]], later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, titled ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]''.\n\nThe film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\", written by [[Diane Warren]] and performed by [[Celine Dion]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=August 2015}}\nSally \"Tally\" Atwater ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) is an ambitious, aspiring news reporter, who is hired by [[Miami]] local news director Warren Justice ([[Robert Redford]]) when she sends in a homemade audition tape. He carefully guides her career to new heights, all the while becoming increasingly attracted to her.\n\nTally soon rises through the ranks of network news to become successful, while Warren's once-stellar career sinks into mediocrity. Furthermore, Tally's ascension takes her away from Warren when she is forced to relocate to [[Philadelphia]]. Tally struggles at her new post, in no small part due to the hostility of veteran reporter Marcia McGrath ([[Stockard Channing]]), who jealously protects her position as the top reporter. Warren turns up to inspire Tally, and the two partners begin a new career together.\n\nHowever, on a routine assignment in a Philadelphia prison, Tally and her cameraman are taken hostage in a prison riot and forced to endure hours of intense violence. Tally covers the groundbreaking story from within the walls of the collapsing prison as Warren looks on from outside, guiding her through her first national broadcast. This incredible act of bravery leads to Tally's eagerly anticipated advancement to a national network newscaster position and the continuation of the dynamic duo's rise to fame - but shortly after, disaster strikes when Warren is killed during an assignment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Robert Redford]] as Warren Justice\n*[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Sally \"Tally\" Atwater\n*[[Stockard Channing]] as Marcia McGrath\n*[[Joe Mantegna]] as Bucky Terranova\n*[[Kate Nelligan]] as Joanna Kennelly\n*[[Glenn Plummer]] as Ned Jackson\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as John Merino\n*[[Scott Bryce]] as Rob Sullivan\n*[[Raymond Cruz]] as Fernando Buttanda\n*[[Dedee Pfeiffer]] as Luanne Atwater\n*[[Miguel Sandoval]] as Dan Duarte\n*[[Noble Willingham]] as Buford Sells\n*[[James Karen]] as Tom Orr\n*[[Brian Markinson]] as Vic Nash\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack album track listing==\n# \"[[Exhale (Shoop Shoop)]]\" - [[98 Degrees]] (5:02)\n# \"[[Let Me Entertain You (Robbie Williams song)|Let Me Entertain You (Money Train Remix)]]\" - [[will.i.am|Will.I.Am]] featuring [[SWV]] (4:23)\n# \"[[Drowning (Backstreet Boys song)|Drowning]]\" - [[New Edition|Heads Of State]] (4:51)\n# \"[[Loungin|Summer Luv]]\" - [[LL Cool J]] (5:49)\n# \"Home Again\" - [[New Edition]] (4:40)\n# \"Darlin'\" - [[Backstreet Boys]] (4:18)\n# \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\" - [[Celine Dion]] (3:39)\n# \"[[Talk to Me (Babyface song)|Talk to Me]]\" - [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] featuring [[Eric Clapton]] (3:50)\n# \"How Many Mics\" - [[Fugees|The Fugees]] (3:21)\n# \"[[The Blast (song)|The Blast]]\" - [[Justin Timberlake]] featuring [[Wyclef Jean]] (4:09)\n# \"[[When Can I See You]]\" - [[JC Chasez]] (4:53)\n# \"Dangerous Game\" - [[Kylie Minogue]] (4:20)\n# \"[[Freak Me]]\" - [[Keith Sweat]] featuring [[Silk (band)|Silk]] (4:04)\n# \"Don't Cry Dry Your Eyes\" - The Fugees (4:04)\n\n==Adaptation==\nIn the spring of 1988, [[John Gregory Dunne]] and [[Joan Didion]] began writing the script for a film entitled ''Golden Girl'', based on [[Alanna Nash]]'s biography of the late [[NBC News]] anchor and reporter [[Jessica Savitch]] and financed by [[The Walt Disney Company]].

His mother Mable died when Stan was three months old, leaving him to be raised by his grandmother, aunts and uncles. Hodgson was educated at Whinny Hill school, and after leaving took up a job at a carpet factory. He married Doreen Smith, with whom he had four children.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/14/stan-hodgson-obituary |title=\nStan Hodgson obituary |work=The Guardian |date=2015-04-14 |first=Jim |last=McManners |accessdate=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Club and representative career==\n\nHodgson played all his club games for [[Durham City RFC]].

The early model GSPs, from 1968 to 1977, had a manual safety catch on the left side of the frame.  This feature was omitted in 1977 because it was an unnecessary feature on a competition pistol.

The MV models were available in both .22 lr and .32 S&W Long calibers.\n\nIn 1992, Walther had a special limited edition of the GSP designated as the 25 Jahre (25th Anniversary Edition).  The frame of this model had a nickel finish and the bolt had a gold titanium finish.  At the time, these sold for 2,549 [[Deutsche Marks]].\n\nIn 1996, Walther produced a GSP Atlanta model commemorating the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in Atlanta.  These ones also had the gold titanium finish on the bolt.\n\nToday, there is also a more accurate version available known as the '''GSP Expert''' which has a vibration-absorbing Aluminum sleeve, containing inertial dampers, around the barrel.\n\nThe Walther GSP is a popular choice for the various 25 m pistol shooting events governed by the [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]] (some contested at the Olympic games).  The .22 short variant was used in [[rapid fire pistol]]. The .22 LR variant was used for the [[25 m Pistol]] (formerly \"Sport Pistol\"), [[25 m Standard Pistol]] while the .32 caliber variant was used in the [[25 m Center-Fire Pistol]] event.\n\nUnder the N.Y Safe Act the Walther GSP is now classified as an assault weapon under N.Y state law.

He was the eldest son and the [[heir apparent]] to his father, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], until his death at age 38 during the political turmoil that occurred during 91 BC.  Contrary to his less-than-flattering [[posthumous name]], Liu Ju was generally regarded by historians as a well-mannered, benevolent, morally upright man who, by circumstances beyond his control, was forced into an uprising against his father's army and died as a consequence of the rebellion.\n\n== Family background and birth ==\nLiu Ju's mother, [[Empress Wei Zifu|Wei Zifu]], was Emperor Wu's second wife. Emperor Wu's first wife, Empress [[Chen Jiao]], had long lost the Emperor's favour due to [[infertility]], as well as her [[spoiled child|spoilt]] and [[jealous]] personality. When Empress Chen was found employing [[witchcraft]] to curse Emperor Wu's other concubines (aimed at Wei Zifu in particular), she was officially deposed in 130 BC, leaving open the position of empress. Wei Zifu, who had been Emperor Wu's favourite consort since 138 BC, had by then already bore him three daughters. In 128 BC, she gave birth to Liu Ju, Emperor Wu's first son, and was created empress as a result.\n\nIt was recorded that Emperor Wu, who was already 29 years old when his first son was born, was overjoyed and ordered poets to write [[paean]]s celebrating the arrival of the \"grand prince\", hinting Liu Ju would become his imperial heir by default.  Prince Ju was later formally created crown prince in 122 BC, at the age of 6.\n\n== As crown prince ==\nEmperor Wu had high hopes for Prince Ju, and made sure he got the best education possible, even constructing the \"Broad Vision Academy\" (\u535a\u671b\u82d1) to allow his son exposure to all schools of scholars.  It is unclear when Liu Ju become involved in government affairs, but as he matured and Emperor Wu began to take more time away from the capital, from 113 BC he was entrusted as the [[prince regent]] while his father was absent. His mother Empress Wei, whose sexual attraction decreased in the eyes of Emperor Wu, was still entrusted to look after domestic palace affairs. Both Liu Ju and Empress Wei remained well respected by Emperor Wu.\n\nUnlike Emperor Wu, who was at times [[megalomania|megalomanic]] and always looking for territorial expansion which burdened his people to their limit, Liu Ju was regarded as a [[Pacifist|man of peace]], interested more in the social well-being and economic recovery of the people, and openly opposed his father on many policies.  He was well known for his hospitality and openness to different opinions, and he maintained a large group of advisers and friends at his palace.  Because Liu Ju favoured more lenient policies and often helped overturn [[wrongful conviction]]<nowiki/>s.  He frequently had conflicts with legal officials who had received promotions from following his father's harsher, more [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] policies.\n\nIn 113 BC, Liu Ju married his only well-known [[Prince consort|consort]], Lady Shi (\u53f2\u826f\u5a23), who bore him a son Liu Jin (\u5289\u9032).  Liu Jin would later produce [[Liu Bingyi|a young grandson]], who was only months old when his entire family were killed during the 91 BC political turmoil.  Liu Ju also had two other sons and a daughter.\n\nWhile Liu Ju's well-respected uncle, General [[Wei Qing]] was alive, Crown Prince Ju was safe politically.  After Wei Qing died in 106 BC, certain officials and factions started plotting against Liu Ju.\n\n== Forced into rebellion ==\nNear the end of his reign, the physically deteriorating Emperor Wu became increasingly paranoid and fearful of others using witchcraft against him, especially after incidents involving the sighting/[[hallucination]] of an armed stranger walking by as well as a nightmare of hundreds of small wooden [[puppet]]<nowiki/>s beating him with sticks. A massive crackdown was ordered and those who were suspected of witchcraft were often summarily executed along with their entire clans. Many important people became victims of this [[witch-hunt]], which peaked during early 91 BC, including the entire family of Prime Minister Gongsun He (\u516c\u5b6b\u8cc0, Liu Ju's maternal [[uncle-in-law]]), Liu Ju's sisters (and Emperor Wu's own daughters) Princesses Yangshi (\u967d\u77f3\u516c\u4e3b) and Princess Zhuyi (\u8af8\u9091\u516c\u4e3b), as well as Wei Qing's son Wei Kang (\u885b\u5ffc), effectively removing almost all of the Crown Prince's political supporters in the Han court.\n\nFurthermore, Emperor Wu's favourite concubine was now the young Lady Zhao (\u8d99\u5a55\u59a4), who was also known as \"Lady Fist\" (\u62f3\u592b\u4eba) or \"Lady Hook\" (\u9264\u5f0b\u592b\u4eba) due to legend that she was born with a [[contracture]]<nowiki/>d clenched fist, which somehow magically opened up when Emperor Wu massaged it, revealing a [[jade]] [[Belt hook|hook]] in the palm.  She gave birth to Emperor Wu's youngest son [[Liu Fuling]] after a rumoured 14-month-long pregnancy, same as the legendary [[Emperor Yao]].  Overjoyed that he could still father a son with such divine implications at the age of 66, the superstitious Emperor Wu named Lady Zhao's household the \"Gate of Yao's Mother\" (\u582f\u6bcd\u9580).  This gesture did not go unnoticed, and speculations started to rise that he intended to replace Liu Ju with the 3-year-old Prince Fuling as the new crown prince. Such speculation fuelled further conspiracies to dethrone Liu Ju.\n\nOne of the conspirators against Crown Prince Ju was Jiang Chong (\u6c5f\u5145), the ruthless and opportunistic head of the secret intelligence, who once had a run-in with Prince Ju after arresting one of Prince Ju's assistants for improper use of an imperial right of way. Fearing that with Emperor Wu's health declining, Crown Prince Ju would one day ascend to the throne and punish him for their past clashes, Jiang Chong decided that he had to remove the Crown Prince once and for all.  One other conspirator was Emperor Wu's chief [[eunuch]] Su Wen (\u8607\u6587), who had falsely and repeatedly accused Liu Ju of committing adultery with Emperor Wu's junior concubines.  Su Wen also blocked any attempts by Liu Ju and Empress Wei to communicate with Emperor Wu, who was then staying at his summer palace in Ganquan (\u7518\u6cc9, in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]).\n\nIn the same year, Jiang Chong and Su Wen decided to move against Liu Ju, once again using witchcraft as an excuse. Jiang, with the approval of Emperor Wu, searched through various palaces, ostensibly for witchcraft items, eventually reaching Empress Wei and Liu Ju's household. Jiang's men dug holes everywhere, leaving barely room for the Empress and Crown Prince to lay their beds. Jiang Chong then planted dolls and pieces of cloth with mysterious writing in Liu Ju's palace, and then announced that he found evidence of witchcraft. Liu Ju, initially believing that he had nothing to hide, was shocked and forced to consider his options, and his teacher Shi De (\u77f3\u5fb7), invoking the story of [[Zhao Gao]]'s plot to murder [[Ying Fusu]] and raising the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be deceased, suggested that Liu Ju should start an uprising to remove Jiang. Liu Ju initially hesitated and wanted to speedily proceed to Ganquan Palace and explain himself to his father, but he found out that Jiang's messengers were already on their way to report the \"crime\".  So he decided to accept Shi's suggestion.\n\nLiu Ju arranged for one of his men to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu and arrest Jiang Chong's party.  However, Su Wen managed to escape arrest. After they were subdued, Liu Ju personally executed Jiang. He then reported his actions to his mother, who authorised him the right to mobilise her palace guards and distribute weapons to any civilian supporters he could muster in preparation to defend himself against any retaliation from Jiang's co-conspirators. Meanwhile, Su Wen fled to Ganquan Palace and told Emperor Wu that the Crown Prince was going to overthrow him in a rebellion.  Emperor Wu, refusing to believe his benevolent son would commit treason and (correctly at this point) concluding that Prince Ju was merely angry at Jiang Chong.  So the Emperor decided to send a low-ranking eunuch to the capital [[Chang'an]] to summon Prince Ju to provide an explanation for his actions. This messenger did not dare to proceed to Chang'an, but instead falsely reported to Emperor Wu that he fled because Prince Ju was going to kill him. By now enraged, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (\u5289\u5c48\u729b), to put down the rebellion.\n\nPrince Ju also sent two messengers in attempts to mobilise regular armies. One was sent to a detachment of surrendered Xiongnu cavalry stationed outside the capital, but Emperor Wu's messenger had arrived just earlier and ordered the cavalry to attack Prince Ju instead. The other messenger was sent to the North Army in charge of guarding the capital, but the commander-in-charge, Ren An (\u4efb\u5b89), refused to get involved.  Without regular army support, Prince Ju's forces, consisting only palace guards and armed civilians, were no match for Liu Qumao's army.  Furthermore, after Emperor Wu's banner was displayed outside the capital city, it became clear that Emperor Wu was still in charge and Prince Ju did not have his father's authorisation.  So public support for the Crown Prince disappeared. The two sides then battled in the streets of Chang'an for five days, and Liu Qumao's forces prevailed.  Prince Ju was forced to flee the capital with two of his sons. His mother, Empress Wei, committed suicide after Emperor Wu sent messengers to seize her [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] as a punishment of supporting her son's uprising. The rest of Prince Ju's family were then killed, with the only exception of the months-old grandson [[Liu Bingyi]], who was thrown into prison.\n\nEmperor Wu ordered that Prince Ju be hunted down, but after a junior official, Linghu Mao (\u4ee4\u72d0\u8302), risked his life and spoke on Prince Ju's behalf, Emperor Wu's anger began to subside, but he had not yet issued a pardon for his son. At this point, Liu Ju had fled to Hu County (\u6e56\u7e23, in modern [[Sanmenxia]], [[Henan]]) and took refuge in the home of a poor [[shoemaker]]. Knowing the financial burden imposed on his warm-hearted host, Liu Ju attempted to seek help from an old friend living in Hu County, but this exposed his whereabouts. Local officials quickly tracked down and surrounded the house. Seeing no chance of escape, Liu Ju committed suicide by hanging. His two sons and the family hosting them all died when government soldiers finally broke in and killed everyone. The officials in charge, Li Shou (\u674e\u58fd) and Zhang Fuchang (\u5f35\u5bcc\u660c), then wasted no times to take Liu Ju's body to Chang'an and claim rewards from Emperor Wu, who had to keep his word despite great sorrow over his son's death.\n\n== Posthumous developments ==\nEventually, Emperor Wu began to realize that the witchcraft cases during 91 BC were often false accusations. In 89 BC, when [[Tian Qianqiu]] (\u7530\u5343\u79cb), then the superintendent of Emperor Gao's temple, filed a report claiming that \"a white-haired old man\" told him in a dream that for the offence of armed uprising, Prince Ju would at most be caned, not killed, as a punishment, Emperor Wu realised what had really happened.  Furious that the conspirators had abused his trust and plotted his son's death, he had Su Wen [[Death by burning|burned alive]], Jiang Chong's [[Nine familial exterminations|immediate and extended family executed]], and killed every official who had received promotions for tracking down the Crown Prince. He also promoted Tian Qianqiu to prime minister, and made major policy changes that supported the ideals supported by his dead son.  To express his regret over causing his son's death, Emperor Wu also built the Palace of Son-Grieving (\u601d\u5b50\u5bae) and Platform of Longing for Return (\u6b78\u4f86\u671b\u601d\u53f0), officially [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitating]] Liu Ju's name.\n\nLiu Ju's only surviving offspring, his grandson [[Liu Bingyi]], would eventually become emperor (as [[Emperor Xuan of Han|Emperor Xuan]]) in 74 BC following the death of Crown Prince Ju's childless younger brother [[Emperor Zhao of Han|Emperor Zhao]] and a brief reign by their nephew, [[Prince He of Changyi]].  Out of respect for Emperor Zhao, Emperor Xuan did not initially attempt to restore the title of his grandfather.  It was not until 73 BC that he restored Crown Prince Ju's title (but with the rather unflattering posthumous name of \"Li\", which means \"unrepentant\") and reburied his grandparents and parents.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1=1st son: Liu Ju, Crown Prince Li<br>\u623e\u592a\u5b50\u5218\u636e<br>128 BC\u201391 BC\n|2=10th son: [[Emperor Wu of Han|Liu Che, Emperor Wu]]<br>\u6b66\u5e1d\u5218\u5f7b<br>157 BC\u201387 BC\n|3=Wife: [[Empress Wei Zifu|Lady Wei, Empress Si]]<br>\u601d\u7687\u540e\u536b\u6c0f<br>d. 91 BC\n|4=1st son: [[Emperor Jing of Han|Liu Qi, Emperor Jing]]<br>\u666f\u5e1d\u5218\u542f<br>188 BC\u2013141 BC\n|5=Wife: [[Empress Wang Zhi|Wang Zhi, Empress Xiaojing]]<br>\u5b5d\u666f\u7687\u540e\u738b\u5a21<br>d. 125 BC\n|6= A Man Surnamed Wei<br>\u536b\u6c0f\u7537\u5b50\n|7=Lady Wei<br>\u536b\u5aaa\n|8=4th son: [[Emperor Wen of Han|Liu Heng, Emperor Wen]]<br>\u6587\u5e1d\u5218\u6052<br>203 BC\u2013157 BC\n|9=Wife: [[Empress Dou (Wen)|Dou Yi, Empress Xiaowen]]<br>\u5b5d\u6587\u7687\u540e\u7aa6\u7317<br>d. 135 BC\n|10=Wang Zhong, Marquis Gong of Gai<br>\u76d6\u5171\u4faf\u738b\u4ef2\n|11=Zang Er, Lady of Pingyuan<br>\u5e73\u539f\u541b\u81e7\u513f\n|16=[[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang, Gaozu]]<br>\u9ad8\u7956\u5218\u90a6<br>256 BC\u2013195 BC\n|17=Concubine: [[Empress Dowager Bo|Lady Bao, Empress Gao]]<br>\u9ad8\u7687\u540e\u8584\u6c0f<br>d. 155 BC\n|18=Dou Chong, Marquis of Ancheng<br>\u5b89\u6210\u4faf\u7aa6\u5145\n|19=Marchioness of Ancheng<br>\u5b89\u6210\u4faf\u592b\u4eba\n}}\n\n== References ==\n* ''[[Book of Han]]'', [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377063|vol. 63]].\n* ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vols.

By now enraged, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (\u5289\u5c48\u729b), to put down the rebellion.\n\nPrince Ju also sent two messengers in attempts to mobilise regular armies. One was sent to a detachment of surrendered Xiongnu cavalry stationed outside the capital, but Emperor Wu's messenger had arrived just earlier and ordered the cavalry to attack Prince Ju instead. The other messenger was sent tothe North Army in charge of guarding the capital, but the commander-in-charge, Ren An (\u4efb\u5b89), refused to get involved.  Without regular army support, Prince Ju's forces, consisting only palace guards and armed civilians, were no match for Liu Qumao's army.  Furthermore, after Emperor Wu's banner was displayed outside the capital city, it became clear that Emperor Wu was still in charge and Prince Ju did not have his father's authorisation.  So public support for the Crown Prince disappeared. The two sides then battled in the streets of Chang'an for five days, and Liu Qumao's forces prevailed.  Prince Ju was forced to flee the capital with two of his sons. His mother, Empress Wei, committed suicide after Emperor Wu sent messengers to seize her [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] as a punishment of supporting her son's uprising. The rest of Prince Ju's family were then killed, with the only exception of the months-old grandson [[Liu Bingyi]], who was thrown into prison.\n\nEmperor Wu ordered that Prince Ju be hunted down, but after a junior official, Linghu Mao (\u4ee4\u72d0\u8302), risked his life and spoke on Prince Ju's behalf, Emperor Wu's anger began to subside, but he had not yet issued a pardon for his son. At this point, Liu Ju had fled to Hu County (\u6e56\u7e23, in modern [[Sanmenxia]], [[Henan]]) and took refuge in the home of a poor [[shoemaker]]. Knowing the financial burden imposed on his warm-hearted host, Liu Ju attempted to seek help from an old friend living in Hu County, but this exposed his whereabouts. Local officials quickly tracked down and surrounded the house. Seeing no chance of escape, Liu Ju committed suicide by hanging. His two sons and the family hosting them all died when government soldiers finally broke in and killed everyone. The officials in charge, Li Shou (\u674e\u58fd) and Zhang Fuchang (\u5f35\u5bcc\u660c), then wasted no times to take Liu Ju's body to Chang'an and claim rewards from Emperor Wu, who had to keep his word despite great sorrow over his son's death.\n\n== Posthumous developments ==\nEventually, Emperor Wu began to realize that the witchcraft cases during 91 BC were often false accusations. In 89 BC, when [[Tian Qianqiu]] (\u7530\u5343\u79cb), then the superintendent of Emperor Gao's temple, filed a report claiming that \"a white-haired old man\" told him in a dream that for the offence of armed uprising, Prince Ju would at most be caned, not killed, as a punishment, Emperor Wu realised what had really happened.  Furious that the conspirators had abused his trust and plotted his son's death, he had Su Wen [[Death by burning|burned alive]], Jiang Chong's [[Nine familial exterminations|immediate and extended family executed]], and killed every official who had received promotions for tracking down the Crown Prince. He also promoted Tian Qianqiu to prime minister, and made major policy changes that supported the ideals supported by his dead son.  To express his regret over causing his son's death, Emperor Wu also built the Palace of Son-Grieving (\u601d\u5b50\u5bae) and Platform of Longing for Return (\u6b78\u4f86\u671b\u601d\u53f0), officially [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitating]] Liu Ju's name.\n\nLiu Ju's only surviving offspring, his grandson [[Liu Bingyi]], would eventually become emperor (as [[Emperor Xuan of Han|Emperor Xuan]]) in 74 BC following the death of Crown Prince Ju's childless younger brother [[Emperor Zhao of Han|Emperor Zhao]] and a brief reign by their nephew, [[Prince He of Changyi]].  Out of respect for Emperor Zhao, Emperor Xuan did not initially attempt to restore the title of his grandfather.  It was not until 73 BC that he restored Crown Prince Ju's title (but with the rather unflattering posthumous name of \"Li\", which means \"unrepentant\") and reburied his grandparents and parents.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1=1st son: Liu Ju, Crown Prince Li<br>\u623e\u592a\u5b50\u5218\u636e<br>128 BC\u201391 BC\n|2=10th son: [[Emperor Wu of Han|Liu Che, Emperor Wu]]<br>\u6b66\u5e1d\u5218\u5f7b<br>157 BC\u201387 BC\n|3=Wife: [[Empress Wei Zifu|Lady Wei, Empress Si]]<br>\u601d\u7687\u540e\u536b\u6c0f<br>d. 91 BC\n|4=1st son: [[Emperor Jing of Han|Liu Qi, Emperor Jing]]<br>\u666f\u5e1d\u5218\u542f<br>188 BC\u2013141 BC\n|5=Wife: [[Empress Wang Zhi|Wang Zhi, Empress Xiaojing]]<br>\u5b5d\u666f\u7687\u540e\u738b\u5a21<br>d. 125 BC\n|6= A Man Surnamed Wei<br>\u536b\u6c0f\u7537\u5b50\n|7=Lady Wei<br>\u536b\u5aaa\n|8=4th son: [[Emperor Wen of Han|Liu Heng, Emperor Wen]]<br>\u6587\u5e1d\u5218\u6052<br>203 BC\u2013157 BC\n|9=Wife: [[Empress Dou (Wen)|Dou Yi, Empress Xiaowen]]<br>\u5b5d\u6587\u7687\u540e\u7aa6\u7317<br>d. 135 BC\n|10=Wang Zhong, Marquis Gong of Gai<br>\u76d6\u5171\u4faf\u738b\u4ef2\n|11=Zang Er, Lady of Pingyuan<br>\u5e73\u539f\u541b\u81e7\u513f\n|16=[[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang, Gaozu]]<br>\u9ad8\u7956\u5218\u90a6<br>256 BC\u2013195 BC\n|17=Concubine: [[Empress Dowager Bo|Lady Bao, Empress Gao]]<br>\u9ad8\u7687\u540e\u8584\u6c0f<br>d. 155 BC\n|18=Dou Chong, Marquis of Ancheng<br>\u5b89\u6210\u4faf\u7aa6\u5145\n|19=Marchioness of Ancheng<br>\u5b89\u6210\u4faf\u592b\u4eba\n}}\n\n== References ==\n* ''[[Book of Han]]'', [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377063|vol. 63]].\n* ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vols.
