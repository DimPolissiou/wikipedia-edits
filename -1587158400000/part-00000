Following the failure of the heavy and uncompetitive [[Aston Martin DB3]] designed by Eberan Eberhorst; William Watson, employed as Eberhorst's assistant, presented an alternative design to John Wyer, Aston Martin's competitions manager, whose assistance was needed as Eberhorst could well oppose being up-staged. In total 31 cars were made, with 11 works cars and 20 cars being sold for customer use.\n\nThe DB3S was introduced in 1953 and it proved significantly more successful than the [[Aston Martin DB3]]. Although the DB3S failed at Le Mans they went on to score a 1-2 at the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod in the 6th round of the inaugural World Sports Car Championship to help Astons to 3rd in the championship. As well there was a win in the non championship Goodwood 9 Hours.\n\n1954 was a less successful season with a third place in the Buenos Aires 1000&nbsp;km being the high point. However the cars failed at the Sebring 12 hours, the Mille Miglia, Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy.\n\n1955 saw a return to form. Astons missed the opening two rounds at Buenos Aires and Sebring and the sole DB3S failed to finish at the Mille Miglia but Collins/Frere finished 2nd at Le Mans and Walker/Poore scored a 4th at the Tourist Trophy behind the dominant 1, 2, 3 of the Mercedes 300SLR to finish 5th in the championship. There was also time for another win in the non championship Goodwood 9 Hours.\n\nBy 1956 the design was starting to show its age and Astons were putting their resources into the development of the new [[Aston Martin DBR1|DBR1]] but the DB3S still finished 4th at Sebring and 5th at the Nurburging 1000Km to finish 4th in the championship together with another second at Le Mans in the hands of Moss/Collins although due to the change of regulations following the 1955 disaster this latter event was a non championship race.\n\nThe DBR1 now took over as Astons main sports racer but there was one last swan song for the DB3S in the hands of the Whitehead brothers at Le Mans in 1958 with a second place after all the works DBR1s failed to finish.\n\nThe car won the 2013 [[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo Trophy]] at [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]].<ref>http://www.gtplanet.net/aston-martin-db3s-wins-2013-gran-turismo-trophy/</ref>\n\n==Chassis numbers==\nThe 11 works cars had chassis numbers from DB3S/1 to DB3S/11, with the 11th works car never being raced by [[Aston Martin]]. The 20 customer cars had three digit chassis numbers, from DB3S/101 to DB3S/120.\nIn 1994 a recreation car was assembled from original spare parts at Aston Service Dorset. This car carries the continuation chassis number DB3S/121.\n\n==Coup\u00e9s==\nOriginally two works Aston Martin DB3S fixed head coup\u00e9s were made. The change was to make them more aerodynamic than the open top bodied cars. However, they were unstable at high speeds and both crashed at the [[1954 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Both coup\u00e9s were then rebuilt as open bodied cars.\n\nThree of the customer cars were also fitted with similar coup\u00e9 bodies.\n\n==Chassis information==\nIncluded are a list of victories by each chassis under Aston Martin.\n\n*'''DB3S/1'''\n**1953 Charterhall\n**1953 British Empire Trophy\n**1953 Charterhall(2)\n**1953 Castle Coombe\n**1954 Silverstone\n*'''DB3S/2'''\n**1953 B.A.R.C.

Facial palsy is typified by inability to control movement in the muscles of facial expression. The paralysis is of the infranuclear/lower motor neuron type.\n\nIt is thought that as a result of [[inflammation]] of the facial nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the [[stylomastoid foramen]]), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy ''per se''. Possible causes include [[tumor]], [[meningitis]], [[stroke]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[head injury|head trauma]] and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves ([[sarcoidosis]], [[brucellosis]], etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the facial nerve. Babies can be born with facial palsy.<ref>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001425.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001211231/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001425.htm |date=2008-10-01 }} retrieved 10 September 2008</ref> In a few cases, bilateral facial palsy has been associated with [[acute HIV infection]].\n\nIn some research, the [[herpes simplex virus]] type 1 (HSV-1) has been identified in a majority of cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy via endoneurial fluid sampling.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Murakami S, Mizobuchi M, Nakashiro Y, Doi T, Hato N, Yanagihara N |title=Bell palsy and herpes simplex virus: identification of viral DNA in endoneurial fluid and muscle |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=124 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=27\u201330 |year=1996 |pmid=7503474 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-124-1_Part_1-199601010-00005}}</ref> Other research, however, identified, out of a total of 176 cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy, HSV-1 in 31 cases (18 percent) and [[herpes zoster]] in 45 cases (26 percent).<ref name=Furuta>{{cite journal |vauthors=Furuta Y, Ohtani F, Chida E, Mesuda Y, Fukuda S, Inuyama Y |title=Herpes simplex virus type 1 reactivation and antiviral therapy in patients with acute peripheral facial palsy |journal=Auris Nasus Larynx |volume=28 |issue=Suppl |pages=S13\u201317 |year=2001 |pmid=11683332 |doi= 10.1016/S0385-8146(00)00105-X}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, HSV-1 infection is associated with [[demyelination]] of nerves. This nerve damage mechanism is different from the above-mentioned\u2014that edema, swelling and compression of the nerve in the narrow bone canal is responsible for nerve damage. Demyelination may not even be directly caused by the virus, but by an unknown [[immune system|immune]] response.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBell's palsy is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]], meaning it is diagnosed by elimination of other reasonable possibilities. By definition, no specific cause can be determined. There are no routine lab or imaging tests required to make the diagnosis.<ref name=CPG2013/> The degree of nerve damage can be assessed using the [[House-Brackmann score]].\n\nOne study found that 45% of patients are not referred to a specialist, which suggests that Bell's palsy is considered by physicians to be a straightforward diagnosis that is easy to manage.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal |author=Morris AM |title=Annualized incidence and spectrum of illness from an outbreak investigation of Bell's palsy |journal=Neuroepidemiology |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=255\u201361 |year=2002 |pmid=12207155 |doi=10.1159/000065645 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=ned21255 |author2=Deeks SL |author3=Hill MD |display-authors=3 |last4=Midroni |first4=Gyl |last5=Goldstein |first5=Warren C. |last6=Mazzulli |first6=Tony |last7=Davidson |first7=Ross |last8=Squires |first8=Susan G. |last9=Marrie |first9=Thomas |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713151821/http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=ned21255 |archivedate=2009-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nOther conditions that can cause similar symptoms include: [[herpes zoster]], [[Lyme disease]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[stroke]], and [[brain tumor]]s.<ref name=CPG2013/>\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nOnce the facial paralysis sets in, many people may mistake it as a symptom of a stroke; however, there are a few subtle differences. A stroke will usually cause a few additional symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. And unlike Bell's palsy, a stroke will usually let patients control the upper part of their faces. A person with a stroke will usually have some wrinkling of their forehead.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/c-tv-reporter-loses-her-smile-bells-palsy-164432652--abc-news-wellness.html S.C.

Another complication can occur in case of incomplete or erroneous regeneration of the damaged facial nerve. The nerve can be thought of as a bundle of smaller individual nerve connections that branch out to their proper destinations. During regrowth, nerves are generally able to track the original path to the right destination\u2014but some nerves may sidetrack leading to a condition known as [[synkinesis]]. For instance, regrowth of nerves controlling muscles attached to the eye may sidetrack and also regrow connections reaching the muscles of the mouth. In this way, movement of one also affects the other. For example, when the person closes the eye, the corner of the mouth lifts involuntarily.\n\nAround 9% of people have some sort of ongoing problems after Bell's palsy, typically the synkinesis already discussed, or spasm, contracture, [[tinnitus]] or hearing loss during facial movement or crocodile-tear syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamamoto E, Nishimura H, Hirono Y |title=Occurrence of sequelae in Bell's palsy |journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica |volume=Suppl 446 |pages=93\u201396 |year=1988 |pmid=3166596 |doi=10.3109/00016488709121848 }}</ref> This is also called gustatolacrimal reflex or [[Bogorad's syndrome]] and involves the sufferer shedding tears while eating.

[[James Douglas (physician)|James Douglas]] (1675\u20131742) and Nicolaus Anton Friedreich (1761\u20131836) also described it.\n\nSir [[Charles Bell]], for whom the condition is named, presented three cases at the [[Royal Society of London]] in 1829.

The ad was interpreted as an attack on Chr\u00e9tien's physical appearance and garnered widespread anger among the public, while Chr\u00e9tien used the ad to make himself more sympathetic to voters. The ad had the adverse effect of increasing Chr\u00e9tien's lead in the polls and the subsequent backlash clinched the election for the Liberals, which the party [[Landslide victory|won in a

Facial palsy is typified by inability to control movement in the muscles of facial expression. The paralysis is of the infranuclear/lower motor neuron type.\n\nIt is thought that as a result of [[inflammation]] of the facial nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the [[stylomastoid foramen]]), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy ''per se''.

The immediate reaction was citizens and the city clamoring to build an indestructible, all-weather crossing over the Trinity.  This had already been tried following the 1890 flood&mdash;the result was the \"Long Wooden Bridge\" that connected Jefferson Boulevard in Oak Cliff and Cadiz in Dallas, but the resulting unstable bridge was easily washed away by the 1908 flood.  [[George Dealey|George B.

The successor to the [[Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports|2-Litre Sports]] model, it had a comparatively advanced [[dual overhead cam]] 2.6&nbsp;L [[straight-6]] engine in place of the previous [[pushrod engine|pushrod]] [[straight-4]]. It was available as a closed, 2-door, 2-seater [[coupe|coup\u00e9]] which Aston Martin called a sports saloon, and later also as a [[drophead coupe|drophead coup\u00e9]], which accounted for a quarter of the model's total sales. The closed version had some success in racing.\n\n==Development and racing==\n\nIn 1947 [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] bought the Aston Martin and [[Lagonda]] companies and incorporated them as [[Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.]].  [[Lagonda straight-6 engine|Lagonda's 2.6&nbsp;L (2580&nbsp;cc/157&nbsp;in<sup>3</sup>)]], [[dual overhead cam]], straight-six engine, more powerful than the pushrod 2.0 L straight 4 unit in the [[Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports]], was the main objective in Brown's acquisition of the company. [[W. O. Bentley]] had supervised the engine's design, which was largely by William (Willie) Watson, an engineer with the pre-war [[Invicta (car)|Invicta]] company who had collaborated on Lagonda's pre-war V12 and also designed the short-lived post-war version.\n\nIn its original form the Lagonda straight-6 had a 78&nbsp;mm (3.07&nbsp;in) bore and 90&nbsp;mm (3.543&nbsp;in) stroke, and produced about 105&nbsp;hp (78&nbsp;kW) with dual [[SU carburetor|SU carburettor]]s. The DB2 utilized it in a shortened version of the [[Space frame|tube-frame]] chassis designed by Claude Hill for the Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports, with a [[fastback]] coup\u00e9 body designed by [[Frank Feeley]].\n\nThree pre-production cars were entered for the [[1949 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. One, which would become the development car for the production DB2, had the Lagonda straight-6, while the four-cylinder Aston Martin 2-litre unit powered the other two. After six laps the Lagonda-powered car, driven by [[Leslie Johnson (racing driver)|Leslie Johnson]], retired with overheating caused by failure of the water pump. One of the 2-litre cars was in 4th place and running without brakes when it crashed two hours short of the finish, fatally injuring driver [[Pierre Mar\u00e9chal]]. The other finished 7th, crewed by Arthur Jones and Nick Haines.{{efn-lr|This car was  stolen in 2002 but recovered in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news\n  |title='Exceptional' Aston Martin found 14 years after theft\n  |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]\n  |date=10 June 2016\n  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-36501571\n}}</ref>}}  A month later, the larger-engined car, driven by Leslie Johnson and Charles Brackenbury, finished 3rd in the [[Spa 24 Hours|Spa 24-hour race]], where one of the 2-litre cars was driven to 5th by Nick Haines and [[Lance Macklin]].\n\nFor 1950 all three factory team cars were equipped with the Lagonda engine.  At the [[1950 24 Hours of Le Mans|1950 Le Mans race]] the one driven by  [[George Abecassis]] and [[Lance Macklin]] finished 5th, with Brackenbury and [[Reg Parnell]] bringing another home 6th, which won Aston Martin 1st and 2nd in the 3-litre class. Across the Atlantic, [[Briggs Cunningham]] drove his DB2 to 2nd in its class at the inaugural [[Sebring Raceway|Sebring]] race meeting in December 1950. The factory team cars continued racing in Europe throughout 1951, including at [[1951 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], where Macklin and [[Eric Thompson (racing driver)|Eric Thompson]] took 3rd overall, with Abecassis and [[Brian Shawe-Taylor]] 5th.\n\nDavid Brown soon embarked on a series of Aston Martins designed specifically for competition use, starting with the [[Aston Martin DB3|DB3]].\n\n==Production==\n\nThe DB2 debuted at the [[New York Auto Show]] in April 1950 and continued in production until April 1953, by which time 411 had been made.  The first 49 had a chrome-framed front grille in three separate parts, and large rectangular cooling vents in the front wings.

The successor to the [[Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports|2-Litre Sports]] model, it had a comparatively advanced [[dual overhead cam]] 2.6&nbsp;L [[straight-6]] engine in place of the previous [[pushrod engine|pushrod]] [[straight-4]]. It was available as a closed, 2-door, 2-seater [[coupe|coup\u00e9]] which Aston Martin called a sports saloon, and later also as a [[drophead coupe|drophead coup\u00e9]], which accounted for a quarter of the model's total sales. The closed version had some success in racing.\n\n==Development and racing==\n\nIn 1947 [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]] bought the Aston Martin and [[Lagonda]] companies and incorporated them as [[Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.]].  [[Lagonda straight-6 engine|Lagonda's 2.6&nbsp;L (2580&nbsp;cc/157&nbsp;in<sup>3</sup>)]], [[dual overhead cam]], straight-six engine, more powerful than the pushrod 2.0 L straight 4 unit in the [[Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports]], was the main objective in Brown's acquisition of the company. [[W. O. Bentley]] had supervised the engine's design, which was largely by William (Willie) Watson, an engineer with the pre-war [[Invicta (car)|Invicta]] company who had collaborated on Lagonda's pre-war V12 and also designed the short-lived post-war version.\n\nIn its original form the Lagonda straight-6 had a 78&nbsp;mm (3.07&nbsp;in) bore and 90&nbsp;mm (3.543&nbsp;in) stroke, and produced about 105&nbsp;hp (78&nbsp;kW) with dual [[SU carburetor|SU carburettor]]s. The DB2 utilized it in a shortened version of the [[Space frame|tube-frame]] chassis designed by Claude Hill for the Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports, with a [[fastback]] coup\u00e9 body designed by [[Frank Feeley]].\n\nThree pre-production cars were entered for the [[1949 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. One, which would become the development car for the production DB2, had the Lagonda straight-6, while the four-cylinder Aston Martin 2-litre unit powered the other two. After six laps the Lagonda-powered car, driven by [[Leslie Johnson (racing driver)|Leslie Johnson]], retired with overheating caused by failure of the water pump. One of the 2-litre cars was in 4th place and running without brakes when it crashed two hours short of the finish, fatally injuring driver [[Pierre Mar\u00e9chal]]. The other finished 7th, crewed by Arthur Jones and Nick Haines.{{efn-lr|This car was  stolen in 2002 but recovered in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news\n  |title='Exceptional' Aston Martin found 14 years after theft\n  |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]\n  |date=10 June 2016\n  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-36501571\n}}</ref>}}  A month later, the larger-engined car, driven by Leslie Johnson and Charles Brackenbury, finished 3rd in the [[Spa 24 Hours|Spa 24-hour race]], where one of the 2-litre cars was driven to 5th by Nick Haines and [[Lance Macklin]].\n\nFor 1950 all three factory team cars were equipped with the Lagonda engine.  At the [[1950 24 Hours of Le Mans|1950 Le Mans race]] the one driven by  [[George Abecassis]] and [[Lance Macklin]] finished 5th, with Brackenbury and [[Reg Parnell]] bringing another home 6th, which won Aston Martin 1st and 2nd in the 3-litre class. Across the Atlantic, [[Briggs Cunningham]] drove his DB2 to 2nd in its class at the inaugural [[Sebring Raceway|Sebring]] race meeting in December 1950. The factory team cars continued racing in Europe throughout 1951, including at [[1951 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]], where Macklin and [[Eric Thompson (racing driver)|Eric Thompson]] took 3rd overall, with Abecassis and [[Brian Shawe-Taylor]] 5th.\n\nDavid Brown soon embarked on a series of Aston Martins designed specifically for competition use, starting with the [[Aston Martin DB3|DB3]].\n\n==Production==\n\nThe DB2 debuted at the [[New York Auto Show]] in April 1950 and continued in production until April 1953, by which time 411 had been made.  The first 49 had a chrome-framed front grille in three separate parts, and large rectangular cooling vents in the front wings. Subsequent cars had a one-piece grille with horizontal chrome slats, and no side vents.\n\nThe single-piece bonnet was hinged at the front.  At the rear of the fixed-head coup\u00e9 (FHC) a small top-hinged lid gave access to the spare wheel, and luggage space was behind the front seats, accessible only from inside the car.\n\nLater in 1950, a Drophead Coup\u00e9 (DHC) variant was introduced.

He is well liked by the [[demi-monde]] community there, but has hit a run of bad luck and is nearly broke. Ever the gentleman, he lets an attractive young drifter called Anne stay in his flat in order to keep her from the attentions of Marc, a pimp he hates, and encourages his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Paolo to become involved with her. Marc is arrested for beating up his wife, but is released on condition he becomes an informer. Ledru, the police inspector who does this, owes an unrepayable debt of gratitude to Bob, who once saved his life. \n\nThrough an ex-con who is now a croupier in the casino at [[Deauville]], Bob and his safecracker friend Roger learn that by 5.00 in the morning at the height of the season the casino safe can hold 800 million in cash. Forming a plan to lift it, they find a backer to finance their preparations and recruit a team of professional criminals. The croupier gets them detailed floor plans, together with the specification of the safe. Paid in cash for this valuable information, he uses some of it to buy jewellery for his avaricious wife. \n\nIn bed with Anne, the immature Paolo brags about the upcoming raid, news which she passes on to Marc, who tips off Ledru that he has valuable info to share. When Anne confesses what she has done, Paolo shoots Marc dead before he can get to Ledru. Meanwhile, the croupier's wife has wormed out the secret of her husband's new riches and decides to blackmail Bob but, unable to find him, tells the police. Ledru finds it hard to believe, as he thinks Bob is truly reformed, and after checking with the casino mounts a fruitless search for Bob, who is already on his way to Deauville. Ledru follows with a convoy of armed police.\n\nBob's plan is to spend the time until 5:00 as a customer inside the casino, keeping an eye on things until the rest of the gang burst in with guns. After wandering around the tables for a while, he can't resist placing a bet. There follows the most incredible run of luck, in which he wins millions. Just before 5:00 he orders the staff to cash his huge pile of chips and bring the money to the front door. Arriving there on time, his gang are ambushed by the police and Paolo is killed in the ensuing gun battle. The handcuffed Bob is put into Ledru's car and the casino staff put his winnings in the trunk. It is strongly implied that his lucky streak will hold and he will get off with little or no jail time. Indeed, he quips, he may sue the police for damages \u2013 while the beautiful Anne waits for him at his apartment.\n\n==Principal cast==\n* [[Isabelle Corey]] as Anne\n* [[Daniel Cauchy]] as Paolo\n* [[Roger Duchesne]] as Bob Montagn\u00e9\n* [[Guy Decomble]] as Insp.
