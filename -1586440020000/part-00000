He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for [[Truman Capote]], took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.<ref name=Y>{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/allan-carr-rise-fall-hollywood-hedonist-014130665.html|title=Allan Carr: The rise and fall of a Hollywood hedonist|author=Taggart, Frankie|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management career==\nIn 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Peter Sellers]],<ref name=Y/> [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Melina Mercouri]], and [[Marlo Thomas]].  Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced: [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[The Four Seasons (band)|Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]] and [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]]<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman Black|Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''[[Goya: A Life in Song]]'' with [[Freddie Gershon]] and [[Sony Music|CBS Records]], a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[John F.

Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

{"title_page": "Eric Bostrom", "text_new": "{{short description|American motorcycle racer}}\n'''Eric Bostrom''' (born {{Birth date and age|1976|11|19}}, in [[San Francisco, California]]) is an American professional [[motorcycle sport|motorcycle racer]] and brother of [[Ben Bostrom]], who also races motorcycles professionally.\n\nHe is currently racing in the [[AMA Superbike]] series for [[Attack Kawasaki]], but he is better known for being a member of the Austin [[Ducati]] and Parts Unlimited Ducati teams in 2004 and 2005, and perhaps best known for riding for the factory [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] team from 1999 to 2003.  Bostrom raced for [[Erion Honda]] in 1998 and Zero Gravity Racing in 1997.\n\nStatistically, Bostrom's best season was the 2001 season.  Riding for Kawasaki, he finished a close 2nd to [[Mat Mladin]] in the AMA Superbike series and won the [[AMA Supersport Championship]].\n\n==Timeline==\nBostrom won the [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Insurance]] [[Harley-Davidson]] SuperTwins Championship in 1997, winning 10 of the 11 series races.\n\nBostrom's AMA Superbike career began in 1998 when he replaced the injured [[Miguel Duhamel]] on the Erion Honda, winning his 2nd and 3rd races in the class. He was entered in several Superbike World Championship races as well.  Bostrom also won the [[AMA Formula Xtreme]] Championship in 1998 riding for the Erion Honda team.\n\nBostrom raced for Kawasaki from 1999 to 2003 riding the [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-7R|ZX-7R]] in the [[AMA Superbike Championship]].  He also rode the [[ZX-6R]] in the [[AMA Supersport Championship]], winning the AMA Supersport championship in 2001.  In 2001, Bostrom finished second in the AMA Superbike Championship to Mat Mladin.  He also finished second in the AMA Superbike Championship in 2002, this time behind [[Nicky Hayden]].  During his career at Kawasaki, Bostrom was able to compete in several [[World Superbike]] events.  This, coupled with his back-to-back second-place finishes in AMA's highest class lead many observers to believe a transfer to World Superbike, or possibly [[MotoGP]] was in Bostrom's future.  Injuries marred his 2003 season and Kawasaki pulled out of AMA competitions.\n\nBostrom rode the Austin Ducati in the AMA Superbike Championship in 2004 and the Parts Unlimited Ducati in 2005.  He was the sole AMA Superbike Ducati rider in 2004.  Former [[List of Superbike World champions|Superbike World Champion]] [[Neil Hodgson]] joined the Parts Unlimited Ducati AMA Superbike team for the 2005 season.  Bostrom's brother, Ben, took his spot on the Ducati team after Eric left for Yamaha after the 2005 season ended.  By the end of the 2006 season, Ducati pulled out of all AMA competitions.\n\nBostrom joined the factory Yamaha team before the 2006 season to ride in the [[AMA Supersport Championship]] and AMA Formula Xtreme Championship.  His factory Yamaha teammate was [[Jason DiSalvo]].  For the 2007 and 2008 seasons, Bostrom rode for Yamaha, competing in AMA Superbike riding and developing the [[Yamaha YZF-R1]] Superbike alongside DiSalvo.\n\nBostrom did not race motorcycles professionally during 2009.\n\nDuring 2010 Bostrom rode part-time in the AMA Daytona Sportbike and Superbike classes for Cycle World Attack Performance Yoshimura Suzuki.\n\nIn July 2012, Bostrom raced for Team Icon [[Brammo]] at the [[TTXGP]] [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] e-Power race at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], riding the Brammo Empulse RR electric motorcycle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Bostrom to Ride Team Icon Brammo at TTXGP/FIM e-Power International Race at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|url=http://roadracingworld.com/news/article/?article=49161|publisher=Roadracing World|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Superbike World Championship==\nBostrom has also raced in the [[Superbike World Championship]], usually as a wildcard entry in the United States rounds at Laguna Seca.  In {{SBK|1999}} he finished 10th and 7th, and in {{SBK|2001}} he finished fifth twice.  In the {{SBK|2002}} season, Bostrom was entered at five meetings as a third rider in the Kawasaki World Superbike team, with his best results being 6th and 4th in the US.  He also appeared at Laguna in {{SBK|2003}}, but an accident caused by Aaron Yates in the second turn of the first lap prevented him taking any further part in the action.\n\nEric and his brothers are also very engaged with 2Wheel Tuner, a leading magazine editorial based around the Sportbike community.

These 'battles' are performed using material items such as money, mobile phones, clothes, alcohol or foods. In most instances a battle is won by the intentional destruction or wastage of one's own expensive items to demonstrate the lack of concern for such material possessions due to the ability to afford more of the same. A competitor's chances of victory are improved by having items that are more expensive than those of their opponent it can be money or clothes. Some of the Izikhothanes are from [[Botswana]] (Super Mosha).\n\n== Origin ==\nThe word \"Izikhothane\" is a slang word that originates from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"Osikhotheni\". Osikhotheni means people who live in the bushes/bundus, and that is derived from the Zulu word \"Isikhotha\" that means \"bush\". The singular form of this Zulu word is called \"usikhotheni\". This term is township slang for [[Con man|hustlers]] who live a lavish lifestyle (nice expensive clothes etc.) without having a job or owning a business. You can call them modernised beggars who live by using illegal ways to satisfy their hunger for their lavish lifestyles.\n\nIzikhothane originated in the early 2000s in the South African townships of [[City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality|Ekurhuleni Metropolitan]] previously known as the Eastrand, but mainly started in [[Katlehong]], one of the townships in Eastrand. The act remained largely unnoticed until it gained popularity in 2011 and 2012. A similar trend called uSwenka existed in South Africa in the 1950s where [[Migrant worker|migrant workers]] and labourers dressed themselves in their finest suits and shoes to compete in contests.<ref name=mg1/> The winner of these contests would win money, household necessities or livestock, which they would send back home to their families.\n\n== Practices ==\nThe Izikhothane are usually from impoverished backgrounds and spend beyond their financial means to purchase high-end [[Designer clothing|designer apparel]], prestige branded alcohol, luxury food items, and expensive accessories including jewellery and mobile phones. These items are then destroyed or disposed of in an attempt to create a perception of opulence and thereby gain social status.\n\nIn [[Eastern Cape]] this culture is mostly joined at 11 to 18 years old. The purpose of the culture is to impress and making your [[clan]] famous. The members make battles of showing off tags and dancing with other groups to make themselves famous. In [[Port Elizabeth|P.E.]] the culture mostly includes music in it. The members end up dissing each others in terms of challenging. In Eastern Cape a Clan called Innocent Squad is the most famous and Skeem Seh Njabulo, in [[Jeffreys Bay]] is Smart Fellaz. Hankey got the elderly clan called Mpolo Trend. The members get money in different ways. Eastern cape got the mostly talented clans for example Innocent Squad (also known as Obhuti abamsulwa) is one of the clan with its own recording studio (Omthina fam). As the Producer and the member of the clan meets Young Talents Int, he said \"I am very glad to be in my clan. My wish is us to be the example of our fellow clans. Grow and glow.Be wise,stop wasting and save for the future\" said Blessing Brighter mostly known as Jostar. In other ways community don't support this culture but it never stopped. In Eastern Cape, Carvela is mostly worn in terms of showing you afford. They always show themselves in Public places for attention and makes Saturday a big day for them.\n\nThe ability to afford expensive clothing is fundamental to Izikhothane and one's reputation is determined by this expression. The Izikhothane sometimes demonstrate this by buying two pairs of the same high-end brand of shoe in different colours and then wearing one shoe of each colour to indicate that two pairs of the same expensive shoe can be afforded.<ref name=star1/> Another tactic in battle is to wear expensive clothing in layers and then destroy one layer at a time thereby destroying more clothes than the opponent. Price tags are sometimes retained on the clothing so that competitors can flaunt the cost of their items.\n\nSome of the greatest legends are Thapelo Sello (Sisto Di Boto), King Mosha, Cvk, Don Dada, Fearless Mosha,Mandana,Mavesta. etc.\n\n== Battles ==\nThe aim of the dance battle is to show more abundance than your opponents as this determines the winner of the battle. There is no tangible reward for winning an Izikhothane battle, just the recognition and affection from the audience that witnesses the battle.\n\nIzikhothane battles occur predominantly across South Africa's townships. The act or battle is performed in a public place such as a park or any open space so that large crowds may gather to witness the event.\n\nCompetitors are predominantly males aged between 12 and 25 years. The popularity of Izikhothane has also started to attract female youth {Material.Mix and Material.Prix). Izikhothane groups compete against each other in inter- or intra-township battles. A group's identity and reputation is upheld by its members' wasteful extravagance.\n\nTo perform in an Izikhothane battle, a contestant must purchase expensive items such as clothing, shoes, alcohol and exorbitant accessories. Loud, colourful, branded items are a necessity. The more a competitor's gear costs, the more dominant they are able to be in the battle. Once at the battle venue, the contestant calls out an opponent. Thereafter these two competitors dance around, showing off their expensive material items to each other and to the crowd. To win the battle, a contestant may be required to destroy their items such as tearing up cash notes, burning or tearing up their designer branded clothing, pouring out expensive alcohol onto the ground and Custured or submerging their mobile phones in water.<ref name=star1/> The champions are decided by the crowd whereby the crowd cheers for the Izikhothane that impressed them the most with their abundance of wealth as depicted by the destruction of their high-value items.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Competitive altruism]]\n* [[Koha (custom)|Koha]], a similar concept among the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]]\n* [[Moka exchange]], a similar concept in [[Papua New Guinea]]\n* [[Potlatch]]\n* [[Potluck]]\n* [[Pow wow]], a gathering whose name is derived from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] word for \"spiritual leader\"\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=mg1>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/print/2011-10-28-burn-after-wearing-township-kids-hottest-fashion-statement/|title=Burn after wearing \u2013 township kids' hottest fashion statement|author=Nkosi, Sibongile|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=Mail & Guardian|publisher=M&G Online}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=star1>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-bling-1.1343682/|title=Burning Bling|author=Unknown|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-with-a-destructive-desire-1.1465938/|title=Burning with a destructive desire|author=Wende, Hamilton|date=7 February 2013|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403/|title=Youths destroy pricey togs in show-off challenges|author=Ndabeni, Khanyi|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Herald|publisher=Times Media Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204021635/http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403|archive-date=4 December 2013|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|title=Brash bling and ghetto fabulous|author=Unknown|date=6 August 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024064533/http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|archive-date=24 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|title='Izikhothane' tear up R100 notes \u2013 report|author=Unknown|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106081319/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|archive-date=6 November 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{facebook.com|izikhothane|Izikothane (official)}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWEcV_Ecfl4 Izikothane on 3rd Degree \u2013 Part 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbsnhbRM7P4 Part 2], and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O97BOeLVI5o Part 3]\u2014YouTube videos of current affairs investigative journalism on eNCA news channel\n\n[[Category:South African culture]]\n[[Category:South African English]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|South African competition to determine which party is wealthier.}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=March 2018}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Izikhothane''' (Ukukhothana) refers to [[South Africa]]n [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] or dance battles in which individuals or groups of individuals compete against each other in front of large crowds to determine which party is wealthier.
