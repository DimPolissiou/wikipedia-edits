He was the lead voice on such famous songs as \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]].\"\n\nKnown for his unique raspy and anguished baritone vocals, Ruffin was ranked as one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2008.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/david-ruffin-19691231|title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time|publisher=rollingstone.com|page=65|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 for his work with the Temptations.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-temptations|title=the Temptations at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Fellow [[Motown]] recording artist [[Marvin Gaye]] once said admiringly of Ruffin that, \"I heard [in his voice] a strength my own voice lacked.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n==Early life==\nRuffin was born '''Davis Eli Ruffin''' in the rural [[unincorporated community]] of [[Whynot, Mississippi]], 15 miles from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. He was the third born son of Elias \"Eli\" Ruffin, a [[Baptist]] minister, and Ophelia Ruffin. His siblings were Quincy B. Ruffin, Rita Mae Ruffin, and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy L. Ruffin]]. Ruffin also had another sister, who died in infancy.\n\n===Ancestry===\nDavid Ruffin's parents were both natives of Mississippi. His father Eli worked as a truck driver at numerous lumber mills, and his mother Ophelia worked out of their home. Eli's parents had moved from [[Alabama]] to Mississippi, because of the harsh circumstances of living after the [[American Civil War]]. Prior to living in Alabama, David Ruffin's great grandparents, John Ruffin and Clara Ruffin, had moved from [[Bertie County, North Carolina]]. John Ruffin was a Civil War Veteran, fighting with the 14th United States Colored Heavy [[Artillery]] Regiment.\n\n===Childhood and adolescence===\nRuffin's father was strict and at times violently abusive.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> Ruffin's mother died ten months after his birth in 1941; and his father married Earline, a [[schoolteacher]], in 1942.<ref name=soulbot>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911052258/http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2009|title=Low notes for David Ruffin|last=Noriyuki|first=Duane|date=May 26, 1988|publisher=soulbot.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> As a young child, Ruffin, along with his other siblings (older brothers Quincy and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy]], and sister Rita Mae), traveled with their father and their stepmother as a family [[gospel (music)|gospel]] group, opening shows for [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi]], among others.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\">Ribowsky, Mark (2010).

Billed as Little David Bush, Ruffin continued to sing at talent shows, worked with horses at a jockey club and eventually became a member of [[The Dixie Nightingales]]. He also sang with [[The Soul Stirrers]] briefly after the departure of [[Johnnie Taylor]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> It was in Ruffin's travels as a teenager that he met such later popular personalities as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]], [[Frankie Lymon]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Swan Silvertones]] and [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" />\n\nAfter some of his singing idols such as [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] had left [[gospel (music)|gospel music]] and gone secular, Ruffin also turned in that direction. Eddie Bush and his wife, Dorothy Helen, took the then-16-year-old Ruffin to [[Detroit, Michigan]], where his brother Jimmy was pursuing a career in music while simultaneously working at the [[Ford Motor Company]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nAfter moving to Detroit with the Bushes, Ruffin recorded his first released record with the songs \"You and I\" (1958) b/w \"Believe Me\" (1958). These songs were recorded at Vega Records and released under the name \"Little David Bush\", using the last name of his guardian. Ruffin would later recall how he initially recorded \"a different kind of music\", strongly influenced by the smoother pop and R&B of the time, when he first recorded in Detroit for Vega.<ref name=\"StreetGold\">{{cite AV media|people=Farag, Henry|year=1992|trans-title=|medium=VHS videocasette|title=David Ruffin|publisher=Street Gold Records|location=Merrillville, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Ruffin met [[Berry Gordy Jr.]], then a songwriter with ambitions of running his own label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin lived with Gordy's father, a [[General contractor|contractor]], and helped \"Pops\" Gordy do construction work on the building that would become [[Hitsville USA]], the headquarters for Gordy's [[Tamla Records]] (later [[Motown Records]]) label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/> Ruffin's brother Jimmy would eventually be signed to Tamla's Miracle Records label as an artist.\n\nRuffin also worked alongside another ambitious singer, [[Marvin Gaye]], as an apprentice at [[Anna Records]], a [[Chess Records|Chess]]-distributed label run by Gordy's sister [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua]] and his songwriting partner [[Roquel Billy Davis|Billy Davis]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/>\n\nAsked about Ruffin in the ''Detroit Free Press'' in 1988, Gordy Fuqua said: \"He was very much a gentleman, yes ma'am and no ma'am, but the thing that really impressed me about David was that he was one of the only artists I've seen who rehearsed like he was on stage\".<ref name=soulbot/> According to Ruffin, both he and Gaye would pack records for Anna Records.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nRuffin created music as both the vocalist and drummer in the Voice Masters, a doo-wop style combo<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\">\"Ruffin, David.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.

Other group members included members of [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]]: Ty Hunter, CP Spencer, Hank Dixon and (Voice Masters and The Originals founder) Walter Gaines. (At one time, The Voice Masters also included another future Temptations member, [[Melvin Franklin]], one of numerous people David would claim as a cousin).<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin did sign to Anna Records as a solo artist, but his work in that time was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\"/>\n\nRuffin eventually met an up-and-coming local group by the name of [[The Temptations]]. His older brother Jimmy went on a [[Motortown Revue]] tour with the Temptations, and he told David that they needed someone to sing [[tenor]] in their group. David shared his interest in joining the group with [[Otis Williams]], who lived very close to Ruffin in Detroit.\n\nIn January 1964, Ruffin became a member of the Temptations after founding member [[Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant]] was fired from the group. Ruffin's first recording session with the group was January 9, 1964. Though both David and Jimmy were considered, David was given the edge, thanks to his performance skills. These were displayed when he joined the Temptations on stage during the label's New Year's Eve party in 1963.<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 68\u201370.</ref>\n\n===With the Temptations (1964-1968)===\n{{main|The Temptations}}\nAfter joining the Temptations, the bespectacled Ruffin initially sang [[background singer|backgrounds]] while the role of lead singer mostly alternated between [[Eddie Kendricks]] and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]. He did sing a few lead parts, both on stage and in the studio, during his first year with the group, but his leads on these studio tracks would not be released for over a year, as they were not considered good enough to showcase his vocals. However, [[Smokey Robinson]], who produced and [[songwriter|co-wrote]] most of the Temptations' material at this point, saw Ruffin during this period as a \"sleeping giant\" in the group with a unique voice that was \"mellow\" yet \"gruff.\"<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1074993|title=My Girl|last=Blair|first=Elizabeth |publisher=npr.org|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Robinson thought that if he could write just the 'perfect song' for Ruffin's voice, then he could have a smash hit.<ref name=\"npr\" /> The song was to be something that Ruffin could \"belt out\" yet something that was also \"melodic and sweet\".<ref name=\"npr\" /> When Robinson achieved his goal, the song, \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\", was recorded in November 1964 and released a month later. It became the group's first number-one single in 1965. \"My Girl\" subsequently became the Temptations' signature song, and elevated Ruffin to the role of lead singer and frontman.\n\nThe follow-ups to \"My Girl\" were also extremely successful singles, and included the Ruffin-led hits \"[[It's Growing]]\" (1965), \"[[Since I Lost My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[My Baby (Temptations song)|My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\" (1966), \"[[Beauty Is Only Skin Deep]]\" (1966), \"[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]\" (1966), \"[[All I Need (The Temptations song)|All I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[I Wish It Would Rain]]\" (1967), and \"[[I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)]]\" (1968). Ruffin also shared lead vocals on the 1967 hit single \"[[You're My Everything (The Temptations song)|You're My Everything]]\" with Eddie Kendricks.  The tall, 6'3\", Ruffin's passionate and dramatic performances endeared him to the Temptations' audiences and fans. According to [[Otis Williams]], Ruffin (playfully nicknamed \"Ruff\" by the group) was a natural comedian and a hard-working singer when he first joined the group.\n\nRuffin's most notable non-vocal contribution to the Temptations was the masterminding of their trademark four-headed microphone stand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|page=185}}</ref> This enabled the other members to sing and do their dances without having to crowd around one microphone while the lead singer would sing into a separate microphone.\n\n[[File:Temptations-group-pic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|David Ruffin (center) with the Temptations 1967.]]\n\nBy 1967, however, difficulties with Ruffin became an issue for the group. He became addicted to [[cocaine]] and began missing rehearsals and performances.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" /> Refusing to travel with the other Temptations, Ruffin and his then girlfriend, [[Tammi Terrell]], traveled in a custom [[Limousine|limo]] (with the image of his trademark black rimmed glasses painted on the door).<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=s|isbn=|page=129}}</ref> After [[the Supremes]] had their name changed to ''Diana Ross & the Supremes'' in early 1967, Ruffin felt that he should become the focal point of the Temptations, just as [[Diana Ross]] was for her group, and began demanding that the group name be changed to ''David Ruffin & the Temptations''.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=164\u2013168}}</ref> This led to a number of disagreements between Ruffin and the group's ''de facto'' leader, Otis Williams.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" />\n \nIn addition to the group's problems with Ruffin's ego, he began inquiring into the Temptations' financial records, demanding an accounting of the group's money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=161\u2013162, 198\u2013203}}</ref> This caused friction between Ruffin and Gordy.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /><ref name=\"ClayMcMurray\">{{cite interview |last= McMurray |first=Clay |interviewer= |title=[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]: \"The Story of David Ruffin\" |type= |url= |format= |work= [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]\n |location=[[Silver Spring, Maryland]] |date=March 2012 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1968, the Temptations agreed that Ruffin had finally crossed the line when he missed a June 22 [[Cleveland, Ohio]], date with the Temptations in order to attend a performance by his new girlfriend, Barbara Gail Martin ([[Dean Martin]]'s daughter).<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Ruffin was fired on June 27, and replaced with [[Dennis Edwards]], a former member of [[the Contours]], who had been a friend of Ruffin and the group as a whole beforehand.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Though Ruffin himself personally encouraged Edwards to take his place, Ruffin began turning up unannounced at Temptations concerts during Edwards' first few dates with the group.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> When the group started to perform a Ruffin-era song such as \"My Girl\" or \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", Ruffin would suddenly walk on to the stage, take the microphone from Edwards' hands, and steal the show, embarrassing the group but entertaining the fans.<ref name=\"RuffOut\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 180\u2013188.</ref> According to Edwards, the adulation and Ruffin's pleas convinced the other four Temptations to give Ruffin a second chance, but when he arrived late to what was to be his return show with the group in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], The Temptations decided to keep Edwards and drop considerations of rehiring Ruffin.<ref name=\"Interview with Dennis Edwards\">{{cite web|last=Meros|first=Tom|title=Dennis Edwards (Interview)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjZtVCRBQk}}</ref><ref name=\"RuffinReturn\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nIn October 1968, Ruffin filed suit against Motown Records, seeking a release from the label and an accounting of his money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> Motown counter-sued to keep the singer from leaving the label and eventually the case was settled.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown to finish out his initial contract (Ruffin joined Motown as a solo artist and always had a separate contract from the other Temptations, which some felt caused a lot of the in-fighting within the group).<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" />\n\n=== Solo years ===\n[[File:David Ruffin My Whole World Ended.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The album cover of Ruffin's solo debut LP released in 1969]]\n\nRuffin's first solo single was a song originally intended for the Temptations, \"[[My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)]]\". The single (from the album also entitled ''[[My Whole World Ended]]'') was released in 1969, and reached the US Pop and R&B Top Ten. This was followed by the 1969 album ''[[Feelin' Good (David Ruffin)|Feelin' Good]]''. A third album, titled ''[[David (David Ruffin album)|David]]'', was recorded in 1970\u201371, but was shelved by Motown and did not see commercial release until 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-unreleased-album-mw0001895171|title=The Unreleased Album - David Ruffin {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=|first=|date=|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1970, Ruffin recorded an album with his brother Jimmy, [[I Am My Brother's Keeper]], for which they had minor hits with \"When My Love Hand (Comes Tumbling Down)\" and \"Your Love Was Worth Waiting For.\" His next official release for Motown did not arrive until 1973 when ''[[David Ruffin (album)|David Ruffin]]'' was released. While his solo career initially showed promise, Ruffin went into decline, reportedly in part because of his cocaine addiction and the lack of support from Motown.\n\nHis final Top Ten hit was \"[[Walk Away from Love]]\" in 1975, produced by [[Van McCoy]], which reached #9 on the Pop Charts. It was also Ruffin's only entry into the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]] (as a solo artist), and was a hit there as well, making it into the Top Ten (peaking at #10) in early 1976.

He later signed with [[RCA Records]], accompanied by former Temptations colleague Eddie Kendricks, who chose to rekindle their friendship when Kendricks himself started experiencing problems with the Temptations.\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nIn 1982, Ruffin and [[Eddie Kendricks]] re-joined the Temptations for the recording of their album ''[[Reunion (The Temptations album)|Reunion]]'' and a tour to promote the album. The album included the R&B hit \"Standing on the Top\" with [[Rick James]]. The reunion tour was short lived, however, as Ruffin started to miss shows as a result of his cocaine addiction, leading the group to be fined thousands of dollars. Otis Williams fired Ruffin from the group for the second and final time (along with Kendricks, whose voice was weakened due to heavy smoking) by Christmas 1982.<ref name=ReferenceA />\n\nRuffin started touring with Kendricks (who dropped the \"s\" from his last name at this time) as a duo act in 1985. That year, longtime Temptations fans [[Hall & Oates]] teamed up with Ruffin and Kendrick to perform at the re-opening of the [[Apollo Theater]] in New York.

He was the lead voice on such famous songs as \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]].\"\n\nKnown for his unique raspy and anguished baritone vocals, Ruffin was ranked as one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2008.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/david-ruffin-19691231|title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time|publisher=rollingstone.com|page=65|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 for his work with the Temptations.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-temptations|title=the Temptations at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Fellow [[Motown]] recording artist [[Marvin Gaye]] once said admiringly of Ruffin that, \"I heard [in his voice] a strength my own voice lacked.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n==Early life==\nRuffin was born '''Davis Eli Ruffin''' in the rural [[unincorporated community]] of [[Whynot, Mississippi]], 15 miles from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. He was the third born son of Elias \"Eli\" Ruffin, a [[Baptist]] minister, and Ophelia Ruffin. His siblings were Quincy B. Ruffin, Rita Mae Ruffin, and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy L. Ruffin]]. Ruffin also had another sister, who died in infancy.\n\n===Ancestry===\nDavid Ruffin's parents were both natives of Mississippi. His father Eli worked as a truck driver at numerous lumber mills, and his mother Ophelia worked out of their home. Eli's parents had moved from [[Alabama]] to Mississippi, because of the harsh circumstances of living after the [[American Civil War]]. Prior to living in Alabama, David Ruffin's great grandparents, John Ruffin and Clara Ruffin, had moved from [[Bertie County, North Carolina]]. John Ruffin was a Civil War Veteran, fighting with the 14th United States Colored Heavy [[Artillery]] Regiment.\n\n===Childhood and adolescence===\nRuffin's father was strict and at times violently abusive.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> Ruffin's mother died ten months after his birth in 1941; and his father married Earline, a [[schoolteacher]], in 1942.<ref name=soulbot>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911052258/http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2009|title=Low notes for David Ruffin|last=Noriyuki|first=Duane|date=May 26, 1988|publisher=soulbot.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> As a young child, Ruffin, along with his other siblings (older brothers Quincy and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy]], and sister Rita Mae), traveled with their father and their stepmother as a family [[gospel (music)|gospel]] group, opening shows for [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi]], among others.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\">Ribowsky, Mark (2010).

Billed as Little David Bush, Ruffin continued to sing at talent shows, worked with horses at a jockey club and eventually became a member of [[The Dixie Nightingales]]. He also sang with [[The Soul Stirrers]] briefly after the departure of [[Johnnie Taylor]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> It was in Ruffin's travels as a teenager that he met such later popular personalities as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]], [[Frankie Lymon]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Swan Silvertones]] and [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" />\n\nAfter some of his singing idols such as [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] had left [[gospel (music)|gospel music]] and gone secular, Ruffin also turned in that direction. Eddie Bush and his wife, Dorothy Helen, took the then-16-year-old Ruffin to [[Detroit, Michigan]], where his brother Jimmy was pursuing a career in music while simultaneously working at the [[Ford Motor Company]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nAfter moving to Detroit with the Bushes, Ruffin recorded his first released record with the songs \"You and I\" (1958) b/w \"Believe Me\" (1958). These songs were recorded at Vega Records and released under the name \"Little David Bush\", using the last name of his guardian. Ruffin would later recall how he initially recorded \"a different kind of music\", strongly influenced by the smoother pop and R&B of the time, when he first recorded in Detroit for Vega.<ref name=\"StreetGold\">{{cite AV media|people=Farag, Henry|year=1992|trans-title=|medium=VHS videocasette|title=David Ruffin|publisher=Street Gold Records|location=Merrillville, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Ruffin met [[Berry Gordy Jr.]], then a songwriter with ambitions of running his own label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin lived with Gordy's father, a [[General contractor|contractor]], and helped \"Pops\" Gordy do construction work on the building that would become [[Hitsville USA]], the headquarters for Gordy's [[Tamla Records]] (later [[Motown Records]]) label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/> Ruffin's brother Jimmy would eventually be signed to Tamla's Miracle Records label as an artist.\n\nRuffin also worked alongside another ambitious singer, [[Marvin Gaye]], as an apprentice at [[Anna Records]], a [[Chess Records|Chess]]-distributed label run by Gordy's sister [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua]] and his songwriting partner [[Roquel Billy Davis|Billy Davis]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/>\n\nAsked about Ruffin in the ''Detroit Free Press'' in 1988, Gordy Fuqua said: \"He was very much a gentleman, yes ma'am and no ma'am, but the thing that really impressed me about David was that he was one of the only artists I've seen who rehearsed like he was on stage\".<ref name=soulbot/> According to Ruffin, both he and Gaye would pack records for Anna Records.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nRuffin created music as both the vocalist and drummer in the Voice Masters, a doo-wop style combo<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\">\"Ruffin, David.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed.

Other group members included members of [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]]: Ty Hunter, CP Spencer, Hank Dixon and (Voice Masters and The Originals founder) Walter Gaines. (At one time, The Voice Masters also included another future Temptations member, [[Melvin Franklin]], one of numerous people David would claim as a cousin).<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin did sign to Anna Records as a solo artist, but his work in that time was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\"/>\n\nRuffin eventually met an up-and-coming local group by the name of [[The Temptations]]. His older brother Jimmy went on a [[Motortown Revue]] tour with the Temptations, and he told David that they needed someone to sing [[tenor]] in their group. David shared his interest in joining the group with [[Otis Williams]], who lived very close to Ruffin in Detroit.\n\nIn January 1964, Ruffin became a member of the Temptations after founding member [[Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant]] was fired from the group. Ruffin's first recording session with the group was January 9, 1964. Though both David and Jimmy were considered, David was given the edge, thanks to his performance skills. These were displayed when he joined the Temptations on stage during the label's New Year's Eve party in 1963.<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 68\u201370.</ref>\n\n===With the Temptations (1964-1968)===\n{{main|The Temptations}}\nAfter joining the Temptations, the bespectacled Ruffin initially sang [[background singer|backgrounds]] while the role of lead singer mostly alternated between [[Eddie Kendricks]] and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]. He did sing a few lead parts, both on stage and in the studio, during his first year with the group, but his leads on these studio tracks would not be released for over a year, as they were not considered good enough to showcase his vocals. However, [[Smokey Robinson]], who produced and [[songwriter|co-wrote]] most of the Temptations' material at this point, saw Ruffin during this period as a \"sleeping giant\" in the group with a unique voice that was \"mellow\" yet \"gruff.\"<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1074993|title=My Girl|last=Blair|first=Elizabeth |publisher=npr.org|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Robinson thought that if he could write just the 'perfect song' for Ruffin's voice, then he could have a smash hit.<ref name=\"npr\" /> The song was to be something that Ruffin could \"belt out\" yet something that was also \"melodic and sweet\".<ref name=\"npr\" /> When Robinson achieved his goal, the song, \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\", was recorded in November 1964 and released a month later. It became the group's first number-one single in 1965. \"My Girl\" subsequently became the Temptations' signature song, and elevated Ruffin to the role of lead singer and frontman.\n\nThe follow-ups to \"My Girl\" were also extremely successful singles, and included the Ruffin-led hits \"[[It's Growing]]\" (1965), \"[[Since I Lost My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[My Baby (Temptations song)|My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\" (1966), \"[[Beauty Is Only Skin Deep]]\" (1966), \"[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]\" (1966), \"[[All I Need (The Temptations song)|All I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[I Wish It Would Rain]]\" (1967), and \"[[I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)]]\" (1968). Ruffin also shared lead vocals on the 1967 hit single \"[[You're My Everything (The Temptations song)|You're My Everything]]\" with Eddie Kendricks.  The tall, 6'3\", Ruffin's passionate and dramatic performances endeared him to the Temptations' audiences and fans. According to [[Otis Williams]], Ruffin (playfully nicknamed \"Ruff\" by the group) was a natural comedian and a hard-working singer when he first joined the group.\n\nRuffin's most notable non-vocal contribution to the Temptations was the masterminding of their trademark four-headed microphone stand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|page=185}}</ref> This enabled the other members to sing and do their dances without having to crowd around one microphone while the lead singer would sing into a separate microphone.\n\n[[File:Temptations-group-pic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|David Ruffin (center) with the Temptations 1967.]]\n\nBy 1967, however, difficulties with Ruffin became an issue for the group. He became addicted to [[cocaine]] and began missing rehearsals and performances.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" /> Refusing to travel with the other Temptations, Ruffin and his then girlfriend, [[Tammi Terrell]], traveled in a custom [[Limousine|limo]] (with the image of his trademark black rimmed glasses painted on the door).<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=s|isbn=|page=129}}</ref> After [[the Supremes]] had their name changed to ''Diana Ross & the Supremes'' in early 1967, Ruffin felt that he should become the focal point of the Temptations, just as [[Diana Ross]] was for her group, and began demanding that the group name be changed to ''David Ruffin & the Temptations''.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=164\u2013168}}</ref> This led to a number of disagreements between Ruffin and the group's ''de facto'' leader, Otis Williams.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" />\n \nIn addition to the group's problems with Ruffin's ego, he began inquiring into the Temptations' financial records, demanding an accounting of the group's money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=161\u2013162, 198\u2013203}}</ref> This caused friction between Ruffin and Gordy.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /><ref name=\"ClayMcMurray\">{{cite interview |last= McMurray |first=Clay |interviewer= |title=[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]: \"The Story of David Ruffin\" |type= |url= |format= |work= [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]\n |location=[[Silver Spring, Maryland]] |date=March 2012 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1968, the Temptations agreed that Ruffin had finally crossed the line when he missed a June 22 [[Cleveland, Ohio]], date with the Temptations in order to attend a performance by his new girlfriend, Barbara Gail Martin ([[Dean Martin]]'s daughter).<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Ruffin was fired on June 27, and replaced with [[Dennis Edwards]], a former member of [[the Contours]], who had been a friend of Ruffin and the group as a whole beforehand.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Though Ruffin himself personally encouraged Edwards to take his place, Ruffin began turning up unannounced at Temptations concerts during Edwards' first few dates with the group.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> When the group started to perform a Ruffin-era song such as \"My Girl\" or \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", Ruffin would suddenly walk on to the stage, take the microphone from Edwards' hands, and steal the show, embarrassing the group but entertaining the fans.<ref name=\"RuffOut\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 180\u2013188.</ref> According to Edwards, the adulation and Ruffin's pleas convinced the other four Temptations to give Ruffin a second chance, but when he arrived late to what was to be his return show with the group in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], The Temptations decided to keep Edwards and drop considerations of rehiring Ruffin.<ref name=\"Interview with Dennis Edwards\">{{cite web|last=Meros|first=Tom|title=Dennis Edwards (Interview)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjZtVCRBQk}}</ref><ref name=\"RuffinReturn\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nIn October 1968, Ruffin filed suit against Motown Records, seeking a release from the label and an accounting of his money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> Motown counter-sued to keep the singer from leaving the label and eventually the case was settled.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown to finish out his initial contract (Ruffin joined Motown as a solo artist and always had a separate contract from the other Temptations, which some felt caused a lot of the in-fighting within the group).<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" />\n\n=== Solo years ===\n[[File:David Ruffin My Whole World Ended.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The album cover of Ruffin's solo debut LP released in 1969]]\n\nRuffin's first solo single was a song originally intended for the Temptations, \"[[My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)]]\". The single (from the album also entitled ''[[My Whole World Ended]]'') was released in 1969, and reached the US Pop and R&B Top Ten. This was followed by the 1969 album ''[[Feelin' Good (David Ruffin)|Feelin' Good]]''. A third album, titled ''[[David (David Ruffin album)|David]]'', was recorded in 1970\u201371, but was shelved by Motown and did not see commercial release until 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-unreleased-album-mw0001895171|title=The Unreleased Album - David Ruffin {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=|first=|date=|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1970, Ruffin recorded an album with his brother Jimmy, [[I Am My Brother's Keeper]], for which they had minor hits with \"When My Love Hand (Comes Tumbling Down)\" and \"Your Love Was Worth Waiting For.\" His next official release for Motown did not arrive until 1973 when ''[[David Ruffin (album)|David Ruffin]]'' was released. While his solo career initially showed promise, Ruffin went into decline, reportedly in part because of his cocaine addiction and the lack of support from Motown.\n\nHis final Top Ten hit was \"[[Walk Away from Love]]\" in 1975, produced by [[Van McCoy]], which reached #9 on the Pop Charts. It was also Ruffin's only entry into the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]] (as a solo artist), and was a hit there as well, making it into the Top Ten (peaking at #10) in early 1976.

The album included the R&B hit \"Standing on the Top\" with [[Rick James]]. The reunion tour was short lived, however, as Ruffin started to miss shows as a result of his cocaine addiction, leading the group to be fined thousands of dollars. Otis Williams fired Ruffin from the group for the second and final time (along with Kendricks, whose voice was weakened due to heavy smoking) by Christmas 1982.<ref name=ReferenceA />\n\nRuffin started touring with Kendricks (who dropped the \"s\" from his last name at this time) as a duo act in 1985. That year, longtime Temptations fans [[Hall & Oates]] teamed up with Ruffin and Kendrick to perform at the re-opening of the [[Apollo Theater]] in New York. Their performance was released as a successful live album and single. The four singers also sang a medley of Temptations hits at [[Live Aid]] on July 13, 1985. In 1985, a live medley of \"[[The Way You Do the Things You Do|The Way You Do The Things You Do]]\" and \"My Girl\" was released by Hall & Oates featuring Ruffin and Kendrick.

Romero]] and [[Sam Raimi]]. The shambling movement of the zombies as compared to the players and the relative ease with which they are dispatched makes them weak enemies individually, but (as in the films) they are strong in large numbers.\n\nPlayers must decide whether to avoid combat and allow the other players to dispose of the zombies for them, or to strike out and collect the various items that the board and event cards provide. Once the Helipad tile is placed, the players can choose between racing to the helicopter (which will often result in death); holding back and hoping to rush in when another player dies; or ignoring the helipad entirely and trying to kill 25 zombies.\n\nThe event cards and the zombie movement phase also provide opportunities to hinder the progress of other players, and there is scope for diplomacy.\n\nThe game can take up to three hours to complete, which was a complaint of some reviewers<ref>[http://iguk.co.uk/blog/2006/01/zombies-review.html Infinity Games UK Blog: Zombies!!! Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\u2014for shorter games, the publishers recommend that the Helipad tile be shuffled in among the other town tiles.\n\nZombies!!! feature 30 map tiles, a 50 card event deck, 6 humans, life and ammunition tokens, AND 100 plastic zombies in different poses.\n\n==Expansions==\n'''''Zombies!!! 2: Zombie Corps(e)''''': This expansion adds a [[military base]] with 15 new tiles and 30 event cards, as well as government-enhanced \"super zombies\" (represented by six glow-in-the-dark zombie figures). A number of additional rule variations are introduced into the base Zombies game through the use of this expansion and the insertion of special tiles.  For example, when the \u201cTop Secret Lab\u201d tile is drawn glow-in-the-dark zombies are placed instead of the normal zombies. These new zombies are considered to be \u201cGovernment Enhanced\u201d zombies and as such require the defending player to roll a 5 or 6 to kill them.  In addition to this, these new zombies can also move 2 spaces during the zombie movement stage instead of the standard 1 space. The \u201cMotor Pool\u201d also introduces a rule which means that as soon as a player moves beyond a certain point on that tile then they get a jeep.  Players with this jeep are effectively allowed to move up to double their movement dice roll while on a road. However, as soon as a player enters a building they lose their jeep and  the ability it affords.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zombies 2 Rules PDF|url=http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/fileadmin/downloads/zombies_se_rules.pdf|publisher=Twilight Creations}}</ref>  A [[Zombies!!!#Second edition|second edition]] was released in 2007.\n\nBelow is a list of released Zombies!!! expansions.<ref>[http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/en/boardgames/zombies.html Zombies!!!

Romero]] and [[Sam Raimi]]. The shambling movement of the zombies as compared to the players and the relative ease with which they are dispatched makes them weak enemies individually, but (as in the films) they are strong in large numbers.\n\nPlayers must decide whether to avoid combat and allow the other players to dispose of the zombies for them, or to strike out and collect the various items that the board and event cards provide. Once the Helipad tile is placed, the players can choose between racing to the helicopter (which will often result in death); holding back and hoping to rush in when another player dies; or ignoring the helipad entirely and trying to kill 25 zombies.\n\nThe event cards and the zombie movement phase also provide opportunities to hinder the progress of other players, and there is scope for diplomacy.\n\nThe game can take up to three hours to complete, which was a complaint of some reviewers<ref>[http://iguk.co.uk/blog/2006/01/zombies-review.html Infinity Games UK Blog: Zombies!!! Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\u2014for shorter games, the publishers recommend that the Helipad tile be shuffled in among the other town tiles.\n\nZombies!!! feature 30 map tiles, a 50 card event deck, 6 humans, life and ammunition tokens, AND 100 plastic zombies in different poses.\n\n==Expansions==\n'''''Zombies!!! 2: Zombie Corps(e)''''': This expansion adds a [[military base]] with 15 new tiles and 30 event cards, as well as government-enhanced \"super zombies\" (represented by six glow-in-the-dark zombie figures). A number of additional rule variations are introduced into the base Zombies game through the use of this expansion and the insertion of special tiles.  For example, when the \u201cTop Secret Lab\u201d tile is drawn glow-in-the-dark zombies are placed instead of the normal zombies. These new zombies are considered to be \u201cGovernment Enhanced\u201d zombies and as such require the defending player to roll a 5 or 6 to kill them.  In addition to this, these new zombies can also move 2 spaces during the zombie movement stage instead of the standard 1 space. The \u201cMotor Pool\u201d also introduces a rule which means that as soon as a player moves beyond a certain point on that tile then they get a jeep.  Players with this jeep are effectively allowed to move up to double their movement dice roll while on a road. However, as soon as a player enters a building they lose their jeep and  the ability it affords.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zombies 2 Rules PDF|url=http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/fileadmin/downloads/zombies_se_rules.pdf|publisher=Twilight Creations}}</ref>  A [[Zombies!!!#Second edition|second edition]] was released in 2007.\n\nBelow is a list of released Zombies!!! expansions.<ref>[http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/en/boardgames/zombies.html Zombies!!!
