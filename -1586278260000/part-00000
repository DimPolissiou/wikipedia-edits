Known as \"\u0130slimye\" by the Turks, during Ottoman rule it was a sanjak centre in first [[Rumelia eyalet]], then [[Silistra Eyalet|Silistre]] ([[Ochakov|\u00d6zi]]) eyalet, [[Edirne vilayet]], finally being for a short period a  centre of a department in the autonomous province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] before its inclusion in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885. During the [[First World War]] it was the site of the [[Sliven prisoner of war camp]], the largest such camp in the country. It was the place of internment for Greek and Serbian civilians and soldiers, with peak numbers of 19,000.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Pissari |first=Milovan |date=2013 |title=Bulgarian Crimes against Civilians in Occupied Serbia during the First World War|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2013/0350-76531344357P.pdf|journal=Balcanica |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies  |issue=44 |pages=357\u2013390 |doi=10.2298/BALC1344357P |accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn more modern times, Sliven became one of the most significant cultural centres during the Bulgarian National Revival, with much of its old heritage still preserved and enriched and today offers to its citizens and visitors a lot of opportunities for cultural life. It served as the birthplace of many prominent Bulgarians who contributed to the enlightenment such as [[Hadzhi Dimitar]], [[Dobri Chintulov]], [[Evgeniy Chapkanov]], [[Ivan Seliminski]] and many others. Another notable native is [[Anton Pann]] who composed the [[Romania]]n national anthem. Another notable resident is [[Yordan Letchkov]], whose goal in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] eliminated defending champion Germany. Letchkov was mayor of Sliven from 2003 to 2011.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy of Sliven has centered around industry since the early 19th century. In 1834, [[Dobri Zhelyazkov]] established the first factory in Bulgarian lands, thus starting industrial development in Bulgaria. Sliven was one of the largest industrial centers in Bulgaria, playing an important role during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. It has long-lived traditions in textiles, machine-building, glass-making, chemical production, and the technical and food industries.\n\nFollowing the beginning of communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944, most industries were nationalized and much industrial building and development was spurred. Industry continued to develop until the fall of communism, at which point much of the previously built industry stagnated; many plants and factories were shut down and there was little development.\n\nIn contemporary times, Sliven has experienced a surge in economy with increased investment, banking establishments and new industries have begun to emerge. The dairy industry, which has long been present, continues to grow and thrive. The wine industry, with companies such as [[Bulgarian wine|Vinprom]] and Vini Sliven and about a dozen others, continues to grow as grapes are easily grown due to the climate conditions. In terms of heavy industry, the city produces electric lights and electrical machines. The city has also become notorious as a source of young girls who are trafficked into the sex industry.\n\nLight industry in Sliven is mostly devoted to textiles with many companies making wool clothing, socks, and food.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Dramatic Theatre Sliven .jpg|right|thumb|200px|Theater traditions in Sliven date back 140 years when the city opens its first theatrical stage. The first professional theatrical ensemble was created in 1918 at the Zora community center. The dramatic theater in Sliven, situated on the city's main square. This theatre serves as a venue for various performing arts.]]\nThere are many buildings in the city built in the National Revival Architecture style, including the House museum \"Hadzhi Dimitar\". It is in the south western part of the town and shows visitors a complex  of a native memorial home and an old traditional inn. The Museum collection \"Dobri Chintulov\" is on the North side of Sliven; it was the home of the Bulgarian revival teacher and poet Dobri Chintulov.\nThe city's main theater is located at the main city square. It is named after the Sliven native Stefan Kirov (\u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432) who was a prominent actor and director.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of cities in Bulgaria]]\n* [[Upper Thrace]]\n\n==Twin towns -

Investors are exploring the opportunity to use the famous local wind (Bora) for the production of electricity.\n\nAnother point of interest and a major symbol of the city as featured on the coat of arms, is the more than thousand-year-old Stariyat Briast (\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0411\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0442, \"The Old Elm\"), a huge [[Smooth-leaved Elm]] in the center of the city. In times of the Ottoman rule Turkish officials used to hang Bulgarian revolutionaries on it. Today the city is helping the tree to live on by frequent evaluations and reinforcing its base. It was elected Bulgarian tree of the year in 2013. On 19 March 2014 the results of an online poll were revealed at a ceremony in the European Parliament. The Old Elm was voted [[European Tree of the Year]] 2014. The city also served as an important strategic centre for the [[Bulgarian Army]], with the headquarters of the Bulgarian Third Army located in the centre of the city, being situated relatively near to the sensitive Turkish border.\n\n[[Sliven Peak]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Sliven.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name comes from the Slavic word ''sliv'' (\"pour, confluence\") + the Slavic suffix or ending ''-en''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sliven.gvardia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=221&Itemid=80 |title=\u0417\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d |publisher=\u0411\u041d\u0421 \u2013 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2008-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928233719/http://sliven.gvardia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=221&Itemid=80 |archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref>\n|\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Karandila2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|View of Sliven and the [[Upper Thracian Lowlands|lowlands of Thrace]] from southern [[Stara Planina]]]]\n\nSliven is located 300&nbsp;km east of Bulgaria's capital [[Sofia]], 100&nbsp;km from [[Burgas]], the country's largest commercial port, 130&nbsp;km from the border with [[Greece]] and 130&nbsp;km from the border with [[Turkey]].

Ruins of a [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement dating to around 5th\u20133rd century BCE as well as [[Thrace|Thracian]] ceramics and [[Hellenistic]] coins have been discovered in the area of Hisarlaka \u2014 a small hill in Sliven. In antiquity it was known as ''Selymnos (\u03a3\u03ae\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 in [[Greek language|Greek]])''. The area occupied by present-day Sliven has in the past been settled by the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes Asti, Kabileti and Seleti. These tribes held their independence until time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered them.\n\nThe 2nd century BCE marked the beginning of the Roman conquests of northeastern [[Thracia]]. Sliven was conquered by [[Rome]] around 72\u201371 BCE when the [[Thracians|Thracian]]<ref>Fol, Aleksandar. The Thracian Royal city of Kabyle. - In: Settlement Life in Ancient Thrace.

With the emergence of the [[Roman Empire]] the region of the city became part of the [[Thrace|Thracian]] province of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nA new stage in the city's history began around 2nd-4th century. The first written records of the settlement's name, Tuida/Suida/Tsuida date to this period. This name is most likely of [[Thracian language|Thracian]] origin. Its etymology is currently not understood. Known as \"\u0130slimye\" by the Turks, during Ottoman rule it was a sanjak centre in first [[Rumelia eyalet]], then [[Silistra Eyalet|Silistre]] ([[Ochakov|\u00d6zi]]) eyalet, [[Edirne vilayet]], finally being for a short period a  centre of a department in the autonomous province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] before its inclusion in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885. During the [[First World War]] it was the site of the [[Sliven prisoner of war camp]], the largest such camp in the country. It was the place of internment for Greek and Serbian civilians and soldiers, with peak numbers of 19,000.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Pissari |first=Milovan |date=2013 |title=Bulgarian Crimes against Civilians in Occupied Serbia during the First World War|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2013/0350-76531344357P.pdf|journal=Balcanica |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies  |issue=44 |pages=357\u2013390 |doi=10.2298/BALC1344357P |accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn more modern times, Sliven became one of the most significant cultural centres during the Bulgarian National Revival, with much of its old heritage still preserved and enriched and today offers to its citizens and visitors a lot of opportunities for cultural life. It served as the birthplace of many prominent Bulgarians who contributed to the enlightenment such as [[Hadzhi Dimitar]], [[Dobri Chintulov]], [[Evgeniy Chapkanov]], [[Ivan Seliminski]] and many others. Another notable native is [[Anton Pann]] who composed the [[Romania]]n national anthem. Another notable resident is [[Yordan Letchkov]], whose goal in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] eliminated defending champion Germany. Letchkov was mayor of Sliven from 2003 to 2011.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy of Sliven has centered around industry since the early 19th century. In 1834, [[Dobri Zhelyazkov]] established the first factory in Bulgarian lands, thus starting industrial development in Bulgaria. Sliven was one of the largest industrial centers in Bulgaria, playing an important role during the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. It has long-lived traditions in textiles, machine-building, glass-making, chemical production, and the technical and food industries.\n\nFollowing the beginning of communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944, most industries were nationalized and much industrial building and development was spurred. Industry continued to develop until the fall of communism, at which point much of the previously built industry stagnated; many plants and factories were shut down and there was little development.\n\nIn contemporary times, Sliven has experienced a surge in economy with increased investment, banking establishments and new industries have begun to emerge. The dairy industry, which has long been present, continues to grow and thrive. The wine industry, with companies such as [[Bulgarian wine|Vinprom]] and Vini Sliven and about a dozen others, continues to grow as grapes are easily grown due to the climate conditions. In terms of heavy industry, the city produces electric lights and electrical machines. The city has also become notorious as a source of young girls who are trafficked into the sex industry.\n\nLight industry in Sliven is mostly devoted to textiles with many companies making wool clothing, socks, and food.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Dramatic Theatre Sliven .jpg|right|thumb|200px|Theater traditions in Sliven date back 140 years when the city opens its first theatrical stage. The first professional theatrical ensemble was created in 1918 at the Zora community center. The dramatic theater in Sliven, situated on the city's main square. This theatre serves as a venue for various performing arts.]]\nThere are many buildings in the city built in the National Revival Architecture style, including the House museum \"Hadzhi Dimitar\". It is in the south western part of the town and shows visitors a complex  of a native memorial home and an old traditional inn. The Museum collection \"Dobri Chintulov\" is on the North side of Sliven; it was the home of the Bulgarian revival teacher and poet Dobri Chintulov.\nThe city's main theater is located at the main city square.
