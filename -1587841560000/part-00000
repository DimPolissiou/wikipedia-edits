Its [[unit of measurement|unit]] is [[kilogram]] per [[second]] in [[SI]] units, and [[Slug (unit)|slug]] per second or [[pound (mass)|pound]] per second in [[US customary unit]]s.  The common symbol is <math>\\dot{m}</math> ('''\u1e41''', pronounced \"m-dot\"), although sometimes ''\u03bc'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] lowercase [[Mu (letter)|mu]]) is used.\n\nSometimes, mass flow rate is termed ''[[mass flux]]'' or ''mass current'', see for example ''Fluid Mechanics, Schaum's et al''.<ref>Fluid Mechanics, M. Potter, D.C. Wiggart, Schuam's outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-07-148781-8}}</ref> In this article, the (more intuitive) definition is used.\n\nMass flow rate is defined by the [[limit of a function|limit]]:<ref>http://www.engineersedge.com/fluid_flow/mass_flow_rate.htm</ref><ref>http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/mflow.html</ref>\n\n:<math>\\dot{m} = \\lim\\limits_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\Delta m}{ \\Delta t}= \\frac{{\\rm d}m}{{\\rm d}t}</math>\n\ni.e. the flow of mass ''m'' through a surface per unit time ''t''.\n\nThe overdot on the ''m'' is [[Newton's notation]] for a [[time derivative]]. Since mass is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, the mass flow rate (the time derivative of mass) is also a scalar quantity. The change in mass is the amount that flows ''after'' crossing the boundary for some time duration, not the initial amount of mass at the boundary minus the final amount at the boundary, since the change in mass flowing through the area would be zero for [[steady flow]].\n\n==Alternative equations==\n\nMass flow rate can also be calculated by:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho \\cdot \\dot V = \\rho \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nwhere:\n*''<math>\\dot V</math>'' or '''Q''' = [[Volumetric flow rate|Volume flow rate]],\n*''&rho;'' = mass [[density]] of the fluid,\n*'''v''' = [[Flow velocity]] of the mass elements,\n*'''A''' = [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] [[vector area]]/surface,\n* '''j'''<sub>m</sub> = [[mass flux]].\n\nThe above equation is only true for a flat, plane area. In general, including cases where the area is curved, the equation becomes a [[surface integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\iint_A \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = \\iint_A \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nThe [[area]] required to calculate the mass flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. E.g. for substances passing through a [[Filter paper|filter]] or a [[Artificial membrane|membrane]], the real surface is the (generally curved) surface area of the filter, [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopically]] - ignoring the area spanned by the holes in the filter/membrane. The spaces would be cross-sectional areas. For liquids passing through a pipe, the area is the cross-section of the pipe, at the section considered. The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>. The relation is <math>\\mathbf{A} = A \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>.\n\nThe reason for the dot product is as follows. The only mass flowing ''through'' the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, i.e. [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the unit normal. This amount is:  \n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos\\theta </math>\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the unit normal <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math> and the velocity of mass elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor <math>\\cos\\theta </math>, as ''\u03b8'' increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is [[perpendicular]] to the unit normal, ''doesn't'' actually pass ''through'' the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when ''\u03b8'' = ''\u03c0''/2:\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0</math>\nThese results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate.\n\nConsidering flow through porous media, a special quantity, superficial mass flow rate, can be introduced. It is related with [[superficial velocity]], v<sub>s</sub>, with the following relationship:\n:<math>\\dot m_s = v_s \\cdot \\rho = \\dot m/A </math><ref>Lindeburg M. R.

The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the indigenous inhabitants of the region, and they called the place of the foundation \"Thybzaca\" or \"Old Town\". The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Muisca ''[[Bacat\u00e1]]'' (or Mueket\u00e1) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota.

The civilisation built by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who settled in the valleys and fertile highlands of and surrounding the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] (modern-day [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyac\u00e1 Department|Boyac\u00e1]] and small parts of [[Santander Department|Santander]]), was one of the great civilisations in the Americas. The name [[Muisca Confederation]] has been given to a loose egalitarian society of various chiefs (''caciques'') who lived in small settlements of maximum 100 ''[[Muisca architecture|boh\u00edos]]''. The [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] and [[Muisca economy#Salt|salt-based]] society of the people was rich in goldworking, [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] and [[Muisca mummification|mummification]].

Such was the target of [[Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada]], the [[Kingdom of Granada|Granadanian]] [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistador]] who left [[Santa Marta]] on 6 April 1536 with 800 soldiers, heading towards the interior of current [[Colombia]]. The expedition divided into two groups, one under Quesada's command to move on land, and the other commanded by Diego de Urbino would go up river in four brigantine ships to, later on, meet Quesada troops at the site named Tora de las Barrancas Bermejas. When they arrived, they heard news about Indians inhabiting the south and making large salt cakes used to trade for wild cotton and fish. Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada decided to abandon the route to [[Peru]] and cross the mountain in search of salt villages. They saw crops, trails, white salt cakes and then huts where they found corn, yucca and beans. From Tora, the expedition went up the Op\u00f3n River and found indigenous people wearing very finely painted cotton mantles. When they arrived in Muisca territories in the Andean Plateau, on 9 March 1537, of the expedition leaving [[Santa Marta]], only 162 men were left.<ref name=BancoList>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm List of conquistadors led by Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309181315/http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm |date=9 March 2016 }} \u2013 [[Banco de la Rep\u00fablica]]</ref>\n\nThe ''zipa'' at the moment of [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]] was [[Tisquesusa]]. His main ''boh\u00edo'' was in a small village called ''Bacat\u00e1'' with others in [[Funza]] and [[Cajic\u00e1]], giving name to the present day capital of Colombia. ''Bacat\u00e1'' was actually located near to the modern location of the city of [[Funza]]. A prophecy in his life came true; ''he would be dying, bathing in his own blood''. Defending Funza with a reduced army of [[Muisca warfare|guecha warriors]] against the heavily exhausted but heavily armed strangers, his reign fell in the hands of Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada and his younger brother [[Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada|Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez]] on 20 April 1537. Upon his death, his brother [[Sagipa]] became the last ''zipa'', against the [[Women in Muisca society|inheritance tradition of the Muisca]]. Sagipa used to be a main captain for Tisquesusa but quickly submitted to the Spanish rulers. The first [[encomienda|encomenderos]] asked high prices in valuable products and agricultural production from the indigenous people. On top of that epidemics of European viruses razed through the population, of which in current [[Boyac\u00e1 Department|Boyac\u00e1]] 65\u201385 % of the Muisca were killed within 100 years.<ref>Francis, 2002</ref>\n\nJim\u00e9nez de Quesada decided to establish a military campament in the area in 1538, in the site today known as the Chorro de Quevedo square. The foundation was performed by the construction of 12 houses of reed, referring to the [[Twelve Apostles]], and the construction of a preliminary church, also of reed. With the celebration of the first [[Mass in the Catholic Church|mass]] in the campament, celebrated by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Domingo de las Casas]] the city was founded with the name of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Esperanza (Our Lady of Hope) on 6 August 1538.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Quesada placed his right foot on the bare earth and said simply, \"I take possession of this land in the name of the most sovereign emperor, Charles V.\"\n\nThis founding, however, was irregular as no town council was formed nor were town officials appointed, as well as lacking some other juridical requirements for an official founding. As a consequence, the official founding only occurred about eight months later, on 27 April 1539, in a site close to one of the recreational lands of the ''zipa'', called Theusa or Theusaquillo.<ref name=\":0\" /> This official founding involved an official ceremony appointing a council and officials, and the demarcation of streets and lands, and in it fellow conquistadores [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]] and [[Nikolaus Federmann]] were present. While this was the official date of founding, traditionally it is the 6 August 1538 that is considered the date of the actual foundation.\n\nThe village obtained the title of City by way of a decree from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] on 27 July 1540, which changed the name of the city from Our Lady of Hope to Santa Fe (Holy Faith), after the name of a town nearby [[Granada]] where Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada grew up.<ref name=\":2\" /> Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada and conquerors [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar|De Belalc\u00e1zar]] and [[Nikolaus Federmann|Federmann]] left for Spain in April 1539, founding [[Guataqu\u00ed]] together on 6 April 1539. The rule over the newly created [[New Kingdom of Granada]] was left to Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada's brother, [[Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada]]. The first mayors of the city were capitains [[Pedro de Arevalo]] y [[Jeronimo de Inzar]]. The city obtained the Title of Muy Noble y Muy Leal (Very Noble and Loyal) on 17 August 1575 by a decree from [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]]. Bogot\u00e1, then called Santa Fe, later became the capital of the later [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].<ref name=\"ElCarnero\" /> Following the independence from Spain, Bogot\u00e1 became capital of [[Gran Colombia]] and later the capital of the [[Republic of Colombia]].\n\n=== Spanish colonization ===\nThe city mayor and the chapter formed by two councilmen, assisted by the constable and the police chief, governed the city. For better administration of these domains, in April 1550, the [[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]] of Santaf\u00e9 was organized<!--, for Hearers to act-->. Santa Fe (or Santaf\u00e9) became the seat of the government of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] . Fourteen years later in 1564, the Spanish Crown designated the first Royal Audiencia chairman, [[Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz Venero de Leiva|Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz Venero de Leyva]]. The Chapter and the Royal Audience were located on the other side of what is today the [[Bol\u00edvar Square|Plaza de Bol\u00edvar]] (then called, Plaza Mayor or Major Square). The street connecting the Major Square and the Square of Herbs\u2014 now Santander Park\u2014 was named ''Calle Real'' (Royal Street), now ''Carrera S\u00e9ptima'' (or \"Seventh Street\"; counted from the mountains to the east of the city). After 1717 Santaf\u00e9 became the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nFormed by Europeans, [[mestizo]]s, indigenous people, and slaves, from the second half of the 16th century, the population began to grow rapidly. The 1789 census recorded 18,161 inhabitants, and by 1819 the city population reached 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 195 blocks. Importance grew when the [[Diocese]] was established. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n[[File:CatedralPrimadaBogota2004-7.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Bol\u00edvar Square]]]]\n[[File:Calle real de Bogot\u00e1 en 1869 dibujo de Therond.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|The Royal Street, today known as the Seventh Avenue (Carrera S\u00e9ptima)]]\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n de la Sabana 2010 retusche.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Bogot\u00e1's Railroad Central Station]]\nPolitical unease over the Spanish monarchy and the rights of citizens born in the Americas had been feeling all over Spanish colonies in America, and it was expressed in New Granada in many different ways, accelerating the movement to independence.

He left an imprint, though. One of the soldiers witnessing his execution was an intellectually curious, noble teenager named [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], who was deeply impressed by both the insurrection and the execution. Nari\u00f1o went on to become a politician in Santaf\u00e9, and he became acquainted with the liberal ideas in vogue in Europe. He started organizing clandestine meetings with other intellectuals and politicians to discuss and promote the independence of the American colonies from the Spanish crown. In 1794, Nari\u00f1o clandestinely translated and published in Santa Fe the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of the Rights of Men and of the Citizen]], and copies of his translation were distributed all over the continent and started creating a stirring in the political mentalities of the time. The Spanish government had banned the distribution of the pamphlet and soon discovered the material and burned any copy that they could find. Nari\u00f1o was arrested on 29 August 1794, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and to have all of his properties confiscated, and was sent to exile the year after. Those suspected of being part of Nari\u00f1o's intellectual circle were also persecuted, but his ideas had become widespread.<ref>{{Citation|last=McFarlane|first=Anthony|pages=400|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511529122|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511529122.019|chapter=Cambridge Latin American Studies|title=Colombia before Independence|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nIn 1807, following the [[Peninsular War|French invasion of Spain]] and the subsequent [[Abdications of Bayonne|abdication]] of the [[House of Bourbon]] in Spain, pressed by [[Napoleon]] to give the crown to his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], resulting in the destruction of the Spanish administration, many in Spain and in the American colonies created local resistance governments called [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]]. The dissolution of the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|Supreme Central Junta]], following a series of military defeats in the Spanish troops promoted the [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|creation of local juntas]] all throughout Latin America, which very soon consolidated the independentist ideas already in vogue. After the establishment of a junta in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]] on 22 May 1810, and in many other cities throughout the Viceroyalty, the '''Junta de Santa Fe''' was established in 20 July 1810, in what is often called the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence]]. The Junta adopted the name of \"Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada\", and first swore allegiance to Viceroy [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n]], and appointed him as president, but then he was deposed and arrested five days later. After declaring independence from Spain the different juntas attempted to establish a congress of provinces, but they were unable to do so and military conflicts soon emerged.\n\nThe period between 1810 and 1816 was marked by intense conflict between federalist and centralist factions over the nature of the new government of the recently emancipated juntas, a period that has become known as ''[[Foolish Fatherland|la Patria Boba]]''. The Province of Santaf\u00e9 became the [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca]], which soon became embroiled in a civil war against other of the local juntas which banded together to form the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] and advocated for a federalist government system. Following a failed military campaign against Quito, General [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of the United Provinces led a campaign that led to the surrender of the Cundinamarca province in December 1814.\n\nIn Spain, the war had ended and the [[Spanish monarchy]] was restored on 11 December 1813. King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] declared the uprisings in the colonies illegal and sent a large army to quell the rebellions and reconquer the lost colonies, for which he appointed General [[Pablo Morillo]]. Morillo led a [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|successful military campaign]] that culminated in the capture of Santaf\u00e9 on 6 May 1816.\n\nIn 1819, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]] initiated his [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|campaign to liberate New Granada]]. Following a series of battles, the last of which was the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]], the republican army led by Bol\u00edvar cleared its way to Santaf\u00e9, where he arrived victorious on 10 August 1819. It was [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogot\u00e1, to honor the Muisca people and to emphasize the emancipation from Spain. Bogot\u00e1 then became the capital of the [[Gran Colombia]].\n\nBetween 1819 and 1849, there were no fundamental structural changes from the colonial period. By the mid-19th century, a series of fundamental reforms were enacted, some of the most important being slavery abolition and religious, teaching, print and speech industry and trade freedom, among others. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} During the decade of the 70s, radicalism accelerated reforms and state and social institutions were substantially modified.

Following the 1946 liberal party division, a conservative candidate took presidential office again in 1948, after the killing of liberal leader [[Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n]], Bogot\u00e1's downtown was virtually destroyed as violence reigned. From then, Bogot\u00e1's urban, architectural and population sectors were substantially reorganized.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Twenty-first century ===\n\n[[File:Centro internacional.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Bogot\u00e1 is the third largest city within city limits in South America by population, after [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Lima]] ]]\n\nThe city begins the 21st century with important changes in its urban space and public transport, looking to plan a demographic and economic growth that would position it as a strategic hub for international business in Latin America. Some of the main interventions initiated in this century looked to develop projects contained in the Plan of Territorial Ordering (POT), which will guide the development of the city for the next two centuries.\n\nOne of the most important interventions in the city for this time was its transportation system. In 1967, there were 2,679 urban buses in Bogot\u00e1 that transported, on average, 1,629,254 passengers per day. The city had a little more than a million inhabitants and 8,000 hectares in length, the service was relatively reasonable and comfortable. But as the city grew and reached more than five million inhabitants and an area greater than 30,000 hectares, not only did the car fleet increase substantially to reach more than 20,000 vehicles, but chaos multiplied, as well as pollution and the inefficiency of the only existing transportation system.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the situation was critical. There was no real urban public transport system that would serve as an alternative to the private vehicle - which further incentivized its use - and the city had low levels of competitiveness in Latin America, as well as an unsatisfactory quality of life for the vast majority of its inhabitants.\n\nThe administrations of mayors [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana]] (1988-1990) and Jaime Castro (1992-1994), in addition to the first one of [[Antanas Mockus]] (1995 - 1997), formulated proposals to solve the problem of public transport, with limited results. It was during the mayoralty of the latter when there was an insistent talk about the possibility of establishing a mass transportation system that would help remedy the problem of mobility in Bogot\u00e1.\n\nUnder the second administration of [[Antanas Mockus]] , Bogota opened a 'zone of tolerancia' which legalized prostitution in a large swath  of the center of the city in the Santa Fe neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/colombia/bogota-zona.htm|title=Primera zona de tolerancia en Bogot\u00e1|website=www.latinamericanstudies.org}}</ref>\n\nMayor [[Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa]] (1998-2000) included in his government program as a priority project a solution to the problem of public transport. Consequently, in the execution of the development plan \"For the Bogot\u00e1 we Want\" in terms of mobility and in a concrete way to the massive transportation system project, the construction of a special infrastructure exclusively for its operation was determined. This system would include specialized bus corridors, equipped with single-use lanes, stations, bridges, bike paths and special pedestrian access platforms, designed to facilitate the user's experience in the system. However, Pe\u00f1alosa was became infamous for this campaign against the poor, saying he would rather see robbers on the streets rather than people selling candies.\n\nAfter getting elected in 2011, [[Gustavo Petro]], a populist mayor, clashed with conservative political establishment after remunicipalization of the city's garbage collection system. The inspector general, [[Alejandro Ordo\u00f1ez]] deposed Petro  for alleged constitutional overreach and when he tried to replace the city's private trash collectors. Petro was reinstated weeks later after a Bogota court ruled that the [[Alejandro Ordo\u00f1ez]] had overstepped his authority.\n\nAlthough the proposal for biarticulated diesel buses called \"Transmilenio\" was in its early stages a success, due in part to the small numbers of passengers that it transported, in the long term it became an inefficient and contaminating system, saturated for a metro population of almost ten million inhabitants, guilty of environmental deterioration and air pollution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/publicaciones/146028/historia-de-transmilenio/|title=Historia de TransMilenio|website=www.transmilenio.gov.co|access-date=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420012617/https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/publicaciones/146028/historia-de-transmilenio/|archive-date=20 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bogota Centro Internacional Latam Business Hub.jpg|thumb|right|International Business Center, Bogota D.C.]]\n\nFor its part, the cultural equipment plan of Bogot\u00e1 has given as one of its most significant results the construction of three large public libraries in different sectors of the city, in addition to the provision of existing ones. The new libraries were located in sectors that allow a wide coverage, have easy access by public transport and bike paths; and their projects were commissioned to distinguished architects of the city. They are those of El Tunal, in the south, projected by the architect Suely Vargas of El Tintal, in the west, the work of the architect Daniel Berm\u00fadez, and the Virgilio Barco Vargas library, located in the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar park in the central area, work of the architect Rogelio Salmona.

''Carreras'' (roads) run from north to south vertically, with numbering increasing from east to west. (with the suffix \"Este\" for roads east of Carrera 0).

According to the Consultancy for Human Rights, Codhes, in the period 1999-2005 more than 260,000 displaced persons arrived in Bogot\u00e1, approximately 3.8% of the total population of Bogot\u00e1. The locations where the majority of the displaced population is concentrated are Ciudad Bolivar, Kennedy, Bosa and Usme. For this reason, the children of the migrant population born in Bogot\u00e1 (rolos) often do not have a sense of belonging to the city or a cultural identity as marked as that of the cachacos. However, due to the growing acculturation of rolos and the decreasing number of ethnic cachacos in Bogot\u00e1, the\u00a0 population of rolos tends to be predominant in the city\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ethnic and demographic evolution of Bogot\u00e1\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Year'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Pop.'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Bogota natives'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Other colombians'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Foreigners'''\n|-\n|'''Rolos'''\n|'''Cachacos'''\n|-\n|'''1951'''\n|715.250\n|10.729\n|693.793\n|8047\n|2682\n|-\n|'''1964'''\n|1.697.311\n|135.785\n|1.425.741\n|101.839\n|33.946\n|-\n|'''1973'''\n|2.855.065\n|356.883\n|2.141.299\n|267.662\n|89.221\n|-\n|'''1985'''\n|4.236.490\n|783.751\n|2.668.989\n|587.813\n|195.938\n|-\n|'''1993'''\n|5.484.244\n|1.233.955\n|3.016.334\n|925.466\n|308.489\n|-\n|'''2005'''\n|6.778.691\n|1.931.927\n|2.914.837\n|1.448.945\n|482.982\n|-\n|'''2018'''\n|7.412.566\n|2.594.398\n|2.223.770\n|1.945.799\n|648.600\n|-\n|'''2020'''\n|7.743.955\n|2.787.824\n|2.168.307\n|2.090.868\n|696.956\n|}\n\n=== Crime ===\nBogot\u00e1 has gone to great lengths to change its formerly notorious crime rate and its image with increasing success after being considered in the 1990s to be one of the most violent cities in the world.<ref>{{cite web |year= 2005 |url= http://www.comunidadesegura.org/?q=en/node/32000 |title= Bogot\u00e1's lesson in crime fighting |publisher= Comunidad Segura |accessdate= 2008-12-28 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181127064701/https://www.comunidadesegura.org/?q=en%2Fnode%2F32000 |archive-date= 27 November 2018 |url-status= live }}</ref> In 1993 there were 4,352 murders at a rate of 81 per 100,000 people;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.institut-gouvernance.org/en/conference/fiche-conference-36.html |title=Seguridad, ciudadan\u00eda y pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas en Bogot\u00e1 |publisher=IRG |accessdate=29 December 2008 |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622012727/http://www.institut-gouvernance.org/en/conference/fiche-conference-36.html |archivedate=22 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in 2007 Bogot\u00e1 suffered 1,401 murders at a rate of 20 per 100,000 inhabitants, and had a further reduction to 14 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017 (the lowest since 1979).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/bogota/bogota-confirma-baja-historica-en-tasa-de-homicidios-en-2017-167202|title=Bogot\u00e1 confirma baja hist\u00f3rica en tasa de homicidios|publisher=El Tiempo|accessdate=2 January 2018|language=spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103034159/http://www.eltiempo.com/bogota/bogota-confirma-baja-historica-en-tasa-de-homicidios-en-2017-167202|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/bogota/expertos-analizan-ndice-de-homicidios-en-bogot_12497841-4 |title=Homicidios |format=PDF |page=36 |publisher=El Tiempos |accessdate=29 December 2008 |language=spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620035628/http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/bogota/expertos-analizan-ndice-de-homicidios-en-bogot_12497841-4 |archive-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinalegal.gov.co/drip/2007/2%20Forensis%202007%20homicidio-1.pdf |title=Homicidios |page=36 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal y Ciencias Forenses |accessdate=29 December 2008 |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217232140/http://www.medicinalegal.gov.co/drip/2007/2%20Forensis%202007%20homicidio-1.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> This success was mainly the result of a participatory and integrated security policy;

The bigger buses were divided into two categories: ''Ejecutivo'', which was originally to be a deluxe service and was not to carry standing passengers, and ''corriente'' or normal service. Since May 2008, all buses run as ''corriente'' services. Bogot\u00e1 is a [[Transportation hub|hub]] for domestic and international bus routes.

TransMilenio combines articulated buses that operate on dedicated bus roads (busways) and smaller buses (feeders) that operate in residential areas, bringing passengers to the main grid. TransMilenio's main routes are: Caracas Avenue, Northern Highway (''Autopista Norte''), 80th Street, Americas Avenue, Jim\u00e9nez Avenue, and 30th Avenue (also referred to as ''Norte Quito Sur'' or ''N.Q.S.'' for short). Routes for Suba Avenue and Southern Highway (''Autopista Sur''), the southern leg of the 30th Avenue, were opened in April 2006. The third phase of the system will cover 7th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and 26th Street (or ''Avenida El Dorado''). The system is planned to cover the entire city by 2030. Although the Transmilenio carries commuters to numerous corners of the city, it is more expensive (US$0.80 or 2300 COP) than any public transport, except taxis.\n\nIn addition to TransMilenio, the Pe\u00f1alosa administration and voter-approved referenda helped to establish travel restrictions on cars with certain license plate numbers during peak hours called [[Pico y placa]]; {{convert|121|km|0|abbr=off}} of [[Ciclov\u00eda]] on Sundays and major holidays; a massive system ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}) of bicycle paths and segregated lanes called ''[[Bogot\u00e1's Bike Paths Network|ciclorrutas]]''; and the removal of thousands of parking spots in an attempt to make roads more pedestrian-friendly and discourage car use.

The yellow denotes the gold from the earth, as well as the virtues of justice, clemency, benevolence, the so-called \"mundane qualities\" (defined as nobility, excellence, richness, generosity, splendour, health, steadfastness, joy and prosperity), long life, eternity, power and constancy. The red denotes the virtue of charity, as well as the qualities of bravery, nobility, values, audacity, victory, honour and furor, Colombians call it the blood of their people. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe coat of arms of the city was granted by emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V (Charles I of Spain)]] to the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], by royal decree given in [[Valladolid]], Spain on 3 December 1548. It contains a black eagle in the center, which symbolises steadfastness. The eagle is also a symbol of the Habsburgs, which was the ruling family of the Spanish empire at the time. The eagle is crowned with gold and holds a red pomegranate inside a golden background. The border contains olive branches with nine golden pomegranates on a blue background. The two red pomegranates symbolize audacity, and the nine golden ones represent the nine states which constituted the New Kingdom of Granada at the time. In 1932 the coat of arms was officially recognized and adopted as the symbol of Bogot\u00e1. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBogot\u00e1's anthem lyrics were written by Pedro Medina Avenda\u00f1o; the melody was composed by Roberto Pineda Duque.

It is the political, economic, administrative and industrial center of the country.\n\nBogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] on 6 August 1538, by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada]] after a harsh [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca]]. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the indigenous inhabitants of the region, and they called the place of the foundation \"Thybzaca\" or \"Old Town\". The name of Bogot\u00e1 corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Muisca ''[[Bacat\u00e1]]'' (or Mueket\u00e1) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota.

The civilisation built by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who settled in the valleys and fertile highlands of and surrounding the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] (modern-day [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyac\u00e1 Department|Boyac\u00e1]] and small parts of [[Santander Department|Santander]]), was one of the great civilisations in the Americas. The name [[Muisca Confederation]] has been given to a loose egalitarian society of various chiefs (''caciques'') who lived in small settlements of maximum 100 ''[[Muisca architecture|boh\u00edos]]''.

Such was the target of [[Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada]], the [[Kingdom of Granada|Granadanian]] [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistador]] who left [[Santa Marta]] on 6 April 1536 with 800 soldiers, heading towards the interior of current [[Colombia]]. The expedition divided into two groups, one under Quesada's command to move on land, and the other commanded by Diego de Urbino would go up river in four brigantine ships to, later on, meet Quesada troops at the site named Tora de las Barrancas Bermejas. When they arrived, they heard news about Indians inhabiting the south and making large salt cakes used to trade for wild cotton and fish. Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada decided to abandon the route to [[Peru]] and cross the mountain in search of salt villages. They saw crops, trails, white salt cakes and then huts where they found corn, yucca and beans. From Tora, the expedition went up the Op\u00f3n River and found indigenous people wearing very finely painted cotton mantles. When they arrived in Muisca territories in the Andean Plateau, on 9 March 1537, of the expedition leaving [[Santa Marta]], only 162 men were left.<ref name=BancoList>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm List of conquistadors led by Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309181315/http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm |date=9 March 2016 }} \u2013 [[Banco de la Rep\u00fablica]]</ref>\n\nThe ''zipa'' at the moment of [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]] was [[Tisquesusa]]. His main ''boh\u00edo'' was in a small village called ''Bacat\u00e1'' with others in [[Funza]] and [[Cajic\u00e1]], giving name to the present day capital of Colombia. ''Bacat\u00e1'' was actually located near to the modern location of the city of [[Funza]]. A prophecy in his life came true; ''he would be dying, bathing in his own blood''. Defending Funza with a reduced army of [[Muisca warfare|guecha warriors]] against the heavily exhausted but heavily armed strangers, his reign fell in the hands of Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada and his younger brother [[Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada|Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez]] on 20 April 1537. Upon his death, his brother [[Sagipa]] became the last ''zipa'', against the [[Women in Muisca society|inheritance tradition of the Muisca]]. Sagipa used to be a main captain for Tisquesusa but quickly submitted to the Spanish rulers. The first [[encomienda|encomenderos]] asked high prices in valuable products and agricultural production from the indigenous people. On top of that epidemics of European viruses razed through the population, of which in current [[Boyac\u00e1 Department|Boyac\u00e1]] 65\u201385 % of the Muisca were killed within 100 years.<ref>Francis, 2002</ref>\n\nJim\u00e9nez de Quesada decided to establish a military campament in the area in 1538, in the site today known as the Chorro de Quevedo square. The foundation was performed by the construction of 12 houses of reed, referring to the [[Twelve Apostles]], and the construction of a preliminary church, also of reed. With the celebration of the first [[Mass in the Catholic Church|mass]] in the campament, celebrated by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Domingo de las Casas]] the city was founded with the name of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Esperanza (Our Lady of Hope) on 6 August 1538.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Quesada placed his right foot on the bare earth and said simply, \"I take possession of this land in the name of the most sovereign emperor, Charles V.\"\n\nThis founding, however, was irregular as no town council was formed nor were town officials appointed, as well as lacking some other juridical requirements for an official founding. As a consequence, the official founding only occurred about eight months later, on 27 April 1539, in a site close to one of the recreational lands of the ''zipa'', called Theusa or Theusaquillo.<ref name=\":0\" /> This official founding involved an official ceremony appointing a council and officials, and the demarcation of streets and lands, and in it fellow conquistadores [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]] and [[Nikolaus Federmann]] were present. While this was the official date of founding, traditionally it is the 6 August 1538 that is considered the date of the actual foundation.\n\nThe village obtained the title of City by way of a decree from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] on 27 July 1540, which changed the name of the city from Our Lady of Hope to Santa Fe (Holy Faith), after the name of a town nearby [[Granada]] where Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada grew up.<ref name=\":2\" /> Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada and conquerors [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar|De Belalc\u00e1zar]] and [[Nikolaus Federmann|Federmann]] left for Spain in April 1539, founding [[Guataqu\u00ed]] together on 6 April 1539. The rule over the newly created [[New Kingdom of Granada]] was left to Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada's brother, [[Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada]]. The first mayors of the city were capitains [[Pedro de Arevalo]] y [[Jeronimo de Inzar]]. The city obtained the Title of Muy Noble y Muy Leal (Very Noble and Loyal) on 17 August 1575 by a decree from [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]]. Bogot\u00e1, then called Santa Fe, later became the capital of the later [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].<ref name=\"ElCarnero\" /> Following the independence from Spain, Bogot\u00e1 became capital of [[Gran Colombia]] and later the capital of the [[Republic of Colombia]].\n\n=== Spanish colonization ===\nThe city mayor and the chapter formed by two councilmen, assisted by the constable and the police chief, governed the city. For better administration of these domains, in April 1550, the [[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]] of Santaf\u00e9 was organized<!--, for Hearers to act-->. Santa Fe (or Santaf\u00e9) became the seat of the government of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] . Fourteen years later in 1564, the Spanish Crown designated the first Royal Audiencia chairman, [[Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz Venero de Leiva|Andr\u00e9s D\u00edaz Venero de Leyva]]. The Chapter and the Royal Audience were located on the other side of what is today the [[Bol\u00edvar Square|Plaza de Bol\u00edvar]] (then called, Plaza Mayor or Major Square). The street connecting the Major Square and the Square of Herbs\u2014 now Santander Park\u2014 was named ''Calle Real'' (Royal Street), now ''Carrera S\u00e9ptima'' (or \"Seventh Street\"; counted from the mountains to the east of the city). After 1717 Santaf\u00e9 became the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nFormed by Europeans, [[mestizo]]s, indigenous people, and slaves, from the second half of the 16th century, the population began to grow rapidly. The 1789 census recorded 18,161 inhabitants, and by 1819 the city population reached 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 195 blocks. Importance grew when the [[Diocese]] was established. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\n[[File:CatedralPrimadaBogota2004-7.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Bol\u00edvar Square]]]]\n[[File:Calle real de Bogot\u00e1 en 1869 dibujo de Therond.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|The Royal Street, today known as the Seventh Avenue (Carrera S\u00e9ptima)]]\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n de la Sabana 2010 retusche.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Bogot\u00e1's Railroad Central Station]]\nPolitical unease over the Spanish monarchy and the rights of citizens born in the Americas had been feeling all over Spanish colonies in America, and it was expressed in New Granada in many different ways, accelerating the movement to independence.

One of the soldiers witnessing his execution was an intellectually curious, noble teenager named [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]], who was deeply impressed by both the insurrection and the execution. Nari\u00f1o went on to become a politician in Santaf\u00e9, and he became acquainted with the liberal ideas in vogue in Europe. He started organizing clandestine meetings with other intellectuals and politicians to discuss and promote the independence of the American colonies from the Spanish crown. In 1794, Nari\u00f1o clandestinely translated and published in Santa Fe the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of the Rights of Men and of the Citizen]], and copies of his translation were distributed all over the continent and started creating a stirring in the political mentalities of the time. The Spanish government had banned the distribution of the pamphlet and soon discovered the material and burned any copy that they could find. Nari\u00f1o was arrested on 29 August 1794, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and to have all of his properties confiscated, and was sent to exile the year after.

The dissolution of the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|Supreme Central Junta]], following a series of military defeats in the Spanish troops promoted the [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|creation of local juntas]] all throughout Latin America, which very soon consolidated the independentist ideas already in vogue. After the establishment of a junta in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]] on 22 May 1810, and in many other cities throughout the Viceroyalty, the '''Junta de Santa Fe''' was established in 20 July 1810, in what is often called the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence]]. The Junta adopted the name of \"Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada\", and first swore allegiance to Viceroy [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 Amar y Borb\u00f3n]], and appointed him as president, but then he was deposed and arrested five days later. After declaring independence from Spain the different juntas attempted to establish a congress of provinces, but they were unable to do so and military conflicts soon emerged.\n\nThe period between 1810 and 1816 was marked by intense conflict between federalist and centralist factions over the nature of the new government of the recently emancipated juntas, a period that has become known as ''[[Foolish Fatherland|la Patria Boba]]''. The Province of Santaf\u00e9 became the [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca]], which soon became embroiled in a civil war against other of the local juntas which banded together to form the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] and advocated for a federalist government system. Following a failed military campaign against Quito, General [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of the United Provinces led a campaign that led to the surrender of the Cundinamarca province in December 1814.\n\nIn Spain, the war had ended and the [[Spanish monarchy]] was restored on 11 December 1813. King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] declared the uprisings in the colonies illegal and sent a large army to quell the rebellions and reconquer the lost colonies, for which he appointed General [[Pablo Morillo]]. Morillo led a [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|successful military campaign]] that culminated in the capture of Santaf\u00e9 on 6 May 1816.\n\nIn 1819, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]] initiated his [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|campaign to liberate New Granada]]. Following a series of battles, the last of which was the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]], the republican army led by Bol\u00edvar cleared its way to Santaf\u00e9, where he arrived victorious on 10 August 1819. It was [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogot\u00e1, to honor the Muisca people and to emphasize the emancipation from Spain. Bogot\u00e1 then became the capital of the [[Gran Colombia]].\n\nBetween 1819 and 1849, there were no fundamental structural changes from the colonial period. By the mid-19th century, a series of fundamental reforms were enacted, some of the most important being slavery abolition and religious, teaching, print and speech industry and trade freedom, among others. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} During the decade of the 70s, radicalism accelerated reforms and state and social institutions were substantially modified. However, during the second half of the century, the country faced permanent pronouncements, declarations of rebellions between states, and factions which resulted in civil wars: the last and bloodiest was the [[Thousand Days' War]] from 1899 to 1902. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 1823, a few years after the formation of Gran Colombia, the Public Library, now the National Library, was enlarged and modernized with new volumes and better facilities. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The National Museum was founded.

In the middle of political and administration avatars, Bogot\u00e1 continued as the capital and principal political center of the country.\n\nFrom a base of only 20,000 people in 1793, the city grew to approximately 117,000 people in 1912.

From then, Bogot\u00e1's urban, architectural and population sectors were substantially reorganized.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Twenty-first century ===\n\n[[File:Centro internacional.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Bogot\u00e1 is the third largest city within city limits in South America by population, after [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Lima]] ]]\n\nThe city begins the 21st century with important changes in its urban space and public transport, looking to plan a demographic and economic growth that would position it as a strategic hub for international business in Latin America. Some of the main interventions initiated in this century looked to develop projects contained in the Plan of Territorial Ordering (POT), which will guide the development of the city for the next two centuries.\n\nOne of the most important interventions in the city for this time was its transportation system. In 1967, there were 2,679 urban buses in Bogot\u00e1 that transported, on average, 1,629,254 passengers per day. The city had a little more than a million inhabitants and 8,000 hectares in length, the service was relatively reasonable and comfortable. But as the city grew and reached more than five million inhabitants and an area greater than 30,000 hectares, not only did the car fleet increase substantially to reach more than 20,000 vehicles, but chaos multiplied, as well as pollution and the inefficiency of the only existing transportation system.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the situation was critical. There was no real urban public transport system that would serve as an alternative to the private vehicle - which further incentivized its use - and the city had low levels of competitiveness in Latin America, as well as an unsatisfactory quality of life for the vast majority of its inhabitants.\n\nThe administrations of mayors [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana]] (1988-1990) and Jaime Castro (1992-1994), in addition to the first one of [[Antanas Mockus]] (1995 - 1997), formulated proposals to solve the problem of public transport, with limited results. It was during the mayoralty of the latter when there was an insistent talk about the possibility of establishing a mass transportation system that would help remedy the problem of mobility in Bogot\u00e1.\n\nUnder the second administration of [[Antanas Mockus]] , Bogota opened a 'zone of tolerancia' which legalized prostitution in a large swath  of the center of the city in the Santa Fe neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/colombia/bogota-zona.htm|title=Primera zona de tolerancia en Bogot\u00e1|website=www.latinamericanstudies.org}}</ref>\n\nMayor [[Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa]] (1998-2000) included in his government program as a priority project a solution to the problem of public transport. Consequently, in the execution of the development plan \"For the Bogot\u00e1 we Want\" in terms of mobility and in a concrete way to the massive transportation system project, the construction of a special infrastructure exclusively for its operation was determined. This system would include specialized bus corridors, equipped with single-use lanes, stations, bridges, bike paths and special pedestrian access platforms, designed to facilitate the user's experience in the system. However, Pe\u00f1alosa was became infamous for this campaign against the poor, saying he would rather see robbers on the streets rather than people selling candies.\n\nAfter getting elected in 2011, [[Gustavo Petro]], a populist mayor, clashed with conservative political establishment after remunicipalization of the city's garbage collection system. The inspector general, [[Alejandro Ordo\u00f1ez]] deposed Petro  for alleged constitutional overreach and when he tried to replace the city's private trash collectors. Petro was reinstated weeks later after a Bogota court ruled that the [[Alejandro Ordo\u00f1ez]] had overstepped his authority.\n\nAlthough the proposal for biarticulated diesel buses called \"Transmilenio\" was in its early stages a success, due in part to the small numbers of passengers that it transported, in the long term it became an inefficient and contaminating system, saturated for a metro population of almost ten million inhabitants, guilty of environmental deterioration and air pollution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/publicaciones/146028/historia-de-transmilenio/|title=Historia de TransMilenio|website=www.transmilenio.gov.co|access-date=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420012617/https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/publicaciones/146028/historia-de-transmilenio/|archive-date=20 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bogota Centro Internacional Latam Business Hub.jpg|thumb|right|International Business Center, Bogota D.C.]]\n\nFor its part, the cultural equipment plan of Bogot\u00e1 has given as one of its most significant results the construction of three large public libraries in different sectors of the city, in addition to the provision of existing ones. The new libraries were located in sectors that allow a wide coverage, have easy access by public transport and bike paths; and their projects were commissioned to distinguished architects of the city. They are those of El Tunal, in the south, projected by the architect Suely Vargas of El Tintal, in the west, the work of the architect Daniel Berm\u00fadez, and the Virgilio Barco Vargas library, located in the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar park in the central area, work of the architect Rogelio Salmona.

''Carreras'' (roads) run from north to south vertically, with numbering increasing from east to west. (with the suffix \"Este\" for roads east of Carrera 0).

The locations where the majority of the displaced population is concentrated are Ciudad Bolivar, Kennedy, Bosa and Usme. For this reason, the children of the migrant population born in Bogot\u00e1 (rolos) often do not have a sense of belonging to the city or a cultural identity as marked as that of the cachacos.

Buses remain the main means of mass transit. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the [[TransMilenio]].\n\nThe traditional system runs a variety of bus types, operated by several companies on normal streets and avenues: ''Bus'' (large buses), ''Buseta'' (medium size buses) and ''Colectivo'' (vans or minivans). The bigger buses were divided into two categories: ''Ejecutivo'', which was originally to be a deluxe service and was not to carry standing passengers, and ''corriente'' or normal service. Since May 2008, all buses run as ''corriente'' services. Bogot\u00e1 is a [[Transportation hub|hub]] for domestic and international bus routes.

TransMilenio combines articulated buses that operate on dedicated bus roads (busways) and smaller buses (feeders) that operate in residential areas, bringing passengers to the main grid. TransMilenio's main routes are: Caracas Avenue, Northern Highway (''Autopista Norte''), 80th Street, Americas Avenue, Jim\u00e9nez Avenue, and 30th Avenue (also referred to as ''Norte Quito Sur'' or ''N.Q.S.'' for short). Routes for Suba Avenue and Southern Highway (''Autopista Sur''), the southern leg of the 30th Avenue, were opened in April 2006. The third phase of the system will cover 7th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and 26th Street (or ''Avenida El Dorado''). The system is planned to cover the entire city by 2030. Although the Transmilenio carries commuters to numerous corners of the city, it is more expensive (US$0.80 or 2300 COP) than any public transport, except taxis.\n\nIn addition to TransMilenio, the Pe\u00f1alosa administration and voter-approved referenda helped to establish travel restrictions on cars with certain license plate numbers during peak hours called [[Pico y placa]]; {{convert|121|km|0|abbr=off}} of [[Ciclov\u00eda]] on Sundays and major holidays; a massive system ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}) of bicycle paths and segregated lanes called ''[[Bogot\u00e1's Bike Paths Network|ciclorrutas]]''; and the removal of thousands of parking spots in an attempt to make roads more pedestrian-friendly and discourage car use. ''Ciclorrutas'' is one of the most extensive dedicated bike path networks of any city in the world, with a total extension of {{convert|376|km|0|abbr=off}}. It extends from the north of the city, 170th Street, to the south, 27th Street, and from [[Monserrate]] on the east to the [[Bogot\u00e1 River]] on the west.

The yellow denotes the gold from the earth, as well as the virtues of justice, clemency, benevolence, the so-called \"mundane qualities\" (defined as nobility, excellence, richness, generosity, splendour, health, steadfastness, joy and prosperity), long life, eternity, power and constancy. The red denotes the virtue of charity, as well as the qualities of bravery, nobility, values, audacity, victory, honour and furor, Colombians call it the blood of their people. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe coat of arms of the city was granted by emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V (Charles I of Spain)]] to the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], by royal decree given in [[Valladolid]], Spain on 3 December 1548. It contains a black eagle in the center, which symbolises steadfastness. The eagle is also a symbol of the Habsburgs, which was the ruling family of the Spanish empire at the time. The eagle is crowned with gold and holds a red pomegranate inside a golden background. The border contains olive branches with nine golden pomegranates on a blue background. The two red pomegranates symbolize audacity, and the nine golden ones represent the nine states which constituted the New Kingdom of Granada at the time. In 1932 the coat of arms was officially recognized and adopted as the symbol of Bogot\u00e1. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBogot\u00e1's anthem lyrics were written by Pedro Medina Avenda\u00f1o; the melody was composed by Roberto Pineda Duque.

{"title_page": "Girod Street Cemetery", "text_new": "The '''Girod Street Cemetery''' (also known as the Protestant Cemetery) was a large above-ground cemetery that resided in central New Orleans, Louisiana, established in 1822 for [[Protestant]] residents of the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Faubourg St. Mary]] and was closed down in 1940, with the bodies being exhumed and moved elsewhere. The cemetery then remained empty and derelict until it was officially torn down on January 4, 1957. \n\nIt consisted of 2,319 wall vaults and approximately 1,100 tombs. As the cemetery was above ground with mostly wall vaults, and was located in what was considered a very \u201cconvenient\u201d central area of the city, it had been become used as a public burying ground to stack bodies, especially during  epidemics. Notables interred there included [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Henry Adams Bullard]], Zulu Social Club King Joseph J. Smith,<ref name=Zulu/> Lieutenant Colonel [[William Wallace Smith Bliss]], and [[California]] [[Governor of California|governor]] [[John B. Weller]].\n\nThere were multiple cases (usually during a major epidemic in the nineteenth century) of people getting in fights because people were over stacking the tombs and wall vaults, and they even had to stack bodies near the entrance because there were not enough people to bury the bodies. As it was described during the 1833 cholera epidemic \u201c...the shrouded dead dumped at the gateway of the Girod Street Cemetery accumulated in such numbers that the entrance to its precincts was so obstructed that arriving bodies had to be deposited on the outside; no graves at this time could be dug; no coffins procurable, for there were neither grave diggers to be had nor undertakers to be found.\u201d Because most of the bodies in the vaults were from epidemics, the site came to be known as the \u201cyellow fever mound\u201d. \n[[File:Girod Cemetery Vaults New Orleans 1885.jpg|right|thumb|Row of crypts in Girod Cemetery, 1885]]\n\nGirod Street Cemetery was laid out along a central artery with side aisles, and was noted for its so-called \"society tombs,\" which could rise seven or eight tiers above ground.<ref name=up/>  Societies of (former) [[History of slavery in Louisiana|slaves]] owned their own tombs: the First African Baptist Association, the Home Missionary Benevolent Society, and the Male and Female Lutheran Benevolent Society.  The New Lusitanos Benevolent Association owned the largest society tomb in Girod Street Cemetery, which was designed by J.N.B. de Pouilly in 1859.<ref name=JNB/>\n\nIn 1880, a commissioner of Louisiana inspected all the cemeteries of New Orleans. All of them were found to be in good condition except for the Girod Street Cemetery. Since the cemetery vaults had been built hastily with only a single layer of bricks, unpleasant odors of decay were constantly wafting out, but since there was no specific regulation against that, it was considered unimportant. However, the commissioner noted that \u201cin the event of rain [Girod Street Cemetery] is always flooded to such an extent that it will affect the sanitary precautions necessary to prevent the contracting or spreading of any diseases,\u201d. The commissioner deemed that the Girod Street Cemetery was unsanitary and recommended that it be shut down, but it appears that his recommendation was simply ignored.\n\nBy the early 1940s, the Girod Street Cemetery had run into further problems. It was run by the [[Christ Church Cathedral (New Orleans)|Christ Church Cathedral]],  and since the mid 1930s people had begun to use newer, better kept cemeteries in the local area. Since the cemetery catered specifically to deceased [[Protestants]], who were in a minority locally, it fell into disuse and disrepair.\n\nDuring this time the cemetery was subject to vandalism; tombs were found broken into and completely destroyed, a large fire was found burning atop one tomb, and a citizen reported that it looked more like a [[poultry]] farm, with many chickens randomly wandering the premises. In 1945 the Christ Church Cathedral tried again to help fix up the cemetery by placing notices on all of the tombs for the owners, saying that if they did not repair their property (the decrepit tombs) within 60 days, it would be demolished by the Church. With the cemetery by now a civic [[eyesore]], in June 1948 under the orders of Mayor Morrison, the cemetery was dismantled. He had people start hauling away bricks, disregarding the protests of the Christ Church Cathedral, and alerted citizens that they should retrieve the remains of loved ones. In October 1958 the remaining 96,000 square feet of the cemetery land were sold to the government for almost $300,000.\n\nThe cemetery land was [[deconsecrated]] on January 4, 1957. According to local historian Leonard Huber, between January and March 1957 the human remains were moved elsewhere on a racially segregated basis: the whites to Hope Mausoleum of New Orleans and the African Americans to Providence Memorial Park of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].\n\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]], [[Smoothie King Center]], [[Benson Tower (New Orleans)|Benson Tower]], [[Entergy Tower]], and [[Energy Centre]] were eventually constructed near to, but not on, the cemetery site.  A local [[superstition]] alleges that the notoriously poor record of the [[New Orleans Saints]] football team for many years was somehow supernaturally tied to the ground on which the dome was constructed. However, several reliable historical sources indicate that the Superdome was not in fact built on the site of the former cemetery location, but on the former location of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] [[New Orleans Union Station|engine terminal]] and roundhouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citiesofthedead.net/archives/2007/09/ |title=Girod Street Cemetery |work=Cities of the Dead |date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2009-03-14 |publisher=[[Cities of the Dead]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708204636/http://www.citiesofthedead.net/archives/2007/09/ |archivedate=July 8, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe former Girod Street Cemetery site is the current location of the parking garage for the [[New Orleans Centre]] shopping mall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.nola.com/reneepeck/2007/10/scream_a_little_scream_with_me.html|title=Scream a Little Scream With Me|work=Renne Peck|date=2007-10-27|accessdate=2009-03-14|publisher=[[Times Picayune]]}}</ref> However, overlaying a [[Sanborn Maps|Sanborn map]] over a current aerial image shows that the cemetery's location was directly underneath the New Orleans Centre and the Superdome's [[parking garage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.cox.net/audubon5425/dome.jpg |title=Girod Street Cemetery Map Overlay }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[Champions Square]], an entertainment district of sports [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] and other attractions was built on the site.<ref name=Mor/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nicholas Girod]], for whom the street was named\n*[[Historic Cemeteries of New Orleans]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"up\">\n   New Orleans is near sea level, and tombs are elevated above ground.\n</ref><ref name=\"Zulu\">\n   \"King of Mardi Gras Dies in New Orleans\",\n   ''New York Amsterdam News'', 28 August 1948.\n</ref><ref name=\"JNB\">\n   Huber, Leonard.

With both having worked at other studios since the early 1930s, Hanna and Barbera solidified a partnership that would last for six decades. Their first cartoon together, the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', featuring a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, was released to theaters in 1940 and served as the pilot for the long-running theatrical short subject series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Hanna and Barbera served as directors of the shorts for over 20 years, with Hanna supervising the animation{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=83\u201384}} and Barbera in charge of the stories and pre-production.\n\nHaving been nominated for twelve Oscars, seven of the cartoons won seven [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] between 1943 and 1953, but these were awarded to producer [[Fred Quimby]], who was not involved in the creative development of the shorts.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=207}}{{rp|83\u201384}} The pair also directed new hybrid animated and live-action musical sequences for MGM's feature films ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (notable for its dance sequence featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]), ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'' and ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' and wrote and directed a handful of one-shot cartoons, ''[[Gallopin' Gals]]'', ''[[Officer Pooch]]'', ''[[War Dogs (1943 film)|War Dogs]]'' and ''[[Good Will to Men]]'', a 1955 remake of 1939's ''Peace on Earth''.\n\nWith Quimby's retirement in 1955, Hanna and Barbera became the producers in charge of the MGM animation studio's output,{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=547\u2013548}} supervising the last seven shorts of [[Tex Avery]]'s ''[[Droopy]]'' series and directing and producing a short-lived ''Tom and Jerry'' spin-off series, ''[[Spike and Tyke]]'', which ran for two entries.

[[Harry Cohn]], president and head of Columbia Pictures, took an 18% ownership in Hanna and Barbera's new company, '''H-B Enterprises''',<ref name=\"HannaRuffReddy\" /> and provided working capital. Screen Gems became the new studio's distributor and its licensing agent, handling merchandizing of the characters from the animated programs.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> The duo's cartoon firm officially opened for business in rented offices on the lot of Kling Studios (formerly [[Jim Henson Company Lot#Charlie Chaplin (1919\u20131952)|Charlie Chaplin Studios]]<ref name=\"jbarberainterviewvideo\" />) on July 7, 1957, two months after the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animation studio closed down.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}}\n\nSidney and several Screen Gems alumni became members of the studio's board of directors and much of the former MGM animation staff \u2014 including animators [[Carlo Vinci]], [[Kenneth Muse]], [[Lewis Marshall]], [[Michael Lah]] and [[Ed Barge]] and layout artists [[Ed Benedict]] and Richard Bickenbach \u2014 became the new production staff for the H-B studio.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}} Conductor and composer [[Hoyt Curtin]] was in charge of providing the music while many voice actors came on board, such as [[Daws Butler]], [[Don Messick]], [[Julie Bennett]], [[Mel Blanc]], [[Howard Morris]], [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]], [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] and [[Doug Young (voice actor)|Doug Young]].\n\n===1957\u20131969: Funny animals, sitcom families and more===\n[[File:Hb1957logo.jpg|right|thumb|Hanna-Barbera's first studio logo, used from 1957 to 1960.]]\nH-B Enterprises was the first major animation studio to successfully produce cartoons exclusively for television<ref>{{cite news|title= Caveman to Carp: The Prime-Time Cartoon Devolves|work=The New York Times|date=January 23, 1996|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/23/movies/caveman-to-carp-the-prime-time-cartoon-devolves.html?scp=27&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2009 |first=Jan |last=Benzel}}</ref> and after rebroadcasts of theatrical cartoons as programming, its first TV original ''[[The Ruff and Reddy Show]]'', premiered on [[NBC]] in December 1957.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=123}} ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' came next in 1958 and aired in most markets just before prime time.

''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' and its only theatrical short film series, ''[[Loopy De Loop]]'', would follow that year.\n\n''[[The Flintstones]]'' premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in prime time in 1960, loosely based on the CBS series ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. It was set in a fictionalized stone age of cavemen and dinosaurs. [[Jackie Gleason]] considered suing Hanna-Barbera for [[copyright infringement]], but decided not to because he did not want to be known as \"the man who yanked [[Fred Flintstone]] off the air\". The show ran for six seasons, becoming the longest-running animated show in American prime time at the time (until ''[[The Simpsons (TV series)|The Simpsons]]'' beat it in 1997), a ratings and merchandising success and the top-ranking animated program in syndication history. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, but its reputation eventually improved and it is now considered a classic.\n\n''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'' and ''[[Top Cat]]'' would soon follow in 1961. The three shows ''[[Wally Gator]]'', ''[[Touch\u00e9 Turtle and Dum Dum]]'' and ''[[Lippy the Lion & Hardy Har Har]]'' aired as part of ''[[The Hanna-Barbera New Cartoon Series]]'' then ''[[The Jetsons]]'' debuted in 1962. Several animated TV commercials were produced as well, often starring their own characters (probably the best known is a series of [[Pebbles cereal]] commercials for [[Post Foods|Post]] featuring [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] tricking Fred into giving him his Pebbles cereal) and H-B also produced the opening credits for ''[[Bewitched]]'', in which animated caricatures of Samantha and Darrin appeared.

''A Cast of Friends''. New York: Da Capo Press. 0306-80917-6. Pg. 81\u201383</ref> To keep within these tighter budgets, Hanna-Barbera furthered the concept of [[limited animation]] (also called semi-animation) practiced and popularized by the [[UPA (animation studio)|United Productions of America]] (UPA) studio, which also once had a partnership with Columbia Pictures. Character designs were simplified, and backgrounds and animation cycles (walks, runs, etc.) were regularly re-purposed.\n\nCharacters were often broken up into a handful of levels so that only the parts of the body that needed to be moved at a given time (i.e. a mouth, an arm, a head) would be animated. The rest of the figure would remain on a held animation cel. This allowed a typical 10-minute short to be done with only 1,200 drawings instead of the usual 26,000. Dialogue, music, and sound effects were emphasized over action, leading [[Chuck Jones]]\u2014a contemporary who worked for [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] and whose short ''[[The Dover Boys]]'' practically invented many of the concepts in limited animation\u2014to disparagingly refer to the limited television cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera and others as \"illustrated radio\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Cartoons-THE-GOLDEN-ERA.html|title=The golden era - Cartoons - film, director, music|work=filmreference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a story published by ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1961, critics stated that Hanna-Barbera was taking on more work than it could handle and was resorting to shortcuts only a television audience would tolerate.<ref name=\"SEP\" /> An executive who worked for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] said, \"We don't even consider [them] competition\".<ref name=\"SEP\">(Dec. 2, 1961) \"[http://dawsbutler.com/hb-article-web/hb-article-05.jpg TV'S Most Unexpected Hit \u2013 ''The Flintstones'']\" ''The Saturday Evening Post''</ref> Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman argues that Hanna-Barbera attempted to maximize their [[Net income|bottom line]] by recycling story formulas and characterization instead of introducing new ones. Once a formula for an original series was deemed successful, the studio would keep reusing it in subsequent series.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}} Besides copying their own works, Hanna-Barbera would draw inspiration from the works of other people and studios.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}}\n\nLehman considers that the studio served as a main example of how animation studios which focused on TV animation differed from those that focused on theatrical animation. Theatrical animation studios tried to maintain full and fluid animation, and consequently struggled with the rising expenses associated with producing it.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}} Limited animation as practiced by Hanna-Barbera kept production costs at a minimum. The cost in quality of using this technique was that Hanna-Barbera's characters only moved when absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}}\n\nIts solution to the criticism over its quality was to go into movies. It produced six theatrical feature films, among them are higher-quality versions of its television cartoons (''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' and ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'') and adaptations of other material (''Charlotte's Web'', ''[[Heidi's Song]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]''). It was also one of the first animation studios to have their work produced overseas.

Their first cartoon together, the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', featuring a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, was released to theaters in 1940 and served as the pilot for the long-running theatrical short subject series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Hanna and Barbera served as directors of the shorts for over 20 years, with Hanna supervising the animation{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=83\u201384}} and Barbera in charge of the stories and pre-production.\n\nHaving been nominated for twelve Oscars, seven of the cartoons won seven [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] between 1943 and 1953, but these were awarded to producer [[Fred Quimby]], who was not involved in the creative development of the shorts.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=207}}{{rp|83\u201384}} The pair also directed new hybrid animated and live-action musical sequences for MGM's feature films ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (notable for its dance sequence featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]), ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'' and ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' and wrote and directed a handful of one-shot cartoons, ''[[Gallopin' Gals]]'', ''[[Officer Pooch]]'', ''[[War Dogs (1943 film)|War Dogs]]'' and ''[[Good Will to Men]]'', a 1955 remake of 1939's ''Peace on Earth''.\n\nWith Quimby's retirement in 1955, Hanna and Barbera became the producers in charge of the MGM animation studio's output,{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=547\u2013548}} supervising the last seven shorts of [[Tex Avery]]'s ''[[Droopy]]'' series and directing and producing a short-lived ''Tom and Jerry'' spin-off series, ''[[Spike and Tyke]]'', which ran for two entries.

[[Harry Cohn]], president and head of Columbia Pictures, took an 18% ownership in Hanna and Barbera's new company, '''H-B Enterprises''',<ref name=\"HannaRuffReddy\" /> and provided working capital. Screen Gems became the new studio's distributor and its licensing agent, handling merchandizing of the characters from the animated programs.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> The duo's cartoon firm officially opened for business in rented offices on the lot of Kling Studios (formerly [[Jim Henson Company Lot#Charlie Chaplin (1919\u20131952)|Charlie Chaplin Studios]]<ref name=\"jbarberainterviewvideo\" />) on July 7, 1957, two months after the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animation studio closed down.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}}\n\nSidney and several Screen Gems alumni became members of the studio's board of directors and much of the former MGM animation staff \u2014 including animators [[Carlo Vinci]], [[Kenneth Muse]], [[Lewis Marshall]], [[Michael Lah]] and [[Ed Barge]] and layout artists [[Ed Benedict]] and Richard Bickenbach \u2014 became the new production staff for the H-B studio.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}} Conductor and composer [[Hoyt Curtin]] was in charge of providing the music while many voice actors came on board, such as [[Daws Butler]], [[Don Messick]], [[Julie Bennett]], [[Mel Blanc]], [[Howard Morris]], [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]], [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] and [[Doug Young (voice actor)|Doug Young]].\n\n===1957\u20131969: Funny animals, sitcom families and more===\n[[File:Hb1957logo.jpg|right|thumb|Hanna-Barbera's first studio logo, used from 1957 to 1960.]]\nH-B Enterprises was the first major animation studio to successfully produce cartoons exclusively for television<ref>{{cite news|title= Caveman to Carp: The Prime-Time Cartoon Devolves|work=The New York Times|date=January 23, 1996|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/23/movies/caveman-to-carp-the-prime-time-cartoon-devolves.html?scp=27&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2009 |first=Jan |last=Benzel}}</ref> and after rebroadcasts of theatrical cartoons as programming, its first TV original ''[[The Ruff and Reddy Show]]'', premiered on [[NBC]] in December 1957.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=123}} ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' came next in 1958 and aired in most markets just before prime time.

''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' and its only theatrical short film series, ''[[Loopy De Loop]]'', would follow that year.\n\n''[[The Flintstones]]'' premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in prime time in 1960, loosely based on the CBS series ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. It was set in a fictionalized stone age of cavemen and dinosaurs. [[Jackie Gleason]] considered suing Hanna-Barbera for [[copyright infringement]], but decided not to because he did not want to be known as \"the man who yanked [[Fred Flintstone]] off the air\". The show ran for six seasons, becoming the longest-running animated show in American prime time at the time (until ''[[The Simpsons (TV series)|The Simpsons]]'' beat it in 1997), a ratings and merchandising success and the top-ranking animated program in syndication history. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, but its reputation eventually improved and it is now considered a classic.\n\n''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'' and ''[[Top Cat]]'' would soon follow in 1961. The three shows ''[[Wally Gator]]'', ''[[Touch\u00e9 Turtle and Dum Dum]]'' and ''[[Lippy the Lion & Hardy Har Har]]'' aired as part of ''[[The Hanna-Barbera New Cartoon Series]]'' then ''[[The Jetsons]]'' debuted in 1962. Several animated TV commercials were produced as well, often starring their own characters (probably the best known is a series of [[Pebbles cereal]] commercials for [[Post Foods|Post]] featuring [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] tricking Fred into giving him his Pebbles cereal) and H-B also produced the opening credits for ''[[Bewitched]]'', in which animated caricatures of Samantha and Darrin appeared.

While the budget for MGM's seven-minute ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts was about $35,000, the Hanna-Barbera studios was required to produce five-minute ''Ruff and Reddy'' episodes for no more than $3,000 a piece.<ref name=\"HannaRuffReddy\">Hanna, William and Ito, Tom (1999). ''A Cast of Friends''. New York: Da Capo Press. 0306-80917-6. Pg. 81\u201383</ref> To keep within these tighter budgets, Hanna-Barbera furthered the concept of [[limited animation]] (also called semi-animation) practiced and popularized by the [[UPA (animation studio)|United Productions of America]] (UPA) studio, which also once had a partnership with Columbia Pictures. Character designs were simplified, and backgrounds and animation cycles (walks, runs, etc.) were regularly re-purposed.\n\nCharacters were often broken up into a handful of levels so that only the parts of the body that needed to be moved at a given time (i.e. a mouth, an arm, a head) would be animated. The rest of the figure would remain on a held animation cel. This allowed a typical 10-minute short to be done with only 1,200 drawings instead of the usual 26,000. Dialogue, music, and sound effects were emphasized over action, leading [[Chuck Jones]]\u2014a contemporary who worked for [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] and whose short ''[[The Dover Boys]]'' practically invented many of the concepts in limited animation\u2014to disparagingly refer to the limited television cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera and others as \"illustrated radio\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Cartoons-THE-GOLDEN-ERA.html|title=The golden era - Cartoons - film, director, music|work=filmreference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a story published by ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1961, critics stated that Hanna-Barbera was taking on more work than it could handle and was resorting to shortcuts only a television audience would tolerate.<ref name=\"SEP\" /> An executive who worked for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] said, \"We don't even consider [them] competition\".<ref name=\"SEP\">(Dec. 2, 1961) \"[http://dawsbutler.com/hb-article-web/hb-article-05.jpg TV'S Most Unexpected Hit \u2013 ''The Flintstones'']\" ''The Saturday Evening Post''</ref> Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman argues that Hanna-Barbera attempted to maximize their [[Net income|bottom line]] by recycling story formulas and characterization instead of introducing new ones. Once a formula for an original series was deemed successful, the studio would keep reusing it in subsequent series.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}} Besides copying their own works, Hanna-Barbera would draw inspiration from the works of other people and studios.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}}\n\nLehman considers that the studio served as a main example of how animation studios which focused on TV animation differed from those that focused on theatrical animation. Theatrical animation studios tried to maintain full and fluid animation, and consequently struggled with the rising expenses associated with producing it.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}} Limited animation as practiced by Hanna-Barbera kept production costs at a minimum. The cost in quality of using this technique was that Hanna-Barbera's characters only moved when absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}}\n\nIts solution to the criticism over its quality was to go into movies. It produced six theatrical feature films, among them are higher-quality versions of its television cartoons (''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' and ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'') and adaptations of other material (''Charlotte's Web'', ''[[Heidi's Song]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]''). It was also one of the first animation studios to have their work produced overseas.

{"title_page": "Law enforcement in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Major component of the US criminal justice system}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Law enforcement in the United States}}\n{{Criminal law}}\n\n'''Law enforcement in the United States''' is one of three major components of the [[criminal justice]] system of the United States, along with [[List of courts of the United States|courts]] and [[corrections]]. Although each component operates semi-independently, the three collectively form a chain leading from an investigation of suspected criminal activity to the administration of criminal punishment.\n\nLaw enforcement operates primarily through governmental [[police]] agencies. There are 17,985 U.S. police agencies in the United States which include City Police Departments, [[Sheriffs in the United States|County Sheriff's Offices]], [[State police (United States)|State Police/Highway Patrol]] and [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|Federal Law Enforcement Agencies]]. The law-enforcement purposes of these agencies are the investigation of suspected criminal activity, referral of the results of investigations to state or federal [[Prosecutor (United States)|prosecutors]], and the temporary detention of suspected criminals pending judicial action. Law enforcement agencies, to varying degrees at different levels of government and in different agencies, are also commonly charged with the responsibilities of deterring criminal activity and preventing the successful commission of crimes in progress. Other duties may include the service and enforcement of [[warrant (law)|warrants]], [[writ]]s, and other orders of the courts.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are also involved in providing first response to emergencies and other threats to [[Public security|public safety]]; the protection of certain public facilities and [[infrastructure]]; the maintenance of public order; the protection of public officials; and the operation of some detention facilities (usually at the local level).\n\n==Types of police==\n[[Police|Policing]] in the United States is conducted by \"around to 18,000 federal, state, local and city departments, all with their own rules\".<ref name=\"world today debusmann\">{{cite news|last1=Debusmann|first1=Bernd|title=The race problem in black and white|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/race-problem-black-and-white|access-date=October 4, 2016|work=[[The World Today (magazine)|The World Today]]|publisher=[[Chatham House]]|date=October\u2013November 2016}}</ref> Every state has its own nomenclature for agencies, and their powers, responsibilities and funding vary from state to state.<ref name=\"world today debusmann\" />\n\n===Federal===\n{{main|Federal law enforcement in the United States}}\n{{see also|Law enforcement agency#Federal responsibilities}}\n[[File:US Park Police at 2005 presidential inaugural.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Park Police|U.S. Park Police]] officers standing by during the 2005 [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]]]]\n[[File:CBP female officers going aboard a ship.jpg|thumb|upright|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers board a ship.]]\n\nAt the federal level, there exists both federal police, who possess full federal authority as given to them under [[United States Code]] (U.S.C.), and federal law enforcement agencies, who are authorized to enforce various laws at the federal level. Both police and law enforcement agencies operate at the highest level and are endowed with police roles; each may maintain a small component of the other (for example, the [[FBI Police]]). The agencies have jurisdiction in all states, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions for enforcement of federal law. Most federal agencies are limited by the U.S. Code to investigating only matters that are explicitly within the power of the federal government. However, federal investigative powers have become very broad in practice, especially since the passage of the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]]. There are also federal law enforcement agencies, such as the [[United States Park Police]], that are granted state arrest authority off primary federal jurisdiction.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) is responsible for most law enforcement duties at the federal level.<ref name=\"langeluttig-p92\">{{cite book|title=The Department of Justice of the United States|author=Langeluttig, Albert|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|year=1927|pages=9\u201314}}</ref> It includes the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF), the [[United States Marshals Service]], the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP), and others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.justice.gov/agencies/alphabetical-listing-components-programs-initiatives|title=Alphabetical Listing of Components, Programs, & Initiatives|date=June 7, 2017|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) is another branch with numerous federal law enforcement agencies reporting to it. [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[United States Secret Service]] (USSS), [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), and the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) are some of the agencies that report to DHS.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components|title=Operational and Support Components|date=June 18, 2015|work=Department of Homeland Security|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en}}</ref> The United States Coast Guard is assigned to the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the event of war.\n\nAt a crime or disaster scene affecting large numbers of people, multiple jurisdictions, or broad geographic areas, many police agencies may be involved by [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] agreements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emilms.fema.gov/IS703A/RES0102130text.htm|title=Mutual Aid Agreements and Assistance Agreements|website=emilms.fema.gov|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|United States Federal Protective Service]] responded to the [[Hurricane Katrina]] natural disaster. The command in such situations remains a complex and flexible issue.\n\nIn accordance with the [[Federation|federal]] structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], the national (federal) government is not authorized to execute general police powers by the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution of the United States of America]]. The power to have a police force is given to each of the United States' 50 [[federated state]]s. The US Constitution gives the federal government the power to deal with foreign affairs and interstate affairs (affairs between the states). For police, this means that if a non-federal crime is committed in a US state and the [[fugitive]] does not flee the state, the federal government has no jurisdiction. However, once the fugitive crosses a state line, he violates the federal law of interstate flight and is subject to federal jurisdiction, at which time federal law enforcement agencies may become involved.\n\n===State===\n{{Main|State police (United States)|l1=State police}}\n[[File:Trooper 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Massachusetts State Police Troopers]]\nMost [[U.S. state|states]] operate statewide [[Government agency|government agencies]] that provide law enforcement duties, including [[Criminal procedure|investigation]]s and state patrols. They may be called [[state police]] or [[highway patrol]], and are normally part of the state [[Department of Public Safety]]. In addition, the [[State attorney general|Attorney General]]'s office of each state has its own [[state bureau of investigation]] such as in [[California]] with the [[California Department of Justice]]. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] fulfill this role in [[Texas]] although they were founded in the period before Texas became a state.\n\nVarious departments of state governments may have their own enforcement divisions, such as [[capitol police]], [[campus police]], [[Psychiatric hospital|state hospitals]], [[Corrections|Departments of Correction]], [[water police]], environmental (fish and game/wildlife) [[Conservation officer|game wardens]] or conservation officers (with full police powers and statewide jurisdiction). In [[Colorado]], for instance, the [[Colorado Department of Revenue|Department of Revenue]] has its own investigative branch, as do many of the state-funded universities.\n\n===County===\nAlso known as [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]] and [[Borough (United States)|boroughs]], [[County (United States)|county]] law enforcement is provided by [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs' departments or offices]] and [[County police#United States|county police]].\n\n====County police====\n{{Main|County police#United States}}\n[[County police#United States|County police]] tend to exist only in metropolitan counties and have countywide jurisdiction. For places that have both county police and county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], responsibilities are given to each: The county police are in charge of typical police duties such as patrol and investigations,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mypspa.org/article/more/interfacing-with-law-enforcement|title=Interfacing with Law Enforcement|website=mypspa.org|language=en|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref> whereas the sheriffs' department in this situation takes care of serving papers and providing security to the courts. County police tend to fall into three broad categories, full service, limited service, and restrictive service.<ref name=\":2\" /> Full service provides full police services to the entire county. Limited service provides to the unincorporated and special districts. Restricted service provide security to the county-owned parts of the county.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Sheriffs' offices====\n{{Main|Sheriffs in the United States}}[[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriffs]] are not police and have many different responsibilities. Sheriffs are elected officials where the head of police is appointed or hired in. Sheriffs are responsible for all three parts of the criminal justice system. They uphold the county jail, ensure safety within the courts, and have jurisdiction to enforce laws in the entire county.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Sheriffs \u2013 The other police|last=Kawucha|first=Soraya|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=10\u201317}}</ref> They have more responsibilities such as transporting prisoners, running crime labs, and collecting taxes.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n*In Texas, the sheriff's office is normally the agency responsible for handling mental health calls. If the situation is dangerous, a sheriff's deputy has the power to take a person to a hospital on a mental health commitment immediately. However, if the situation is not actively dangerous, a warrant must be sought. With the rise in mental health units across the state, the [[Police crisis intervention team#Texas|Texas CIT Association]] was formed.\n\n==== Commonwealth of Virginia ====\nThe [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] does not have overlapping county and city jurisdictions, whereas in the other 49 states most municipalities fall within (and share jurisdiction and many other governmental responsibilities with) one (or more) County(ies). In Virginia, governmental power flows down from the state (or in Virginia's case, commonwealth) directly to either a county or an independent city. Thus, policing in Virginia is more streamlined: the county sheriff's office/department or county police department does not overlap with an independent city police department. Unincorporated townships remain part of their parent county but may have town police departments to augment their county law enforcement. Town police departments are often small and may deploy a combination of paid and nonpaid, full and part-time law enforcement officers, including auxiliary officers who typically serve as part-time, unpaid volunteers. If present, independent city sheriff's offices usually follow the restrictive model shown above for sheriff's departments, with limited law enforcement authority including warrant service, jail bailiff, etc. Mutual assistance compacts may exist where neighboring law enforcement agencies will assist each other, however, in addition to state (commonwealth) law enforcement resources. Like most states, Virginia also has campus police officers. Under Virginia State Code 23.1-809 and 23.1-810, public and private colleges and universities can maintain their own armed police force and employ sworn campus police officers. These sworn officers have the same authority as local police and are required to complete police academy training mandated by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services. Virginia campus police officers have jurisdiction on and immediately around the campus, but police departments may petition to the local circuit court for concurrent jurisdiction with the local police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/nova/countytowncity.html|title=Virginia County vs. Town vs. City|website=Virginia Places.Org|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/standardsTraining/compulsoryMinimumTraining/5-7-13AUXILIARYPOLICEANDPARTTIMELAWENFORCEMENTOFFICER.pdf|title=Auxiliary Police and Part Time Law Enforcement Officer Training Standards|website=Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services|publisher=DCJS VA|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Municipal===\n[[Image:Ford Crown Victoria 1.JPG|thumb|A [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] of the [[New York City Police Department]]]]\n{{See|Category:Municipal police departments of the United States}}\n\n[[Municipal police]] range from one-officer agencies (sometimes still called the town [[marshal]]) to the 40,000 person-strong [[New York City Police Department]]. Most municipal agencies take the form (Municipality Name) Police Department. Most [[municipality|municipalities]] have their own police departments.\n\nMetropolitan departments, such as the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]], have jurisdiction covering multiple communities and municipalities, often over a wide area typically share geographical boundaries within one or more cities or counties. Metropolitan departments have usually been formed by a merger between local agencies, typically several local police departments and often the local sheriff's department or office, in efforts to provide greater efficiency by centralizing command and resources and to resolve jurisdictional problems, often in communities experiencing rapid population growth and [[urban sprawl]], or in neighboring communities too small to afford individual police departments. Some county sheriff's departments, such as the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], are contracted to provide full police services to local cities within their counties.\n\n===Other===\n{{See|:Category: Specialist police departments of the United States}}\nThere are other types of specialist police departments with varying jurisdictions. Most of these serve [[Special district (United States)|special-purpose districts]] and are known as special district police. In some states, they serve as little more than [[security police]], but in states such as [[California]], special district forces are composed of fully sworn police officers with statewide authority.\n\nThese agencies can be [[transit police]], school district police, [[campus police]], [[airport police]], [[Railroad police#United States|railroad police]], [[park police]] or police departments responsible for protecting government property, such as the former [[Los Angeles General Services Police]]. Some agencies, such as the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department]], have multi-state powers. There are also some [[Private police in the United States|Private Police]] agencies, such as the [[Parkchester, Bronx|Parkchester Department of Public Safety]] and [[Co-op City Department of Public Safety]].\n\n===Puerto Rico Police===\n{{Main|Puerto Rico Police}}\nThe [[Puerto Rico Police]] traces back to 1837, when Spanish governor Francisco Javier de Moreda y Prieto created La Guardia Civil de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Civil Guard) to protect the lives and property of Puerto Ricans who at the time were Spanish subjects, and provide police services to the entire island, even though many municipalities maintained their own police force. The United States invaded and took possession of Puerto Rico in July 1898 as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and has controlled the island as a US territory since then. The Insular Police of Puerto Rico was created on February 21, 1899, under the command of Col. Frank Thacher ([[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] officer during the Spanish\u2013American War), with an authorized strength of 313 sworn officers. As of 2009, the PRPD had over 17,292 officers.\n\n==Police functions==\n[[File:Florida Highway Patrol in action.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Florida Highway Patrol]] state trooper at the scene of a [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle accident]]]]\n[[File:FBI Evidence Response Team.jpg|thumb|right|[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Evidence Response Team]]\nTextbooks and scholars have identified three primary police agency functions. The following is cited from ''The American System of Criminal Justice'', by George F. Cole and Christopher E. Smith, 2004, 10th edition, Wadsworth/Thomson Learning:\n\n* Order maintenance\n::This is the broad mandate to keep the peace or otherwise prevent behaviors which might disturb others. This can deal with things ranging from a barking dog to a fist-fight. By way of description, Cole and Smith note that police are usually called-on to \"handle\" these situations with discretion, rather than deal with them as strict violations of law, though of course their authority to deal with these situations are based in violations of law.\n* Law enforcement\n::Those powers are typically used only in cases where the law has been violated and a suspect must be identified and apprehended. Most obvious instances include [[robbery]], [[murder]], or [[burglary]]. This is the popular notion of the main police function, but the frequency of such activity is dependent on geography and season.\n* Service\n::Services may include rendering [[first aid]], providing tourist information, guiding the disoriented, or acting as educators (on topics such as preventing [[Substance abuse|drug use]]). Cole and Smith cited one study which showed 80% of all calls for police assistance did not involve crimes, but this may not be the case in all parts of the country. Because police agencies are traditionally available year-round, 24 hours a day, citizens call upon police departments not only in times of trouble but also when just inconvenienced. As a result, police services may include roadside auto assistance, providing referrals to other agencies, finding lost pets or property, or checking locks on vacationers' homes.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PCLEV001-009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grover Cleveland]] was Sheriff of Erie County New York in 1871\u20131872]]\n[[File:Tr - nyc police commissioner 1894 - jacob riis bio - the making of an american - illustration named one was sitting asleep on a buttertub crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] as Police Commissioner of New York City with [[Jacob Riis]] 1894]]\n\nEarly policing in American history was based on the [[Hue and cry|ancient English common law system]] which relied heavily on citizen volunteers, watch groups, and a [[conscription]] system known as ''[[posse comitatus]]'' similar to the [[Militia (United States)|militia system]], which continued until the mid-nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Archbold |first=Carol A. |date=2013 |title=Policing |url=http://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/50819_ch_1.pdf  |location= |publisher=Sage Publication |isbn=9781412993692 }}</ref>\n\n===Police reform===\n{{Main|Police reform in the United States}}\nThere have been many initiatives to reform policing, notably since the 1960s, under President [[Lyndon B.

Some of the more controversial policies restrict, or even forbid, high-speed vehicular pursuits. Researchers Falcone, Wells, & Weisheit describe a historical separation of police models between small towns and larger cities. The distinction has also been defined between rural and urban policing models, which tended to function differently with separate hierarchical systems supporting each.<ref>Falcone, David N., Edward L. Wells, and Ralph A. Weisheit. \"The Small-Town Police Department.\" Policing 25.2 (2002): 371-85. ProQuest Criminal Justice Periodicals Index. Web. September 25, 2014.</ref>\n\nThree styles of policing develop from a jurisdiction's [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] characteristics, government organization, and choice of police administrators. According to a study by [[James Q. Wilson]] (\"Varieties of Police Behavior\", 1968, 1978, Harvard University Press), there were three distinct types of policing developed in his study of eight communities. Each style emphasized different police functions and was linked to specific characteristics of the community the department served. \n\n*Watchman\n\n::Emphasizes maintaining order, usually found in communities with a declining industrial base, and a blue-collar, mixed ethnic/racial population. This form of policing is implicitly less pro-active than other styles, and certain offenses may be \"overlooked\" on a variety of social, legal, and cultural grounds as long as public order is maintained. Cole and Smith comment the broad discretion exercised in this style of policing can result in charges of discrimination when it appears police treatment of different groups results in the perception that some groups get better treatment than others;\n*Legalistic\n::Emphasizes law enforcement and professionalism. This is usually found in reform-minded cities, with mixed socioeconomic composition. Officers are expected to generate a large number of arrests and citations and act as if there were a single community standard for conduct, rather than different standards for different groups. However, the fact that certain groups are more likely to have law enforcement contact means this strict enforcement of laws may seem overly harsh on certain groups;\n*Service\n::Emphasizes the service functions of police work, usually found in suburban, middle-class communities where residents demand individual treatment. Police in homogeneous communities can view their work as protecting their citizens against \"outsiders\", with frequent but often-informal interventions against community members. The uniform make-up of the community means crimes are usually more obvious, and therefore less frequent, leaving police free to deal with service functions and traffic control.\n\nWilson's study applies to police behavior for the entire department over time. At any given time, police officers may be acting in a watchman, service, or legalistic function by the nature of what they are doing at the time, their temperament, or their mood at the time. Individual officers may also be inclined to one style or another, regardless of the supervisor or citizen demands.\n\nCommunity-oriented policing is a shift in policing practices in the U.S. that moved away from standardization and towards a more preventative model where police actively partner with the community it serves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Batten|first1=Ed.

Federal, state, and local laws, and individual law enforcement departmental policies govern when, where, how, and upon whom a law enforcement officer may perform a \"pat down,\" \"protective search,\" or \"Terry frisk,\" based on several U.S. Supreme Court decisions (including [[Terry v.

The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is ''whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terry v.

There were also planned attacks against police stemming directly from the force that was being used by the police, against the protesters. President Lyndon Johnson created the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance in 1965. From that, much was done on the federal and local level, such as enhanced training for police personnel. Police officers at that time were often made up of ex-military members that had little training and were left to learn their skills during their job experiences. Law enforcement personnel were also responsible to attend college as a result.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Police Brutality, Misconduct, and Corruption|last=Albrecht|first=James|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=9\u201314}}</ref>\n* 1965: The [[Watts riots|Watts Riots]] of 1965 lasted six days and began following the arrest of Marquette Frye by a white [[California Highway Patrol]] officer on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. 34 people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured.

The officers were charged with assault and using excessive force, with all officers acquitted of the assault, and three of the four officers acquitted of using excessive use of force, during the initial trial. This led to the citywide [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], during which 63 people were killed and 2,373 were injured; it ended only after the [[California Army National Guard]], the [[United States Army]], and the [[United States Marine Corps]] provided reinforcements to re-establish control.<ref name=\":02\" />\n* 2006: In 2006, [[Shooting of Sean Bell|Sean Bell]] was fatally shot on the night before his wedding.

Recruiting in most departments is competitive, with more suitable and desirable candidates accepted over lesser ones, and failure to meet some minimum standards disqualifying a candidate entirely.

Many are required to be armed off-duty and often required to have a concealable off-duty handgun. Among the most common sidearms are models produced by [[Glock]], [[Smith & Wesson]], [[SIG Sauer]], [[Beretta]], and [[Heckler & Koch]], usually in [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]], [[.40 S&W]], [[.357 SIG]] (US Secret Service and other Federal Law Enforcement agencies) or [[.45 ACP]].\n\nUntil the late 1980s and early 1990s, most US police officers carried [[revolver]]s, typically in [[.38 Special]] or [[.357 Magnum]] calibers, as their primary duty weapons. At the time, [[Smith & Wesson]], [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]], [[Sturm, Ruger & Co.|Ruger]] and some [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]] models were popular with police officers, most popular being the Smith & Wesson or Colt revolvers. Since then, most agencies have switched to [[semi-automatic pistol|semiautomatic pistols]]. Two key events influencing many US police forces to upgrade their primary duty weapons to weapons with greater [[stopping power]] and round capacity were the 1980 [[Norco shootout]] and the 1986 [[1986 FBI Miami shootout|FBI Miami shootout]].\n\nSome police departments allow qualified officers to carry [[shotgun]]s and/or [[Semi-automatic rifle|semiautomatic rifles]] in their vehicles for additional firepower, typically to be used if a suspect is involved in an [[active shooter]] situation, or a [[hostage]]/barricade incident.\n\n===Less lethal weapons===\n[[File:21' ASP Baton.jpg|thumb|250px|ASP 21\u2033 tactical baton in collapsed and expanded states.]]\n\nPolice also often carry an [[Club (weapon)|impact weapon]]\u2014a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]], also known as a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been replaced in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock Expandable Baton or [[ASP, Inc.|ASP baton]]. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while still wearing the baton on their duty belt. The side handle nightstick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use [[Non-lethal weapon|less-lethal weapons]] such as [[Mace (spray)|mace]], [[pepper spray]], and [[Bean bag round|beanbag]] shotgun rounds.\n\nAnother less lethal weapon that police officers often carry is an [[Electroshock weapon|electroshock guns]], also known as a [[taser]]. The handheld electroshock weapon was designed to incapacitate a single person from a distance by using electric current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles. Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in Drive Stun mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons.\n\n===Specialized weapons===\n{{Further|SWAT}}\nMost large police departments have elite [[SWAT]] units which are called in to handle situations such as barricaded suspects, hostage situations and high-risk warrant service that require greater force, specialized equipment, and special tactics. These units usually have [[submachine gun]]s, automatic [[carbine]]s or [[rifle]]s, semiautomatic [[combat shotgun]]s, [[sniper rifle]]s, gas, smoke, and flashbang [[grenade]]s, and other specialized weapons and equipment at their disposal. Some departments are equipped with [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored vehicles]].\n\n===Body armor===\n{{Further|Body armor}}\nUniformed police officers often wear [[body armor]], typically in the form of a lightweight Level IIA, II or IIIA vest that can be worn under service shirts. SWAT teams typically wear heavier Level III or IV tactical armored vests, often with steel or ceramic trauma plates, comparable to those worn by U.S. military personnel engaged in ground operations. Officers trained in [[bomb disposal]] wear specialized heavy protective armor designed to protect them from the effects of an explosion when working around live ordnance. Local [[Police foundation|police foundations]] have initiated programs to provide law enforcement agencies with higher level vests that provide greater protection and vests for police [[Police dog|K-9]]<nowiki/>s as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstonpolicefoundation.org/body-armor|title=Houston Police Foundation - Houston Police Department Body Armor |publisher=houstonpolicefoundation.org |access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexandriapolicefoundation.org/Recent-News.htm&blogarticle=czekaj-armor|title=Body Armor {{!}} Recent News|publisher=alexandriapolicefoundation.org|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Body-worn camera ===\n{{Further|Body worn video (police equipment)}}\nMultiple states have pending body-worn camera legislation that requires its law enforcement to be equipped with body-worn cameras when the officers are on duty.

Corporations are currently working on body-worn camera models that will resolve the technology's limitations such as better audio capturing technology and battery life, to name a few.\n\n=== Drones===\nIn recent years police have recruited unmanned surveillance devices such as small throwable robotics and flying drones to conduct reconnaissance in dangerous locations. These devices can be used to identify the presence of a hostage, locate and/or identify subjects, and reveal the layout of a room.

American police cars are also increasingly equipped with [[Mobile data terminal|mobile data terminals]] (MDTs) or portable computers linked by radio to a network allowing them access to state [[Department of Motor Vehicles|department of motor vehicles]] information, criminal records, and other important information.\n\nMost police communications are now conducted within a regional pool of area telecommunicators or dispatchers using 9-1-1 and 9-1-1 telephone taxation. A large number of police agencies have pooled their 9-1-1 tax resources for Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD) to streamline dispatching and reporting. CAD systems are usually linked to MDTs (see above).\n\n===National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System===\nA variety of national, regional, state, and local information systems are available to law enforcement agencies in the U.S., with different purposes and types of information. One example is the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlets.org/about/who-we-are|title=Who We Are - Nlets|publisher=nlets.org |access-date=November 13, 2016}}</ref> an interstate justice and public safety network owned by the states supporting inquiry into state systems for criminal history, driver's license and motor vehicle registration, as well as supporting inquiry into federal systems, such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 's [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) Law Enforcement Support Center, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) National Drug Pointer Index (NDPIX), and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) Aircraft Registry and the Government of Canada's [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] (CPIC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/tribal/national-crime-information-systems|title=National Crime Information Systems {{!}} TRIBAL |publisher=Department of Justice|access-date=November 13, 2016|date=November 24, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nNLETS operates primarily through a secure private network through which each state has an interface to the network that all agencies within the state operate through.

The primary operational site for the network is housed in [[Arizona]], with a secure backup site located in the East Central U.S.\n\nThrough the NLETS network, law enforcement and criminal justice agencies can access a wide range of information, from standard driver license and vehicle queries to criminal history and [[Interpol]] information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlets.org/about/what-we-do|title=What We Do - Nlets|website=nlets.org|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref> Operations consist of nearly 1.5 billion transactions a year to over one million PC, mobile, and handheld devices in the U.S. and Canada at 45,000 user agencies, and to 1.3 million individual users.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination===\nPolice departments share arrest information with third-party news organizations that archive names of citizens and legal allegations in a \"police blotter\".

Although each component operates semi-independently, the three collectively form a chain leading from an investigation of suspected criminal activity to the administration of criminal punishment.\n\nLaw enforcement operates primarily through governmental [[police]] agencies. There are 17,985 U.S. police agencies in the United States which include City Police Departments, [[Sheriffs in the United States|County Sheriff's Offices]], [[State police (United States)|State Police/Highway Patrol]] and [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|Federal Law Enforcement Agencies]]. The law-enforcement purposes of these agencies are the investigation of suspected criminal activity, referral of the results of investigations to state or federal [[Prosecutor (United States)|prosecutors]], and the temporary detention of suspected criminals pending judicial action. Law enforcement agencies, to varying degrees at different levels of government and in different agencies, are also commonly charged with the responsibilities of deterring criminal activity and preventing the successful commission of crimes in progress. Other duties may include the service and enforcement of [[warrant (law)|warrants]], [[writ]]s, and other orders of the courts.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are also involved in providing first response to emergencies and other threats to [[Public security|public safety]]; the protection of certain public facilities and [[infrastructure]]; the maintenance of public order; the protection of public officials; and the operation of some detention facilities (usually at the local level).\n\n==Types of police==\n[[Police|Policing]] in the United States is conducted by \"around to 18,000 federal, state, local and city departments, all with their own rules\".<ref name=\"world today debusmann\">{{cite news|last1=Debusmann|first1=Bernd|title=The race problem in black and white|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/race-problem-black-and-white|access-date=October 4, 2016|work=[[The World Today (magazine)|The World Today]]|publisher=[[Chatham House]]|date=October\u2013November 2016}}</ref> Every state has its own nomenclature for agencies, and their powers, responsibilities and funding vary from state to state.<ref name=\"world today debusmann\" />\n\n===Federal===\n{{main|Federal law enforcement in the United States}}\n{{see also|Law enforcement agency#Federal responsibilities}}\n[[File:US Park Police at 2005 presidential inaugural.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Park Police|U.S. Park Police]] officers standing by during the 2005 [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]]]]\n[[File:CBP female officers going aboard a ship.jpg|thumb|upright|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers board a ship.]]\n\nAt the federal level, there exists both federal police, who possess full federal authority as given to them under [[United States Code]] (U.S.C.), and federal law enforcement agencies, who are authorized to enforce various laws at the federal level. Both police and law enforcement agencies operate at the highest level and are endowed with police roles; each may maintain a small component of the other (for example, the [[FBI Police]]). The agencies have jurisdiction in all states, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions for enforcement of federal law. Most federal agencies are limited by the U.S. Code to investigating only matters that are explicitly within the power of the federal government. However, federal investigative powers have become very broad in practice, especially since the passage of the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]]. There are also federal law enforcement agencies, such as the [[United States Park Police]], that are granted state arrest authority off primary federal jurisdiction.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) is responsible for most law enforcement duties at the federal level.<ref name=\"langeluttig-p92\">{{cite book|title=The Department of Justice of the United States|author=Langeluttig, Albert|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|year=1927|pages=9\u201314}}</ref> It includes the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF), the [[United States Marshals Service]], the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP), and others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.justice.gov/agencies/alphabetical-listing-components-programs-initiatives|title=Alphabetical Listing of Components, Programs, & Initiatives|date=June 7, 2017|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) is another branch with numerous federal law enforcement agencies reporting to it. [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[United States Secret Service]] (USSS), [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), and the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) are some of the agencies that report to DHS.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components|title=Operational and Support Components|date=June 18, 2015|work=Department of Homeland Security|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en}}</ref> The United States Coast Guard is assigned to the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the event of war.\n\nAt a crime or disaster scene affecting large numbers of people, multiple jurisdictions, or broad geographic areas, many police agencies may be involved by [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] agreements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emilms.fema.gov/IS703A/RES0102130text.htm|title=Mutual Aid Agreements and Assistance Agreements|website=emilms.fema.gov|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|United States Federal Protective Service]] responded to the [[Hurricane Katrina]] natural disaster. The command in such situations remains a complex and flexible issue.\n\nIn accordance with the [[Federation|federal]] structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], the national (federal) government is not authorized to execute general police powers by the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution of the United States of America]]. The power to have a police force is given to each of the United States' 50 [[federated state]]s. The US Constitution gives the federal government the power to deal with foreign affairs and interstate affairs (affairs between the states). For police, this means that if a non-federal crime is committed in a US state and the [[fugitive]] does not flee the state, the federal government has no jurisdiction. However, once the fugitive crosses a state line, he violates the federal law of interstate flight and is subject to federal jurisdiction, at which time federal law enforcement agencies may become involved.\n\n===State===\n{{Main|State police (United States)|l1=State police}}\n[[File:Trooper 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Massachusetts State Police Troopers]]\nMost [[U.S. state|states]] operate statewide [[Government agency|government agencies]] that provide law enforcement duties, including [[Criminal procedure|investigation]]s and state patrols. They may be called [[state police]] or [[highway patrol]], and are normally part of the state [[Department of Public Safety]]. In addition, the [[State attorney general|Attorney General]]'s office of each state has its own [[state bureau of investigation]] such as in [[California]] with the [[California Department of Justice]]. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] fulfill this role in [[Texas]] although they were founded in the period before Texas became a state.\n\nVarious departments of state governments may have their own enforcement divisions, such as [[capitol police]], [[campus police]], [[Psychiatric hospital|state hospitals]], [[Corrections|Departments of Correction]], [[water police]], environmental (fish and game/wildlife) [[Conservation officer|game wardens]] or conservation officers (with full police powers and statewide jurisdiction). In [[Colorado]], for instance, the [[Colorado Department of Revenue|Department of Revenue]] has its own investigative branch, as do many of the state-funded universities.\n\n===County===\nAlso known as [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]] and [[Borough (United States)|boroughs]], [[County (United States)|county]] law enforcement is provided by [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs' departments or offices]] and [[County police#United States|county police]].\n\n====County police====\n{{Main|County police#United States}}\n[[County police#United States|County police]] tend to exist only in metropolitan counties and have countywide jurisdiction. For places that have both county police and county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], responsibilities are given to each: The county police are in charge of typical police duties such as patrol and investigations,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mypspa.org/article/more/interfacing-with-law-enforcement|title=Interfacing with Law Enforcement|website=mypspa.org|language=en|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref> whereas the sheriffs' department in this situation takes care of serving papers and providing security to the courts. County police tend to fall into three broad categories, full service, limited service, and restrictive service.<ref name=\":2\" /> Full service provides full police services to the entire county. Limited service provides to the unincorporated and special districts. Restricted service provide security to the county-owned parts of the county.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Sheriffs' offices====\n{{Main|Sheriffs in the United States}}[[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriffs]] are not police and have many different responsibilities. Sheriffs are elected officials where the head of police is appointed or hired in. Sheriffs are responsible for all three parts of the criminal justice system. They uphold the county jail, ensure safety within the courts, and have jurisdiction to enforce laws in the entire county.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Sheriffs \u2013 The other police|last=Kawucha|first=Soraya|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=10\u201317}}</ref> They have more responsibilities such as transporting prisoners, running crime labs, and collecting taxes.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n*In Texas, the sheriff's office is normally the agency responsible for handling mental health calls. If the situation is dangerous, a sheriff's deputy has the power to take a person to a hospital on a mental health commitment immediately. However, if the situation is not actively dangerous, a warrant must be sought. With the rise in mental health units across the state, the [[Police crisis intervention team#Texas|Texas CIT Association]] was formed.\n\n==== Commonwealth of Virginia ====\nThe [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] does not have overlapping county and city jurisdictions, whereas in the other 49 states most municipalities fall within (and share jurisdiction and many other governmental responsibilities with) one (or more) County(ies). In Virginia, governmental power flows down from the state (or in Virginia's case, commonwealth) directly to either a county or an independent city. Thus, policing in Virginia is more streamlined: the county sheriff's office/department or county police department does not overlap with an independent city police department. Unincorporated townships remain part of their parent county but may have town police departments to augment their county law enforcement. Town police departments are often small and may deploy a combination of paid and nonpaid, full and part-time law enforcement officers, including auxiliary officers who typically serve as part-time, unpaid volunteers. If present, independent city sheriff's offices usually follow the restrictive model shown above for sheriff's departments, with limited law enforcement authority including warrant service, jail bailiff, etc. Mutual assistance compacts may exist where neighboring law enforcement agencies will assist each other, however, in addition to state (commonwealth) law enforcement resources. Like most states, Virginia also has campus police officers. Under Virginia State Code 23.1-809 and 23.1-810, public and private colleges and universities can maintain their own armed police force and employ sworn campus police officers. These sworn officers have the same authority as local police and are required to complete police academy training mandated by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services. Virginia campus police officers have jurisdiction on and immediately around the campus, but police departments may petition to the local circuit court for concurrent jurisdiction with the local police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/nova/countytowncity.html|title=Virginia County vs. Town vs. City|website=Virginia Places.Org|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/standardsTraining/compulsoryMinimumTraining/5-7-13AUXILIARYPOLICEANDPARTTIMELAWENFORCEMENTOFFICER.pdf|title=Auxiliary Police and Part Time Law Enforcement Officer Training Standards|website=Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services|publisher=DCJS VA|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Municipal===\n[[Image:Ford Crown Victoria 1.JPG|thumb|A [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] of the [[New York City Police Department]]]]\n{{See|Category:Municipal police departments of the United States}}\n\n[[Municipal police]] range from one-officer agencies (sometimes still called the town [[marshal]]) to the 40,000 person-strong [[New York City Police Department]]. Most municipal agencies take the form (Municipality Name) Police Department. Most [[municipality|municipalities]] have their own police departments.\n\nMetropolitan departments, such as the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]], have jurisdiction covering multiple communities and municipalities, often over a wide area typically share geographical boundaries within one or more cities or counties. Metropolitan departments have usually been formed by a merger between local agencies, typically several local police departments and often the local sheriff's department or office, in efforts to provide greater efficiency by centralizing command and resources and to resolve jurisdictional problems, often in communities experiencing rapid population growth and [[urban sprawl]], or in neighboring communities too small to afford individual police departments. Some county sheriff's departments, such as the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], are contracted to provide full police services to local cities within their counties.\n\n===Other===\n{{See|:Category: Specialist police departments of the United States}}\nThere are other types of specialist police departments with varying jurisdictions. Most of these serve [[Special district (United States)|special-purpose districts]] and are known as special district police. In some states, they serve as little more than [[security police]], but in states such as [[California]], special district forces are composed of fully sworn police officers with statewide authority.\n\nThese agencies can be [[transit police]], school district police, [[campus police]], [[airport police]], [[Railroad police#United States|railroad police]], [[park police]] or police departments responsible for protecting government property, such as the former [[Los Angeles General Services Police]]. Some agencies, such as the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department]], have multi-state powers. There are also some [[Private police in the United States|Private Police]] agencies, such as the [[Parkchester, Bronx|Parkchester Department of Public Safety]] and [[Co-op City Department of Public Safety]].\n\n===Puerto Rico Police===\n{{Main|Puerto Rico Police}}\nThe [[Puerto Rico Police]] traces back to 1837, when Spanish governor Francisco Javier de Moreda y Prieto created La Guardia Civil de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Civil Guard) to protect the lives and property of Puerto Ricans who at the time were Spanish subjects, and provide police services to the entire island, even though many municipalities maintained their own police force. The United States invaded and took possession of Puerto Rico in July 1898 as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and has controlled the island as a US territory since then. The Insular Police of Puerto Rico was created on February 21, 1899, under the command of Col. Frank Thacher ([[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] officer during the Spanish\u2013American War), with an authorized strength of 313 sworn officers. As of 2009, the PRPD had over 17,292 officers.\n\n==Police functions==\n[[File:Florida Highway Patrol in action.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Florida Highway Patrol]] state trooper at the scene of a [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle accident]]]]\n[[File:FBI Evidence Response Team.jpg|thumb|right|[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Evidence Response Team]]\nTextbooks and scholars have identified three primary police agency functions. The following is cited from ''The American System of Criminal Justice'', by George F. Cole and Christopher E. Smith, 2004, 10th edition, Wadsworth/Thomson Learning:\n\n* Order maintenance\n::This is the broad mandate to keep the peace or otherwise prevent behaviors which might disturb others. This can deal with things ranging from a barking dog to a fist-fight. By way of description, Cole and Smith note that police are usually called-on to \"handle\" these situations with discretion, rather than deal with them as strict violations of law, though of course their authority to deal with these situations are based in violations of law.\n* Law enforcement\n::Those powers are typically used only in cases where the law has been violated and a suspect must be identified and apprehended. Most obvious instances include [[robbery]], [[murder]], or [[burglary]]. This is the popular notion of the main police function, but the frequency of such activity is dependent on geography and season.\n* Service\n::Services may include rendering [[first aid]], providing tourist information, guiding the disoriented, or acting as educators (on topics such as preventing [[Substance abuse|drug use]]). Cole and Smith cited one study which showed 80% of all calls for police assistance did not involve crimes, but this may not be the case in all parts of the country. Because police agencies are traditionally available year-round, 24 hours a day, citizens call upon police departments not only in times of trouble but also when just inconvenienced. As a result, police services may include roadside auto assistance, providing referrals to other agencies, finding lost pets or property, or checking locks on vacationers' homes.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PCLEV001-009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grover Cleveland]] was Sheriff of Erie County New York in 1871\u20131872]]\n[[File:Tr - nyc police commissioner 1894 - jacob riis bio - the making of an american - illustration named one was sitting asleep on a buttertub crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] as Police Commissioner of New York City with [[Jacob Riis]] 1894]]\n\nEarly policing in American history was based on the [[Hue and cry|ancient English common law system]] which relied heavily on citizen volunteers, watch groups, and a [[conscription]] system known as ''[[posse comitatus]]'' similar to the [[Militia (United States)|militia system]], which continued until the mid-nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Archbold |first=Carol A. |date=2013 |title=Policing |url=http://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/50819_ch_1.pdf  |location= |publisher=Sage Publication |isbn=9781412993692 }}</ref>\n\n===Police reform===\n{{Main|Police reform in the United States}}\nThere have been many initiatives to reform policing, notably since the 1960s, under President [[Lyndon B.

Some of the more controversial policies restrict, or even forbid, high-speed vehicular pursuits. Researchers Falcone, Wells, & Weisheit describe a historical separation of police models between small towns and larger cities. The distinction has also been defined between rural and urban policing models, which tended to function differently with separate hierarchical systems supporting each.<ref>Falcone, David N., Edward L. Wells, and Ralph A. Weisheit. \"The Small-Town Police Department.\" Policing 25.2 (2002): 371-85. ProQuest Criminal Justice Periodicals Index. Web. September 25, 2014.</ref>\n\nThree styles of policing develop from a jurisdiction's [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] characteristics, government organization, and choice of police administrators. According to a study by [[James Q. Wilson]] (\"Varieties of Police Behavior\", 1968, 1978, Harvard University Press), there were three distinct types of policing developed in his study of eight communities. Each style emphasized different police functions and was linked to specific characteristics of the community the department served. \n\n*Watchman\n\n::Emphasizes maintaining order, usually found in communities with a declining industrial base, and a blue-collar, mixed ethnic/racial population. This form of policing is implicitly less pro-active than other styles, and certain offenses may be \"overlooked\" on a variety of social, legal, and cultural grounds as long as public order is maintained. Cole and Smith comment the broad discretion exercised in this style of policing can result in charges of discrimination when it appears police treatment of different groups results in the perception that some groups get better treatment than others;\n*Legalistic\n::Emphasizes law enforcement and professionalism. This is usually found in reform-minded cities, with mixed socioeconomic composition. Officers are expected to generate a large number of arrests and citations and act as if there were a single community standard for conduct, rather than different standards for different groups. However, the fact that certain groups are more likely to have law enforcement contact means this strict enforcement of laws may seem overly harsh on certain groups;\n*Service\n::Emphasizes the service functions of police work, usually found in suburban, middle-class communities where residents demand individual treatment. Police in homogeneous communities can view their work as protecting their citizens against \"outsiders\", with frequent but often-informal interventions against community members. The uniform make-up of the community means crimes are usually more obvious, and therefore less frequent, leaving police free to deal with service functions and traffic control.\n\nWilson's study applies to police behavior for the entire department over time. At any given time, police officers may be acting in a watchman, service, or legalistic function by the nature of what they are doing at the time, their temperament, or their mood at the time. Individual officers may also be inclined to one style or another, regardless of the supervisor or citizen demands.\n\nCommunity-oriented policing is a shift in policing practices in the U.S. that moved away from standardization and towards a more preventative model where police actively partner with the community it serves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Batten|first1=Ed.

The property-owner need not be convicted of that crime; if officers find drugs in a house, they can take cash from the house and possibly the house itself. Commentators have said these rules provide an incentive for law enforcement officers to focus on drug-related crimes rather than crimes against persons, such as rape and homicide. They also provide an incentive to arrest suspected drug-dealers inside their houses, which can be seized, and to raid stash houses after most of their drugs have been sold, when officers can seize the cash.<ref name=Economist1>{{cite news|title=Cops or soldiers?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21599349-americas-police-have-become-too-militarised-cops-or-soldiers|accessdate=June 8, 2014|work=The Economist|date=March 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Civil Asset Forfeiture|url=https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/civil-asset-forfeiture|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=December 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n===Deadly force===\n{{Main|Police use of deadly force in the United States|List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States}}\n\nIn most states, law enforcement officers operate under the same self-defense laws as the civilians of these states.

Many are required to be armed off-duty and often required to have a concealable off-duty handgun. Among the most common sidearms are models produced by [[Glock]], [[Smith & Wesson]], [[SIG Sauer]], [[Beretta]], and [[Heckler & Koch]], usually in [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]], [[.40 S&W]], [[.357 SIG]] (US Secret Service and other Federal Law Enforcement agencies) or [[.45 ACP]].\n\nUntil the late 1980s and early 1990s, most US police officers carried [[revolver]]s, typically in [[.38 Special]] or [[.357 Magnum]] calibers, as their primary duty weapons. At the time, [[Smith & Wesson]], [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]], [[Sturm, Ruger & Co.|Ruger]] and some [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]] models were popular with police officers, most popular being the Smith & Wesson or Colt revolvers. Since then, most agencies have switched to [[semi-automatic pistol|semiautomatic pistols]]. Two key events influencing many US police forces to upgrade their primary duty weapons to weapons with greater [[stopping power]] and round capacity were the 1980 [[Norco shootout]] and the 1986 [[1986 FBI Miami shootout|FBI Miami shootout]].\n\nSome police departments allow qualified officers to carry [[shotgun]]s and/or [[Semi-automatic rifle|semiautomatic rifles]] in their vehicles for additional firepower, typically to be used if a suspect is involved in an [[active shooter]] situation, or a [[hostage]]/barricade incident.\n\n===Less lethal weapons===\n[[File:21' ASP Baton.jpg|thumb|250px|ASP 21\u2033 tactical baton in collapsed and expanded states.]]\n\nPolice also often carry an [[Club (weapon)|impact weapon]]\u2014a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]], also known as a nightstick. The common nightstick and the side handle baton have been replaced in many locations by expandable batons such as the Monadnock Auto-Lock Expandable Baton or [[ASP, Inc.|ASP baton]]. One advantage of the collapsible baton is that the wearer can comfortably sit in a patrol vehicle while still wearing the baton on their duty belt. The side handle nightstick usually has to be removed before entering the vehicle. Many departments also use [[Non-lethal weapon|less-lethal weapons]] such as [[Mace (spray)|mace]], [[pepper spray]], and [[Bean bag round|beanbag]] shotgun rounds.\n\nAnother less lethal weapon that police officers often carry is an [[Electroshock weapon|electroshock guns]], also known as a [[taser]]. The handheld electroshock weapon was designed to incapacitate a single person from a distance by using electric current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles. Someone struck by a Taser experiences stimulation of his or her sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions. Tasers do not rely only on pain compliance, except when used in Drive Stun mode, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons.\n\n===Specialized weapons===\n{{Further|SWAT}}\nMost large police departments have elite [[SWAT]] units which are called in to handle situations such as barricaded suspects, hostage situations and high-risk warrant service that require greater force, specialized equipment, and special tactics. These units usually have [[submachine gun]]s, automatic [[carbine]]s or [[rifle]]s, semiautomatic [[combat shotgun]]s, [[sniper rifle]]s, gas, smoke, and flashbang [[grenade]]s, and other specialized weapons and equipment at their disposal. Some departments are equipped with [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored vehicles]].\n\n===Body armor===\n{{Further|Body armor}}\nUniformed police officers often wear [[body armor]], typically in the form of a lightweight Level IIA, II or IIIA vest that can be worn under service shirts. SWAT teams typically wear heavier Level III or IV tactical armored vests, often with steel or ceramic trauma plates, comparable to those worn by U.S. military personnel engaged in ground operations. Officers trained in [[bomb disposal]] wear specialized heavy protective armor designed to protect them from the effects of an explosion when working around live ordnance. Local [[Police foundation|police foundations]] have initiated programs to provide law enforcement agencies with higher level vests that provide greater protection and vests for police [[Police dog|K-9]]<nowiki/>s as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstonpolicefoundation.org/body-armor|title=Houston Police Foundation - Houston Police Department Body Armor |publisher=houstonpolicefoundation.org |access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexandriapolicefoundation.org/Recent-News.htm&blogarticle=czekaj-armor|title=Body Armor {{!}} Recent News|publisher=alexandriapolicefoundation.org|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Body-worn camera ===\n{{Further|Body worn video (police equipment)}}\nMultiple states have pending body-worn camera legislation that requires its law enforcement to be equipped with body-worn cameras when the officers are on duty.

American police cars are also increasingly equipped with [[Mobile data terminal|mobile data terminals]] (MDTs) or portable computers linked by radio to a network allowing them access to state [[Department of Motor Vehicles|department of motor vehicles]] information, criminal records, and other important information.\n\nMost police communications are now conducted within a regional pool of area telecommunicators or dispatchers using 9-1-1 and 9-1-1 telephone taxation. A large number of police agencies have pooled their 9-1-1 tax resources for Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD) to streamline dispatching and reporting. CAD systems are usually linked to MDTs (see above).\n\n===National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System===\nA variety of national, regional, state, and local information systems are available to law enforcement agencies in the U.S., with different purposes and types of information. One example is the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlets.org/about/who-we-are|title=Who We Are - Nlets|publisher=nlets.org |access-date=November 13, 2016}}</ref> an interstate justice and public safety network owned by the states supporting inquiry into state systems for criminal history, driver's license and motor vehicle registration, as well as supporting inquiry into federal systems, such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 's [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) Law Enforcement Support Center, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) National Drug Pointer Index (NDPIX), and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) Aircraft Registry and the Government of Canada's [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] (CPIC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/tribal/national-crime-information-systems|title=National Crime Information Systems {{!}} TRIBAL |publisher=Department of Justice|access-date=November 13, 2016|date=November 24, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nNLETS operates primarily through a secure private network through which each state has an interface to the network that all agencies within the state operate through.
