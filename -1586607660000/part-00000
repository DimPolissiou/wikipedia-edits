The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's latest start on record, with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020. As of 11 April, a total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since 2016\u201317. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

Blake would later make landfall in  northwestern [[Australia]] and soon degenerate afterwards. At the same time, Claudia, another tropical cyclone, formed. It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating west of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]]. The third one intensified into Cyclone Damien. In late February, 2 new tropical lows formed, and were named Esther and Ferdinand. Esther didn't strengthen much, but Ferdinand went on to become a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, equivalent to a Category 2 Atlantic hurricane.\n\n== Systems ==\n=== Tropical Cyclone Blake ===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=Aus\n|Image=Blake 2020-01-06 0537Z.jpg\n|Track=Blake 2020 track.png\n|Formed=4 January\n|Dissipated=11 January\n|10-min winds=40\n|1-min winds=50\n|Pressure=986\n}}\n\nDuring 4 January, the BOM reported that Tropical Low 02U had started to develop within a monsoon trough, about 750 km (465 mi) north-northwest of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/forecasts/nwcyclone.shtml|title=Western Region Tropical Cyclone Outlook|last=|first=|date=4 January 2020|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104062353/http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/forecasts/nwcyclone.shtml|archive-date=4 January 2020|access-date=4 January 2020}}</ref> Citing considerable rotation extending into the mid [[troposphere]], well-established dual-channel [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] and warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, the JTWC assessed the system as having a moderate chance of attaining tropical cyclone intensity within the following 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/abioweb.txt|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Indian Ocean (91S)|last=|first=|date=4 January 2020|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104063202/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/abioweb.txt|archive-date=4 January 2020|access-date=4 January 2020}}</ref> The system gradually gathered strength in the favourable environment as it tracked slowly towards the south-southwest,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|title=Tropical Low 02U Forecast Track Map #4 (00Z)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105004641/http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> leading the JTWC to issue a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|tropical cyclone formation alert]] at 03:30 UTC the following day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh9120web.txt|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (06S)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105065010/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh9120web.txt|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> The BOM indicated that sustained [[Beaufort scale|gale-force]] winds had developed on the western side of the tropical low at 15:00 UTC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|title=Tropical Low 02U Forecast Track Map #8 (15Z)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105160308/http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDW60281.shtml|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> and the system was designated as Tropical Cyclone 06S by the JTWC a few hours later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh0620web.txt|title=Tropical Cyclone 06S Warning #1 (18Z)|last=|first=|date=5 January 2020|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105215539/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/sh0620web.txt|archive-date=5 January 2020|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Gales fully encircled the system by 00:00 UTC on 6 January, prompting the BOM to upgrade the low to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Australian scale]], the first of the season.

'''2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season''' is the currently active period of the year when most [[tropical cyclones]] form in the southern [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans between [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]] and [[160th meridian east|160\u00b0E]]. The season officially began on 1 November 2019 and will end on 30 April 2020; however, a tropical cyclone could form at any time between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 and would count towards the season total. The season featured the region's latest start on record, with the formation of the first tropical low only occurring on 4 January 2020. As of 11 April, a total of seven tropical cyclones have existed within the region, which represents the region's least active season by this date since 2016\u201317. Three systems have intensified further into severe tropical cyclones, and three systems have made landfall within the region at tropical cyclone intensity. A total of 28 fatalities have been caused, either directly or indirectly, as a result of impacts from the season's systems.\n\nDuring the season, tropical cyclones will be officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM), the [[Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency]] (BMKG), and the National Weather Service of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[United States]]' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), and other national agencies such as the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), the [[MetService|Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] (MetService), and [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France#Worldwide|M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] at [[R\u00e9union|La R\u00e9union]], will also monitor parts of the basin during the season. \n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n! colspan=2|Source/Record\n!

Blake would later make landfall in  northwestern [[Australia]] and soon degenerate afterwards. At the same time, Claudia, another tropical cyclone, formed. It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating west of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]].

Proton itself is designed for integration into the [[Steam (service)|Steam]] client as \"Steam Play\", allowing for seamless operation of Windows games and software within Steam, but it can be used as a standalone application.\n\n== Overview ==\nProton was initially released on 21 August 2018.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dawe |first1=Liam  |title= Valve officially confirm a new version of 'Steam Play' which includes a modified version of Wine|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine.12400 |website=GamingOnLinux}}</ref> Upon release, Valve announced a whitelist of 27 games that were tested and certified to perform like their native Windows counterparts without requiring end-user tweaking.

Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) by Prince Vardges Manouk who rebuilt the settlement near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of King [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC). However, in his first book, ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] refers to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after King Valash (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift of the medial ''l'' into a ''gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by King Vagharsh I to become known as ''Norakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later ''Vagharshapat''.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe territory of ancient Vagharshapat was inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC. Many sites, such as [[Metsamor Castle]], Shresh hill and Mokhrablur hill date back to the [[neolithic]] period. The first written records about Vagharshapat were found in the inscriptions left by the [[Urartu|Urartian]] king [[Rusa II]] (685\u2013645 BC), where it was mentioned as ''Kuarlini'' (\u053f\u0578\u0582\u0561\u0580\u056c\u056b\u0576\u056b). The inscription found in the archaeological site of ancient Vagharshapat cites to a water canal opened by king Rusa II, between Ildaruni river ([[Hrazdan River]]) and the valley of Kuarlini.\n\nAccording to 5th-century writer [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the oldest name of Vagharshapat was ''Artimed'' (\u0531\u0580\u057f\u056b\u0574\u0567\u0564), derived from the [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek]] deity [[Artemis]]. Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) after being rebuilt by prince ''Vardges Manouk'' near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of king [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC).\n\nUnder the reign of king [[Tigranes the Great]] (95\u201345 BC), the town was partly inhabited by Jewish captives.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st century AD, under the reign of the Armenian [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] king [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vagharsh I]] of Armenia (117\u2013144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed ''Vagharshapat'' (\u054e\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0580\u0577\u0561\u057a\u0561\u057f). In his first book ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] has cited to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after king ''Valash'' (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial ''L'' into a ''Gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the Town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by king Vagharsh I to become known as ''Noarakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later Vagharshapat.\n[[File:Zvartnots3.jpg|thumb|The remains of the 7th-century [[Zvartnots Cathedral|Cathedral of Zvartnots]]]]\nVagharshapat has served as the capital of the Arsacid [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] between 120 AD and 330 AD. After embracing Christianity as a state religion in Armenia in 301, Vagharshapat was gradually called ''Ejmiatsin'' ({{lang-hy|\u0537\u057b\u0574\u056b\u0561\u056e\u056b\u0576}}), after the name of the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral|Mother Cathedral]]; the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate, which is considered as one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. As a spiritual centre of the entire Armenian nation, Vagharshapat has grown up rapidly and developed as an important centre of education and culture. The city was home to one of the oldest educational institutions in Armenia founded by [[Mesrop Mashtots]].\n\nThe political capital of the Armenian kingdom was transferred to the city of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 336.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Grigory Gagarin. Escarmouche de Persans et de Kurdes.jpg|thumb|Kurds and Persians attacking Vagharshapat]]\nVagharshapat maintained its status as the country's most important city until the fall of the Arsacid Kingdom in 428. The city has gradually lost its importance under the Persian rule, specifically when the seat of the Catholicosate was transferred to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 452. However, the first manuscript library in Armenia was founded in 480 in Vagharshapat.\n\nThe Armenian Church rejected the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) because they believed the Chalcedonian [[christology]] was too similar to [[Nestorianism]]; however, some Armenian bishops who were present in the territories of [[Roman Armenia]] signed the Council's documents and also accepted [[Pope Leo I]]'s 458 [[encyclical]] mandating adherence to the [[Chalcedonian Definition]]. In [[Persarmenia]], the [[Church of the East|Persian Nestorian Church]] supported the spread of Nestorianism, which the Armenian Church had previously declared heretical and saw as a threat to the independence of their Church. [[Peter the Iberian]], a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] prince, also strongly opposed the Chalcedonian Creed.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Wydawnictwo UJ| isbn = 978-83-233-9555-3| last = Stopka| first = Krzysztof| title = Armenia Christiana: Armenian Religious Identity and the Churches of Constantinople and Rome (4th\u201315th Century)| date = 16 December 2016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeq-DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|pages=62-}}</ref> Thus, in 491, Catholicos [[Babken I of Armenia]], along with the [[Caucasian Albania|Albanian]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian]] bishops met in Vagharshapat and issued a condemnation of the Chalcedonian Definition.<ref>''Zvartnots and the Origins of Christian Architecture in Armenia'', W.

The city was briefly revived between the 9th and 11th centuries under the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratid]] [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Kingdom of Armenia]], before being overrun by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in 1045 and later by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] in 1064.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, Vagharshapat became part of the [[Ilkhanate]] of the [[Mongol Empire]]. During the last quarter of the 14th century the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] Sunni [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkic]] tribe took over Armenia, including Vagharshapat.\n\nIn 1400, when [[Timur]] invaded Armenia and Georgia many districts including Vagharshapat were depopulated under the rule of the [[Timurid Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/atmi4.htm |title=The Turco-Mongol Invasions |publisher=Rbedrosian.com |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>{{self published inline|date=November 2018}} In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe.

In 930, the church was ruined by an earthquake and remained buried until it was rediscovered in the early 20th century by architect [[Toros Toramanian]].

In 1780, Catholicos [[Simeon I of Yerevan]] founded the [[Etchmiadzin Paper Factory]] which served for 6 years.\n\nUnder the Soviet rule, the town was turned into an important industrial centre. It was home to 4 major industrial firms specialized in the production of military technology. However, the productivity of the plants declined after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nCurrently, the industry of the town is mainly based on food-processing. The largest industrial firms of the town are the Ejmiatsin Instrument Making Factory founded in 1966, the E.P.G. Ejmiatsin Cannery founded in 1969, the Ejmiatsin Kat dairy factory founded in 1997, the Sonimol plant for grains founded in 2001, the Ejmiatsin wine brandy and vodka factory founded in 2005, and the Ekologia V.K.H. biological waste destruction plant founded in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hetq.am/arm/news/38076/bzhshkakan-taponneri-vnasazertsman-gortsaran-ejmiatsnum.html|title=\u0532\u056a\u0577\u056f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0569\u0561\u0583\u0578\u0576\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u057e\u0576\u0561\u057d\u0561\u0566\u0565\u0580\u056e\u0574\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0580\u056e\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576 \u0537\u057b\u0574\u056b\u0561\u056e\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574 - \u0540\u0565\u057f\u0584 - \u053c\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0565\u0580, \u0570\u0578\u0564\u057e\u0561\u056e\u0576\u0565\u0580, \u0570\u0565\u057f\u0561\u0584\u0576\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0576\u0565\u0580}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Center of Vagharshapat.jpg|thumb|Center of Vagharshapat]]\n\n===Tourism===\nBeing the spiritual centre of the Armenian nation worldwide, Vagharshapat is a major tourist destination for Armenians as well as foreign visitors.

Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) by Prince Vardges Manouk who rebuilt the settlement near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of King [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC). However, in his first book, ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] refers to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after King Valash (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift of the medial ''l'' into a ''gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by King Vagharsh I to become known as ''Norakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later ''Vagharshapat''.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe territory of ancient Vagharshapat was inhabited since the 3rd millennium BC. Many sites, such as [[Metsamor Castle]], Shresh hill and Mokhrablur hill date back to the [[neolithic]] period. The first written records about Vagharshapat were found in the inscriptions left by the [[Urartu|Urartian]] king [[Rusa II]] (685\u2013645 BC), where it was mentioned as ''Kuarlini'' (\u053f\u0578\u0582\u0561\u0580\u056c\u056b\u0576\u056b). The inscription found in the archaeological site of ancient Vagharshapat cites to a water canal opened by king Rusa II, between Ildaruni river ([[Hrazdan River]]) and the valley of Kuarlini.\n\nAccording to 5th-century writer [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the oldest name of Vagharshapat was ''Artimed'' (\u0531\u0580\u057f\u056b\u0574\u0567\u0564), derived from the [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek]] deity [[Artemis]]. Later, it was renamed ''Avan Vardgesi'' (\u0531\u0582\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u056b, \"Town of Vardges\") or ''Vardgesavan'' (\u054e\u0561\u0580\u0564\u0563\u0567\u057d\u0561\u0582\u0561\u0576) after being rebuilt by prince ''Vardges Manouk'' near the shores of [[Kasagh River]], during the reign of king [[Orontes I Sakavakyats]] of Armenia (570\u2013560 BC).\n\nUnder the reign of king [[Tigranes the Great]] (95\u201345 BC), the town was partly inhabited by Jewish captives.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st century AD, under the reign of the Armenian [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] king [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vagharsh I]] of Armenia (117\u2013144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed ''Vagharshapat'' (\u054e\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0580\u0577\u0561\u057a\u0561\u057f). In his first book ''Wars of Justinian'', the Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] has cited to the city as ''Valashabad'' (Balashabad), named after king ''Valash'' (Balash) of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial ''L'' into a ''Gh'', which is common in the Armenian language. [[Movses Khorenatsi]] mentioned that the Town of Vardges was entirely rebuilt and fenced by king Vagharsh I to become known as ''Noarakaghak'' (\u0546\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0584\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0584, \"New City\") and later Vagharshapat.\n[[File:Zvartnots3.jpg|thumb|The remains of the 7th-century [[Zvartnots Cathedral|Cathedral of Zvartnots]]]]\nVagharshapat has served as the capital of the Arsacid [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] between 120 AD and 330 AD. After embracing Christianity as a state religion in Armenia in 301, Vagharshapat was gradually called ''Ejmiatsin'' ({{lang-hy|\u0537\u057b\u0574\u056b\u0561\u056e\u056b\u0576}}), after the name of the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral|Mother Cathedral]]; the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate, which is considered as one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. As a spiritual centre of the entire Armenian nation, Vagharshapat has grown up rapidly and developed as an important centre of education and culture. The city was home to one of the oldest educational institutions in Armenia founded by [[Mesrop Mashtots]].\n\nThe political capital of the Armenian kingdom was transferred to the city of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 336.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Grigory Gagarin. Escarmouche de Persans et de Kurdes.jpg|thumb|Kurds and Persians attacking Vagharshapat]]\nVagharshapat maintained its status as the country's most important city until the fall of the Arsacid Kingdom in 428. The city has gradually lost its importance under the Persian rule, specifically when the seat of the Catholicosate was transferred to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 452. However, the first manuscript library in Armenia was founded in 480 in Vagharshapat.\n\nThe Armenian Church rejected the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) because they believed the Chalcedonian [[christology]] was too similar to [[Nestorianism]]; however, some Armenian bishops who were present in the territories of [[Roman Armenia]] signed the Council's documents and also accepted [[Pope Leo I]]'s 458 [[encyclical]] mandating adherence to the [[Chalcedonian Definition]]. In [[Persarmenia]], the [[Church of the East|Persian Nestorian Church]] supported the spread of Nestorianism, which the Armenian Church had previously declared heretical and saw as a threat to the independence of their Church. [[Peter the Iberian]], a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] prince, also strongly opposed the Chalcedonian Creed.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Wydawnictwo UJ| isbn = 978-83-233-9555-3| last = Stopka| first = Krzysztof| title = Armenia Christiana: Armenian Religious Identity and the Churches of Constantinople and Rome (4th\u201315th Century)| date = 16 December 2016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeq-DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|pages=62-}}</ref> Thus, in 491, Catholicos [[Babken I of Armenia]], along with the [[Caucasian Albania|Albanian]] and [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian]] bishops met in Vagharshapat and issued a condemnation of the Chalcedonian Definition.<ref>''Zvartnots and the Origins of Christian Architecture in Armenia'', W.

The construction work was funded by the Armenian philanthropist Gagik Galstyan.\n\n====[[Saint Hripsime Church]]====\nBuilt in 618, the Church of Saint Hripsim\u00e9 has basically survived almost unchanged. It is considered one of the oldest surviving churches in Armenia, known for its fine architecture of the classical period, which influenced many other Armenian churches. It was erected in 618 by Catholicos [[Komitas Aghtsetsi|Gomidas]] atop the original mausoleum, built by Catholicos [[Sahak the Great]] in 395, which contained the remains of the martyred Saint [[Hripsime|Hripsim\u00e9]]. According to the 17th century Armenian historian [[Arakel of Tabriz]], the church was renovated during 1651\u20131653 by Catholicos [[Philip I of Armenia|Philip I]]. Repairs were made on the roof, top of the dome, the walls and bases. A cross was placed on top of the roof, and a small portico was added to the western side. It is one of the few churches in Armenian that remained active during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period.\n\n====[[Saint Gayane Church]]====\nBuilt in 630 by Catholicos [[Ezra I of Armenia|Ezra I]], Saint Gayane Church is distinguished by its harmonious proportions. It is a three-[[nave]] domed [[basilica]] with an octagonal [[tholobate|drum]] resting on four internal pillars that divide the interior of the church into three. Its design remained unchanged despite partial renovations of the dome and some ceilings in 1652.\n\n====[[Shoghakat Church]]==== \nMeaning ''drop of light'', Shoghakat Church is a single-nave domed basilica, built and completed in 1694 by prince Aghamal Sorotetsi during the period of Catholicos [[Nahabed I of Armenia|Nahabed I]].

Zvartnots was a majestic cathedral famous for its unique design, dedicated to [[Saint George]], built at the place where a meeting between king [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] and Saint [[Gregory the Illuminator]] was supposed to have taken place. In 930, the church was ruined by an earthquake and remained buried until it was rediscovered in the early 20th century by architect [[Toros Toramanian]]. The site was excavated between 1900 and 1907, uncovering the foundations of the cathedral as well as the remains of the Pontifical palace and a winery.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\">\nFile:Ejmiadzin Cathedral.jpg|Etchmiadzin Cathedral, opened in 303\nFile:S.
