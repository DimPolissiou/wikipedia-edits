The second major wave of cases was clustered around accidental exposure among patients, visitors, and staff within the [[North York General Hospital]].

The results found that the SARS coronavirus could be isolated from [[masked palm civet]]s (''Paguma'' sp.), even if the animals did not show clinical signs of the virus. The preliminary conclusion was the SARS virus crossed the [[xenographic]] barrier from [[asian palm civet]] to humans, and more than 10,000 masked palm civets were killed in Guangdong Province. The virus was also later found in [[raccoon dog]]s (''Nyctereuteus'' sp.), [[ferret badger]]s (''Melogale'' spp.), and domestic cats. In 2005, two studies identified a number of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese [[bat]]s.<ref name=\"PMID 16195424\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118391 |pmid=16195424 |title=Bats Are Natural Reservoirs of SARS-Like Coronaviruses |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=676\u20139 |year=2005 |last1=Li |first1=W |last2=Shi |first2=Zhengli |last3=Yu |first3=Meng |last4=Ren |first4=Wuze |last5=Smith |first5=Craig |last6=Epstein |first6=Jonathan H |last7=Wang |first7=Hanzhong |last8=Crameri |first8=Gary |last9=Hu |first9=Zhihong |last10=Zhang |first10=Huajun |last11=Zhang |first11=Jianhong |last12=McEachern |first12=Jennifer |last13=Field |first13=Hume |last14=Daszak |first14=Peter |last15=Eaton |first15=Bryan T |last16=Zhang |first16=Shuyi |last17=Wang |first17=Lin-Fa |bibcode=2005Sci...310..676L |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f270438ddc983d3b61976fb24e7833e7cadd1ad8 }}</ref><ref name=\"PMID 16169905\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0506735102 |pmid=16169905 |pmc=1236580 |title=Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=39 |pages=14040\u20135 |year=2005 |last1=Lau |first1=S.

The bats did not show any visible signs of disease but are the likely natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses. In late 2006, scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of [[Hong Kong University]] and the Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and Prevention established a genetic link between the SARS coronavirus appearing in civets and humans, bearing out claims that the disease had jumped across species.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-11/23/content_740511.htm |title=Scientists prove SARS-civet cat link |work=China Daily |date=23 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, \"after years of searching across China, where the disease first emerged, researchers reported ... that they had found a remote cave in Yunnan province, which is home to horseshoe bats that carry a strain of a particular virus known as a coronavirus.

A large [[squall line]] formed and tracked through the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|mid-Atlantic]] on April 13, prompting more [[tornado warning]]s and [[Tornado watch|watches]]. Fifteen total watches were produced during the course of the event, two of which were designated [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]]s.\n\nThroughout the nearly two-day outbreak 132&nbsp;tornadoes touched down across 10&nbsp;states, inflicting widespread and locally catastrophic damage. Fourteen of these tornadoes reached EF3 or EF4 intensity. The strongest of these occurred in southern Mississippi, producing estimated winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and reaching a width of {{convert|2.25|mi|km|abbr=on}}; eight people were killed by this tornado. Inclusive of wind damage and flooding, 38&nbsp;people died during the event making it the deadliest outbreak since [[Tornado outbreak of March 2\u20133, 2012|March 2\u20133, 2012]]. To assist with recovery efforts, governors of five states declared a [[state of emergency]].

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted. Near Tynes Ainsworth Road, a mobile home was tossed and completely destroyed; both occupants died.

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted. Near Tynes Ainsworth Road, a mobile home was tossed and completely destroyed; both occupants died.
