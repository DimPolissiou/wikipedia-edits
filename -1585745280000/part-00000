He began his musical career as a drummer for a local church. Flavour is popularly known across Africa and the world for his hit song \"[[Nwa Baby]] (Ashawo Remix)\". He is currently signed to 2nite Entertainment.\n\nIn 2005, he released his [[self-titled]] debut album ''[[N'abania]]''. In 2010, Flavour released his second studio album ''[[Uplifted]]''. It was supported by the singles \"[[Nwa Baby]] (Ashawo Remix)\", \"[[Adamma]]\", and \"[[Oyi (song)|Oyi Remix]]\". The album's success made Flavour one of Africa's most sought out artists. Flavour was booked to perform at numerous concerts and social events following ''Uplifted'''s release.\n\n==Early life==\n\nFlavour, who is well known for his ability to sing fluently in the [[Igbo language]], was born in [[Enugu State]], Nigeria. His family is originally from [[Umunze]] in [[Orumba South]] LGA, [[Anambra State]], Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.flavournabania.com|title= Flavour N'abania's Official Website}}</ref> Flavour began his music career at the age of 13 when he started playing the drums for his [[church choir]] in [[Enugu]]. The resident pastor at his church introduced him to a friend, Chris I.

After learning to play drums professionally, Flavour received an offer to perform at City Centre, Enugu. The massive crowd at City Centre inspired him to gain new grounds and reach great heights. Flavour's educational background in music enabled him to learn music production from [[Dekumzy]], Isi Charles and Nnachie.<ref name=GreatLakesMix>{{cite web|title=Flavour|url=http://www.greatlakesmix.com/artist.php?p=Flavour&bio=1|publisher=GreatLakesMix|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2005: ''N'abania''===\nIn 2005, Flavour released his debut album ''[[N'abania]]'' through Obaino Music. The album's success was relative and limited to Eastern Nigeria, particularly [[Enugu State]]. Flavour collaborated with [[Mr Raw]] on the album's lead single titled \"N'abania\". The song was recorded at Kingsley Ogoro's music studio in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n===2010: ''Uplifted''===\nFollowing the relative success of his debut album, Flavour released ''[[Uplifted]]'' in 2010. While working on the album, Flavour believed the album would surpass his previous works. Flavour's projection came true when the album broke national barriers. Lolhiphop Records, an established record label in South Africa, released the album after popular demand. The album's top singles include \"[[Nwa Baby]] (Ashawo Remix)\", \"Adamma\", and \"[[Oyi (song)|Oyi Remix]]\" featuring [[Tiwa Savage]].\n\n===2012: ''Blessed''===\n''[[Blessed (Flavour N'abania album)|Blessed]]'' was released on 18 October 2012 through 2nite Entertainment and iROCKING LTD. The album is the successor to ''Uplifted''. It is arguably Flavour's biggest album to date due to the number of producers that worked on it.

He began his musical career as a drummer for a local church. Flavour is popularly known across Africa and the world for his hit song \"[[Nwa Baby]] (Ashawo Remix)\". He is currently signed to 2nite Entertainment.\n\nIn 2005, he released his [[self-titled]] debut album ''[[N'abania]]''. In 2010, Flavour released his second studio album ''[[Uplifted]]''. It was supported by the singles \"[[Nwa Baby]] (Ashawo Remix)\", \"[[Adamma]]\", and \"[[Oyi (song)|Oyi Remix]]\". The album's success made Flavour one of Africa's most sought out artists. Flavour was booked to perform at numerous concerts and social events following ''Uplifted'''s release.\n\n==Early life==\n\nFlavour, who is well known for his ability to sing fluently in the [[Igbo language]], was born in [[Enugu State]], Nigeria. His family is originally from [[Umunze]] in [[Orumba South]] LGA, [[Anambra State]], Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.flavournabania.com|title= Flavour N'abania's Official Website}}</ref> Flavour began his music career at the age of 13 when he started playing the drums for his [[church choir]] in [[Enugu]].

After learning to play drums professionally, Flavour received an offer to perform at City Centre, Enugu. The massive crowd at City Centre inspired him to gain new grounds and reach great heights.

The album's success was relative and limited to Eastern Nigeria, particularly [[Enugu State]]. Flavour collaborated with [[Mr Raw]] on the album's lead single titled \"N'abania\". The song was recorded at Kingsley Ogoro's music studio in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n===2010: ''Uplifted''===\nFollowing the relative success of his debut album, Flavour released ''[[Uplifted]]'' in 2010.

She is also a [[Justice of the Peace]]. In 1970 she became a secondary school teacher, and from 1982 to 1989 she was electorate officer to state [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor]] minister [[Pauline Toner]].<ref name=vic>{{cite web\n  | last = Parliament of Victoria\n  | first = \n  | authorlink = Parliament of Victoria\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Garbutt, Sherryl Maree\n  | work = re-member: a database of all Victorian MPs since 1851\n  | publisher = Parliament of Victoria\n  | year = 2008\n  | url = http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/re-member/bioregfull.cfm?mid=94\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 22 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1989, she succeeded Toner in the seat of [[Electoral district of Greensborough|Greensborough]] in a by-election. In 1992 her seat was abolished and she transferred to [[Electoral district of Bundoora|Bundoora]]. She also entered the shadow ministry that year, serving as Shadow Minister for Community Services (1992\u201396), Women's Affairs (1993\u201396), Environment, Conservation and Land Management (1996\u201399), and Water Resources (1997\u201399). When Labor won office under [[Steve Bracks]] in 1999, she became Minister for Women's Affairs, Environment and Conservation. Although she remained Minister for Environment and Conservation, Garbutt lost responsibility for Land Victoria in the reshuffled [[Bracks]] Cabinet following the 2002 elections.

They play in the [[Belarusian Premier League]], the highest division in Belarusian football. Their colours are red and navy blue. \n\n==History==\nThe club was established in 2006 and was based on the [[Belarusian First League]] club ''[[FC Minsk-2|Smena Minsk]]''. FC Minsk took over Smena's license and was able to start immediately operating in the [[Belarusian First League]] without having to first play in the [[Belarusian Second League|Second League]], the third tier in Belarus. In the club's inaugural season in the First League, they were able to finish in first place guaranteeing them promotion to the [[Belarusian Premier League]].\n\nIn their top tier debut season, FC Minsk showed weak performances and were relegated at end of 2007, but they managed to bounce straight back the following year with a dominant campaign in the [[Belarusian First League]] scoring 72 goals and failing to win in only 3 of the 26 games. 2008 therefore saw them once again competing in the [[Belarusian Premier League]] where they have remained ever since.\n\nA 3rd-placed finish in 2010 saw FC Minsk embark on their first ever European campaign in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League]]. In the first qualifying round, they were pitched against [[AZAL PFK|AZAL Baku]] of [[Azerbaijan]] and managed a 3\u20132 aggregate win over two legs. The second qualifying round saw them drawn against [[Gaziantepspor]] of [[Turkey]]. After a 1\u20131 draw at home, the away fixture in [[Gaziantep]] saw the Turkish side win 4\u20131 as the tie finished 5\u20132 on aggregate in favour of [[Gaziantepspor]].\n\nIn 2013, FC Minsk changed their club crest for the current one. The same year they have qualified for the second qualifying round of the [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League]] by winning [[Belarusian Cup]].

They play in the [[Belarusian Premier League]], the highest division in Belarusian football. Their colours are red and navy blue. \n\n==History==\nThe club was established in 2006 and was based on the [[Belarusian First League]] club ''[[FC Minsk-2|Smena Minsk]]''. FC Minsk took over Smena's license and was able to start immediately operating in the [[Belarusian First League]] without having to first play in the [[Belarusian Second League|Second League]], the third tier in Belarus. In the club's inaugural season in the First League, they were able to finish in first place guaranteeing them promotion to the [[Belarusian Premier League]].\n\nIn their top tier debut season, FC Minsk showed weak performances and were relegated at end of 2007, but they managed to bounce straight back the following year with a dominant campaign in the [[Belarusian First League]] scoring 72 goals and failing to win in only 3 of the 26 games. 2008 therefore saw them once again competing in the [[Belarusian Premier League]] where they have remained ever since.\n\nA 3rd-placed finish in 2010 saw FC Minsk embark on their first ever European campaign in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League]]. In the first qualifying round, they were pitched against [[AZAL PFK|AZAL Baku]] of [[Azerbaijan]] and managed a 3\u20132 aggregate win over two legs. The second qualifying round saw them drawn against [[Gaziantepspor]] of [[Turkey]]. After a 1\u20131 draw at home, the away fixture in [[Gaziantep]] saw the Turkish side win 4\u20131 as the tie finished 5\u20132 on aggregate in favour of [[Gaziantepspor]].\n\nIn 2013, FC Minsk changed their club crest for the current one. The same year they have qualified for the second qualifying round of the [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League]] by winning [[Belarusian Cup]]. This campaign was more successful as Minsk first eliminated [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]] of [[Malta]] 3\u20131 on aggregate before beating the Scottish team [[St Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]] in the third qualifying round. After losing 0\u20131 at home, FC Minsk managed to win 1\u20130 in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and prevailed in penalty shootout 3\u20132, advancing to the play-offs, where they have lost to [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] of [[Belgium]] 5\u20131 on aggregate.\n\n===Club Crest===\nUpon their formation in 2006, FC Minsk adopted a simple white and blue crest which they kept for 7 years until 2013.

According to the Berlitz Complete Guide to Cruising and Cruise Ships, it was the only five-star expedition-cruise ship worldwide. Built in 1991, she specialises in trips to the [[Antarctic]]. She was built as ''Society Adventurer'', but was renamed when she was purchased by [[Hanseatic Tours]], as the fourth in a line of ''Hanseatics''. In 1997, [[Hapag-Lloyd]] purchased Hanseatic Tours, and she passed into their fleet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/HamburgAtlantik.html |title=Hanseatic Tours |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Shimplon Postcards |accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref>\n\n==Drydock fire==\nOn June 13, 2013, the ship was in [[drydock]] at the Bredo Shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany when a fire broke out in the shipyard. This caused a delay in drydock and additional repairs were required and so the June 17 and July 4 sailings were cancelled.\n\n==Insolvency==\nThe Resolute was scheduled to conduct a cruise to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and Antarctica from October 19, 2019, through November 6, 2019, beginning and ending in Ushuaia.  A medical emergency occurred on the ship while it was en route to Ushuaia, which delayed the ship, so the passengers were flown to Buenos Aires to meet the ship.  The ship sailed from Buenos Aires on October 19.  On October 22, the ship entered the port at Puerto Madryn to refuel.  After sitting in port for two days, it was revealed that the fuel could not be obtained because of non-payment by the ship operator, One Ocean Expeditions.

According to the Berlitz Complete Guide to Cruising and Cruise Ships, it was the only five-star expedition-cruise ship worldwide. Built in 1991, she specialises in trips to the [[Antarctic]]. She was built as ''Society Adventurer'', but was renamed when she was purchased by [[Hanseatic Tours]], as the fourth in a line of ''Hanseatics''. In 1997, [[Hapag-Lloyd]] purchased Hanseatic Tours, and she passed into their fleet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/HamburgAtlantik.html |title=Hanseatic Tours |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Shimplon Postcards |accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref>\n\n==Drydock fire==\nOn June 13, 2013, the ship was in [[drydock]] at the Bredo Shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany when a fire broke out in the shipyard. This caused a delay in drydock and additional repairs were required and so the June 17 and July 4 sailings were cancelled.\n\n==Insolvency==\nThe Resolute was scheduled to conduct a cruise to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and Antarctica from October 19, 2019, through November 6, 2019, beginning and ending in Ushuaia.  A medical emergency occurred on the ship while it was en route to Ushuaia, which delayed the ship, so the passengers were flown to Buenos Aires to meet the ship.  The ship sailed from Buenos Aires on October 19.  On October 22, the ship entered the port at Puerto Madryn to refuel.  After sitting in port for two days, it was revealed that the fuel could not be obtained because of non-payment by the ship operator, One Ocean Expeditions.  The Antarctic expedition was cancelled and the ship sailed back to Buenos Aires with all its passengers.  Once in Buenos Aires, the passengers disembarked and were left on their own with no reimbursement or compensation.  The ship was subsequently arrested in Buenos Aires for non-payment of debts. <ref>https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Rcgs-Resolute-9000168.html</ref> At last report, the ship was still under arrest in Buenos Aires, having missed the entire 2019-2020 Antarctic season. <ref>https://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/dates-and-rates</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|IMO 9000168}}\n*[http://www.rcgsresolute.com/ RCGS Resolute Virtual Tour]<ref>{{cite web |title=One Ocean Dates and Rates |url=https://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/dates-and-rates}}</ref>\n\n{{Hapag-Lloyd Cruises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Resolute}}\n[[Category:1991 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Rauma, Finland]]\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n\n\n{{cruise-ship-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCGS_Resolute"}

Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]] family, then until January 31, 1963, under successive owners.<ref name=\"Texas Hanbook 2010 Jun 15\" /><ref name=\"Stefano 1983\" /><ref name=\"Blanchard 1998\" /><ref name=\"Mexico Abroad 2000 Jan\" /><ref name=\"Bold 2011\" />\n\n== History of ''La Prensa'' ==\n''La Prensa'' was founded on February 13, 1913, in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] as a weekly newspaper by [[Ignacio Eugenio Lozano, Sr.]] (1886\u20131953), a prominent exile of Mexico, native of [[Nuevo Leon]], and supporter of [[Porfirio Diaz]] leading up to, and throughout the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"AJ 2004 Winter\" />  That same month, nine days later, Mexico's President [[Francisco I. Madero]] was assassinated.  The era was coincident with a large influx of Mexican exiles in America who had fled after a series of [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary]]-related civil unrest.<ref name=\"SA Express 1951 Feb 14\" /><ref name=\"Buitron 2004\" /> ''La Prensa'', according to historian Richard Griswold del Castillo, PhD, had two missions: (i) to serve as the voice of the Mexican exile community and (ii) to defend and represent the views of the wealthy Mexican exiles who favored [[Porfirio Diaz|Diaz]].  ''La Prensa's'' editorials strongly challenged Mexican public policy.<ref name=\"Journalism History 1977 Summer\" /><ref name=\"Garcia 1980\" />  The upshot was that its editorial positions mirrored the [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]] of [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]].<ref name=\"Aztl\u00e1n 1980 Spring\" />\n\nFrom 1913 to 1954, ''La Prensa'' was the leading Spanish-language newspaper circulating in South Texas.  For many years, it was the most widely circulated Spanish-language newspaper in the United States and had an international readership.  During its first two decades, it covered topics pertinent to exiles of the [[Mexican Revolution]], from 1910 to 1930.  The lifespan of ''La Prensa'' covered eras of [[World War I]], the decline of organized labor in the U.S. during the 1920s, the rise in the U.S. stock market between 1924 and 1929, the [[Great Crash]], the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], and the [[Great Depression]] that followed, the [[New Deal]], [[World War II]], and the emergence of the U.S. as a [[superpower]].  Yet through all that, in contrast to mainstream newspapers in the U.S., ''La Prensa'' devoted considerable coverage to matters relating to Mexico, and was the leading publication in opposition to the [[Mexican Revolution]].  For mainstream U.S. newspapers, matters in Europe were more important than matters in Mexico, which positioned ''La Prensa'' in an elevated role as a prime-source for important news involving Mexico.<ref name=\"Richmond & Haynes\" /><ref name=\"Bloom 2008\" /><ref name=\"Doak 2007\" />\n\n''La Prensa'' was also a leading voice for Mexican culture, which at the time, was a [[Mexican Renaissance|renaissance]] of literature, film, visual arts (including [[Mexican muralism|muralism]]), and music (including [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]]).  For Mexico, it was a vibrant period, and yet one of economic challenges and public policy shifts.\n\n''La Prensa's'' domestic and international readership peaked during the [[Mexican Revolution]], due largely to its position as the leading U.S. publication covering Mexico; and, unlike the print media of Mexico, ''La Prensa'' was free to print news and editorials of its choosing.<ref name=\"SA Light 1957 Jun 14\" />  In the 1920s, Los Angeles surpassed San Antonio as the U.S. city with the largest concentration of Mexicans.<ref name=\"Rodriguez 1999\" />  In that same decade, ''La Prensa's'' largest readership shifted to [[Los Angeles]].  On September 16, 1926 \u2014 [[Mexican Independence Day]] \u2014 [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]] launched the Los Angeles-based Spanish-language daily newspaper, ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]].''<ref name=\"biagi\" /><ref name=\"laweekly 1999 Jun 17\" /><ref name=\"Ru\u00edz\" /><ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Journalism\" /> As of the current date \u2014 {{date|2=mdy}} \u2014 ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' is in its {{number to word|{{age|1926|09|16}}|ord=on}}<!--subtract a year when using ordinal--> year.  It is the nation's oldest [[Mexican-American]] daily newspaper, the nation's largest Spanish-language daily newspaper, and is still directed by the Lozano family.  ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' is the enduring legacy of ''La Prensa.''\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], another Mexican cultural renaissance flourished,<ref name=\"LP 2011 Feb 20\" /> giving more rich material for ''La Prensa'' and the two U.S. cities with the largest Mexican and Mexican-American populations.  New York, at the time, had a large Spanish-speaking population, but it was not predominately Mexican.\n\nIn 1936, following the [[Mexican Revolution]], the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke-out.  ''La Prensa'' was an important publication for politically engaged people of Mexico and exiled Mexicans in the U.S. involved in helping integrate Spanish exiles who were fleeing [[falangism]].<ref name=\"Buitron 2004\" />  In 1953, the year that [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]] died, the [[Cuban Revolution]] began.\n\nYet, circulation of ''La Prensa'' declined in the late 1950s due to several factors, namely a waning public yearning to restore pre-[[Mexican Revolution]] values, a drop in Spanish literacy by writers and readers of newer generations of U.S.-born American citizens of Mexican ancestry, and a desire by newer generations to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] and embrace the [[Popular culture|pop culture]] of the post-[[swing era|swing]] and pre-[[Rock music|rock-n-roll]] eras.\n\nGiven that ''La Prensa'', under its founders, was strongly linked to its view of conservative pre-[[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] Mexican values, some scholars attribute its decline to being stuck in a bygone era while major cultural changes were occurring in new-generation Mexican-Americans \u2014 changes that included the [[Americanization]] of ''La Prensa's'' readership.  The Lozono family \u2014 who sold ''La Prensa'' at a low in 1959 but retained their Los Angeles newspaper, ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' \u2014 struggling with the changes for a decade following the death of their patriarch; but, they had several advantages over the successive owners of ''La Prensa.'' The new generation of Lozanos, led by American-born [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Jr.]], identified with forward-thinking [[United States|Americans]] of Mexican ancestry.  Moreover, [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Jr.|Ignacio, Jr.]], had experience of having worked in the family business with the mentoring of a lifetime from his father, mother, and executives close to the family.\n\n\"Mexico abroad\" was a fashionable term among many Mexican exiles.<ref name=\"Mexico Abroad 2000 Jan\" /> ''La Prensa'' was distinctly different from other major U.S. Spanish-language newspapers because of its allegiance to Mexico and its people.\n\n{{cquote|''La Prensa'' and ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' have become, spontaneously and automatically, the strongest links among all these Mexicans and their work in favor of \"Mexico abroad\" has surpassed the effectiveness of the work of all our border area consulates ... These newspapers have shown Mexicans in Mexico the intensity of the life of Mexicans abroad.  Without them, Mexicans inside Mexico would not know that thousands of fellow countrymen live abroad who have not lost their Mexican spirit or broken their spiritual ties with our homeland.''|25px|25px| [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Azcona]] [[:es:Juan S\u00e1nchez Azcona|(es)]], 1929<ref name=\"LO 1929 Jun 24\" />}}\n\nIn the latter part of the [[19th-century]], the phrase \"[[Mexican-American]],\"<ref name=\"Mex-Am vs. Chicano note 1\" group=lower-roman /> as an ethnic classification or reference, was still commonly used, but it waned in favor of other expressions.  Some historians and scholars have opined that the waning might have been a result of:\n\n# a loss of Mexican cultural values or allegiance to Mexico by newer generations born in America\n# fatigue from [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotyping]]\n# a broader mix of Spanish-speaking Americans from other countries blurring lines of ethnic identity\n# a desire for a broader ethnic or [[National identity|full-American]] or [[World view|worldly]] or [[Hip (slang)|hipper]] [[Identity (social science)|identity]] by Mexican-Americans\n# dilution degrees of Mexican-American ethnicity of successive generations\n# a disavowal of the [[patriarchal]], conservative values attached to the phrase by the early 19th-century generation of Mexican exiles  \n# any combination(s) thereof\n\nThe headquarters for ''La Prensa'' always remained in San Antonio.  In the era when the Lozano family controlled both ''La Prensa'' and ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'', until 1956, the headquarters for both remained in San Antonio.\n\n== Editorial bent ==\n; Conservative political stance towards the Mexican Revolution\nThe [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] views harbored by [[Mexican Revolution]] era exiles in the U.S. had some similarities to the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] views of Cuban exiles from the [[Cuban Revolution]]. That is, the so-called labor classes wanted change while wealthier classes, particularity those who fled, feared that change would result in economic ruin \u2014 and resisting change would threaten their lives.  From 1913, throughout the [[Mexican Revolution]], the editorials of ''La Prensa'' included contributions by prominent Mexican intellectual exiles that supported [[Factions in the Mexican Revolution#Porfiristas|Porfirista]] policies \u2014 policies that included [[authoritarianism|strongman political stability]], antisocialist proforeign economic intervention, and a united nationalistic society. Its negative views of the revolution complicated the Texas Mexican's attitudes towards both Mexico and the U.S.\n\nIn contrast to ''La Prensa's'' stance against labor uprisings in Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]], ''La Prensa'' was an influential watchdog for bigotry and labor abuses against Mexican-Americans in the U.S. during the same period.  And, in that same period, ''La Prensa'' supported Mexican-American non-union labor, notably in industries grappling with labor disputes.  In one case, ''La Prensa'' supported Mexican-American labor at [[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1923.<ref name=\"Penn Legacies 2006 Nov\" />  The April 17, 1923 edition of ''La Prensa'' announced that (i) a train left that day for [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], with four-hundred workers aboard, (ii) four-hundred more were to leave on April 22, 1923, and (iii) three-hundred workers had left two weeks earlier.\n\n; Third generation progressive political influence in the U.S.\nMany descendants of ''La Prensa'' journalists became leading exponents of progressive politics in [[United States|America]], including Lozano's granddaughter, [[Monica C. Lozano]] and Leonides Gonz\u00e1lez's son, [[Henry B. Gonzalez]].\n\n; Loyalty to Mexico\nLozano contended that all Mexicans were the same and urged them to return and rebuild their homeland.  One of his editors, Federico Allen Hinojosa, published a book in 1940 in which he asserted that members of the ''El M\u00e9xico de Afuera'' \u2014 the title of the book which translates to \"Exiles from Mexico\" \u2014 had distinguished themselves by not only retaining their faith (in Catholicism) and devotion (to Mexican nationalism) that their non-exiled Mexican counterparts had lost, they achieved a reconquest of the lost lands that the United States had taken from Mexico in the [[19th century]].<ref name=\"Matovina & Riebe-Estrella 2002\" /><ref name=\"Hinojosa 1940\" /><ref name=\"Aztl\u00e1n 1978\" />  While ''La Prensa'' articulated the political views of its publisher, it contained news and features about the Mexican homeland that appealed to Mexicans in the U.S. who harbored a wide spectrum of political views.\n\n; Provocative editorials towards the Mexican Revolutionary Party\nOn November 6, 1934, the [[Associated Press]] reported that distribution of ''La Prensa'' and ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' was barred from Mexico by the government because of articles criticizing the ousting of Catholic officials from government over opposition against the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Revolutionary Party]]-controlled government's plan to contest so-called Catholic aggression and to, among other things, transfer the role of education to the government.  [[Archbishop]] [[Pascual D\u00edaz y Barreto|Pascual Diaz]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|Mexico]] had gone into hiding.<ref name=\"Bing Press 1934 Nov 6\" />\n\n; Publishing influence in the Southwest\nSan Antonio became the publishing center for Hispanics in the Southwest, and housed more Spanish-language publishing houses than any other city in the United States.  During the 1920s and 1930s, San Antonio was home to:\n\n* Casa Editorial Lozano, founded around 1916 by [[Ignacio E.

It also urged readers to listen to classical music on the radio, \"M\u00fasica Simf\u00f3nica.\"  In an apparent attempt to cultivate Mexican heritage, ''La Prensa'' urged its readers to attend Mexican films, lectures by Mexican and Spanish intellectuals, and theater. Many Mexican-Americans, especially rico exiles, wanted to preserved their national heritage, Lo Mexicano; whereas lower income Mexican-Americans preferred to create their own cultural traditions.<ref name=\"Bryant\">''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DpOZBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT162 Culture in the American Southwest: The Earth, the Sky, the People,]'' by Keith L.

Gonz\u00e1lez was the father of [[Henry B. Gonzalez]], who in 1961, became a U.S. Congressman.  He was also the grandfather of [[Charlie Gonzalez]], who in 1999, also became a U.S. Congressman.\n\n; 1957 suspension of ''La Prensa''\nGonz\u00e1lez had retired in 1957 and on June 16 (Sunday), 1957, the paper suspended operation.<ref name=\"SA Light 1957 Jun 14\" /> It reappeared July 11, 1957, as a weekly tabloid.

The last issue under the Lozano family was published May 29, 1959, Vol. 47, No. 15.\n\n; 1959 sale of ''La Prensa''\n''La Prensa'' was sold to Texas millionaire-philanthropist Dudley Tarleton Dougherty (1924\u20131978) and economist Eduardo Grenas-Gooding (born 1887\u20131968), formerly of Colombia, Mexico, and Cuba.

Ed Castillo, who had been the managing editor since November 1959, remained in that role. Brinsmade remained owner and publisher of ''La Prensa'' until its demise in 1963.\n\nHis father, Robert Bruce Brinsmade, PhD (1873\u20131936), was an [[United States|American]] mining engineer, who through his work in mining, became a labor rights advocate and exponent of the economist [[Henry George]].<ref name=\"Land & Freedom Jan-Feb 1937\" /><ref name=\"Who's Who Pac Coast 1913\" /> Robert Turgot Brinsmade's maternal uncle, [[Harry Steenbock|Harry Steenbock, PhD]] (1886\u20131967), was a biochemistry professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]], inventor, and one of the discoverers of vitamins [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin A|A]] and [[Vitamin B|B]].\n\nBrinsmade, who had been practicing law in [[Caracas]], admitted that he collaborated in the overthrow of [[Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica]], the Venezuelan political party that governed from 1945 to 1948, when it ended by a [[1948 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat|''coup d'\u00e9tat'']].

Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]] family, then until January 31, 1963, under successive owners.<ref name=\"Texas Hanbook 2010 Jun 15\" /><ref name=\"Stefano 1983\" /><ref name=\"Blanchard 1998\" /><ref name=\"Mexico Abroad 2000 Jan\" /><ref name=\"Bold 2011\" />\n\n== History of ''La Prensa'' ==\n''La Prensa'' was founded on February 13, 1913, in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] as a weekly newspaper by [[Ignacio Eugenio Lozano, Sr.]] (1886\u20131953), a prominent exile of Mexico, native of [[Nuevo Leon]], and supporter of [[Porfirio Diaz]] leading up to, and throughout the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"AJ 2004 Winter\" />  That same month, nine days later, Mexico's President [[Francisco I. Madero]] was assassinated.  The era was coincident with a large influx of Mexican exiles in America who had fled after a series of [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary]]-related civil unrest.<ref name=\"SA Express 1951 Feb 14\" /><ref name=\"Buitron 2004\" /> ''La Prensa'', according to historian Richard Griswold del Castillo, PhD, had two missions: (i) to serve as the voice of the Mexican exile community and (ii) to defend and represent the views of the wealthy Mexican exiles who favored [[Porfirio Diaz|Diaz]].  ''La Prensa's'' editorials strongly challenged Mexican public policy.<ref name=\"Journalism History 1977 Summer\" /><ref name=\"Garcia 1980\" />  The upshot was that its editorial positions mirrored the [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]] of [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]].<ref name=\"Aztl\u00e1n 1980 Spring\" />\n\nFrom 1913 to 1954, ''La Prensa'' was the leading Spanish-language newspaper circulating in South Texas.  For many years, it was the most widely circulated Spanish-language newspaper in the United States and had an international readership.  During its first two decades, it covered topics pertinent to exiles of the [[Mexican Revolution]], from 1910 to 1930.  The lifespan of ''La Prensa'' covered eras of [[World War I]], the decline of organized labor in the U.S. during the 1920s, the rise in the U.S. stock market between 1924 and 1929, the [[Great Crash]], the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], and the [[Great Depression]] that followed, the [[New Deal]], [[World War II]], and the emergence of the U.S. as a [[superpower]].  Yet through all that, in contrast to mainstream newspapers in the U.S., ''La Prensa'' devoted considerable coverage to matters relating to Mexico, and was the leading publication in opposition to the [[Mexican Revolution]].  For mainstream U.S. newspapers, matters in Europe were more important than matters in Mexico, which positioned ''La Prensa'' in an elevated role as a prime-source for important news involving Mexico.<ref name=\"Richmond & Haynes\" /><ref name=\"Bloom 2008\" /><ref name=\"Doak 2007\" />\n\n''La Prensa'' was also a leading voice for Mexican culture, which at the time, was a [[Mexican Renaissance|renaissance]] of literature, film, visual arts (including [[Mexican muralism|muralism]]), and music (including [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]]).  For Mexico, it was a vibrant period, and yet one of economic challenges and public policy shifts.\n\n''La Prensa's'' domestic and international readership peaked during the [[Mexican Revolution]], due largely to its position as the leading U.S. publication covering Mexico; and, unlike the print media of Mexico, ''La Prensa'' was free to print news and editorials of its choosing.<ref name=\"SA Light 1957 Jun 14\" />  In the 1920s, Los Angeles surpassed San Antonio as the U.S. city with the largest concentration of Mexicans.<ref name=\"Rodriguez 1999\" />  In that same decade, ''La Prensa's'' largest readership shifted to [[Los Angeles]].  On September 16, 1926 \u2014 [[Mexican Independence Day]] \u2014 [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]] launched the Los Angeles-based Spanish-language daily newspaper, ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]].''<ref name=\"biagi\" /><ref name=\"laweekly 1999 Jun 17\" /><ref name=\"Ru\u00edz\" /><ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Journalism\" /> As of the current date \u2014 {{date|2=mdy}} \u2014 ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' is in its {{number to word|{{age|1926|09|16}}|ord=on}}<!--subtract a year when using ordinal--> year.  It is the nation's oldest [[Mexican-American]] daily newspaper, the nation's largest Spanish-language daily newspaper, and is still directed by the Lozano family.  ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' is the enduring legacy of ''La Prensa.''\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], another Mexican cultural renaissance flourished,<ref name=\"LP 2011 Feb 20\" /> giving more rich material for ''La Prensa'' and the two U.S. cities with the largest Mexican and Mexican-American populations.  New York, at the time, had a large Spanish-speaking population, but it was not predominately Mexican.\n\nIn 1936, following the [[Mexican Revolution]], the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke-out.  ''La Prensa'' was an important publication for politically engaged people of Mexico and exiled Mexicans in the U.S. involved in helping integrate Spanish exiles who were fleeing [[falangism]].<ref name=\"Buitron 2004\" />  In 1953, the year that [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Sr.|Lozano]] died, the [[Cuban Revolution]] began.\n\nYet, circulation of ''La Prensa'' declined in the late 1950s due to several factors, namely a waning public yearning to restore pre-[[Mexican Revolution]] values, a drop in Spanish literacy by writers and readers of newer generations of U.S.-born American citizens of Mexican ancestry, and a desire by newer generations to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] and embrace the [[Popular culture|pop culture]] of the post-[[swing era|swing]] and pre-[[Rock music|rock-n-roll]] eras.\n\nGiven that ''La Prensa'', under its founders, was strongly linked to its view of conservative pre-[[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] Mexican values, some scholars attribute its decline to being stuck in a bygone era while major cultural changes were occurring in new-generation Mexican-Americans \u2014 changes that included the [[Americanization]] of ''La Prensa's'' readership.  The Lozono family \u2014 who sold ''La Prensa'' at a low in 1959 but retained their Los Angeles newspaper, ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' \u2014 struggling with the changes for a decade following the death of their patriarch; but, they had several advantages over the successive owners of ''La Prensa.'' The new generation of Lozanos, led by American-born [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Jr.]], identified with forward-thinking [[United States|Americans]] of Mexican ancestry.  Moreover, [[Ignacio E. Lozano, Jr.|Ignacio, Jr.]], had experience of having worked in the family business with the mentoring of a lifetime from his father, mother, and executives close to the family.\n\n\"Mexico abroad\" was a fashionable term among many Mexican exiles.<ref name=\"Mexico Abroad 2000 Jan\" /> ''La Prensa'' was distinctly different from other major U.S. Spanish-language newspapers because of its allegiance to Mexico and its people.\n\n{{cquote|''La Prensa'' and ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' have become, spontaneously and automatically, the strongest links among all these Mexicans and their work in favor of \"Mexico abroad\" has surpassed the effectiveness of the work of all our border area consulates ... These newspapers have shown Mexicans in Mexico the intensity of the life of Mexicans abroad.  Without them, Mexicans inside Mexico would not know that thousands of fellow countrymen live abroad who have not lost their Mexican spirit or broken their spiritual ties with our homeland.''|25px|25px| [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Azcona]] [[:es:Juan S\u00e1nchez Azcona|(es)]], 1929<ref name=\"LO 1929 Jun 24\" />}}\n\nIn the latter part of the [[19th-century]], the phrase \"[[Mexican-American]],\"<ref name=\"Mex-Am vs. Chicano note 1\" group=lower-roman /> as an ethnic classification or reference, was still commonly used, but it waned in favor of other expressions.  Some historians and scholars have opined that the waning might have been a result of:\n\n# a loss of Mexican cultural values or allegiance to Mexico by newer generations born in America\n# fatigue from [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotyping]]\n# a broader mix of Spanish-speaking Americans from other countries blurring lines of ethnic identity\n# a desire for a broader ethnic or [[National identity|full-American]] or [[World view|worldly]] or [[Hip (slang)|hipper]] [[Identity (social science)|identity]] by Mexican-Americans\n# dilution degrees of Mexican-American ethnicity of successive generations\n# a disavowal of the [[patriarchal]], conservative values attached to the phrase by the early 19th-century generation of Mexican exiles  \n# any combination(s) thereof\n\nThe headquarters for ''La Prensa'' always remained in San Antonio.  In the era when the Lozano family controlled both ''La Prensa'' and ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'', until 1956, the headquarters for both remained in San Antonio.\n\n== Editorial bent ==\n; Conservative political stance towards the Mexican Revolution\nThe [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] views harbored by [[Mexican Revolution]] era exiles in the U.S. had some similarities to the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] views of Cuban exiles from the [[Cuban Revolution]]. That is, the so-called labor classes wanted change while wealthier classes, particularity those who fled, feared that change would result in economic ruin \u2014 and resisting change would threaten their lives.  From 1913, throughout the [[Mexican Revolution]], the editorials of ''La Prensa'' included contributions by prominent Mexican intellectual exiles that supported [[Factions in the Mexican Revolution#Porfiristas|Porfirista]] policies \u2014 policies that included [[authoritarianism|strongman political stability]], antisocialist proforeign economic intervention, and a united nationalistic society. Its negative views of the revolution complicated the Texas Mexican's attitudes towards both Mexico and the U.S.\n\nIn contrast to ''La Prensa's'' stance against labor uprisings in Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]], ''La Prensa'' was an influential watchdog for bigotry and labor abuses against Mexican-Americans in the U.S. during the same period.  And, in that same period, ''La Prensa'' supported Mexican-American non-union labor, notably in industries grappling with labor disputes.  In one case, ''La Prensa'' supported Mexican-American labor at [[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1923.<ref name=\"Penn Legacies 2006 Nov\" />  The April 17, 1923 edition of ''La Prensa'' announced that (i) a train left that day for [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], with four-hundred workers aboard, (ii) four-hundred more were to leave on April 22, 1923, and (iii) three-hundred workers had left two weeks earlier.\n\n; Third generation progressive political influence in the U.S.\nMany descendants of ''La Prensa'' journalists became leading exponents of progressive politics in [[United States|America]], including Lozano's granddaughter, [[Monica C. Lozano]] and Leonides Gonz\u00e1lez's son, [[Henry B. Gonzalez]].\n\n; Loyalty to Mexico\nLozano contended that all Mexicans were the same and urged them to return and rebuild their homeland.  One of his editors, Federico Allen Hinojosa, published a book in 1940 in which he asserted that members of the ''El M\u00e9xico de Afuera'' \u2014 the title of the book which translates to \"Exiles from Mexico\" \u2014 had distinguished themselves by not only retaining their faith (in Catholicism) and devotion (to Mexican nationalism) that their non-exiled Mexican counterparts had lost, they achieved a reconquest of the lost lands that the United States had taken from Mexico in the [[19th century]].<ref name=\"Matovina & Riebe-Estrella 2002\" /><ref name=\"Hinojosa 1940\" /><ref name=\"Aztl\u00e1n 1978\" />  While ''La Prensa'' articulated the political views of its publisher, it contained news and features about the Mexican homeland that appealed to Mexicans in the U.S. who harbored a wide spectrum of political views.\n\n; Provocative editorials towards the Mexican Revolutionary Party\nOn November 6, 1934, the [[Associated Press]] reported that distribution of ''La Prensa'' and ''[[La Opini\u00f3n]]'' was barred from Mexico by the government because of articles criticizing the ousting of Catholic officials from government over opposition against the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Revolutionary Party]]-controlled government's plan to contest so-called Catholic aggression and to, among other things, transfer the role of education to the government.  [[Archbishop]] [[Pascual D\u00edaz y Barreto|Pascual Diaz]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|Mexico]] had gone into hiding.<ref name=\"Bing Press 1934 Nov 6\" />\n\n; Publishing influence in the Southwest\nSan Antonio became the publishing center for Hispanics in the Southwest, and housed more Spanish-language publishing houses than any other city in the United States.  During the 1920s and 1930s, San Antonio was home to:\n\n* Casa Editorial Lozano, founded around 1916 by [[Ignacio E.

It also urged readers to listen to classical music on the radio, \"M\u00fasica Simf\u00f3nica.\"  In an apparent attempt to cultivate Mexican heritage, ''La Prensa'' urged its readers to attend Mexican films, lectures by Mexican and Spanish intellectuals, and theater. Many Mexican-Americans, especially rico exiles, wanted to preserved their national heritage, Lo Mexicano; whereas lower income Mexican-Americans preferred to create their own cultural traditions.<ref name=\"Bryant\">''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DpOZBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT162 Culture in the American Southwest: The Earth, the Sky, the People,]'' by Keith L.

While not reaching the heights of past seasons, he finished fourth in the best and fairest and was second at the club in centre clearances, tackles and inside 50s, and fourth in goals (23), contested possessions and bounces. \n2009 was a disappointing year after injuring his knee in round three and missing three months of footy.
