One version, the '''C.714''', saw limited production, and were assigned to [[Poland|Polish]] pilots flying in France after the fall of Poland in 1939. A small number was also supplied to [[Finland]].\n\n==Design and development==\nThe original specification that led to the C.710 series was offered in 1936 in order to quickly raise the number of modern aircraft in French service, by supplying a \"light fighter\" of wooden construction that could be built rapidly in large numbers without upsetting the production of existing types. The contract resulted in three designs, the [[Arsenal VG-33|Arsenal VG-30]], the [[Bloch MB.700]]<ref name=\"Dassaultmb700\">{{cite web |title=MB 700: origins, characteristics and performance data |url=https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-bloch-aircraft/mb-700/ |website=Dassault Aviation, a major player to aeronautics |accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref> , and the C.710. Prototypes of all three were ordered.\n\nThe original C.710 model was an angular design developed from an earlier series of air racers. One common feature of the Caudron line was an extremely long nose that set the cockpit far back on the fuselage. The nose housed the 336&nbsp;kW (450&nbsp;hp) [[Renault 12R|Renault 12R-01]], a [[supercharger|supercharged]] inverted and air-cooled [[V-12 engine]] that resulted from putting together two 6Q engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aalebourget.fr/moteur-caudron-cr-714/ |title=The engine of the Caudron CR.714 |language=fr |website=Ailes Anciennes Le Bourget |access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref> The landing gear was fixed and [[Aircraft fairing#Types|spatted]], and the [[vertical stabilizer]] was a seemingly [[World War I]]-era semicircle instead of a more common trapezoidal or triangular design. Armament consisted of a 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano-Suiza HS.9]] cannon under each wing in a small pod.\n\nThe C.710 prototype first flew on 18 July 1936.<ref name=\"complete fighters p111\">Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 111.</ref> Despite its small size, it showed good potential and was able to reach a level speed of 470&nbsp;km/h (292&nbsp;mph) during flight testing. Further development continued with the '''C.711''' and '''C.712''' with more powerful engines, while the C.713 which flew on 15 December 1937 introduced retractable landing gear and a more conventional triangular vertical stabilizer.<ref name=\"complete fighters p111\"/>\n\nThe final evolution of the 710 series was the C.714 Cyclone, a variation on the C.713 which first flew in April 1938 as the C.714.01 prototype. The primary changes were a new wing [[airfoil]] profile, a strengthened fuselage, and instead of two cannons, the fighter had four 7.5&nbsp;mm [[MAC 1934]] machine guns in the wing gondolas. It was powered by the newer 12R-03 version of the engine, which introduced a new [[carburettor]] that could operate in negative [[g-force|''g'']].\n\nThe French Air Force ordered 20 C.714s on 5 November 1938, with options for a further 180. Production started at a [[Renault]] factory in the [[Paris]] suburbs in summer 1939.<ref>Green 1960, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nOther projected versions were the C.720 [[Trainer aircraft|trainer]] with a 75 or 164&nbsp;kW (100 or 220&nbsp;hp) engine, the C.760 fighter with a 559&nbsp;kW (750&nbsp;hp) [[Isotta-Fraschini Delta]] engine, and the '''C.770''' fighter with a 597&nbsp;kW (800&nbsp;hp) Renault V-engine. None of these reached production.\n\n==Operational history==\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Caudron C.714.jpg|thumb|right|A Finnish C.714]]\n\nDeliveries did not start until January 1940. After a series of tests with the first production examples, it became apparent that the design was seriously flawed. Although light and fast, its wooden construction did not permit a more powerful engine to be fitted. The original engine seriously limited its climb rate and maneuverability with the result that the Caudron was withdrawn from active service in February 1940. In March, the initial production order was reduced to 90, as the performance was not considered good enough to warrant further production contracts. Eighty were diverted to Finland to fight in the [[Winter War]]. These were meant to be flown by French pilots.\n\nHowever, events in France resulted in only six aircraft being delivered, and an additional ten were waiting in the harbour when deliveries were stopped. The six aircraft that arrived were assembled, tested and given registrations CA-551 to CA-556. The aircraft were found to be too unreliable and dangerous to use in Finnish conditions, and were not committed to combat. Two of the aircraft were damaged during a transport flight to [[Pori]]. Further, the Finnish pilots found that it was difficult to start and land the aircraft from the air bases at the front. The aircraft were maintained on the roster until they were retired and scrapped on 30 December 1949. One example, ''CA-556'' was transferred to the maintenance personnel school as an instructional airframe.<ref name=\"Stockton\">{{cite web |last1=Stockton |first1=Harold E.

After just 23 sorties, adverse opinion of the fighter was confirmed by frontline pilots who expressed concerns that it was seriously underpowered and was no match for contemporary German fighters.\n\nOn 25 May, only a week after it was introduced, French Minister of War [[Guy La Chambre]] ordered all C.714s to be withdrawn from active service. However, since the French authorities had no other aircraft to offer, the Polish pilots ignored the order and continued to fly the Caudrons. Despite flying a fighter hopelessly outdated compared to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E, the Polish pilots scored 12 confirmed and three unconfirmed victories in three battles between 8 June and 11 June, losing nine in the air and nine more on the ground. Among the aircraft shot down were four [[Dornier Do 17]] bombers, and also three [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and five [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighters.\n\nThe Caudron fighter was also used by the Polish training squadron based in [[Bron]] near [[Lyon]]. Although the pilots managed to disperse several bombing raids, they did not score any kills; but they did not lose any aircraft either. By the end of June when France fell, only 53 production machines had been delivered (although the number varies, 98 is another common figure).\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Caudron CR.714.png|thumb|right|Caudron CR.714 fighter plane of Groupe de Chasse I/145, June 1940]]\n;{{FIN}}\n*[[Finnish Air Force]]\n;{{FRA}}\n*[[French Air Force]]\n;{{POL}}\n*[[Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain|Polish Air Force in Exile]]\n\n==Survivors==\nOne full CR.714 airframe as well as one additional fuselage were preserved in Finland.

One version, the '''C.714''', saw limited production, and were assigned to [[Poland|Polish]] pilots flying in France after the fall of Poland in 1939. A small number was also supplied to [[Finland]].\n\n==Design and development==\nThe original specification that led to the C.710 series was offered in 1936 in order to quickly raise the number of modern aircraft in French service, by supplying a \"light fighter\" of wooden construction that could be built rapidly in large numbers without upsetting the production of existing types. The contract resulted in three designs, the [[Arsenal VG-33|Arsenal VG-30]], the [[Bloch MB.700]]<ref name=\"Dassaultmb700\">{{cite web |title=MB 700: origins, characteristics and performance data |url=https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-bloch-aircraft/mb-700/ |website=Dassault Aviation, a major player to aeronautics |accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref> , and the C.710. Prototypes of all three were ordered.\n\nThe original C.710 model was an angular design developed from an earlier series of air racers. One common feature of the Caudron line was an extremely long nose that set the cockpit far back on the fuselage. The nose housed the 336&nbsp;kW (450&nbsp;hp) [[Renault 12R|Renault 12R-01]], a [[supercharger|supercharged]] inverted and air-cooled [[V-12 engine]] that resulted from putting together two 6Q engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aalebourget.fr/moteur-caudron-cr-714/ |title=The engine of the Caudron CR.714 |language=fr |website=Ailes Anciennes Le Bourget |access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref> The landing gear was fixed and [[Aircraft fairing#Types|spatted]], and the [[vertical stabilizer]] was a seemingly [[World War I]]-era semicircle instead of a more common trapezoidal or triangular design. Armament consisted of a 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano-Suiza HS.9]] cannon under each wing in a small pod.\n\nThe C.710 prototype first flew on 18 July 1936.<ref name=\"complete fighters p111\">Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 111.</ref> Despite its small size, it showed good potential and was able to reach a level speed of 470&nbsp;km/h (292&nbsp;mph) during flight testing. Further development continued with the '''C.711''' and '''C.712''' with more powerful engines, while the C.713 which flew on 15 December 1937 introduced retractable landing gear and a more conventional triangular vertical stabilizer.<ref name=\"complete fighters p111\"/>\n\nThe final evolution of the 710 series was the C.714 Cyclone, a variation on the C.713 which first flew in April 1938 as the C.714.01 prototype. The primary changes were a new wing [[airfoil]] profile, a strengthened fuselage, and instead of two cannons, the fighter had four 7.5&nbsp;mm [[MAC 1934]] machine guns in the wing gondolas. It was powered by the newer 12R-03 version of the engine, which introduced a new [[carburettor]] that could operate in negative [[g-force|''g'']].\n\nThe French Air Force ordered 20 C.714s on 5 November 1938, with options for a further 180. Production started at a [[Renault]] factory in the [[Paris]] suburbs in summer 1939.<ref>Green 1960, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nOther projected versions were the C.720 [[Trainer aircraft|trainer]] with a 75 or 164&nbsp;kW (100 or 220&nbsp;hp) engine, the C.760 fighter with a 559&nbsp;kW (750&nbsp;hp) [[Isotta-Fraschini Delta]] engine, and the '''C.770''' fighter with a 597&nbsp;kW (800&nbsp;hp) Renault V-engine. None of these reached production.\n\n==Operational history==\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Caudron C.714.jpg|thumb|right|A Finnish C.714]]\n\nDeliveries did not start until January 1940. After a series of tests with the first production examples, it became apparent that the design was seriously flawed. Although light and fast, its wooden construction did not permit a more powerful engine to be fitted. The original engine seriously limited its climb rate and maneuverability with the result that the Caudron was withdrawn from active service in February 1940. In March, the initial production order was reduced to 90, as the performance was not considered good enough to warrant further production contracts. Eighty were diverted to Finland to fight in the [[Winter War]]. These were meant to be flown by French pilots.\n\nHowever, events in France resulted in only six aircraft being delivered, and an additional ten were waiting in the harbour when deliveries were stopped. The six aircraft that arrived were assembled, tested and given registrations CA-551 to CA-556. The aircraft were found to be too unreliable and dangerous to use in Finnish conditions, and were not committed to combat. Two of the aircraft were damaged during a transport flight to [[Pori]]. Further, the Finnish pilots found that it was difficult to start and land the aircraft from the air bases at the front. The aircraft were maintained on the roster until they were retired and scrapped on 30 December 1949. One example, ''CA-556'' was transferred to the maintenance personnel school as an instructional airframe.<ref name=\"Stockton\">{{cite web |last1=Stockton |first1=Harold E.

After just 23 sorties, adverse opinion of the fighter was confirmed by frontline pilots who expressed concerns that it was seriously underpowered and was no match for contemporary German fighters.\n\nOn 25 May, only a week after it was introduced, French Minister of War [[Guy La Chambre]] ordered all C.714s to be withdrawn from active service. However, since the French authorities had no other aircraft to offer, the Polish pilots ignored the order and continued to fly the Caudrons. Despite flying a fighter hopelessly outdated compared to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E, the Polish pilots scored 12 confirmed and three unconfirmed victories in three battles between 8 June and 11 June, losing nine in the air and nine more on the ground. Among the aircraft shot down were four [[Dornier Do 17]] bombers, and also three [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and five [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighters.\n\nThe Caudron fighter was also used by the Polish training squadron based in [[Bron]] near [[Lyon]]. Although the pilots managed to disperse several bombing raids, they did not score any kills; but they did not lose any aircraft either. By the end of June when France fell, only 53 production machines had been delivered (although the number varies, 98 is another common figure).\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Caudron CR.714.png|thumb|right|Caudron CR.714 fighter plane of Groupe de Chasse I/145, June 1940]]\n;{{FIN}}\n*[[Finnish Air Force]]\n;{{FRA}}\n*[[French Air Force]]\n;{{POL}}\n*[[Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain|Polish Air Force in Exile]]\n\n==Survivors==\nOne full CR.714 airframe as well as one additional fuselage were preserved in Finland.

The [[double act|straight man]] among his group of friends, this semi-[[character (arts)|fictionalized]] version of [[comedian]] [[Jerry Seinfeld]] was named after, co-created by, based on, and played by Seinfeld himself. The series revolves around Jerry's misadventures with his best friend [[George Costanza]], neighbor [[Cosmo Kramer]], and ex-girlfriend [[Elaine Benes]]. He is usually the voice of reason amidst his friends' antics and the focal point of the relationship.\n\nAn eternal [[optimism|optimist]], he rarely runs into major personal problems. Jerry is the only main character on the show to maintain the same career (a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], like the real Seinfeld) throughout the series. He is the most [[observational comedy|observational character]], sarcastically commenting on his friends' quirky habits. Much of the show's action takes place in Jerry's apartment located in New York City at 129 West 81st Street, apartment 5A.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Alternate Side|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= December 4, 1991|season=3|number=11}}</ref>  He and his friends also frequently have coffee or meals together at [[Monk's Caf\u00e9]].\n\nJerry appeared in all 180 episodes of ''Seinfeld'' (including several two-part episodes) and is the only character in the show to appear in every episode.<ref>Neither George nor Kramer appear in \"[[The Pen]]\"; Elaine does not appear in [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot]], \"[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip, Part I]]\" and \"[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip, Part II]]\"; Kramer also does not appear in \"[[The Chinese Restaurant]]\".</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nIn the show's setting, Jerry is the [[straight man]], a figure who is \"[[Everyman|able to observe the chaos around him but not always be a part of it]].\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml BBC Comedy Guide: Seinfeld]</ref> Plot lines involving Jerry often concern his various relationships \u2013 Jerry often finds \"stupid reasons to break up\" with women; which, according to Elaine, occurs \"every week.\"\n\nJerry is generally completely indifferent to what goes on in his friends' lives, seeing their misery as merely an entertaining distraction, as well as an opportunity for joke material. He often plays along with their hare-brained schemes, even encouraging them, often just to see them fail. In the episode \"[[The Serenity Now]]\", Jerry is perplexed by his experience of crying, asking \"What is this salty discharge?\".<ref name=\"theserenitynow\">{{Cite episode|title=The Serenity Now|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= October 9, 1997|season=9|number=3}}</ref> In \"[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]\" Elaine points out that he has \"never felt remorse,\" to which Jerry replies, \"Yeah, I feel kinda bad about that.\"<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Foundation|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= September 19, 1996|season=8|number=1}}</ref> He will often nonchalantly state, \"That's a shame\" when something bad happens (often due to his or his friends' actions). A recurring joke is Jerry behaving unchivalrously towards Elaine, such as not helping her carry groceries or heavy objects, ignoring her when she is upset, and on one occasion taking a first class upgrade on a flight for himself, leaving Elaine in economy. Jerry, George and Elaine all share a general trait of not letting go of other character's remarks and going to great lengths to be proven right. In one episode, Jerry goes out of his way to rent a house in [[Tuscany]], just because Elaine's boyfriend told him there weren't any available.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Maestro|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= October 5, 1995|season=7|number=3}}</ref> Another example is when he buys his parents the same car over and over again, at great financial loss.<ref name=\"The Cadillac\">{{Cite episode|title=The Cadillac|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= February 8, 1996|season=7|number=14}}</ref>\n\nDespite his usual indifference to his friends and their actions, Jerry apparently is very satisfied with his life, to the point that he actually feels worried about anything that might threaten the group lifestyle. In \"[[The Invitations]]\", for example, Jerry admits that he feels depressed about George getting married, seeing as how George will eventually leave the group and Jerry will never see him again. Once Elaine told him that she was also \"getting out\" of the group, Jerry became so worried about a near future of just him and Kramer that he unknowingly almost walked into a car while crossing the street. In \"[[The Bizarro Jerry]]\", Jerry also grows panicky about losing the group dynamic when Kramer becomes too busy with his fake job and Elaine temporarily leaves to join the Bizarro group, claiming that \"The whole system's breaking down!\" Jerry himself perfectly sums up his relation to his three friends in the episode \"[[The Letter (Seinfeld)|The Letter]]\". In a deleted scene from that show, he claims that his friends are \"not more important\" than his girlfriends, but \"they're as important.\"\n\nUnlike George and Elaine, Jerry rarely runs into major personal problems. In \"[[The Opposite]]\", this tendency is explicitly pointed out, as Jerry goes through a number of experiences after which he invariably \"breaks even\", even as his friends are going through intense periods of success or failure. Even when Elaine threw Jerry's $20 bill out of the window, he unexpectedly found one in his coat pocket, evening out his luck. In \"[[The Rye]]\", during a particularly trying time for Elaine, she angrily tells Jerry, \"You know, one of these days, something terrible is going to happen to you. It ''has'' to!\" Jerry simply replies, \"No, I'm going to be just fine.\" Many of the problems he does run into are the result of the actions of his nemesis [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], a disgruntled postal worker. In \"[[The Old Man (Seinfeld)|The Old Man]]\", George asks \"What kind of a person are you?\" in which Jerry replies \"I think I'm pretty much like you, only successful.\"\n\nHowever, Kramer persuades Jerry to do things that he's reluctant to do. In \"[[The Mango]]\", Kramer gets Jerry to buy fruit for him after Kramer is banned from the store over an argument with the owner. This continues until the owner bans Jerry, because his order is similar enough to Kramer's that it's obvious he's buying fruit for Kramer. The most famous example is in \"[[The Chicken Roaster]]\" in which Kramer and Jerry exchange apartments. This results in the two of them also switching personalities. In several arguments with Jerry, Kramer is incredibly stubborn, protecting his own interests. Examples of this include arguments in \"[[The Chaperone (Seinfeld)|The Chaperone]]\", \"[[The Face Painter]]\" and \"[[The Caddy (Seinfeld)|The Caddy]]\". Probably the only exception is \"[[The Kiss Hello]]\" in which Kramer kissed Jerry as George walked in.\n\nJerry always wears a suit whenever he has to do his stand-up comedy act. In a few cases, Jerry wears an unusual item of clothing. Kramer has persuaded Jerry to wear the \"[[Poet shirt|pirate shirt]]\" in \"[[The Puffy Shirt]]\", the cowboy boots in \"[[The Mom & Pop Store]]\" and the fur coat in \"[[The Reverse Peephole]]\". Like George, Jerry's hairstyle remains relatively the same throughout the series, though the length and thickness of it alters, especially from Season 3 onwards. There is one noticeable episode in which Jerry receives a bad haircut when he reluctantly agrees to get his hair done by an incompetent Italian barber in \"[[The Barber (Seinfeld)|The Barber]]\".\n\nAs in real life, Jerry is a fan of comic book characters, particularly of [[Superman]], who is his hero. As far as sports, Jerry is a fan of the [[New York Mets]] as evidenced as early as the episode \"[[The Baby Shower (Seinfeld)|The Baby Shower]]\" in which Kramer persuades him to install illegal cable by saying \"The Mets have 75 games on cable this year.\" Jerry is also a fan of the [[New York Yankees]], the [[New York Knicks]], the [[New York Giants]], the [[New York Rangers]], and even the [[Chicago Cubs]]. In early episodes, a [[New York Yankees]] hat sits on the counter near his computer. Later on, by the middle of Season 3, it was replaced with a Mets cap, possibly to better reflect Seinfeld's real-life support of the Queens side. While a Mets fan, he has once attended a Yankees games (in the sixth season). In the [[The Chaperone (Seinfeld)|first episode]] of Season 6 and the [[The Engagement (Seinfeld)|first episode]] of Season 7, Jerry is shown watching a Yankees game with George.\n\nJerry never smokes a cigarette but is seen smoking a cigar in \"[[The Calzone]]\", \"[[The Wizard (Seinfeld)|The Wizard]]\" and \"[[The Voice (Seinfeld)|The Voice]]\". Jerry also does not appear to have any particular interest in [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] as he is rarely seen drinking beer or any other alcoholic beverage; however, he is seen drinking beer with George once in \"[[The Shower Head]]\", wine at various meals, and keeps a bottle of Hennigan's scotch in his apartment, though he claims that he only uses it as a [[paint thinner]].<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Red Dot|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= December 11, 1991|season=3|number=12}}</ref>\nHe is also seen doing a shot of Hennigans during season 3 episode 12 \u2018The Red Dot\u2019 when he is trying to lie for George's tight spending habits relating to a gift he bought for Elaine\n\n==Background==\nJerry and George grew up in [[New York City]]. George recalls in \"[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]\" that the two were friends ever since an encounter in gym class in their school days. In \"[[The Betrayal (Seinfeld)|The Betrayal]]\", Jerry mentions that he once beat George up in the fourth grade. Flashbacks in episodes such as \"[[The Library (Seinfeld)|The Library]]\" portray Jerry and George in high school. A pizza place which they frequented is portrayed in \"[[The Frogger]]\". Jerry and George attended school together at [[Edward R. Murrow High School|Edward R. Murrow Middle School]], [[John F. Kennedy High School (New York City)|John F. Kennedy High School]] and [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]].<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Marine Biologist| series= Seinfeld| network= [[NBC]]|airdate= February 10, 1994|season=5|number=14}}</ref>\n\nAfter college, Jerry briefly worked as an [[umbrella]] salesman and claims to have invented the \"twirl\" to make the umbrella look more attractive. He eventually quit the job in order to focus more on his comedy career.\n\n==Family==\nJerry's parents are Morty and Helen Seinfeld, a retired [[American Jews|Jewish]] couple living in [[Florida]]. Unlike George, who usually can't stand his parents, Jerry gets along reasonably well with his parents, but he still prefers they live in Florida rather than New York, so that they do not interfere with his private life (a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d). Although born and raised [[Jews|Jewish]] and he considers himself a Jew, Jerry apparently does not practice and generally does not observe many traditions. In \"[[The Bris]]\", he implies he is circumcised, repeatedly asking people if they have \"ever seen one\" - in reference to an uncircumcised penis. He also mentions having a sister in the episode \"[[The Chinese Restaurant]]\", though she is never named, never appears on screen, and is never mentioned again after this episode. In order to avoid his old friend Joel in \"[[Male Unbonding]]\", Jerry pretends to have promised to tutor his nephew; it is unclear if the nephew really exists or is simply fabricated as part of the excuse.\n\nJerry has an eccentric uncle, [[Uncle Leo|Leo]], who appears in 15 episodes. Uncle Leo has a son, Cousin Jeffrey, who works for the parks department, about whom he constantly talks, but who never appears. In \"[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]\", Jerry speaks to an \"Uncle Mac\", as well as a cousin \"Artie Levine\". In \"[[The Truth (Seinfeld)|The Truth]]\", Jerry mentions a cousin named \"Douglass\" who has an addiction with [[Pepsi]]. In \"[[The Pony Remark]]\", Helen, Morty, Jerry, Elaine and Leo attend a 50th-anniversary party for Manya and Isaac, an elderly couple whose relationship to Jerry is never explicitly defined. Manya is described as a [[Poland|Polish]] immigrant. In the same episode, Jerry references having an \"Aunt Rose\", and Helen mentions a family member named \"Claire\" who is getting married. In \"[[The Soup (Seinfeld)|The Soup]]\" episode, Jerry mentions an \"Aunt Silvia\", who he compares to Elaine in terms of conversation.\n\nJerry's maternal grandmother, Nana, is an elderly woman with memory problems, occasionally unable to tell the past from the present, living alone in the city. Nana makes appearances in \"[[The Pledge Drive]]\", \"[[The Kiss Hello]]\" and \"[[The Doodle]]\".\n\n==Relationships==\nJerry is notorious for his detached approach towards relationships and for breaking up with women for the slightest of flaws or for the most minor of reasons. According to the ninth-season DVD release of the series, Jerry has had 73 different girlfriends seen or alluded to over the course of the series.\n\n===Elaine===\nJerry and [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] are depicted as having dated in the past and apparently a lot longer than they each date other people in the series. During the run of the show, they are shown mainly as best friends, sometimes even joking with one another about their failed dating relationship. However, they do date briefly during the run of the show. In \"[[The Deal (Seinfeld)|The Deal]]\", they [[casual dating|create a set of rules whereby they can sleep together but remain only friends]]. However, their theory is ruined when Elaine gets upset at Jerry for wanting to leave after a sexual encounter instead of sleeping over (one of the rules they discussed was that sleeping over was optional, but not whose option it was). By the end of the episode the two decide to be a couple again. Later in \"[[The Pen]]\" Jerry tells his parents that \"we decided that we don't work out as a couple.\" That is the only time in the run of the show they are shown as anything more than friends. In \"[[The Mango]]\", Jerry is upset at learning that Elaine had faked her [[orgasm]]s while they were together. The fact cause such problems between the two, that Elaine agrees to sleep with Jerry in an effort to \"save the friendship\". The final scene, however, shows the two in bed, with Jerry looking distraught and gesturing towards his groin, suggesting that he was unable to perform. Elaine then asks if there is any mango left, with a stunned Jerry then taking some and successfully giving Elaine an orgasm off-screen.\n\nThere are hints throughout the series that suggest that Jerry and Elaine still have feelings for each other:\n*In \"[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]\", Elaine becomes jealous when Jerry flirts with another woman, Vanessa, at a party that Jerry is accompanying her to.\n*In \"[[The Tape]]\" when Jerry listens to an erotic message on his tape recorder, he becomes obsessed with finding who's the person on the tape; eventually, he pushes George into revealing that it's Elaine and it was supposed to be a joke.\n*In \"[[The Junior Mint]]\", Elaine asks Jerry to accompany her to the hospital as her boyfriend, Roy, to fool one of her ex's. Jerry smiles and responds \"Well, I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.\" At the hospital, Jerry appears annoyed when Elaine begins to show interest in her ex once again (due to her ex having lost weight), although this may be because he was bored of her ignoring him or to tease her for his own amusement.\n*In \"[[The Cadillac]]\" after Jerry buys his parents a [[Cadillac]] and Elaine realizes how much money he has, she becomes very flirtatious towards him.\n*In \"[[The Abstinence]]\" when Elaine is denying sex to her current boyfriend, Ben, in the hope that it will help him pass his medical licensing exam, she begs Jerry to have sex with her, but, after a brief moment of consideration, he turns her down.\n*In \"[[The Serenity Now]]\" when Jerry's emotions come flooding out after being locked up inside him, he confesses his love for Elaine and proposes to her. Later, the horrifying tale of George's life frightens him back into his formerly cold demeanor and he takes back his proposal, much to Elaine's dismay since she was willing to get married (even though she was initially hesitant).\n*In \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale]]\", when their plane appears to be crashing, Elaine begins saying to Jerry \"I've always loved...\", but is interrupted as the plane levels out. Later on, she claims that she intended to say \"I've always loved United Airlines.\"\n\n===Long term relationships===\nOther than Elaine, Jerry has only dated a few other women for more than one episode:\n* He starts dating Vanessa in \"[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]\" and breaks up with her in \"[[The Stock Tip]]\". They break up because of an uncomfortable weekend trip to [[Vermont]].\n* He dates Marla, a virginal woman in the closet business, in \"[[The Virgin (Seinfeld)|The Virgin]]\" and \"[[The Contest]]\" and Tia, a model, in \"[[The Airport]]\" and \"[[The Pick]]\". These relationships are atypical in that both women break up with Jerry for reasons of disgust, rather than it being the other way around.\n* He dates Dolores (whose name he forgets, guessing it to be Mulva, having the clue that it rhymes with a part of the female anatomy) in \"[[The Junior Mint]]\" and \"[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]\". (Season 4 then Season 8). This was the only time he dated a woman in two non-consecutive episodes.\n* He dated Rachel in the following episodes: \"[[The Raincoats (Seinfeld)|The Raincoats, Part I]]\" (a two-part episode), \"[[The Hamptons (Seinfeld)|The Hamptons]]\", and \"[[The Opposite]]\". Rachel ends the relationship, but Jerry, who was \"even steven\" at the time, didn't become upset, and was confident that he would find another girlfriend.\n\n===Engagements===\nOnly twice in the series has Jerry considered marriage.\n* The first time was with his \"perfect\" girlfriend, Jeannie, in the Season 7 finale, \"[[The Invitations]]\", but he soon learned that he didn't want to be with someone exactly like himself. In the first Season 8 episode, \"[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]\", Jerry tells Elaine that he had a perfectly mutual break-up with Jeannie over the summer.\n* Jerry almost got engaged a second time, to Elaine. In the Season 9 episode \"[[The Serenity Now]]\", after Jerry undergoes a personality change and becomes deeply sensitive and emotional, he proposes to a shocked Elaine. She leaves the apartment, but returns later to accept his proposal. By that point, however, he had gone back to his old self and he turns ''her'' down.\n\n===Breakups===\nJerry's approach to relationships is notoriously fickle, and he has broken up with women, or provoked them into breaking up with him for trivial reasons.\n\n*For eating her peas one at a time (\"[[The Engagement (Seinfeld)|The Engagement]]\").\n*For refusing to taste his pie at the coffee shop (\"[[The Pie]]\").\n*Because she once dated Newman (\"[[The Big Salad]]\").\n*Because she would not give him a massage (\"[[The Masseuse (Seinfeld)|The Masseuse]]\").\n*Because she got covered in toilet water after a pipe exploded (\"[[The Pothole]]\")\n*Because she liked a commercial that he hated (\"[[The Phone Message]]\").\n*Because she had large thick hands like a man's (\"[[The Bizarro Jerry]]\").\n*Because she never laughed at his jokes (\"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\").\n*Because she had an irritating laugh (\"[[The Bubble Boy (Seinfeld)|The Bubble Boy]]\").\n*Because she seemingly encouraged people to mistake her as being Chinese (\"[[The Chinese Woman]]\")\n*Because only his parents like her (\"[[The Van Buren Boys]]\")\n\nLikewise, some of Jerry's girlfriends have dumped him for trivial reasons.\n\n*Because he admitted to changing the size 32 to size 31 of all his jeans because he \"doesn't want to be a 32\" (\"[[The Sponge]]\").\n*For snooping around her closet having become suspicious of her wearing the same dress on every date (\"[[The Seven]]\").\n*Because he is caught spitting out fatty meats his girlfriend cooked for him in to napkins after going on a health kick (\"[[The Wink (Seinfeld)|The Wink]]\").\n*Because she discovered he'd been getting her drunk so he and his friends could play with her collection of antique toys (\"[[The Merv Griffin Show (Seinfeld)|The Merv Griffin Show]]\").\n*Because he refuses to use her toothbrush (\"[[The Doodle]]\")\n*Because he cheats on his pretend-wife to give another woman his family dry-cleaning discount (\"[[The Wife (Seinfeld)|The Wife]]\").\n*Because she thinks she saw him pick his nose, when Jerry was in fact only scratching it from the side (\"[[The Pick]]\").\n*Because she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny and refuses to date someone whose work she does not respect (\"[[The Ex-Girlfriend]]\").\n\nIn \"[[The Invitations]]\", Jerry and his fianc\u00e9e had what he described as \"the world's first truly mutual breakup\" after she acted in the same manner as him, noting \"I can't be with somebody like me. I hate myself.\"\n\n===Guest star girlfriends===\nThe following celebrities starred as Jerry's girlfriend or romantic interest:\n*[[Teri Hatcher]] in \"[[The Implant]]\" and in \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale]]\".\n*[[Marcia Cross]] in \"[[The Slicer]]\".\n*[[Courteney Cox]] in \"[[The Wife (Seinfeld)|The Wife]]\".\n*[[Jami Gertz]] in \"[[The Stall]]\".\n*[[Jane Leeves]] in \"[[The Virgin (Seinfeld)|The Virgin]]\", \"[[The Contest]]\", and \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale]]\".\n*[[Jennifer Coolidge]] in \"[[The Masseuse (Seinfeld)|The Masseuse]]\".\n*[[Janeane Garofalo]] in \"[[The Invitations]]\".\n*[[Kristin Davis]] in \"[[The Pothole]]\" and \"[[The Butter Shave]]\".\n*[[Amanda Peet]] in \"[[The Summer of George]]\".\n*[[Marlee Matlin]] in \"[[The Lip Reader]]\".\n*[[Catherine Keener]] in \"[[The Letter (Seinfeld)|The Letter]]\".\n*[[Debra Messing]] in \"[[The Wait Out]]\" and in \"[[The Yada Yada]]\".\n*[[Christine Taylor]] in \"[[The Van Buren Boys]]\".\n*[[Lauren Graham]] in \"[[The Millennium (Seinfeld)|The Millennium]]\".\n*[[Lori Loughlin]] in \"[[The Serenity Now]]\".\n*[[Melinda Clarke]] in \"[[The Muffin Tops]]\".\n*[[Mariska Hargitay]] in \"[[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|The Pilot]]\"\n*[[A. J. Langer]] in \"[[The Fatigues]]\"\n*[[Paula Marshall]] in \"[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]\"\n*[[Anna Gunn]] in \"[[The Glasses]]\"\n*[[Ali Wentworth]] in \"[[The Soup Nazi]]\".\n\n===Newman===\nJerry has a long-running hatred of [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], describing him as his \"sworn enemy\" in \"[[The Andrea Doria (Seinfeld)|The Andrea Doria]]\" and showing general contempt for him at their every meeting. Newman usually reciprocates, although at other times he seems quite pleased by Jerry's hostility, as if it is a testimony to his effectiveness at irritating him. The origin of their feud is never explained.\n\nJerry's snide greeting for him with \"Hello, Newman\" (in response to Newman's \"Hello, Jerry\") becomes a trademark of their relationship. Even Jerry's mother utters the greeting, with as much displeasure as Jerry, in \"[[The Raincoats (Seinfeld)|The Raincoats, Part II]]\". Jerry wants to be rid of Newman so badly that he once even helped him on his postal route so that he could get a prized transfer to [[Hawaii]] (\"[[The Andrea Doria (Seinfeld)|The Andrea Doria]]\").\n\nDespite their antagonistic relationship, Jerry and Newman have ended up working in unison on rare occasions. In \"[[The Sniffing Accountant]]\", Jerry worked with Kramer and Newman to find out if their accountant was on drugs. In \"[[The Soul Mate]]\", Jerry and Newman help each other with their romance problems. Newman told Jerry about Kramer's crush on his then-girlfriend, Pam, while Jerry helps Newman get a chance to date Elaine.\n\nCertain instances would even define their relationship as one of friendship, or at least mutual tolerance, built around their shared friend, Kramer. In \"[[The Pick]]\", Jerry casually walks over to Newman's apartment and brings him back to his own, to examine Elaine's Christmas card. Newman apparently puts up little fight and doesn't make any sarcastic remarks, then leaves without a confrontation. In \"[[The Old Man (Seinfeld)|The Old Man]]\", Jerry says \"my friends\" in reference to Kramer and Newman and in \"[[The Bottle Deposit]]\" he has no qualms about leaving Kramer and Newman alone in his apartment, trusting they'll \"keep an eye on one another.\" In \"[[The Barber (Seinfeld)|The Barber]]\", Jerry allows Newman to use his bathroom, albeit reluctantly, and even watches ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' with him.\n\n==Career and finances==\nJerry is very successful financially, and occupationally stable in comparison with his friends (and perhaps with other stand-up comedians in general). He never seems to be at a loss for money, in comparison to both George and Elaine, whose careers go through both highs and lows but are often unsuccessful or short of money. Throughout the series Jerry suffers numerous financial and material losses, but these do not seem to have long-term impacts on his situation. Examples include:\n\n*Jerry buys his father a [[Cadillac Fleetwood]]<ref name=\"The Cadillac\"/> and buys it ''back'' after his parents sell it, spending over $20,000. Jerry himself seems to only drive luxury European makes, such as a [[BMW]] 5 Series<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Smelly Car|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= April 15, 1993|season=4|number=21}}</ref> and a [[Saab Automobile|SAAB]] 900 Convertible, although in early episodes such as \"[[The Ex-Girlfriend]]\", he drives a mid-1970s American coupe, and also a [[Ford Econoline]] [[conversion van]] in \"[[The Junk Mail]]\". In \"[[The Apartment (Seinfeld)|The Apartment]]\", it is revealed that Jerry could easily lend Elaine $5,000 for an apartment. Also, Jerry is regularly called upon to pay the check for the group at Monk's and allows Kramer to depend on him for food. Despite his apparent financial security, his parents seem to think he needs money, offering to pay for everything when they visit him (even if they have no money, as seen in \"[[The Watch (Seinfeld)|The Watch]]\") and occasionally urging him to find a new job.\n*In \"[[The Checks]]\", Jerry is revealed to be famous in [[Japan]] where he appears in the opening montage of Japanese TV's \"Super Terrific Happy Hour\" and he even continues to earn royalties from each appearance (although each royalty check is only for twelve cents, due to the heavy difference between the worth of Japanese and American currency.)\n*Jerry spends most of the series making a living from stand-up comedy, except for the periods when he and George co-write their own [[sitcom]]. Jerry also acts in the pilot episode of their show \"Jerry\", playing himself.\n*Twice, Jerry is encouraged to switch to a career at [[Bloomingdale's]] in their Executive Training Program. First his parents suggest it after he bounces a check;<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Checks|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= November 7, 1996|season=8|number=7}}</ref> then in another episode, George and Kramer suggest it after he starts dating a \"loser\".<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Van Buren Boys|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= February 6, 1997|season=8|number=14}}</ref>\n\nWhile Jerry's career is successful and his opening and closing stand-up bits always go as planned, his stand-up performances depicted within the show occasionally go awry.\n\n*In \"[[The Red Dot]]\", an inebriated club patron cuts Jerry's stand-up short over the usage of the phrases \"on the wagon\" and \"off the wagon\".\n*In \"[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip, Part I]]\", the hotel [[maid|chambermaid]] throws Jerry's notes away causing him to stumble and bumble his way through a performance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.\n*In \"[[The Fire (Seinfeld)|The Fire]]\", Jerry is thrown off his act by Kramer's girlfriend Toby, who heckles him and later sees his entire crowd run for the exits when George screams \"he's got a gun!\" when referring to a prop comic.\n*In \"[[The Diplomat's Club]]\", Jerry's manager warns him that the pilot of the plane in which he flew to the show in was in the audience. Jerry tells that there is no way that could bother him but when he takes the stage, he can't stop looking at the pilot.\n*In \"[[The Abstinence]]\", Jerry is twice bumped from playing an assembly at his old middle-school. When he finally takes the stage, he's promptly booed for his opening act about homework. [[David Letterman]] later calls him to bump him from the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' due to the poor middle-school performance.\n*In \"[[The Butter Shave]]\", Jerry intentionally performs hackneyed comedy material in a successful attempt to prove that, without his warming up the audience first, Kenny Bania, who performs following him, will not get any laughs.\n*In \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale, Part II]]\", Jerry performs stand-up for his fellow inmates in jail but gets no laughs, except from Kramer, and is heckled and threatened by one of the prisoners.\n\n==Cleanliness==\nJerry has an obsessive insistence on cleanliness and neatness.\n\n*In \"[[The Pothole]]\", Jerry inadvertently knocks his girlfriend's toothbrush into the toilet bowl, and after she uses it, he is unable to bring himself to kiss her. As revenge, she proceeds to put one item of his in the toilet without telling him what it was; a distraught Jerry, thinking it could be anything, ends up throwing away virtually every item in his apartment in panic. Upon learning it was the toilet brush, he reassures himself that it can be replaced (his girlfriend is later bombarded with toilet water following a plumbing accident in her bathroom, causing him to break up with her). [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] says that in some instances, his cleanliness can verge into a [[Mysophobia|serious disorder]].\n*In \"\"[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]\", Jerry comments that most people think he's [[gay]] because he's \"thin and neat\".\n*In \"[[The Statue (Seinfeld)|The Statue]]\", he is delighted to find how thorough his new cleaner has been, to the extent of [[Coagulation|decoagulating]] the dried matter from the nozzle of his bottle of [[dishwashing liquid]].\n*In \"[[The Voice (Seinfeld)|The Voice]]\", he throws out a belt because it touched the edge of a urinal.\n*In \"[[The Butter Shave]]\", he throws out a shoelace because it touched the floor of a public bathroom.\n*In \"[[The Couch (Seinfeld)|The Couch]]\", after Poppie's gastro-intestinal disorder causes him to urinate on Jerry's couch, Jerry, rather than having the cushion cleaned, gives the couch away.\n*In \"[[The Blood (Seinfeld)|The Blood]]\", when Kramer announces that he moved his blood from the blood bank into the building, Jerry panics until Kramer tells him that the blood is in his apartment. Jerry tells him that if any blood gets into his apartment he will \"freak out\". Later when Kramer's freezer breaks, Jerry freaks out again, checking his freezer for the blood, thinking that the bowl of jello and the jug of tomato juice is blood. Kramer proceeds to drink the juice, causing Jerry to freak out even more.\n* In \"[[The Pie]]\", Jerry is horrified when Poppie neglects to wash his hands after using the bathroom and refuses to eat the food Poppie prepares for him.\n* In \"[[The Apology (Seinfeld)|The Apology]]\", while Elaine is talking to Jerry about a [[Mysophobia|germaphobic]] woman in her office, Jerry starts meticulously cleaning a spot where Kramer spilled soda. Elaine says about the woman, with implied commentary about Jerry, that she is probably \"one of those neurotic clean freaks\".\n* In \"[[The Chinese Woman]]\", Jerry almost gets into a state of panic when he finds out that [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] is not wearing any underwear.\n* In \"[[The Limo (Seinfeld)|The Limo]]\", Elaine corrects someone who has misidentified Jerry as a [[Nazism|Nazi]], explaining that \"he's just neat.\"\n* In \"[[The Implant]]\", a girlfriend of his comments that \"he would have made a great [[Nazism|Nazi]]\" because \"everything has to be just so\".\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2007, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' placed the Jerry Seinfeld character eighth on their list of the \"50 Greatest TV icons\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20152957_20152958_20159773_42,00.html |title=The 50 Greatest TV Icons |accessdate=2008-05-13|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619120647/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0%2C%2C20152957_20152958_20159773_42%2C00.html |archivedate=June 19, 2007 }}</ref> For his portrayal, Jerry Seinfeld was nominated four times for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], out of which he won one,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29226|title=Jerry Seinfeld awards for Golden Globe|publisher=[[Golden Globe Award]]s|accessdate=2015-02-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013052703/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29226|archivedate=2012-10-13}}</ref> along with being nominated five times for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]], for which he never won.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Seinfeld}}\n{{Jerry Seinfeld}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seinfeld, Jerry}}\n[[Category:Fictional American Jews]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Fictional comedians]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of actors]]\n[[Category:Seinfeld characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| name               = '''Jerry Seinfeld'''\n| series             = [[Seinfeld]]\n| image              = \n| first              = \"[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]\"\n| last               = \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale, Part II]]\"\n| creator            = [[Jerry Seinfeld]]<br>[[Larry David]]\n| portrayer          = Jerry Seinfeld\n| species            = [[Human]]\n| occupation         = Comedian\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = Morty Seinfeld (father)<br>Helen Seinfeld (mother) <br> Unnamed sister\n| relatives          = [[Uncle Leo|Leo]] (uncle) <br>Mac (uncle)<br>Stella (aunt)<br>Silvia (aunt)<br>Rose (aunt)<br>Jeffery (cousin)<br>Artie (cousin)<br>Douglass (cousins)<br>Nana (grandmother)<br>Unnamed grandfather (deceased)\n| religion           = [[Judaism]]\n| nationality        = [[United States|American]]\n}}\n\n'''Jerome''' \"'''Jerry'''\" '''Seinfeld''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|a\u026a|n|f|\u025b|l|d}}; {{respell|SYNE|feld}}) is the [[title character]] and the [[main protagonist]] of the [[United States|American]] [[television program|television]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' ([[1989 in television|1989]]\u2013[[1998 in television|1998]]). The [[double act|straight man]] among his group of friends, this semi-[[character (arts)|fictionalized]] version of [[comedian]] [[Jerry Seinfeld]] was named after, co-created by, based on, and played by Seinfeld himself. The series revolves around Jerry's misadventures with his best friend [[George Costanza]], neighbor [[Cosmo Kramer]], and ex-girlfriend [[Elaine Benes]]. He is usually the voice of reason amidst his friends' antics and the focal point of the relationship.\n\nAn eternal [[optimism|optimist]], he rarely runs into major personal problems. Jerry is the only main character on the show to maintain the same career (a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], like the real Seinfeld) throughout the series. He is the most [[observational comedy|observational character]], sarcastically commenting on his friends' quirky habits. Much of the show's action takes place in Jerry's apartment located in New York City at 129 West 81st Street, apartment 5A.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Alternate Side|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= December 4, 1991|season=3|number=11}}</ref>  He and his friends also frequently have coffee or meals together at [[Monk's Caf\u00e9]].\n\nJerry appeared in all 180 episodes of ''Seinfeld'' (including several two-part episodes) and is the only character in the show to appear in every episode.<ref>Neither George nor Kramer appear in \"[[The Pen]]\"; Elaine does not appear in [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot]], \"[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip, Part I]]\" and \"[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip, Part II]]\"; Kramer also does not appear in \"[[The Chinese Restaurant]]\".</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nIn the show's setting, Jerry is the [[straight man]], a figure who is \"[[Everyman|able to observe the chaos around him but not always be a part of it]].\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml BBC Comedy Guide: Seinfeld]</ref> Plot lines involving Jerry often concern his various relationships \u2013 Jerry often finds \"stupid reasons to break up\" with women; which, according to Elaine, occurs \"every week.\"\n\nJerry is generally completely indifferent to what goes on in his friends' lives, seeing their misery as merely an entertaining distraction, as well as an opportunity for joke material. He often plays along with their hare-brained schemes, even encouraging them, often just to see them fail. In the episode \"[[The Serenity Now]]\", Jerry is perplexed by his experience of crying, asking \"What is this salty discharge?\".<ref name=\"theserenitynow\">{{Cite episode|title=The Serenity Now|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= October 9, 1997|season=9|number=3}}</ref> In \"[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]\" Elaine points out that he has \"never felt remorse,\" to which Jerry replies, \"Yeah, I feel kinda bad about that.\"<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Foundation|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= September 19, 1996|season=8|number=1}}</ref> He will often nonchalantly state, \"That's a shame\" when something bad happens (often due to his or his friends' actions). A recurring joke is Jerry behaving unchivalrously towards Elaine, such as not helping her carry groceries or heavy objects, ignoring her when she is upset, and on one occasion taking a first class upgrade on a flight for himself, leaving Elaine in economy. Jerry, George and Elaine all share a general trait of not letting go of other character's remarks and going to great lengths to be proven right. In one episode, Jerry goes out of his way to rent a house in [[Tuscany]], just because Elaine's boyfriend told him there weren't any available.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Maestro|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= October 5, 1995|season=7|number=3}}</ref> Another example is when he buys his parents the same car over and over again, at great financial loss.<ref name=\"The Cadillac\">{{Cite episode|title=The Cadillac|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= February 8, 1996|season=7|number=14}}</ref>\n\nDespite his usual indifference to his friends and their actions, Jerry apparently is very satisfied with his life, to the point that he actually feels worried about anything that might threaten the group lifestyle. In \"[[The Invitations]]\", for example, Jerry admits that he feels depressed about George getting married, seeing as how George will eventually leave the group and Jerry will never see him again. Once Elaine told him that she was also \"getting out\" of the group, Jerry became so worried about a near future of just him and Kramer that he unknowingly almost walked into a car while crossing the street. In \"[[The Bizarro Jerry]]\", Jerry also grows panicky about losing the group dynamic when Kramer becomes too busy with his fake job and Elaine temporarily leaves to join the Bizarro group, claiming that \"The whole system's breaking down!\" Jerry himself perfectly sums up his relation to his three friends in the episode \"[[The Letter (Seinfeld)|The Letter]]\". In a deleted scene from that show, he claims that his friends are \"not more important\" than his girlfriends, but \"they're as important.\"\n\nUnlike George and Elaine, Jerry rarely runs into major personal problems. In \"[[The Opposite]]\", this tendency is explicitly pointed out, as Jerry goes through a number of experiences after which he invariably \"breaks even\", even as his friends are going through intense periods of success or failure. Even when Elaine threw Jerry's $20 bill out of the window, he unexpectedly found one in his coat pocket, evening out his luck. In \"[[The Rye]]\", during a particularly trying time for Elaine, she angrily tells Jerry, \"You know, one of these days, something terrible is going to happen to you. It ''has'' to!\" Jerry simply replies, \"No, I'm going to be just fine.\" Many of the problems he does run into are the result of the actions of his nemesis [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], a disgruntled postal worker. In \"[[The Old Man (Seinfeld)|The Old Man]]\", George asks \"What kind of a person are you?\" in which Jerry replies \"I think I'm pretty much like you, only successful.\"\n\nHowever, Kramer persuades Jerry to do things that he's reluctant to do. In \"[[The Mango]]\", Kramer gets Jerry to buy fruit for him after Kramer is banned from the store over an argument with the owner. This continues until the owner bans Jerry, because his order is similar enough to Kramer's that it's obvious he's buying fruit for Kramer. The most famous example is in \"[[The Chicken Roaster]]\" in which Kramer and Jerry exchange apartments. This results in the two of them also switching personalities. In several arguments with Jerry, Kramer is incredibly stubborn, protecting his own interests. Examples of this include arguments in \"[[The Chaperone (Seinfeld)|The Chaperone]]\", \"[[The Face Painter]]\" and \"[[The Caddy (Seinfeld)|The Caddy]]\". Probably the only exception is \"[[The Kiss Hello]]\" in which Kramer kissed Jerry as George walked in.\n\nJerry always wears a suit whenever he has to do his stand-up comedy act. In a few cases, Jerry wears an unusual item of clothing. Kramer has persuaded Jerry to wear the \"[[Poet shirt|pirate shirt]]\" in \"[[The Puffy Shirt]]\", the cowboy boots in \"[[The Mom & Pop Store]]\" and the fur coat in \"[[The Reverse Peephole]]\". Like George, Jerry's hairstyle remains relatively the same throughout the series, though the length and thickness of it alters, especially from Season 3 onwards. There is one noticeable episode in which Jerry receives a bad haircut when he reluctantly agrees to get his hair done by an incompetent Italian barber in \"[[The Barber (Seinfeld)|The Barber]]\".\n\nAs in real life, Jerry is a fan of comic book characters, particularly of [[Superman]], who is his hero. As far as sports, Jerry is a fan of the [[New York Mets]] as evidenced as early as the episode \"[[The Baby Shower (Seinfeld)|The Baby Shower]]\" in which Kramer persuades him to install illegal cable by saying \"The Mets have 75 games on cable this year.\" Jerry is also a fan of the [[New York Yankees]], the [[New York Knicks]], the [[New York Giants]], the [[New York Rangers]], and even the [[Chicago Cubs]]. In early episodes, a [[New York Yankees]] hat sits on the counter near his computer. Later on, by the middle of Season 3, it was replaced with a Mets cap, possibly to better reflect Seinfeld's real-life support of the Queens side. While a Mets fan, he has once attended a Yankees games (in the sixth season). In the [[The Chaperone (Seinfeld)|first episode]] of Season 6 and the [[The Engagement (Seinfeld)|first episode]] of Season 7, Jerry is shown watching a Yankees game with George.\n\nJerry never smokes a cigarette but is seen smoking a cigar in \"[[The Calzone]]\", \"[[The Wizard (Seinfeld)|The Wizard]]\" and \"[[The Voice (Seinfeld)|The Voice]]\". Jerry also does not appear to have any particular interest in [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] as he is rarely seen drinking beer or any other alcoholic beverage; however, he is seen drinking beer with George once in \"[[The Shower Head]]\", wine at various meals, and keeps a bottle of Hennigan's scotch in his apartment, though he claims that he only uses it as a [[paint thinner]].<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Red Dot|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= December 11, 1991|season=3|number=12}}</ref>\nHe is also seen doing a shot of Hennigans during season 3 episode 12 \u2018The Red Dot\u2019 when he is trying to lie for George\u2019s tight spending habits relating to a gift he bought for Elaine\n\n==Background==\nJerry and George grew up in [[New York City]]. George recalls in \"[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]\" that the two were friends ever since an encounter in gym class in their school days. In \"[[The Betrayal (Seinfeld)|The Betrayal]]\", Jerry mentions that he once beat George up in the fourth grade. Flashbacks in episodes such as \"[[The Library (Seinfeld)|The Library]]\" portray Jerry and George in high school. A pizza place which they frequented is portrayed in \"[[The Frogger]]\". Jerry and George attended school together at [[Edward R. Murrow High School|Edward R. Murrow Middle School]], [[John F. Kennedy High School (New York City)|John F. Kennedy High School]] and [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]].<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Marine Biologist| series= Seinfeld| network= [[NBC]]|airdate= February 10, 1994|season=5|number=14}}</ref>\n\nAfter college, Jerry briefly worked as an [[umbrella]] salesman and claims to have invented the \"twirl\" to make the umbrella look more attractive. He eventually quit the job in order to focus more on his comedy career.\n\n==Family==\nJerry's parents are Morty and Helen Seinfeld, a retired [[American Jews|Jewish]] couple living in [[Florida]]. Unlike George, who usually can't stand his parents, Jerry gets along reasonably well with his parents, but he still prefers they live in Florida rather than New York, so that they do not interfere with his private life (a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d). Although born and raised [[Jews|Jewish]] and he considers himself a Jew, Jerry apparently does not practice and generally does not observe many traditions. In \"[[The Bris]]\", he implies he is circumcised, repeatedly asking people if they have \"ever seen one\" - in reference to an uncircumcised penis. He also mentions having a sister in the episode \"[[The Chinese Restaurant]]\", though she is never named, never appears on screen, and is never mentioned again after this episode. In order to avoid his old friend Joel in \"[[Male Unbonding]]\", Jerry pretends to have promised to tutor his nephew; it is unclear if the nephew really exists or is simply fabricated as part of the excuse.\n\nJerry has an eccentric uncle, [[Uncle Leo|Leo]], who appears in 15 episodes. Uncle Leo has a son, Cousin Jeffrey, who works for the parks department, about whom he constantly talks, but who never appears. In \"[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]\", Jerry speaks to an \"Uncle Mac\", as well as a cousin \"Artie Levine\". In \"[[The Truth (Seinfeld)|The Truth]]\", Jerry mentions a cousin named \"Douglass\" who has an addiction with [[Pepsi]]. In \"[[The Pony Remark]]\", Helen, Morty, Jerry, Elaine and Leo attend a 50th-anniversary party for Manya and Isaac, an elderly couple whose relationship to Jerry is never explicitly defined. Manya is described as a [[Poland|Polish]] immigrant. In the same episode, Jerry references having an \"Aunt Rose\", and Helen mentions a family member named \"Claire\" who is getting married. In \"[[The Soup (Seinfeld)|The Soup]]\" episode, Jerry mentions an \"Aunt Silvia\", who he compares to Elaine in terms of conversation.\n\nJerry's maternal grandmother, Nana, is an elderly woman with memory problems, occasionally unable to tell the past from the present, living alone in the city. Nana makes appearances in \"[[The Pledge Drive]]\", \"[[The Kiss Hello]]\" and \"[[The Doodle]]\".\n\n==Relationships==\nJerry is notorious for his detached approach towards relationships and for breaking up with women for the slightest of flaws or for the most minor of reasons. According to the ninth-season DVD release of the series, Jerry has had 73 different girlfriends seen or alluded to over the course of the series.\n\n===Elaine===\nJerry and [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] are depicted as having dated in the past and apparently a lot longer than they each date other people in the series. During the run of the show, they are shown mainly as best friends, sometimes even joking with one another about their failed dating relationship. However, they do date briefly during the run of the show. In \"[[The Deal (Seinfeld)|The Deal]]\", they [[casual dating|create a set of rules whereby they can sleep together but remain only friends]]. However, their theory is ruined when Elaine gets upset at Jerry for wanting to leave after a sexual encounter instead of sleeping over (one of the rules they discussed was that sleeping over was optional, but not whose option it was). By the end of the episode the two decide to be a couple again. Later in \"[[The Pen]]\" Jerry tells his parents that \"we decided that we don't work out as a couple.\" That is the only time in the run of the show they are shown as anything more than friends. In \"[[The Mango]]\", Jerry is upset at learning that Elaine had faked her [[orgasm]]s while they were together. The fact cause such problems between the two, that Elaine agrees to sleep with Jerry in an effort to \"save the friendship\". The final scene, however, shows the two in bed, with Jerry looking distraught and gesturing towards his groin, suggesting that he was unable to perform. Elaine then asks if there is any mango left, with a stunned Jerry then taking some and successfully giving Elaine an orgasm off-screen.\n\nThere are hints throughout the series that suggest that Jerry and Elaine still have feelings for each other:\n*In \"[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]\", Elaine becomes jealous when Jerry flirts with another woman, Vanessa, at a party that Jerry is accompanying her to.\n*In \"[[The Tape]]\" when Jerry listens to an erotic message on his tape recorder, he becomes obsessed with finding who's the person on the tape; eventually, he pushes George into revealing that it's Elaine and it was supposed to be a joke.\n*In \"[[The Junior Mint]]\", Elaine asks Jerry to accompany her to the hospital as her boyfriend, Roy, to fool one of her ex's. Jerry smiles and responds \"Well, I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.\" At the hospital, Jerry appears annoyed when Elaine begins to show interest in her ex once again (due to her ex having lost weight), although this may be because he was bored of her ignoring him or to tease her for his own amusement.\n*In \"[[The Cadillac]]\" after Jerry buys his parents a [[Cadillac]] and Elaine realizes how much money he has, she becomes very flirtatious towards him.\n*In \"[[The Abstinence]]\" when Elaine is denying sex to her current boyfriend, Ben, in the hope that it will help him pass his medical licensing exam, she begs Jerry to have sex with her, but, after a brief moment of consideration, he turns her down.\n*In \"[[The Serenity Now]]\" when Jerry's emotions come flooding out after being locked up inside him, he confesses his love for Elaine and proposes to her. Later, the horrifying tale of George's life frightens him back into his formerly cold demeanor and he takes back his proposal, much to Elaine's dismay since she was willing to get married (even though she was initially hesitant).\n*In \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale]]\", when their plane appears to be crashing, Elaine begins saying to Jerry \"I've always loved...\", but is interrupted as the plane levels out. Later on, she claims that she intended to say \"I've always loved United Airlines.\"\n\n===Long term relationships===\nOther than Elaine, Jerry has only dated a few other women for more than one episode:\n* He starts dating Vanessa in \"[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]\" and breaks up with her in \"[[The Stock Tip]]\". They break up because of an uncomfortable weekend trip to [[Vermont]].\n* He dates Marla, a virginal woman in the closet business, in \"[[The Virgin (Seinfeld)|The Virgin]]\" and \"[[The Contest]]\" and Tia, a model, in \"[[The Airport]]\" and \"[[The Pick]]\". These relationships are atypical in that both women break up with Jerry for reasons of disgust, rather than it being the other way around.\n* He dates Dolores (whose name he forgets, guessing it to be Mulva, having the clue that it rhymes with a part of the female anatomy) in \"[[The Junior Mint]]\" and \"[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]\". (Season 4 then Season 8). This was the only time he dated a woman in two non-consecutive episodes.\n* He dated Rachel in the following episodes: \"[[The Raincoats (Seinfeld)|The Raincoats, Part I]]\" (a two-part episode), \"[[The Hamptons (Seinfeld)|The Hamptons]]\", and \"[[The Opposite]]\". Rachel ends the relationship, but Jerry, who was \"even steven\" at the time, didn't become upset, and was confident that he would find another girlfriend.\n\n===Engagements===\nOnly twice in the series has Jerry considered marriage.\n* The first time was with his \"perfect\" girlfriend, Jeannie, in the Season 7 finale, \"[[The Invitations]]\", but he soon learned that he didn't want to be with someone exactly like himself. In the first Season 8 episode, \"[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]\", Jerry tells Elaine that he had a perfectly mutual break-up with Jeannie over the summer.\n* Jerry almost got engaged a second time, to Elaine. In the Season 9 episode \"[[The Serenity Now]]\", after Jerry undergoes a personality change and becomes deeply sensitive and emotional, he proposes to a shocked Elaine. She leaves the apartment, but returns later to accept his proposal. By that point, however, he had gone back to his old self and he turns ''her'' down.\n\n===Breakups===\nJerry's approach to relationships is notoriously fickle, and he has broken up with women, or provoked them into breaking up with him for trivial reasons.\n\n*For eating her peas one at a time (\"[[The Engagement (Seinfeld)|The Engagement]]\").\n*For refusing to taste his pie at the coffee shop (\"[[The Pie]]\").\n*Because she once dated Newman (\"[[The Big Salad]]\").\n*Because she would not give him a massage (\"[[The Masseuse (Seinfeld)|The Masseuse]]\").\n*Because she got covered in toilet water after a pipe exploded (\"[[The Pothole]]\")\n*Because she liked a commercial that he hated (\"[[The Phone Message]]\").\n*Because she had large thick hands like a man's (\"[[The Bizarro Jerry]]\").\n*Because she never laughed at his jokes (\"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\").\n*Because she had an irritating laugh (\"[[The Bubble Boy (Seinfeld)|The Bubble Boy]]\").\n*Because she seemingly encouraged people to mistake her as being Chinese (\"[[The Chinese Woman]]\")\n*Because only his parents like her (\"[[The Van Buren Boys]]\")\n\nLikewise, some of Jerry's girlfriends have dumped him for trivial reasons.\n\n*Because he admitted to changing the size 32 to size 31 of all his jeans because he \"doesn't want to be a 32\" (\"[[The Sponge]]\").\n*For snooping around her closet having become suspicious of her wearing the same dress on every date (\"[[The Seven]]\").\n*Because he is caught spitting out fatty meats his girlfriend cooked for him in to napkins after going on a health kick (\"[[The Wink (Seinfeld)|The Wink]]\").\n*Because she discovered he'd been getting her drunk so he and his friends could play with her collection of antique toys (\"[[The Merv Griffin Show (Seinfeld)|The Merv Griffin Show]]\").\n*Because he refuses to use her toothbrush (\"[[The Doodle]]\")\n*Because he cheats on his pretend-wife to give another woman his family dry-cleaning discount (\"[[The Wife (Seinfeld)|The Wife]]\").\n*Because she thinks she saw him pick his nose, when Jerry was in fact only scratching it from the side (\"[[The Pick]]\").\n*Because she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny and refuses to date someone whose work she does not respect (\"[[The Ex-Girlfriend]]\").\n\nIn \"[[The Invitations]]\", Jerry and his fianc\u00e9e had what he described as \"the world's first truly mutual breakup\" after she acted in the same manner as him, noting \"I can't be with somebody like me. I hate myself.\"\n\n===Guest star girlfriends===\nThe following celebrities starred as Jerry's girlfriend or romantic interest:\n*[[Teri Hatcher]] in \"[[The Implant]]\" and in \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale]]\".\n*[[Marcia Cross]] in \"[[The Slicer]]\".\n*[[Courteney Cox]] in \"[[The Wife (Seinfeld)|The Wife]]\".\n*[[Jami Gertz]] in \"[[The Stall]]\".\n*[[Jane Leeves]] in \"[[The Virgin (Seinfeld)|The Virgin]]\", \"[[The Contest]]\", and \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale]]\".\n*[[Jennifer Coolidge]] in \"[[The Masseuse (Seinfeld)|The Masseuse]]\".\n*[[Janeane Garofalo]] in \"[[The Invitations]]\".\n*[[Kristin Davis]] in \"[[The Pothole]]\" and \"[[The Butter Shave]]\".\n*[[Amanda Peet]] in \"[[The Summer of George]]\".\n*[[Marlee Matlin]] in \"[[The Lip Reader]]\".\n*[[Catherine Keener]] in \"[[The Letter (Seinfeld)|The Letter]]\".\n*[[Debra Messing]] in \"[[The Wait Out]]\" and in \"[[The Yada Yada]]\".\n*[[Christine Taylor]] in \"[[The Van Buren Boys]]\".\n*[[Lauren Graham]] in \"[[The Millennium (Seinfeld)|The Millennium]]\".\n*[[Lori Loughlin]] in \"[[The Serenity Now]]\".\n*[[Melinda Clarke]] in \"[[The Muffin Tops]]\".\n*[[Mariska Hargitay]] in \"[[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|The Pilot]]\"\n*[[A. J. Langer]] in \"[[The Fatigues]]\"\n*[[Paula Marshall]] in \"[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]\"\n*[[Anna Gunn]] in \"[[The Glasses]]\"\n*[[Ali Wentworth]] in \"[[The Soup Nazi]]\".\n\n===Newman===\nJerry has a long-running hatred of [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], describing him as his \"sworn enemy\" in \"[[The Andrea Doria (Seinfeld)|The Andrea Doria]]\" and showing general contempt for him at their every meeting. Newman usually reciprocates, although at other times he seems quite pleased by Jerry's hostility, as if it is a testimony to his effectiveness at irritating him. The origin of their feud is never explained.\n\nJerry's snide greeting for him with \"Hello, Newman\" (in response to Newman's \"Hello, Jerry\") becomes a trademark of their relationship. Even Jerry's mother utters the greeting, with as much displeasure as Jerry, in \"[[The Raincoats (Seinfeld)|The Raincoats, Part II]]\". Jerry wants to be rid of Newman so badly that he once even helped him on his postal route so that he could get a prized transfer to [[Hawaii]] (\"[[The Andrea Doria (Seinfeld)|The Andrea Doria]]\").\n\nDespite their antagonistic relationship, Jerry and Newman have ended up working in unison on rare occasions. In \"[[The Sniffing Accountant]]\", Jerry worked with Kramer and Newman to find out if their accountant was on drugs. In \"[[The Soul Mate]]\", Jerry and Newman help each other with their romance problems. Newman told Jerry about Kramer's crush on his then-girlfriend, Pam, while Jerry helps Newman get a chance to date Elaine.\n\nCertain instances would even define their relationship as one of friendship, or at least mutual tolerance, built around their shared friend, Kramer. In \"[[The Pick]]\", Jerry casually walks over to Newman's apartment and brings him back to his own, to examine Elaine's Christmas card. Newman apparently puts up little fight and doesn't make any sarcastic remarks, then leaves without a confrontation. In \"[[The Old Man (Seinfeld)|The Old Man]]\", Jerry says \"my friends\" in reference to Kramer and Newman and in \"[[The Bottle Deposit]]\" he has no qualms about leaving Kramer and Newman alone in his apartment, trusting they'll \"keep an eye on one another.\" In \"[[The Barber (Seinfeld)|The Barber]]\", Jerry allows Newman to use his bathroom, albeit reluctantly, and even watches ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' with him.\n\n==Career and finances==\nJerry is very successful financially, and occupationally stable in comparison with his friends (and perhaps with other stand-up comedians in general). He never seems to be at a loss for money, in comparison to both George and Elaine, whose careers go through both highs and lows but are often unsuccessful or short of money. Throughout the series Jerry suffers numerous financial and material losses, but these do not seem to have long-term impacts on his situation. Examples include:\n\n*Jerry buys his father a [[Cadillac Fleetwood]]<ref name=\"The Cadillac\"/> and buys it ''back'' after his parents sell it, spending over $20,000. Jerry himself seems to only drive luxury European makes, such as a [[BMW]] 5 Series<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Smelly Car|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= April 15, 1993|season=4|number=21}}</ref> and a [[Saab Automobile|SAAB]] 900 Convertible, although in early episodes such as \"[[The Ex-Girlfriend]]\", he drives a mid-1970s American coupe, and also a [[Ford Econoline]] [[conversion van]] in \"[[The Junk Mail]]\". In \"[[The Apartment (Seinfeld)|The Apartment]]\", it is revealed that Jerry could easily lend Elaine $5,000 for an apartment. Also, Jerry is regularly called upon to pay the check for the group at Monk's and allows Kramer to depend on him for food. Despite his apparent financial security, his parents seem to think he needs money, offering to pay for everything when they visit him (even if they have no money, as seen in \"[[The Watch (Seinfeld)|The Watch]]\") and occasionally urging him to find a new job.\n*In \"[[The Checks]]\", Jerry is revealed to be famous in [[Japan]] where he appears in the opening montage of Japanese TV's \"Super Terrific Happy Hour\" and he even continues to earn royalties from each appearance (although each royalty check is only for twelve cents, due to the heavy difference between the worth of Japanese and American currency.)\n*Jerry spends most of the series making a living from stand-up comedy, except for the periods when he and George co-write their own [[sitcom]]. Jerry also acts in the pilot episode of their show \"Jerry\", playing himself.\n*Twice, Jerry is encouraged to switch to a career at [[Bloomingdale's]] in their Executive Training Program. First his parents suggest it after he bounces a check;<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Checks|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= November 7, 1996|season=8|number=7}}</ref> then in another episode, George and Kramer suggest it after he starts dating a \"loser\".<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Van Buren Boys|series=[[Seinfeld]]|network=[[NBC]]|airdate= February 6, 1997|season=8|number=14}}</ref>\n\nWhile Jerry's career is successful and his opening and closing stand-up bits always go as planned, his stand-up performances depicted within the show occasionally go awry.\n\n*In \"[[The Red Dot]]\", an inebriated club patron cuts Jerry's stand-up short over the usage of the phrases \"on the wagon\" and \"off the wagon\".\n*In \"[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip, Part I]]\", the hotel [[maid|chambermaid]] throws Jerry's notes away causing him to stumble and bumble his way through a performance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.\n*In \"[[The Fire (Seinfeld)|The Fire]]\", Jerry is thrown off his act by Kramer's girlfriend Toby, who heckles him and later sees his entire crowd run for the exits when George screams \"he's got a gun!\" when referring to a prop comic.\n*In \"[[The Diplomat's Club]]\", Jerry's manager warns him that the pilot of the plane in which he flew to the show in was in the audience. Jerry tells that there is no way that could bother him but when he takes the stage, he can't stop looking at the pilot.\n*In \"[[The Abstinence]]\", Jerry is twice bumped from playing an assembly at his old middle-school. When he finally takes the stage, he's promptly booed for his opening act about homework. [[David Letterman]] later calls him to bump him from the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' due to the poor middle-school performance.\n*In \"[[The Butter Shave]]\", Jerry intentionally performs hackneyed comedy material in a successful attempt to prove that, without his warming up the audience first, Kenny Bania, who performs following him, will not get any laughs.\n*In \"[[The Finale (Seinfeld)|The Finale, Part II]]\", Jerry performs stand-up for his fellow inmates in jail but gets no laughs, except from Kramer, and is heckled and threatened by one of the prisoners.\n\n==Cleanliness==\nJerry has an obsessive insistence on cleanliness and neatness.\n\n*In \"[[The Pothole]]\", Jerry inadvertently knocks his girlfriend's toothbrush into the toilet bowl, and after she uses it, he is unable to bring himself to kiss her. As revenge, she proceeds to put one item of his in the toilet without telling him what it was; a distraught Jerry, thinking it could be anything, ends up throwing away virtually every item in his apartment in panic. Upon learning it was the toilet brush, he reassures himself that it can be replaced (his girlfriend is later bombarded with toilet water following a plumbing accident in her bathroom, causing him to break up with her). [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] says that in some instances, his cleanliness can verge into a [[Mysophobia|serious disorder]].\n*In \"\"[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]\", Jerry comments that most people think he's [[gay]] because he's \"thin and neat\".\n*In \"[[The Statue (Seinfeld)|The Statue]]\", he is delighted to find how thorough his new cleaner has been, to the extent of [[Coagulation|decoagulating]] the dried matter from the nozzle of his bottle of [[dishwashing liquid]].\n*In \"[[The Voice (Seinfeld)|The Voice]]\", he throws out a belt because it touched the edge of a urinal.\n*In \"[[The Butter Shave]]\", he throws out a shoelace because it touched the floor of a public bathroom.\n*In \"[[The Couch (Seinfeld)|The Couch]]\", after Poppie's gastro-intestinal disorder causes him to urinate on Jerry's couch, Jerry, rather than having the cushion cleaned, gives the couch away.\n*In \"[[The Blood (Seinfeld)|The Blood]]\", when Kramer announces that he moved his blood from the blood bank into the building, Jerry panics until Kramer tells him that the blood is in his apartment. Jerry tells him that if any blood gets into his apartment he will \"freak out\". Later when Kramer's freezer breaks, Jerry freaks out again, checking his freezer for the blood, thinking that the bowl of jello and the jug of tomato juice is blood. Kramer proceeds to drink the juice, causing Jerry to freak out even more.\n* In \"[[The Pie]]\", Jerry is horrified when Poppie neglects to wash his hands after using the bathroom and refuses to eat the food Poppie prepares for him.\n* In \"[[The Apology (Seinfeld)|The Apology]]\", while Elaine is talking to Jerry about a [[Mysophobia|germaphobic]] woman in her office, Jerry starts meticulously cleaning a spot where Kramer spilled soda.

Over time, indigenous religious ideas became assimilated by the new Buddhism; e.g. ''sprul'' became part of a compound noun, \u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0f74\u0f0b'sprul.sku' (\"incarnation body\" or 't\u00fclku', and 'btsan', the term for the imperial ruler of the Tibetan Empire, became a kind of mountain deity). The term ''t\u00fclku'' became associated with the translation of the [[Sanskrit]] philosophical term ''[[nirmanakaya]]''. According to the philosophical system of ''[[trikaya]]'' or ''three bodies of Buddha'', nirmanakaya is the Buddha's \"body\" in the sense of the [[bodymind]] (Sanskrit: ''[[namarupa|n\u0101mar\u016bpa]]''). Thus, the person of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the historical Buddha, is an example of nirmanakaya. In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, ''t\u00fclku'' means the corporeal existence of enlightened Buddhist masters in general.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn addition to Tibetans and related peoples, Tibetan Buddhism is a traditional religion of the Mongols and their relatives. The Mongolian word for a ''t\u00fclku'' is ''qubil\u03b3an'', though such persons may also be called by the honorific title ''qutu\u03b3tu'' (Tib: '''phags-pa'' and Skt: ''\u0101rya ''or ''superior'', not to be confused with the historic figure, 'Phags-pa Lama or the script attributed to him, ([['Phags-pa script|''Phags-pa'' script]]), or ''hutagt'' in the standard [[Khalkha Mongolian|Khalkha dialect]]. According to the ''Light of Fearless Indestructible Wisdom'' by Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal: the term ''t\u00fclku'' \"designates one who is 'noble' (or 'selfless' according to Buddha's usage) and used in Buddhist texts to denote a highly achieved being who has attained the first bhumi, a level of attainment which is truly egoless, or higher.\"\n\nThe Chinese word for ''t\u00fclku'' is ''hu\u00f3f\u00f3'' (\u6d3b\u4f5b), which literally means \"living Buddha\" and is sometimes used to mean ''t\u00fclku'', although the Dalai Lama has said that this is a mistranslation, as a t\u00fclku isn't necessarily a realized being.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Meaning of \"tulku\"==\nAny [[Vajrayana]] practitioner can be reborn as a ''t\u00fclku'', if they fail to reach [[Buddhahood]] or a [[Pure Land]] in the [[bardo]] of dying, bardo of dharmata or bardo of becoming.<ref>Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang.

For [[shale oil]] production, the consortium built a tunnel oven in 1928. However, due to the [[Great Depression]], production halted in 1930 and was restarted only in 1936 by the reorganized consortium called ''Baltic Oil Company''.  The second tunnel oven was added in 1938. The main product was gasoline.
