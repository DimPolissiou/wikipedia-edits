Later, as AE3803 tries to find her way to the lungs to make the delivery, she discovers one of the bacteria has escaped and is planning an attack on the lungs, so she and U-1146 accompany each other to the lungs to pursue it. Upon reaching the lungs and parting ways with U-1146, AE3803 discovers Pneumococcus had been hiding in her package the entire time, waiting to target red blood cells for their nutrients. However, U-1146, who had caught onto the bacterium's plan, arrives in time and lures the bacterium into a trap, where he is ultimately sneezed out of the lungs.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Scrape Wound\n| TranslitTitle       = Surikizu\n| NativeTitle         = \u3059\u308a\u50b7\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|7|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = The red blood cells find themselves in trouble when the vessel they are travelling on is broken by a skin abrasion, with U-1146 and the other white blood cells forced to deal with all the germs that come through as a result.

He finally ends up fleeing the battlefield, where the veteran Killer T Cells, Neutrophils and Macrophages are battling. Naive T Cell is filled with self-loathing until Dendritic Cell sees him and speaks to him kindly. This encouragement transforms him into Effector T Cell, a much braver and stronger form that joins the other immune cells in wiping out the influenza virus. However, a surviving virus mutates into [[Type A influenza|Type A]] and proliferates again, so the fighting goes on.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Food Poisoning\n| TranslitTitle       = Shokuch\u016bdoku\n| NativeTitle         = \u98df\u4e2d\u6bd2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|7|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = A band of ''[[Vibrio]]'' bacteria invades the stomach.

The stomach then gets invaded by a massive [[Anisakis]] parasite. The immune cells are no match for it, but Eosinophil explains she is designed to battle parasites and kills it with a single stab.

Though U-1146 points out the creatures are mindless and non-malicious, Memory Cell claims they bring impending doom. B Cell easily defeats the allergens, but Mast Cell releases a profuse amount of [[histamine]]s within the body, which causes violent allergic reactions that damage the surroundings. Just as everyone blames Mast Cell for the destruction, the body takes a steroid to treat the allergy. The steroid appears in the form of a robot that indiscriminately destroys its surroundings until it loses power.

One day, while practicing to evacuate from bacteria, she got lost and was separated from the others. She got captured by a ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' bacterium who intended to torture and kill her before moving on to other blood cells. A young [[Myelocyte]] came to her rescue, and although no match for the bacterium, bought enough time for Macrophage and a Neutrophil to arrive and kill the bacterium. She thanked the Myelocyte for helping her and they went their separate ways hoping to someday see each other again. In the present, she runs into U-1146. As he offers to guide her to her destination, she suspects the Myelocyte who saved her grew up to be U-1146.\n\t\nLater, U-1146 saves a Normal Cell from a Cancer Cell. The Normal Cell explains there are more Cancer Cells in his apartment complex. The Normal Cell leads U-1146, Killer T Cell, and NK Cell to his apartment, but Killer T Cell continually trades spats with NK Cell and stubbornly refuse working with her. The group splits up and once they are alone, NK Cell reveals she knew the Normal Cell was actually a Cancer Cell in disguise.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = Cancer Cells\n| TranslitTitle       = Gansaib\u014d\n| NativeTitle         = \u304c\u3093\u7d30\u80de\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|8|18}}\n| ShortSummary        = NK Cell battles the Cancer Cell, who is able to shapeshift and spread into the surrounding environment.

U-1146, Killer T Cell and NK Cell are cornered and about to be killed, until the other immune cells arrive. All the Cancer Cells are wiped out, with NK Cell delivering the final blow against the original one, but he vows revenge before dying in front of U-1146.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Blood Circulation\n| TranslitTitle       = Ketsueki Junkan\n| NativeTitle         = \u8840\u6db2\u5faa\u74b0\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|8|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = AE3803 becomes tired of always getting lost and resolves to circulate the body without guidance.

U-1146 clandestinely followed her and helped return her dropped notes and hat, then killed some germs who tried to ambush her, all without her noticing his presence. U-1146 later tells Killer T Cell that he has gained an appreciation for all the hard work the Red Blood Cells do every day and hopes the immune cells can live in harmony with other cells, but Killer T Cell angrily punches him and orders him to get back to work.

The future Helper T Cell was disdainful of him for this, but eventually gave him advice that helped him pass the final test. Killer T Cell vowed to become a worthy defender of the body, while Helper T Cell decided to become a commander. In the present, Killer T Cell and Helper T Cell notice the photo album.

Later, as AE3803 tries to find her way to the lungs to make the delivery, she discovers one of the bacteria has escaped and is planning an attack on the lungs, so she and U-1146 accompany each other to the lungs to pursue it. Upon reaching the lungs and parting ways with U-1146, AE3803 discovers Pneumococcus had been hiding in her package the entire time, waiting to target red blood cells for their nutrients. However, U-1146, who had caught onto the bacterium's plan, arrives in time and lures the bacterium into a trap, where he is ultimately sneezed out of the lungs.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Scrape Wound\n| TranslitTitle       = Surikizu\n| NativeTitle         = \u3059\u308a\u50b7\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|7|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = The red blood cells find themselves in trouble when the vessel they are travelling on is broken by a skin abrasion, with U-1146 and the other white blood cells forced to deal with all the germs that come through as a result.

Naive T Cell is filled with self-loathing until Dendritic Cell sees him and speaks to him kindly. This encouragement transforms him into Effector T Cell, a much braver and stronger form that joins the other immune cells in wiping out the influenza virus.

The stomach then gets invaded by a massive [[Anisakis]] parasite. The immune cells are no match for it, but Eosinophil explains she is designed to battle parasites and kills it with a single stab.

Though U-1146 points out the creatures are mindless and non-malicious, Memory Cell claims they bring impending doom. B Cell easily defeats the allergens, but Mast Cell releases a profuse amount of [[histamine]]s within the body, which causes violent allergic reactions that damage the surroundings. Just as everyone blames Mast Cell for the destruction, the body takes a steroid to treat the allergy. The steroid appears in the form of a robot that indiscriminately destroys its surroundings until it loses power.

One day, while practicing to evacuate from bacteria, she got lost and was separated from the others. She got captured by a ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' bacterium who intended to torture and kill her before moving on to other blood cells. A young [[Myelocyte]] came to her rescue, and although no match for the bacterium, bought enough time for Macrophage and a Neutrophil to arrive and kill the bacterium. She thanked the Myelocyte for helping her and they went their separate ways hoping to someday see each other again. In the present, she runs into U-1146. As he offers to guide her to her destination, she suspects the Myelocyte who saved her grew up to be U-1146.\n\t\nLater, U-1146 saves a Normal Cell from a Cancer Cell. The Normal Cell explains there are more Cancer Cells in his apartment complex. The Normal Cell leads U-1146, Killer T Cell, and NK Cell to his apartment, but Killer T Cell continually trades spats with NK Cell and stubbornly refuse working with her.
