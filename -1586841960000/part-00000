The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

These had led to five deaths and 129 injuries. \"The specific causes of each of these accidents may vary,\" Szabo wrote, \"but regardless of the reasons, four serious accidents in less than seven months is simply unacceptable.\"<ref name=\"FRA letter story\">{{cite news|last1=Keane|first1=Angela Greiling|last2=Klopott|first2=Freeman|last3=Goldman|first3=Henry|title=Metro-North Rebuked by U.S. Rail Regulator Over Accidents|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-04/metro-north-rebuked-by-u-s-rail-regulator-over-accidents.html|newspaper=[[Bloomberg news]]|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSzabo asked the MTA for \"a serious, good faith commitment to the safe operation of the system.\" He said it needed to tell employees what, specifically, it would do to improve safety. He requested an answer in two days.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> \"Immediate corrective action is imperative.\" Metro-North announced the day afterwards that it would institute a telephone line where employees could confidentially report \"close calls.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> Prendergast later replied to Szabo that the railroad had held mandatory safety discussions for 4,000 employees at 20 locations since the accident.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Metro-North ordered to have extra crew members in train cabs, new signals|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131206/NEWS/312060056/Metro-North-ordered-extra-crew-members-train-cabs-new-signals|newspaper=The Journal News|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe accident spurred further discussion of [[positive train control]] (PTC), which might have prevented it. After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

Since the [[Emperor of China]] held the [[Mandate of Heaven]], his rule was universal and extended to [[Tianxia|All under heaven]]. Sometimes neighboring states were actual [[protectorate]]s or [[vassal state]]s over which China exerted large amounts of influence, while in other cases foreign states merely acknowledged China's nominal [[suzerainty]] in order to gain access to Chinese trade, which took place through the tributary system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Warren I.

The Tang Dynasty established control over the Tarim Basin region as well, fighting wars with the new Tibetan Empire and stripping them of their colonies in Central Asia (which was abandoned after the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]). The [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279), in securing maritime trade routes that ran from South East Asia into the Indian Ocean, had established fortified trade bases in the Philippines.

The Ming loyalists quickly moved to replace the institutions and culture of Dutch colonial rule with Han Chinese colonial rule. Language and religious institutions left by the Dutch were closed and replaced with Confucian temples and Chinese language schools for both Han Chinese and aboriginals. Officials encouraged new immigration of Han Chinese from China into territory further inland, turning aboriginal lands into new farmland.<ref>Wills J. Jr (2006), \"The Seventeenth Century Transformation\", in ''Taiwan: A New History'', Rubinstein, M. ed., M. E. Sharpe. {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1495-7}}.</ref> After fighting between the Ming loyalists and the [[Qing]] during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the Qing attacked the Kingdom of Tungning. the Qing won the [[Battle of Penghu]] and the Ming loyalists submitted to Qing rule. Tungning was annexed as part of [[Fujian]] province. The Qing were \"reluctant colonizers\" but became convinced of Taiwan's value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers, and by its abundant resources. <ref>Tonio Andrade, ''How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century'', Columbia University Press.</ref> The Qing turned Taiwan into its own province in 1885, after [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Japanese interest]] and a defeated [[Keelung Campaign|French invasion]] attempt.\n\nAfter British troops [[British expedition to Tibet|invaded Tibet]] in the waning days of the Qing dynasty, the Qing responded by sending [[Zhao Erfeng]] to further integrate Tibet into China.  He succeeded in abolishing the powers of the Tibetan local leaders in [[Kham]] and appointing Chinese magistrates in their places by 1909\u201310. Qing forces were also sent to [[\u00dc-Tsang]] in 1910 to establish a direct control over Tibet proper, though a province was never established in this area.\n\n===Process of expansion===\nThe ability of Qing China to project power into [[Central Asia]] came about because of two changes, one social and one technological.  The social change was that under the Qing dynasty, from 1642, China came under the control of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional Chinese infantry.  The technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the [[Steppe]] had with their cavalry. Zunghar Khanate (\u0417\u04af\u04af\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0443\u043b\u0441) was the last great independent nomadic power on the steppe in Central Asia. The [[Dzungars]] were deliberately exterminated in a brutal campaign during the [[Zunghar Genocide]] by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols.

Since the [[Emperor of China]] held the [[Mandate of Heaven]], his rule was universal and extended to [[Tianxia|All under heaven]]. Sometimes neighboring states were actual [[protectorate]]s or [[vassal state]]s over which China exerted large amounts of influence, while in other cases foreign states merely acknowledged China's nominal [[suzerainty]] in order to gain access to Chinese trade, which took place through the tributary system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Warren I.

The Tang Dynasty established control over the Tarim Basin region as well, fighting wars with the new Tibetan Empire and stripping them of their colonies in Central Asia (which was abandoned after the [[An Lushan Rebellion]]).

The Ming loyalists quickly moved to replace the institutions and culture of Dutch colonial rule with Han Chinese colonial rule. Language and religious institutions left by the Dutch were closed and replaced with Confucian temples and Chinese language schools for both Han Chinese and aboriginals. Officials encouraged new immigration of Han Chinese from China into territory further inland, turning aboriginal lands into new farmland.<ref>Wills J.

Sharpe. {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1495-7}}.</ref> After fighting between the Ming loyalists and the [[Qing]] during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the Qing attacked the Kingdom of Tungning. the Qing won the [[Battle of Penghu]] and the Ming loyalists submitted to Qing rule. Tungning was annexed as part of [[Fujian]] province. The Qing were \"reluctant colonizers\" but became convinced of Taiwan's value to their empire due to the threat the island posed if used as a base by rival powers, and by its abundant resources. <ref>Tonio Andrade, ''How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century'', Columbia University Press.</ref> The Qing turned Taiwan into its own province in 1885, after [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Japanese interest]] and a defeated [[Keelung Campaign|French invasion]] attempt.\n\nAfter British troops [[British expedition to Tibet|invaded Tibet]] in the waning days of the Qing dynasty, the Qing responded by sending [[Zhao Erfeng]] to further integrate Tibet into China.  He succeeded in abolishing the powers of the Tibetan local leaders in [[Kham]] and appointing Chinese magistrates in their places by 1909\u201310. Qing forces were also sent to [[\u00dc-Tsang]] in 1910 to establish a direct control over Tibet proper, though a province was never established in this area.\n\n===Process of expansion===\nThe ability of Qing China to project power into [[Central Asia]] came about because of two changes, one social and one technological.  The social change was that under the Qing dynasty, from 1642, China came under the control of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s who organised their military forces around cavalry which was more suited for power projection than traditional Chinese infantry.  The technological change was advances in artillery which negated the military advantage that the people of the [[Steppe]] had with their cavalry. Zunghar Khanate (\u0417\u04af\u04af\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0443\u043b\u0441) was the last great independent nomadic power on the steppe in Central Asia.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 7 November 2015. It is written by [[Peter Harness]] and [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by Daniel Nettheim. The episode is the second of a two-parter, the first being \"[[The Zygon Invasion]]\" on 31 October.\n\nSet in present-day London, the episode involves Bonnie, the leader of a splinter group of shapeshifting aliens called Zygons, taking the form of a human called [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] (played by [[Jenna Coleman]]). Bonnie intends to use an object called the Osgood Box to unmask 20 million Zygons on Earth, thereby starting a war against humanity.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present, Bonnie, the leader of a splinter group of shapeshifting [[Zygon]]s, has taken [[Clara Oswald|Clara]]'s form, keeping her body in a pod. Clara finds herself in a dream version of her flat, able to control Bonnie's actions to a small degree due to a telepathic connection between them, giving the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[UNIT]] scientist [[List of UNIT personnel#Petronella Osgood|Osgood]] time to parachute out of their plane before Bonnie shoots it down.\n\nThe Doctor and Osgood land on a beach. Controlling Bonnie's hand, Clara sends a message to the Doctor's phone saying \"I'm awake.\" The Doctor video calls Bonnie. From winks Bonnie exhibits, the Doctor recognises that Clara is telling him her pod is in London. In interrogating Clara via their telepathic connection, Bonnie learns the Osgood Box is in the UNIT Black Archive under the [[Tower of London]]. Against the wishes of the Zygons who are not aligned with the splinter group, Bonnie intends to start a war against humanity by using the Osgood Box to unmask 20 million Zygons on Earth. UNIT leader [[List of UNIT personnel#Kate Stewart|Kate Stewart]], having survived the encounter with the Zygon in New Mexico,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the previous week's episode, \"[[The Zygon Invasion]]\".}} reconvenes with the Doctor and Osgood in London.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30641597640).jpg|left|thumb|The two Osgood Boxes, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nBonnie discovers that there are two identical Osgood Boxes in the Archive, only differing by colour. By the time the Doctor, Osgood, and Kate arrive, Bonnie has found that either box's button reveals a second set of two buttons within. When Bonnie prepares to press a button on the blue box, which would either unmask the Zygons or make their human forms permanent, Kate prepares to do the same on the red box, which would destroy either every Zygon or everyone in London. The Doctor tries to talk both of them out of this action \u2013 the Osgood Boxes have been a means to assure peace because of the consequences of declaring a war. Eventually, after the Doctor admits the consequences he had to live with since the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], both Bonnie and Kate back off with the former realising the boxes are empty and were only a ploy to avoid a disaster. The Doctor wipes Kate's memories to keep the peace treaty. Bonnie calls off the splinter group and says they will live peacefully. Later, the Doctor offers Osgood a chance to ride in the [[TARDIS]], but she refuses and instead reveals her new duplicate \u2013 Bonnie, who has taken a new form after giving up Clara.\n\n===Continuity===\nKate Stewart describes her gunfire while escaping an attacking Zygon as \"five rounds rapid\".

Depicting the madness of war doesn\u2019t require an epic scale. If anything, narrowing the focus to a single conflict or moral dilemma clarifies the essential futility of violent conflict\". He then closed his review by claiming \"The simplicity of [the] setup allows this two-parter to be one of the show's strongest ever statements against war, not because the Doctor is challenging us from on high to live up to his standard, but rather because he wants no one else to know his pain\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilkins|first1=Alasdair|title=Doctor Who makes its closing argument against war|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-makes-its-closing-argument-against-war-227871|website=The A.V.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 7 November 2015. It is written by [[Peter Harness]] and [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by Daniel Nettheim. The episode is the second of a two-parter, the first being \"[[The Zygon Invasion]]\" on 31 October.\n\nSet in present-day London, the episode involves Bonnie, the leader of a splinter group of shapeshifting aliens called Zygons, taking the form of a human called [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] (played by [[Jenna Coleman]]). Bonnie intends to use an object called the Osgood Box to unmask 20 million Zygons on Earth, thereby starting a war against humanity.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present, Bonnie, the leader of a splinter group of shapeshifting [[Zygon]]s, has taken [[Clara Oswald|Clara]]'s form, keeping her body in a pod. Clara finds herself in a dream version of her flat, able to control Bonnie's actions to a small degree due to a telepathic connection between them, giving the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[UNIT]] scientist [[List of UNIT personnel#Petronella Osgood|Osgood]] time to parachute out of their plane before Bonnie shoots it down.\n\nThe Doctor and Osgood land on a beach. Controlling Bonnie's hand, Clara sends a message to the Doctor's phone saying \"I'm awake.\" The Doctor video calls Bonnie. From winks Bonnie exhibits, the Doctor recognises that Clara is telling him her pod is in London. In interrogating Clara via their telepathic connection, Bonnie learns the Osgood Box is in the UNIT Black Archive under the [[Tower of London]]. Against the wishes of the Zygons who are not aligned with the splinter group, Bonnie intends to start a war against humanity by using the Osgood Box to unmask 20 million Zygons on Earth. UNIT leader [[List of UNIT personnel#Kate Stewart|Kate Stewart]], having survived the encounter with the Zygon in New Mexico,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the previous week's episode, \"[[The Zygon Invasion]]\".}} reconvenes with the Doctor and Osgood in London.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30641597640).jpg|left|thumb|The two Osgood Boxes, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nBonnie discovers that there are two identical Osgood Boxes in the Archive, only differing by colour. By the time the Doctor, Osgood, and Kate arrive, Bonnie has found that either box's button reveals a second set of two buttons within. When Bonnie prepares to press a button on the blue box, which would either unmask the Zygons or make their human forms permanent, Kate prepares to do the same on the red box, which would destroy either every Zygon or everyone in London. The Doctor tries to talk both of them out of this action \u2013 the Osgood Boxes have been a means to assure peace because of the consequences of declaring a war. Eventually, after the Doctor admits the consequences he had to live with since the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], both Bonnie and Kate back off with the former realising the boxes are empty and were only a ploy to avoid a disaster. The Doctor wipes Kate's memories to keep the peace treaty. Bonnie calls off the splinter group and says they will live peacefully. Later, the Doctor offers Osgood a chance to ride in the [[TARDIS]], but she refuses and instead reveals her new duplicate \u2013 Bonnie, who has taken a new form after giving up Clara.\n\n===Continuity===\nKate Stewart describes her gunfire while escaping an attacking Zygon as \"five rounds rapid\".

On review aggregator, [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the episode has a 95% positive review rating and a score of 8/10, with a critical consensus stating, \"While \"The Zygon Inversion\" isn't the most compelling conclusion to a Doctor Who two-parter, it allows for a stirring performance by Capaldi while hinting at Clara's fate in the episodes to come.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" />\n\nSteven Cooper of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' called it the best episode of the season so far and claimed it was \"a powerful conclusion to the story set up last week\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/doctor-who-recap-season-9-episode-8-the-zygon-inversion|title= Doctor Who Recap|work= Slant Magazine}}</ref> Mark Rozeman of ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' praised the transformation from \"standard aliens-invade plot line\" to \"a treatise about war and its ultimate uselessness.\" He ultimately awarded the episode an 8.8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/11/doctor-who-review-the-zygon-inversion.html|title = Doctor Who Review: The Zygon Inversion|work= Paste Magazine}}</ref> Kaite Welsh of ''IndieWire'' heavily acclaimed the episode, awarding it an A++ grade and saying that the episode was \"Less overtly political than the previous episode, this week is an embarrassment of riches\".

He stated \"This Doctor has never been written better, Capaldi has never channelled Tom Baker more, that sequence is cemented instantly as the 'Capaldi moment' in clip shows for the rest of time\", and while he said that \"It was a risky game to attempt the sort of contemporary allegory\" that the episode did, he soon confirmed that the episode \"knocked [it] out of the park\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Dan|title=Doctor Who series 35, episode eight: The Zygon Inversion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/07/doctor-who-series-35-episode-eight-the-zygon-inversion|website=The Guardian|publisher=Dan Martin|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> Alasdair Wilkins of [[The A.V. Club]] also acclaimed the episode, awarding it a perfect \"A\" grade \u2013 the third of the season. He began his review by saying \"The climax of 'The Zygon Inversion' makes explicit something that the best anti-war Doctor Who stories have always understood. Depicting the madness of war doesn\u2019t require an epic scale. If anything, narrowing the focus to a single conflict or moral dilemma clarifies the essential futility of violent conflict\". He then closed his review by claiming \"The simplicity of [the] setup allows this two-parter to be one of the show's strongest ever statements against war, not because the Doctor is challenging us from on high to live up to his standard, but rather because he wants no one else to know his pain\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilkins|first1=Alasdair|title=Doctor Who makes its closing argument against war|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-makes-its-closing-argument-against-war-227871|website=The A.V.

Viewers argued that the scene was inappropriate in the aftermath of the crash, but Ofcom decided not to launch an investigation. The regulator concluded that \"the science fiction nature of Doctor Who and the storyline created a sufficient distinction from recent events\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark |last=Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/23/doctor-who-cleared-by-ofcom-airliner-the-zygon-inversion?subid=15276612&CMP=ema_546 |title=Doctor Who cleared over 'insensitive' airliner scene despite 31 complaints |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 November 2015 |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Twelfth Doctor}}\n*{{BBCDWnew|year=2015|id=b06phcqv|title=The Zygon Inversion}}\n*{{TardisIndexFile |The Zygon Inversion (TV story)|\"The Zygon Inversion\"}}\n\n*{{IMDb episode|4652846|The Zygon Inversion}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|N9}}\n{{Doctor Who episodes by Steven Moffat}}\n{{Zygon stories}}\n{{UNIT stories}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zygon Inversion}}\n[[Category:Twelfth Doctor episodes]]\n[[Category:2015 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes written by Steven Moffat]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Peter Harness]]\n[[Category:UNIT serials]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:British television episodes in multiple parts]]\n", "name_user": "LegoKeoni", "label": "safe", "comment": "Amended running time", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zygon_Inversion"}
