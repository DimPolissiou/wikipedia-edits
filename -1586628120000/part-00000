On his chest-tomb between brasses of his two wives in St Mary's Church, [[Atherington, Devon]], moved in 1818 from the nearby [[Holy Trinity Chapel, Umberleigh]] (now demolished) next to [[Umberleigh|Umberleigh House]]]]\n[[File:BassetArmsAncient.png|thumb|200px|Arms of Basset (ancient) of [[Umberleigh]], Devon and [[Tehidy]], Cornwall: ''Barry dancetty of seven or and gules''. The family's later \"modern\" arms were: ''Barry wavy of six or and gules'', as visible in [[Heanton Punchardon]] Church and at [[Watermouth Castle]], Devon]]\n'''Sir John Basset''' (1462\u201331 January 1528), [[Knight of the Bath|KB]], of [[Tehidy Country Park|Tehidy]] in [[Cornwall]] and of [[Umberleigh]] in [[Devon]] was [[High Sheriff of Cornwall|Sheriff of Cornwall]] in 1497, 1517 and 1522 and [[High Sheriff of Devon|Sheriff of Devon]] in 1524. Although himself an important figure in the [[Westcountry]] [[gentry]], he is chiefly remembered for his connection with the life of his second wife and widow [[Honor Plantagenet, Viscountess Lisle|Honor Grenville]] (d. 1566), who  moved into the highest society when she remarried to [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]] [[Order of the Garter|KG]] (d. 1542), an illegitimate son of King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and an important figure at the court of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], his nephew. The survival of the [[Lisle Letters]], a large collection of letters to Lisle and his wife Honor, makes their lives two of the best-documented of the period. Honor retained for life as her widow's dower several Basset estates including  Umberleigh and Tehidy, and the Lisle Letters include a great deal of correspondence to Honor from her stewards concerning their detailed management. They also include much correspondence to her from her children by Sir John Basset.\n\n==Origins==\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Sir John Basset (1441\u20131485) of Tehidy in Cornwall  and [[Whitechapel, Bishops Nympton|Whitechapel]] in the parish of [[Bishops Nympton]], by his wife Elizabeth Budockshyde.<ref>The Lisle Letters: An Abridgement, By Muriel St. Clare Byrne</ref> His father was the son and heir of John Basset (1374\u20131463) by  Joan Beaumont, daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont of [[Umberleigh]] and [[Heanton Punchardon]] and sister and heiress of Philip Beaumont of [[Shirwell]]. The Beaumonts had inherited Umberleigh from the Poulton family who had inherited it from the Willingtons.<ref>Risdon, Tristram, Survey of Devon, 1810 edition, p. 317</ref> The [[Basset family]] were amongst the early Norman settlers in England.\n\n==Career==\nAs [[High Sheriff of Cornwall|Sheriff of Cornwall]] in 1497 Sir John was a target for the Cornish rebels under Richard Pendyn of Pendeen who attacked and 'dismantled' Tehidy, the family home. He was created Knight of the Bath by [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] in November 1501 at the time of the marriage of his son and heir [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Prince Arthur]] to [[Katherine of Aragon]]. He was Sheriff of Cornwall again in 1517 and 1522 and [[High Sheriff of Devon|Sheriff of Devon]] in 1524. In 1520 he was part of the Devonshire contingent of the large entourage which accompanied King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]].\n\n==Beaumont inheritance==\nSir John Basset as well as being heir to his extensive paternal lands was also heir to his maternal grandmother Joan (or Johanna) Beaumont<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p. 312</ref> (wife of John Basset (1374\u20131463)), the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont (1401\u20131450) of [[Shirwell]] by his wife Philippa Dinham, daughter of Sir [[John Dynham]] (1406-1458)<ref name=\"auto\">Vivian, p. 46</ref> of [[Nutwell]], [[Kingskerswell]] and [[Hartland, Devon|Hartland]]. Joan Beaumont was heiress to her brother Sir Philip Beaumont (1432\u20131473), MP in 1467 and [[Sheriff of Devon]] in 1469, and also to her mother Phillipa Dynham.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThese former Beaumont lands included the manors of Umberleigh and [[Heanton Punchardon]] in North Devon. However, as deduced by Byrne (1981), Basset lacked the financial resources to recover his inheritance,<ref name=\"auto1\">Byrne, p. 313</ref> which involved paying fines and recoveries to the King. At the time he had been married for 30 years<ref name=\"auto1\"/> to his first wife Elizabeth Denys and had given up any hope of producing a surviving son and heir. In order to make the best of his situation, he obtained financing for the recoveries from [[Giles Daubeney, 1st Baron Daubeney]] (1451\u20131508), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], under a special agreement entered into in 1504, referred to by the family as the \"Great Indenture\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Transcribed in Byrne, vol.4, chapter 7, appendix 2</ref> This specified that Daubeney would pay about \u00a32,000 for the recoveries on condition that one of the Basset daughters and co-heiresses would marry Daubeney's son [[Henry Daubeney, 1st Earl of Bridgewater|Henry Daubeney]] (1493\u20131548) (later created [[Earl of Bridgewater]]), then aged 10, before his 16th birthday. The purpose was to entail the Beaumont lands upon the male issue of a Daubeney-Basset marriage, thus increasing the future wealth of the Daubeney family. However the indenture allowed for Sir John Basset and any future wives of his to retain possession during their lives of Umberleigh and lands in Bickington. If the scheme should fail due to the marriage not taking place and in default of other provisions, the lands would revert to the right heirs of Basset. To this effect Basset sent two of his four daughters by Elizabeth Denys, namely Anne and Thomasine, to live in the Daubeney household. The marriage never did take place and Lord Daubeny died four years later in 1508. Whether for those reasons or another the gamble paid off for Basset as his 2nd wife Honor Grenville produced for him a son and heir in 1518 and the Beaumont lands came back to the Basset family.

Detail from top slab of his chest-tomb, Atherington Church, Devon]]\nSir John Basset married twice, producing in total 12 children. His first wife failed to provide him with a surviving son and heir and he appears to have lost all hope of having a son, hence his conveyance of his Beaumont inheritance to Lord Daubeney, retaining only Umberleigh for his life. However, after a long marriage his first wife died unexpectedly and Basset found himself at the age of 53 remarried to a new 22-year-old bride, who would provide him with the desired son and heir. The problem then was how to recover for him the Beaumont inheritance conveyed to Lord Daubeney. This legal struggle, which Lady Lisle pursued vigorously over many years and which was ultimately successful, occupies much of the Lisle Papers.\n\n===First marriage===\n[[File:DenysOfOrleighArms.PNG|thumb|200px|Arms of Denys of Orleigh: ''Azure, three Danish battle axes erect or''.<ref>Vivian, Heraldic Visitationms of Devon, 1895, p.281, pedigree of Denys of Orleigh; as seen on ledger stone of Elizabeth Denys (1625\u20131664) on floor of Orleigh Chapel, Buckland Brewer Church, Devon</ref> As engraved on monumental brasses on Sir John Basset's tomb]]\n[[File:JohnBassettSlab AtheringtonDevon.JPG|thumb|200px|Top slab of chest-tomb of Sir John Basset (1462\u20131529) of Umberleigh, inset with [[monumental brass]]es of himself, his two wives, and their children with heraldic escutcheons.

Whilst Lord Lisle was the [[Governor of Calais]], John Basset's children were moved there and were educated in France. Lord and Lady Lisle were apparently very happily married. Honor was a forceful woman, who wrote many letters to friends at court, ensuring that they were kept well-informed. These letters are preserved today as the [[Lisle Letters]] and give a valuable account of developments during the reign of Henry VIII.\n\n==Career of daughters at court==\nHonor finally succeeded in getting one of her young daughters appointed as a maid-of-honour to [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane Seymour]] in 1537, who had asked her to send two to court for her selection. She chose Anne over Catherine.  Anne Basset subsequently became known at court for her beauty and respectability. Her first appearance as maid-of-honour was at Jane Seymour's funeral. During the interval of two years whilst the king remained without a new wife Anne spent much time at court and received expensive presents from the King. She went on to serve three more Queens, [[Anne of Cleves]], [[Katherine Howard]] and [[Catherine Parr|Katherine Parr]]. Despite Lord Lisle's arrest for treason in 1540, her sister Katherine Basset, and her mother eventually joined her at court.\n\n==Daughter possible bride for King Henry VIII==\nIn 1542 [[Chapuys]], the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] ambassador, reported that on the eve of Catherine Howard's execution, the king appeared besotted with Anne Basset, and that she was a possible sixth wife. This eventuality may have been ruined by Anne's own family as her sister Elizabeth Basset favoured the King marrying her own mistress, Anne of Cleves, and made comments implying that this seemed to be what God wanted. She also said, \"What a man is our king? How many wives will he have?\", which was reported to the King and resulted in her being judicially questioned, a serious matter as under the treason laws her remarks might have warranted the death penalty. The Basset family continued to serve at the courts of Henry VIII's children.\n\n==Death and burial==\nSir John died on 31 January 1528 aged 66. Some of his children were still infants and the wardship and marriage of his son and heir John Basset aged 9 was purchased for 200 marks jointly by his mother Honor and John Worth of [[Compton Pole]].<ref>Byrne, vol 1, p. 315</ref> The wardship was later acquired by his step-father and future father-in-law Viscount Lisle before 1532<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p. 316</ref> Sir John Basset was buried in his family's private [[Holy Trinity Chapel, Umberleigh|Holy Trinity Chapel]] (now largely demolished), next to his manor house of Umberleigh.\n\n===Will===\nSir John Basset left a will dated 6 November 1527, now lost but of which parts were transcribed by the 18th-century herald [[John Anstis|Anstis]].<ref name=\"auto7\">Byrne, vol 1, p. 314</ref>\nHe listed his feoffees, amongst whom were Roger Graynfild (i.e. Grenville), who were directed to \"keep every year a solemn dirige and the morrow upon three masses for the good estate of the said Sir John Basset and Honour his wife\" and of various members of the Grenville family.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> He left his wife Honor, until she remarried, all the rents and profits of his manors of Trevalga, Femarshall, Whitechapel, Holcombe, Upcott Snellard and Calston, from which she was to pay his debts and also provide dowries of 100 marks each on the marriages on each of his daughters Jane, Thomasine, Philippa, Katharine and Mary.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> His marriage settlement of 1515 had already provided that Honor should have as her jointure the manor and advowson of Tehidy, the manor of Umberleigh, and lands in Bickington and Atherington.<ref>Byrne, vol 1, pp. 314\u20135</ref>\n\n===Monument===\nHis [[chest tomb]] with [[monumental brass]]es on top, of himself between his two wives with his children below in two small groups exists in St Mary's Church, [[Atherington, Devon|Atherington]], to where it was moved in 1818 from Umberleigh Chapel.<ref>Byrne, 1981, vol.1, Appendix 6, \"The Atherington Brass\", p. 699</ref> The [[Lisle Letters]] record some details concerning the making of the tomb.

The family's later \"modern\" arms were: ''Barry wavy of six or and gules'', as visible in [[Heanton Punchardon]] Church and at [[Watermouth Castle]], Devon]]\n'''Sir John Basset''' (1462\u201331 January 1528), [[Knight of the Bath|KB]], of [[Tehidy Country Park|Tehidy]] in [[Cornwall]] and of [[Umberleigh]] in [[Devon]] was [[High Sheriff of Cornwall|Sheriff of Cornwall]] in 1497, 1517 and 1522 and [[High Sheriff of Devon|Sheriff of Devon]] in 1524. Although himself an important figure in the [[Westcountry]] [[gentry]], he is chiefly remembered for his connection with the life of his second wife and widow [[Honor Plantagenet, Viscountess Lisle|Honor Grenville]] (d. 1566), who  moved into the highest society when she remarried to [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]] [[Order of the Garter|KG]] (d. 1542), an illegitimate son of King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and an important figure at the court of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], his nephew. The survival of the [[Lisle Letters]], a large collection of letters to Lisle and his wife Honor, makes their lives two of the best-documented of the period. Honor retained for life as her widow's dower several Basset estates including  Umberleigh and Tehidy, and the Lisle Letters include a great deal of correspondence to Honor from her stewards concerning their detailed management. They also include much correspondence to her from her children by Sir John Basset.\n\n==Origins==\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Sir John Basset (1441\u20131485) of Tehidy in Cornwall  and [[Whitechapel, Bishops Nympton|Whitechapel]] in the parish of [[Bishops Nympton]], by his wife Elizabeth Budockshyde.<ref>The Lisle Letters: An Abridgement, By Muriel St. Clare Byrne</ref> His father was the son and heir of John Basset (1374\u20131463) by  Joan Beaumont, daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont of [[Umberleigh]] and [[Heanton Punchardon]] and sister and heiress of Philip Beaumont of [[Shirwell]]. The Beaumonts had inherited Umberleigh from the Poulton family who had inherited it from the Willingtons.<ref>Risdon, Tristram, Survey of Devon, 1810 edition, p. 317</ref> The [[Basset family]] were amongst the early Norman settlers in England.\n\n==Career==\nAs [[High Sheriff of Cornwall|Sheriff of Cornwall]] in 1497 Sir John was a target for the Cornish rebels under Richard Pendyn of Pendeen who attacked and 'dismantled' Tehidy, the family home. He was created Knight of the Bath by [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] in November 1501 at the time of the marriage of his son and heir [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Prince Arthur]] to [[Katherine of Aragon]]. He was Sheriff of Cornwall again in 1517 and 1522 and [[High Sheriff of Devon|Sheriff of Devon]] in 1524. In 1520 he was part of the Devonshire contingent of the large entourage which accompanied King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to the [[Field of Cloth of Gold]].\n\n==Beaumont inheritance==\nSir John Basset as well as being heir to his extensive paternal lands was also heir to his maternal grandmother Joan (or Johanna) Beaumont<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p. 312</ref> (wife of John Basset (1374\u20131463)), the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont (1401\u20131450) of [[Shirwell]] by his wife Philippa Dinham, daughter of Sir [[John Dynham]] (1406-1458)<ref name=\"auto\">Vivian, p. 46</ref> of [[Nutwell]], [[Kingskerswell]] and [[Hartland, Devon|Hartland]]. Joan Beaumont was heiress to her brother Sir Philip Beaumont (1432\u20131473), MP in 1467 and [[Sheriff of Devon]] in 1469, and also to her mother Phillipa Dynham.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThese former Beaumont lands included the manors of Umberleigh and [[Heanton Punchardon]] in North Devon. However, as deduced by Byrne (1981), Basset lacked the financial resources to recover his inheritance,<ref name=\"auto1\">Byrne, p. 313</ref> which involved paying fines and recoveries to the King. At the time he had been married for 30 years<ref name=\"auto1\"/> to his first wife Elizabeth Denys and had given up any hope of producing a surviving son and heir. In order to make the best of his situation, he obtained financing for the recoveries from [[Giles Daubeney, 1st Baron Daubeney]] (1451\u20131508), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], under a special agreement entered into in 1504, referred to by the family as the \"Great Indenture\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Transcribed in Byrne, vol.4, chapter 7, appendix 2</ref> This specified that Daubeney would pay about \u00a32,000 for the recoveries on condition that one of the Basset daughters and co-heiresses would marry Daubeney's son [[Henry Daubeney, 1st Earl of Bridgewater|Henry Daubeney]] (1493\u20131548) (later created [[Earl of Bridgewater]]), then aged 10, before his 16th birthday. The purpose was to entail the Beaumont lands upon the male issue of a Daubeney-Basset marriage, thus increasing the future wealth of the Daubeney family. However the indenture allowed for Sir John Basset and any future wives of his to retain possession during their lives of Umberleigh and lands in Bickington. If the scheme should fail due to the marriage not taking place and in default of other provisions, the lands would revert to the right heirs of Basset. To this effect Basset sent two of his four daughters by Elizabeth Denys, namely Anne and Thomasine, to live in the Daubeney household. The marriage never did take place and Lord Daubeny died four years later in 1508. Whether for those reasons or another the gamble paid off for Basset as his 2nd wife Honor Grenville produced for him a son and heir in 1518 and the Beaumont lands came back to the Basset family. During the time when the agreement was operative the deeds to the properties concerned were kept in safe custody by [[Richard Coffin (1456-1523)|Richard Coffin]] (1456\u20131523)<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p. 605; Vivian, p. 208, pedigree of Coffin; Byrne, vol.1, p. 606: \"died in Dec 1523 at age of 77\"</ref> of [[Portledge Manor|Portledge]], [[Sheriff of Devon]] in 1510,<ref>[[Tristram Risdon|Risdon, Tristram]] (d. 1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions; Pevsner, p. 477</ref> the Beaumont's tenant at Heanton Punchardon and at East Hagginton<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p. 605; East Hagginton had descended to the Beaumonts from the Punchardon (''Pont de Chardin\") family of Heanton and in Risdon's time (d. 1640) was still held by the Coffin family.

Detail from top slab of his chest-tomb, Atherington Church, Devon]]\nSir John Basset married twice, producing in total 12 children. His first wife failed to provide him with a surviving son and heir and he appears to have lost all hope of having a son, hence his conveyance of his Beaumont inheritance to Lord Daubeney, retaining only Umberleigh for his life. However, after a long marriage his first wife died unexpectedly and Basset found himself at the age of 53 remarried to a new 22-year-old bride, who would provide him with the desired son and heir. The problem then was how to recover for him the Beaumont inheritance conveyed to Lord Daubeney. This legal struggle, which Lady Lisle pursued vigorously over many years and which was ultimately successful, occupies much of the Lisle Papers.\n\n===First marriage===\n[[File:DenysOfOrleighArms.PNG|thumb|200px|Arms of Denys of Orleigh: ''Azure, three Danish battle axes erect or''.<ref>Vivian, Heraldic Visitationms of Devon, 1895, p.281, pedigree of Denys of Orleigh; as seen on ledger stone of Elizabeth Denys (1625\u20131664) on floor of Orleigh Chapel, Buckland Brewer Church, Devon</ref> As engraved on monumental brasses on Sir John Basset's tomb]]\n[[File:JohnBassettSlab AtheringtonDevon.JPG|thumb|200px|Top slab of chest-tomb of Sir John Basset (1462\u20131529) of Umberleigh, inset with [[monumental brass]]es of himself, his two wives, and their children with heraldic escutcheons.

Whilst Lord Lisle was the [[Governor of Calais]], John Basset's children were moved there and were educated in France. Lord and Lady Lisle were apparently very happily married. Honor was a forceful woman, who wrote many letters to friends at court, ensuring that they were kept well-informed. These letters are preserved today as the [[Lisle Letters]] and give a valuable account of developments during the reign of Henry VIII.\n\n==Career of daughters at court==\nHonor finally succeeded in getting one of her young daughters appointed as a maid-of-honour to [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane Seymour]] in 1537, who had asked her to send two to court for her selection. She chose Anne over Catherine.  Anne Basset subsequently became known at court for her beauty and respectability. Her first appearance as maid-of-honour was at Jane Seymour's funeral. During the interval of two years whilst the king remained without a new wife Anne spent much time at court and received expensive presents from the King. She went on to serve three more Queens, [[Anne of Cleves]], [[Katherine Howard]] and [[Catherine Parr|Katherine Parr]]. Despite Lord Lisle's arrest for treason in 1540, her sister Katherine Basset, and her mother eventually joined her at court.\n\n==Daughter possible bride for King Henry VIII==\nIn 1542 [[Chapuys]], the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] ambassador, reported that on the eve of Catherine Howard's execution, the king appeared besotted with Anne Basset, and that she was a possible sixth wife. This eventuality may have been ruined by Anne's own family as her sister Elizabeth Basset favoured the King marrying her own mistress, Anne of Cleves, and made comments implying that this seemed to be what God wanted. She also said, \"What a man is our king? How many wives will he have?\", which was reported to the King and resulted in her being judicially questioned, a serious matter as under the treason laws her remarks might have warranted the death penalty. The Basset family continued to serve at the courts of Henry VIII's children.\n\n==Death and burial==\nSir John died on 31 January 1528 aged 66. Some of his children were still infants and the wardship and marriage of his son and heir John Basset aged 9 was purchased for 200 marks jointly by his mother Honor and John Worth of [[Compton Pole]].<ref>Byrne, vol 1, p. 315</ref> The wardship was later acquired by his step-father and future father-in-law Viscount Lisle before 1532<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p. 316</ref> Sir John Basset was buried in his family's private [[Holy Trinity Chapel, Umberleigh|Holy Trinity Chapel]] (now largely demolished), next to his manor house of Umberleigh.\n\n===Will===\nSir John Basset left a will dated 6 November 1527, now lost but of which parts were transcribed by the 18th-century herald [[John Anstis|Anstis]].<ref name=\"auto7\">Byrne, vol 1, p. 314</ref>\nHe listed his feoffees, amongst whom were Roger Graynfild (i.e. Grenville), who were directed to \"keep every year a solemn dirige and the morrow upon three masses for the good estate of the said Sir John Basset and Honour his wife\" and of various members of the Grenville family.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> He left his wife Honor, until she remarried, all the rents and profits of his manors of Trevalga, Femarshall, Whitechapel, Holcombe, Upcott Snellard and Calston, from which she was to pay his debts and also provide dowries of 100 marks each on the marriages on each of his daughters Jane, Thomasine, Philippa, Katharine and Mary.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> His marriage settlement of 1515 had already provided that Honor should have as her jointure the manor and advowson of Tehidy, the manor of Umberleigh, and lands in Bickington and Atherington.<ref>Byrne, vol 1, pp. 314\u20135</ref>\n\n===Monument===\nHis [[chest tomb]] with [[monumental brass]]es on top, of himself between his two wives with his children below in two small groups exists in St Mary's Church, [[Atherington, Devon|Atherington]], to where it was moved in 1818 from Umberleigh Chapel.<ref>Byrne, 1981, vol.1, Appendix 6, \"The Atherington Brass\", p. 699</ref> The [[Lisle Letters]] record some details concerning the making of the tomb.

Roger Clark, a retired [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] officer with expertise in police shootings, said that prosecutors at the hearing treated him with hostility and \"disdain\" for concluding that Loehmann and Garmback had acted recklessly; he also described the prosecutors' as using theatrics, like none he'd ever seen in previous grand jury proceedings, which he believed were intended to lead the grand jurors to the conclusion that the prosecutors wanted them to reach. Jeffrey Noble, another retired police officer and expert in use-of-force cases (who had himself used deadly force on the job), said he was attacked by prosecutors for saying that the officers never should have escalated the situation by rushing Rice, adding, \"I\u2019ve definitely never seen two prosecutors play defense attorney so well.\" And Jesse Wobrock, a biomechanics expert hired by the Rice family's lawyers, also described the prosecutors as \"acting in a way like they were defense attorneys for the cops,\" and as having attacked him professionally for his testimony regarding the timing and significance of body movements by Loehmann and Rice, as seen on video footage of the shooting. (A spokesman for McGinty's office said the three experts were only presenting \"one side\" of the story, but he could not elaborate because prosecutors are bound by grand jury secrecy laws.)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tamir Rice Story: How to Make a Police Shooting Disappear |url=https://www.gq.com/story/tamir-rice-story |publisher=[[GQ]] |author=Sean Flynn |date=July 14, 2016 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the next Democratic primary for Cuyahoga County district attorney, in March 2016, McGinty lost to challenger Michael O'Malley, who received 55.8 percent of the vote.

However, amid accusations from lawyers representing the Rice family that McGinty had deliberately chosen Crawford and Sims because of their \"pro-police bias\" in order to cover for Loehmann and Garmback, McGinty convened a grand jury to consider whether or not criminal charges should be brought against the officers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand jury hearing evidence in Tamir Rice shooting |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/10/grand_jury_hearing_evidence_in.html |publisher=Cleveland.com |author=Cory Shaffer |date=October 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn December 28, McGinty reported that the grand jury had decided not to indict Loehmann or Garmback, saying, \"Given this perfect storm of human error, mistakes, and communications by all involved that day, the evidence did not indicate criminal conduct by police.\" The announcement prompted Rice's mother to release a statement accusing McGinty of mishandling the investigation, stating in part, \"Prosecutor McGinty deliberately sabotaged the case, never advocating for my son, and acting instead like the police officers' defense attorney.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Tamir Rice shooting: No charges for officers |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/28/us/tamir-rice-shooting/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThree expert witnesses who testified before the grand jury criticized the prosecutors' behavior during the grand jury. Roger Clark, a retired [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] officer with expertise in police shootings, said that prosecutors at the hearing treated him with hostility and \"disdain\" for concluding that Loehmann and Garmback had acted recklessly; he also described the prosecutors' as using theatrics, like none he'd ever seen in previous grand jury proceedings, which he believed were intended to lead the grand jurors to the conclusion that the prosecutors wanted them to reach. Jeffrey Noble, another retired police officer and expert in use-of-force cases (who had himself used deadly force on the job), said he was attacked by prosecutors for saying that the officers never should have escalated the situation by rushing Rice, adding, \"I\u2019ve definitely never seen two prosecutors play defense attorney so well.\" And Jesse Wobrock, a biomechanics expert hired by the Rice family's lawyers, also described the prosecutors as \"acting in a way like they were defense attorneys for the cops,\" and as having attacked him professionally for his testimony regarding the timing and significance of body movements by Loehmann and Rice, as seen on video footage of the shooting. (A spokesman for McGinty's office said the three experts were only presenting \"one side\" of the story, but he could not elaborate because prosecutors are bound by grand jury secrecy laws.)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tamir Rice Story: How to Make a Police Shooting Disappear |url=https://www.gq.com/story/tamir-rice-story |publisher=[[GQ]] |author=Sean Flynn |date=July 14, 2016 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the next Democratic primary for Cuyahoga County district attorney, in March 2016, McGinty lost to challenger Michael O'Malley, who received 55.8 percent of the vote.

He witnessed and described several major events in the first part of the 20th century.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born at Mark, near Highbridge, Somerset. Graduating in Slavonic studies from [[University of London|London University]], he expanded his education in Germany and Russia. He took up teaching in the Continent and established a language school in [[Riga]].<ref name=TimesObit>Obituary, ''The Times''. London. 17 May 1945, page 7.</ref>\n\nUrch eventually lectured at [[Riga Technical University|Riga Polytechnic]] prior to the First World War. In 1915, fleeing the advancing German army, Urch and his family arrived at Moscow where he witnessed the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]]. In 1936 he published a book: ''We Generally Shoot Englishmen, An English Schoolmaster's five years of mild adventure in Moscow, 1915\u201320'', where he described what he saw and experienced there.\n\nIn this book Urch told the story of a rather ordinary English family not connected with any official missions, consulates, or services, in the years before, during and after the Russian revolution. The family, a husband, a wife, a son born in 1911, and a daughter born in 1914, fled [[Latvia]] before the arrival of the advancing German troops and eventually made it to Moscow, with little besides their hand-luggage and a trusty maid to help with the tiny children. There they made living by teaching English. While living in Moscow they witnessed the changes from Tsarist-autocratic to Bolshevist-autocratic rule.\n\nIn 1918 Urch was arrested by the [[Cheka]], the Soviet state security organisation. No explanation of his arrest and imprisonment had been given. After two months in prison he was released but not allowed to leave Russia. Only later it became clear to him why he was arrested. He had found out it was due to a denunciation. A fellow member of the House Committee accused him of swindling the House Committee, pocketing the money subscribed for the purchase of products, and stealing the Committee's milk. The accuser died a few months later in a lunatic asylum.\n\nIn 1919 Edith, his wife, and children were allowed to leave Russia. In 1920 the man himself was sent by train across the border to [[Finland]], together with other English citizens. They were exchanged for Bolshevists held by Britain; for each English citizen Britain released 42\u00bd Bolshevists. \n  \nOwing to poor economic circumstances in England after the war, Urch returned to [[Riga]], where he took up employment in 1920 as editor of the Latvian government's English-language commerce publication, ''The Latvian Economist''. Shortly thereafter, in 1922, Urch also took up duties as the Russian affairs correspondence for ''[[The Times]]''; he left his Latvian employ in 1926 to become their full-time correspondent.<ref name=TimesObit />\n\nIn his article \"Bolshevism and religion in Russia\" (1923) Urch told the story of the struggle between the Bolshevik regime and the Russian Orthodox Church. Russia's great millions were suffering immensely and being slaughtered in their thousands, yet they were still clinging to their religion. The Bolsheviki moved cautiously against the church. They began by placarding public places with the legend: 'Religion is a narcotic for the people,' and removing ikons from public places. Later, these ikons were, in some cases, allowed to be put back; Urch remembered seeing some of them in their usual places as late as 1920. The Bolsheviki seemed to recognise that the temper of the people was not yet sufficiently under control for drastic measures against the Church.\n\nGradually it all changed. Private property was abolished and people were divided into categories for the distribution of food by the state, some categories receiving more, other less. Priests were not included in any categories: they had no food-cards, and \u201cby living they were actually committing a crime, for they were forbidden to buy food or anything \u2013 they were left to starve.\u201d The next step was the dismissals of bishops and priests, followed by trials by the Soviet tribunal for counter-revolution, that resulted in them being shot, or being banished to remote parts of Russia, or being sentenced to long terms of imprisonment with hard labour. With the rising generations the Bolsheviki hoped for better results, and that \u201cthe total disappearance of religion from Russia is only a matter of time.\u201d\n\nIn 1927 he and Edith published a book ''English'', a manual for studying English. Another book ''Latvia, Country and people'', was first published in 1935 in Riga and later in 1938 in London. In this book Urch told the story of Latvia, its history, struggle for independence, economy, education, art, music, and so on. The book is not a travel guide in the [[Baedeker]] sense, that is, a book of comprehensive information about places designed for the use of visitors or tourists, but rather a presentation of sites of interest to the occasional visitor through their historical context. However, it includes also practical tips.\n\nIn 1939 he published ''The Rabbit King of Russia''. In this book Urch told the stories of several mind-boggling absurd Soviet projects. The narrative is accompanied with footnotes and the reader must believe it all was true. One such project, that seems to have been quite successful, involved arresting foreign nationals and freeing them for ransom paid by relatives living abroad. This scheme was run by the Chek\u00e1 and the foreign currency gained helped maintaining the regime. Other projects involved attempts to supersede the cow by producing milk supplies from soya bean, the creation of a dog-wool industry by shearing the dogs of Russia, the scheme to produce motor-oil from the bodies of Russia's untold millions of locusts to lubricate her thousands of agricultural tractors, the rounding up the bugs and beetles of Russia to found a State Beetle-soap industry, using tadpoles as excellent swine-fodder, and the \"immense rabbit-farms designed to feed and rescue Russia's millions from enforced vegetarianism due to the depletion of ordinary flocks of herds.\" Urch wrote that \"if a plan was large, new and startling, it was always practically sure of adoption though some were so inherently bizarre that even with the highest patronage they could not have a long innings\". One major figure behind several of those projects was Greg\u00f3riy (Grisha) Ant\u00f3novich Phil\u00edppoff, aka 'the Rabbit King of Russia'. By exposing these projects, which persistently remained concealed, Urch aimed at warning the Western countries from making fair deals with Soviet Russia.\n\nUrch transferred to [[Warsaw]] in 1938, where he lived through the German invasion in 1939 and then escaped to [[Stockholm]]. When the [[Winter War]] between Russia and Finland broke, he was sent as a special correspondent to Finland. He spent time with the troops, getting a firsthand experience of the fighting, which was reflected in his reporting.\n\nIn June 1941, came German attack on Russia. His dispatches were read with interest not only by the general reader but also by professional soldiers.<ref name=TimesObit />\n\nUrch died suddenly on 15 May 1945, in Stockholm. In an obituary published by ''[[The Times]]'' on 12 June 1945, pg. 7, Mr. Peter Tennant wrote:\n\n::It was with a feeling of profound distress that I read of the death of your Special Correspondent in Stockholm, R. O. G. Urch. I knew him well during my years in Stockholm as Press Attach\u00e9 and greatly valued his friendship, wisdom, and whimsical sense of humour. In spite of having spent the greater part of his life in Russia and the Baltic States and Eastern Europe, he remained solidly British to the core, and in the dark days of 1940 and 1941, when our country stood alone and later when Russia was invaded and retreating before German onslaught, Oliver Urch remained calm and unperturbed, always ready to persuade those who doubted in the allies of the certainty of allied victory. In an atmosphere in which it was difficult even for the best of journalists to distinguish truth from fiction he maintained the highest standards of journalism. He was universally beloved and respected by his colleagues of the allied Press in Stockholm, and his kindness, modesty, and wise judgment will be remembered gratefully by his numerous Scandinavian friends.\n\nThe Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' published an obituary already the day after his death (in Swedish, here translated into English):\n\n::The doyen of foreign journalists brought to Stockholm by the war, Mr. R.O.G. Urch, correspondent for The Times, passed away last Tuesday afternoon at [[Serafimerlasarettet]] (Serafimer Hospital), where he had been brought earlier that day due to a severe heart attack. The direct cause of death was a blood clot in the heart. He was 61 years old last Sunday.\n\n::The small colony of foreign journalists in Stockholm loses with Reginald Oliver Gillings Urch an extraordinary competent and conscientious member, and together with them many of their Swedish colleagues feel regret for a good and faithful professional friend. His confident and bright temper, his willingness to listen and help, and his rich fund of knowledge, impossible to hide by his distinctive personal modesty, provided him both affection and respect in all circles. Urch had spent the last five years studying and describing the German warfare and politics from the Stockholm horizon. Especially during the first years of the German-Russian war, his clear and modest daily analyses of the situation at the war front attracted much attention, since it was quite difficult for the English press to get a reliable picture from their reporters in Moscow of what was going on. Insofar as he treated Swedish affairs, which he seldom did, he always made an effort to correctly and often benevolently report the Swedish views.\n\n::As a journalist, Urch had an unusual career. Already in 1907, as a young man, he came to Riga, where he worked as a teacher of English until the outbreak of the World War. He focused from the beginning on thoroughly learning Russian, and he published several frequently used textbooks in English. He spent the war years in Moscow, where he for some time held a teaching position at the university. During the revolutionary years, he was imprisoned for a short time by the Bolsheviks. This experience marks the culmination in a book about his adventures in Russia during the war, much later published under the title ''We generally shoot Englishmen''. After his release and some time in England in the twenties, he returned to Riga, but did not remain as a language teacher for long. From 1922 and up to 1938 he worked as a correspondent for The Times in Riga with the aim to cover the large Russian field. He did this work together with his wife with great energy and almost scientific thoroughness \u2013 his reports were often echoed in the world press and in the British House of Commons. He was moved to Warsaw the year before the outbreak of the war, still mainly as a reporter on Russia. He was in Finland during the Winter War, and came from there to Stockholm in May 1940.\n\n::The late journalist is primarily mourned by his spouse in Stockholm and a son and a daughter in England.\n\n== Personal life ==\nUrch married in 1909 and had a son and daughter.

On 15 March, WHO issued a heightened global health alert about a mysterious pneumonia with a case definition of SARS after cases in Singapore and Canada were also identified. The alert included a rare emergency travel advisory to international travelers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities. The [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) issued a travel advisory stating that persons considering travel to the affected areas in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and China) should not go.\n\nOn 17 March, an international network of 11 laboratories was established to determine the cause of SARS and develop potential treatments. The CDC held its first briefing on SARS and said that 14 suspected SARS cases were being investigated in the US.

The residents of the building were later transferred to the quarantined [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village on 1 April because the building was deemed a health hazard.\n\nMost of the cases were linked to apartments with a north-western orientation which shared the same sewage pipe. According to government officials, the virus was brought into the estate by an infected [[kidney]] patient (the type of kidney illness was not specified) after discharge from [[Prince of Wales Hospital]], who visited his elder brother living on the seventh floor. Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by [[airborne transmission]], through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate's balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.\n\n=== April 2003 ===\nOn 1 April, the U.S. government called back non-essential personnel in their consulate office in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The US government also advised US citizens not to travel to the region.\n\nOn 2 April, Chinese medical officials began reporting the status of the SARS outbreak. China's southern Guangdong province reported 361 new infections and 9 new deaths, increasing the total [[Mainland China]] figures previously reported at end-February.

He never recovered and died in the Intensive Care Unit on 4 March.\n\nLiu is believed to have been a SARS super-spreader: 23 other Metropole guests developed SARS, including seven from the ninth floor. Liu's brother-in-law, who sought treatment in late February, was hospitalized in Kwong Wah Hospital on 1 March and died on 19 March.

He fell ill during the flight and told a friend waiting at Bangkok not to touch him, to call an ambulance and take him to a hospital. He was isolated in an Intensive Care Unit. A similar outbreak of a mysterious respiratory infection was reported among Hong Kong healthcare workers.\n\nOn 12 March, WHO issued a global alert about a new infectious disease of unknown origin in both Vietnam and Hong Kong. On 15 March, WHO issued a heightened global health alert about a mysterious pneumonia with a case definition of SARS after cases in Singapore and Canada were also identified. The alert included a rare emergency travel advisory to international travelers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities. The [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) issued a travel advisory stating that persons considering travel to the affected areas in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and China) should not go.\n\nOn 17 March, an international network of 11 laboratories was established to determine the cause of SARS and develop potential treatments. The CDC held its first briefing on SARS and said that 14 suspected SARS cases were being investigated in the US. On 20 March, WHO reported that several hospitals in Vietnam and Hong Kong were operating with half the usual staff because many workers stayed home out of fear of getting infected. WHO raised the concern that substandard care of the infected patients might contribute to the spread of the disease.\n\nOn 25 March, Hong Kong authorities stated that nine tourists had contracted the disease from a mainland Chinese man who had boarded the same plane on 15 March, [[Air China Flight 112]] to Beijing.<ref name=Koh2003>{{Cite journal|last=Koh|first=D.|last2=Lim|first2=M.

The balcony was completely closed and guarded by the police. The residents of the building were later transferred to the quarantined [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village on 1 April because the building was deemed a health hazard.\n\nMost of the cases were linked to apartments with a north-western orientation which shared the same sewage pipe. According to government officials, the virus was brought into the estate by an infected [[kidney]] patient (the type of kidney illness was not specified) after discharge from [[Prince of Wales Hospital]], who visited his elder brother living on the seventh floor. Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by [[airborne transmission]], through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate's balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.\n\n=== April 2003 ===\nOn 1 April, the U.S. government called back non-essential personnel in their consulate office in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The US government also advised US citizens not to travel to the region.\n\nOn 2 April, Chinese medical officials began reporting the status of the SARS outbreak. China's southern Guangdong province reported 361 new infections and 9 new deaths, increasing the total [[Mainland China]] figures previously reported at end-February. The virus was also detected in Beijing and Shanghai. The WHO also advised travellers to avoid Hong Kong and Guangdong during a press briefing.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/sars/press2003_04_01/en/ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome \u2013 Press briefing] 1 April 2003 ''www.who.int''.

The first medical worker infected with SARS died in Hong Kong. The doctor's daughter and infected wife survived his illness, even though the wife was also among the quarantined medical workers under intensive care. Hong Kong school closures were extended by two weeks to 21 April.\n\nOn 4 April, the WHO team inspected the first infection case in Foshan County. The male infected four people. But, he did not infect his family. A 40-year-old woman became the first local case in Shanghai. A Chinese health specialist admitted at a press conference of not informing the public early enough about the outbreak. The PRC Health Minister also claimed that the disease has been under control in most parts of mainland China. He also released the names of seven drugs which he claimed to be effective in curing SARS. WHO officials said that the information provided by the PRC about the disease has been \"very detailed\".{{cn|date=January 2020}} US government enforced compulsory quarantine of an infected person.\n\nOn 5 April, the Singapore government announced that school closures would be extended.

The last intake to its Primary Department was August 1955.\n\nHarris Academy moved to Lawton Road in 2013 as its former Perth Road building gets revamped. On 22 June 2015, it was announced that [[Menzieshill High School]] would shut down and pupils are to transfer to Harris Academy in 2016 when the new Perth Road building is completed. 18 councillors voted in favour for Menzieshill High School to close with 14 councillors against the closure. In June 2016 the pupils from Menzieshill high were then forced to move to the newly built Harris Academy. Which was a hard move for all who too part in the move.\n\n==Uniform==\nThe uniform of Harris Academy is a three button blazer in maroon with the school badge embroidered on the left front pocket. It is compulsory for pupils to wear a white shirt with black trousers or skirt but not the maroon blazer. Prefects wear yellow bands on the arms of their blazers. The Harris tie is a maroon tie striped with yellow and black.

There is also special ties that the School and House Captains wear and there is also peer support ties that are worn by pupils who help first year pupils throughout the year.\n\n== Buildings and grounds ==\n\n=== Park Place building (1885-1931) ===\nHarris Academy's original building was located at Park Place in Dundee which opened on 31 August 1885. The Park Place building officially opened on 2 September 1885.\n\nDue to the popularity of the school by more pupils joining Harris Academy, the Park Place building was too small for pupils to fit and therefore moved to Perth Road.\n\n===Former Perth Road building (1931-2013)===\n\nThe main building was built in 1931 after the school population outgrew the previous Park Place building and was officially opened by [[James Irvine (chemist)|Sir James Irvine]], principal of St. Andrews University on 1 May 1931.\n\nThe former Perth Road building housed the Modern Languages department, the Social Subjects departments, the Science departments, The Religious Education department, the Craft and Design department, the Mathematics department, Assembly Hall, the Guidance base, Year-Heads' offices, and the Rector's office.\n\nThe Crawford Lodge annex to the west of the main school was purchased by the Town Council in 1946 as an extension to the school. Classics and modern languages were taught there. It was burnt down in 1958 and remained a shell till it was replaced by the new buildings in the late 1960s. This houses the Computing and Business Studies departments, the Home Economics department, the English department, the Art department, the school library, the careers base, the Dining hall, two of the three gyms, and the school's swimming pool.\n\nIn addition to these there is also a Music Block housing the Music department as well as rooms for music tuition; and a substantial Games Hall building with a fitness room. The school has access to a wrought-iron footbridge over the Dundee-Perth railway line to playing fields at the Riverside.\n\nNot far from the school are the school sports grounds at Elliot Road. These include a recently improved pavilion, a rugby pitch and several football or hockey fields. In summer time, it is converted to Athletics tracks.\n\n====Blackness Road Annexe (1970s - 1990s) ====\n\nIn the late 1970s the school experienced a boom in numbers, as a result of its conversion from a Senior Secondary School to a [[comprehensive school]] (it was never known as a 'grammar school'). In addition to its Perth Road buildings, Harris Academy took over the premises of Logie Junior Secondary School on Blackness Road, Dundee.\n\nThe school was split with 1st and 2nd years attending Harris Academy in the Blackness annexe, 3rd to 6th Years continued at the Perth Road building.

On 22 June 2015, it was announced that [[Menzieshill High School]] would shut down and pupils are to transfer to Harris Academy in 2016 when the new Perth Road building is completed. 18 councillors voted in favour for Menzieshill High School to close with 14 councillors against the closure. In June 2016 the pupils from Menzieshill high were then forced to move to the newly built Harris Academy. Which was a hard move for all who too part in the move.\n\n==Uniform==\nThe uniform of Harris Academy is a three button blazer in maroon with the school badge embroidered on the left front pocket. It is compulsory for pupils to wear a white shirt with black trousers or skirt but not the maroon blazer. Prefects wear yellow bands on the arms of their blazers. The Harris tie is a maroon tie striped with yellow and black.
