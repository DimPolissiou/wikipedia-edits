Here he also built up the only provision that exists in the Nordic countries for the instrument bandoneon.

Players assume the role of [[Gordon Freeman]], a scientist who must find his way out of the Black Mesa Research Facility after an experiment with an alien material goes wrong. The core [[gameplay]] consists of fighting alien and human enemies with a variety of weapons and solving puzzles. Unlike many other games at the time, the player has almost complete uninterrupted control of Freeman, and the story is told mostly through [[scripted sequence]]s seen through his eyes.\n\nValve co-founder [[Gabe Newell]] said the team aimed to create an immersive world rather than a \"shooting gallery\". ''Half-Life'' received critical acclaim for its graphics, realistic gameplay, and seamless narrative. It won over fifty [[PC game|PC]] \"[[Game of the Year]]\" awards and is considered one of the most influential games of the first-person shooter genre, as well as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]]. By 2008, the game had sold over 9 million copies.\n\n''Half-Life'' received the [[expansion pack]]s ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'' (1999) and ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]'' (2001). The game was ported to the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001, along with another expansion ''[[Half-Life: Decay]]'', as well as to [[macOS]] and [[Linux kernel|Linux]] in 2013. The game's [[Game engine|engine]], [[GoldSrc]], is a heavily modified version of the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], licensed from [[id Software]]. Valve ported ''Half-Life'' to its [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engine in 2004, while a Valve-endorsed commercial fan remake, ''[[Black Mesa (video game)|Black Mesa]]'', was released in 2020.\n\n''Half-Life'' sparked numerous fan-made [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]], several of them becoming standalone games, notably ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Day of Defeat]]'' and ''[[Sven Co-op]]''. A sequel, ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', was released in 2004, followed by [[Half-Life 2: Episode One|episodic]] [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|extensions]], and ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'' in 2020.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Halflife ingame.jpg|thumb|left|In this scene, the player must bypass a dam reservoir guarded by an [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache]] attack helicopter, a squad of soldiers, and a gun emplacement.]]\n\n''Half-Life'' is a [[first-person shooter]] that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike most of its peers at the time, ''Half-Life'' used scripted sequences, such as a [[Vortigaunt]] ramming down a door, to advance major plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on [[cutscene|cut-scene intermissions]] to detail their plotlines, ''Half-Life''{{'}}s story is told mostly using scripted sequences (bar one short cutscene), keeping the player in control of the [[first-person (video games)|first-person viewpoint]]. In line with this, the player rarely loses the ability to control the [[player character]], who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees \"through his eyes\" for the entire length of the game. ''Half-Life'' has no \"levels\"; it instead divides the game into chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous, except for short pauses for loading.<ref name=\"game guide\">{{cite book |title=Half-Life : Prima's Official Strategy Guide |author=Bell, Joe Grant |date=November 25, 1998 |publisher=[[Prima Games]] |isbn=0-7615-1360-4}}</ref>\n\nThe game regularly integrates puzzles, such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to. Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning a valve to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the boss. Late in the game, the player receives a \"long jump module\" for the [[HEV suit]], which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping. The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style [[jumping puzzles]] in [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] toward the end of the game.<ref name=\"game guide\" />\n\nFor the most part the player battles through the game alone, but is occasionally assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player; the guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information. An array of alien enemies populate the game, including [[headcrab]]s, [[Creatures in the Half-Life series|bullsquids]], and [[Headcrab#Headcrab zombie|headcrab zombies]]. The player also faces human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins.\n\n''Half-Life'' includes online multiplayer support for both individual and team-based [[deathmatch]] modes.<ref name=\"IGNrev\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nPhysicist [[Gordon Freeman]] arrives late for work at the  [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. He dons his Hazardous Environment (HEV) suit to carry out an experiment; pushing an unusual material into a machine for analysis. During the experiment, the spectrometer explodes, creating a \"resonance cascade\" that opens a portal to another dimension, [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]]. Surviving scientists urge Gordon to head to the surface, where he defends himself against hostile Xen creatures and government Marines sent to [[Cover-up|cover up]] the incident.\n\nHeading to the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have found a way to close the portal. Gordon travels to the other end of the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a [[rocket engine test facility]] to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by marines and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility. There, he discovers Xen specimens collected before the incident. Overwhelmed by the aliens, the Marines pull out of Black Mesa and begin airstrikes. Scaling cliffs, navigating destroyed buildings, and traversing through underground water channels, Gordon arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists learn  the portal is being forced open on the other side by an immensely powerful entity. They have developed teleportation technology that allows Gordon to travel to Xen, where he is tasked to stop the entity.\n\nIn Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers before him and defeats Gonarch, a huge egg-laying headcrab. At a factory creating alien soldiers, he enters a portal that sends him to a vast cave. There, Gordon confronts the Nihilanth, the entity maintaining the rift, and destroys it. Gordon is summoned by the mysterious [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], who has been watching his progress in Black Mesa and praises him. The G-Man explains his \"employers\" wish to employ Gordon. If Gordon refuses, he is teleported to an area full of alien soldiers to be killed immediately. If Gordon accepts, the G-Man congratulates him and places him into stasis to await his task.\n\n== Development ==\n{{quote box| quote = ''Half-Life'' in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization of the experience of the first-person genre. Many of us had fallen in love with video games because of the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] possibilities of the field and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities. Our hope was that building worlds and characters would be more compelling than building shooting galleries.\n| source = \u2014Valve president [[Gabe Newell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/story_type/site_trail_story/interview-gabe-newell/ |title=Interview: Gabe Newell |date=November 25, 2011 |author=Tufnell, Nicholas |work=The Cambridge Student Online |accessdate=November 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126125407/http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/story_type/site_trail_story/interview-gabe-newell/ |archivedate=November 26, 2011 }}</ref>| align = right| width = 20%| salign = right}}\n\n[[Valve Corporation|Valve]], based in [[Kirkland, Washington]], was founded in 1996 by former [[Microsoft]] employees [[Mike Harrington]] and [[Gabe Newell]].<ref name=\"fhhalflife2\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part2.html |title=Final Hours of Half-Life: The Microsoft Millionaires |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 12, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520110111/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part2.html |archivedate=May 20, 2012 }}</ref> For its first product, Valve settled on a concept for a horror first-person shooter (FPS) game using the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]] licensed from [[id Software]].<ref name=\"flhalflife22\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part22.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: The id visit |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 12, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223141855/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part22.html |archivedate=February 23, 2011 }}</ref> Valve eventually modified 70%{{Citation needed|reason=70% figure not in cited Gamespot article|date=November 2019}} of the engine's code, adding [[skeletal animation]] and [[Direct3D]] support.<ref name=\"fhhalflife2\" />\n\nThe game was initially inspired by FPS games ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' (1996), [[Stephen King]]'s 1980 novella ''[[The Mist (novella)|The Mist]]'', and a 1963 episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' titled \"[[The Borderland]]\".<ref name=\"raisebar\">{{cite book|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|author=Hodgson, David|publisher=Prima Games|year=2004|isbn=0-7615-4364-3}}</ref> According to designer Harry Teasley, id's 1993 game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was a major influence, and the team wanted ''Half-Life'' to \"scare you like ''Doom'' did\".

They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game and then spent a month iterating on the level.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\"/> When the rest of the team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as \"''[[Die Hard]]'' meets ''[[Evil Dead]]''\", they agreed to use it as a baseline.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\"/> The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, it had several interesting things happen in it, all triggered by the player rather than a timer, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level responded to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" />\n\nTo move forward with this unified design, Valve sought a game designer but found no one suitable. Instead, Valve created the \"cabal\", initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six-hour meetings four days a week. The cabal was responsible for all elements of design, including level layouts, key events, enemy designs, narrative, and the introduction of gameplay elements relative to the story.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" /> The collaboration proved successful, and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed, mini-cabals formed from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements. Membership in the main cabal rotated since commitment required created [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" />\n\nThe cabal produced a 200-page [[game design document|design document]] detailing nearly every aspect of the game. They also produced a 30-page document for the narrative, and hired science fiction novelist [[Marc Laidlaw]] to help manage that script.<ref name=\"fhhalflife3\" /><ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" /> Laidlaw said his contribution was to add \"old storytelling tricks\" to the team's ambitious designs: \"I was in awe of [the team]. It felt to me like I was just borrowing from old standards while they were the ones doing something truly new.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/marc-laidlaw/|title=Marc Laidlaw (Valve) - Interview|date=2017-07-17|website=Arcade Attack|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> Rather than dictate narrative elements \"from some kind of ivory tower of authorial inspiration\", he worked with the team to improvise ideas, and was inspired by their experiments.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, the opening train ride was conceived after an engineer implemented train code for another concept.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWithin a month of the cabal's formation, the other team members started detailed game development, and within another month began [[playtesting]] through Sierra. The cabal was intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting. They noted any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzles and made them into [[action item]]s to be fixed on the next iteration. Later, with most of the main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to fine-tune levels further.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" /> Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for ''Half-Life''{{'}}s success, and was reused for ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' from the start.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" />\n\nMuch of the detail of ''Half-Life''{{'}}s development has been lost; according to employee Erik Johnson, two or three months before release, their [[Microsoft Visual SourceSafe|Visual SourceSafe]] \"exploded\"; logs of technical changes from before the final month of development were lost, and code had to be recovered from individual computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291408/Valve_explains_why_well_never_see_the_full_history_of_HalfLifes_development.php |title=Valve explains why we'll never see the full history of Half-Life's development |last=Wawro |first=Alex |date=February 13, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214102632/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291408/Valve_explains_why_well_never_see_the_full_history_of_HalfLifes_development.php |archivedate=February 14, 2017 |url-status=live |accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Half-Life'' was released in November 1998.<ref name=\"fhhalflife5\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part5.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: Reassembling the Pieces |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225022620/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part5.html |archivedate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref> The revised version of ''Half-Life'' shown at E3 1998 was given [[Game Critics Awards]] for \"Best PC Game\" and \"Best Action Game\".<ref name=\"fhhalflife4\" /> Valve released two [[game demo|demos]] for ''Half-Life.''

It introduced several new weapons, new [[non-player character]]s, both friendly and hostile and new, previously unseen areas of the facility.\n\n''Blue Shift'' returns the player to ''Half-Life''{{'}}s Black Mesa timeline once more, this time as [[Barney Calhoun]], one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was initially developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. ''Blue Shift'' came with the [[Half-Life High Definition Pack|High Definition pack]], that gave the player the option to update the look of ''Half-Life'', ''Opposing Force'', and the new ''Blue Shift'' content.\n\n''Decay'' was another expansion by Gearbox, released only as an extra with the PlayStation 2 version of ''Half-Life''. The add-on featured co-operative gameplay in which two players could solve puzzles or fight against the many foes in the ''Half-Life'' universe.\n\nIn 2000, a compilation pack, ''Half-Life: Platinum Pack,'' was released, including (with their respective manuals) ''Half-Life'', ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''Half-Life: Opposing Force''. In 2002, the pack was re-released under the new titles ''Half-Life Platinum Collection''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Half-Life-Platinum-Collection-Second-Pc/dp/B00006FXIN |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324084442/https://www.amazon.com/Half-Life-Platinum-Collection-Second-Pc/dp/B00006FXIN |archive-date=March 24, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and ''Half-Life: Generation''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Sierra-Half-Life-Generation/dp/B0008MFCC6 |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219103126/http://www.amazon.com/Sierra-Half-Life-Generation/dp/B0008MFCC6 |archive-date=December 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These new iterations also included the ''Half-Life: Blue Shift'' expansion pack; though if registered on [[Steam (software)|Steam]], ''[[Day of Defeat]]'', as well as ''[[Ricochet (2000 video game)|Ricochet]]'' and ''[[Deathmatch Classic]]'' were also included. In 2005, ''Half-Life 1: Anthology'' was released, containing Steam-only versions of the following games on a single [[DVD]]: ''Half-Life'', ''Half-Life: Opposing Force'', ''Half-Life: Blue Shift'', and ''Team Fortress Classic''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/237/HalfLife_1_Anthology/|title=Half-Life 1 Anthology on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Remakes ===\nTo experience firsthand the processes mod-makers would have to go through with the new engine, Valve [[porting|ported]] ''Half-Life'' (dubbed ''Half-Life: Source'') and ''Counter-Strike'' to their new [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]]. ''Half-Life: Source'' is a straight port, lacking any new content or the ''Blue Shift'' High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of [[shader|vertex and pixel shaders]] for more realistic water effects, as well as ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from ''Half-Life 2'', including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in ''Half-Life 2'''s Source engine, along with 3D [[skybox (video games)|skybox]] replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The ''Half-Life'' port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a [[Field of view in video games|field of view]] option, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/280/announcements/detail/2003264815716395225 |title=Half-Life: Source update released |work=Steam |publisher=Valve |date=September 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320153942/http://steamcommunity.com/games/280/announcements/detail/2003264815716395225 |archivedate=March 20, 2015}}</ref> ''Half-Life: Source'' is available with special editions of ''Half-Life 2'', or separately on Steam.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=March 27, 2008 |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2004/09/18/half-life-2-release-candidate-goes-to-vivendi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604175605/http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2004/09/18/half-life-2-release-candidate-goes-to-vivendi |archivedate=June 4, 2008 |title=Half Life 2 release candidate goes to Vivendi |publisher=[[The Inquirer]] |date=September 18, 2004 |author=Harris, Wil}}</ref> ''{{vanchor|Half-Life Deathmatch: Source}}'', the [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] portion of the original game, much in the same fashion as the earlier released ''Half-Life: Source'', was released in July 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/half-life-deathmatch-source|title=Half-Life: Deathmatch \u2013 Source for Windows (2005)|website=MobyGames|access-date=March 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Half-Life: Source'' had been criticized for not fully using many of the features of the Source engine found in ''Half-Life 2'', as it still uses textures and models from the original game.

[[Valve Hammer Editor|Worldcraft]], the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but those plans never materialized. Valve also released a [[software development kit]], enabling developers to modify the game and create [[mod (video gaming)|mods]]. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the [[Software versioning|version]] 1.1.0.0 [[patch (computing)|patch]]. Supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and level editors such as the multiple engine editor [[Quake Army Knife|QuArK]]) were either created or updated to work with ''Half-Life''.\n\nThe ''Half-Life'' software development kit served as the development base for many multiplayer mods, including the Valve-developed ''Team Fortress Classic'' and ''Deathmatch Classic'' (a remake of ''Quake''{{'}}s multiplayer deathmatch mode in the GoldSrc engine).<ref>{{cite web |title=Valve releases Deathmatch Classic mod for Half-Life |first=Trey |last=Walker |date=June 7, 2001 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-releases-deathmatch-classic-mod-for-half-life/1100-2771202/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022201459/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-releases-deathmatch-classic-mod-for-half-life/1100-2771202/ |archivedate=October 22, 2016}}</ref> Other mods such as ''Counter-Strike'' and ''[[Day of Defeat]]'' (''DOD'') began life as the work of independent developers (self-termed \"modders\") who later received aid from Valve. Other multiplayer mods include ''[[Action Half-Life]]'', ''[[Firearms (video game)|Firearms]]'', ''[[Science and Industry]]'', ''[[The Specialists (mod)|The Specialists]]'', ''[[Pirates, Vikings and Knights]]'', ''[[Natural Selection (video game)|Natural Selection]]'' and ''[[Sven Co-op]]''.\n\nNumerous single-player mods have also been created. Notable examples include ''[[USS Darkstar]]'' (1999, a futuristic action-adventure on board a zoological research spaceship), ''[[They Hunger]]'' (2000\u20132001, a [[survival horror]] [[Total conversion (gaming)|total conversion]] trilogy involving zombies), ''[[Poke646]]'' (2001, a follow-up to the original ''Half-Life'' story with improved graphics), and ''[[Someplace Else]]'' (2002, a side-story to the original ''Half-Life'').\n\nIn 2003, Valve's network was infiltrated by hackers. Among the files that were stolen included an unreleased ''Half-Life'' modification: ''Half-Life: Threewave'', a canceled remake of the mod ''[[Malice (video game mod)|Threewave CTF]]'' from ''Quake''. The files were later found by independent reporter Tyler McVicker of ''Valve News Network'' on a Vietnamese [[File transfer protocol|FTP server]] in February 2016, and were unofficially released to the public in September 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Orland |first1=Kyle |title=The unreleased Half-Life multiplayer mod that you can play now |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-unreleased-half-life-multiplayer-mod-that-you-can-play-now/ |accessdate=September 22, 2016 |work=Ars Technica |date=September 21, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922000920/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-unreleased-half-life-multiplayer-mod-that-you-can-play-now/ |archivedate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Mod-derived standalone games ===\n{{Main|Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike: Condition Zero|Day of Defeat|Gunman Chronicles|Sven Co-op|Team Fortress Classic}}\n\nSome ''Half-Life'' modifications eventually landed on retail shelves. ''Counter-Strike'' was the most successful, having been released in six different editions: as a standalone product (2000), as part of the ''Platinum Pack'' (2000), as an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version (2003), and as a single-player spin-off titled ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' (2004), as well as in two versions using the Source engine. ''Team Fortress Classic'', ''Day of Defeat'', ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000, a futuristic [[Western (genre)|Western movie]]-style [[Total conversion (gaming)|total conversion]] with emphasis on its single-player mode) and ''Sven Co-op'' were also released as standalone products.\n\n=== Sequels ===\n{{Main|Half-Life 2|Half-Life 2: Episode One|Half-Life 2: Episode Two}}\n\n''[[Half-Life 2]]'' was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in May 2003 and released on November 16, 2004.

It was Valve's debut product and the first game in the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]]. Players assume the role of [[Gordon Freeman]], a scientist who must find his way out of the Black Mesa Research Facility after an experiment with an alien material goes wrong. The core [[gameplay]] consists of fighting alien and human enemies with a variety of weapons and solving puzzles. Unlike many other games at the time, the player has almost complete uninterrupted control of Freeman, and the story is told mostly through [[scripted sequence]]s seen through his eyes.\n\nValve co-founder [[Gabe Newell]] said the team aimed to create an immersive world rather than a \"shooting gallery\". ''Half-Life'' received critical acclaim for its graphics, realistic gameplay, and seamless narrative. It won over fifty [[PC game|PC]] \"[[Game of the Year]]\" awards and is considered one of the most influential games of the first-person shooter genre, as well as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]]. By 2008, the game had sold over 9 million copies.\n\n''Half-Life'' received the [[expansion pack]]s ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'' (1999) and ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]'' (2001). The game was ported to the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001, along with another expansion ''[[Half-Life: Decay]]'', as well as to [[macOS]] and [[Linux kernel|Linux]] in 2013. The game's [[Game engine|engine]], [[GoldSrc]], is a heavily modified version of the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], licensed from [[id Software]]. Valve ported ''Half-Life'' to its [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engine in 2004, while a Valve-endorsed commercial fan remake, ''[[Black Mesa (video game)|Black Mesa]]'', was released in 2020.\n\n''Half-Life'' sparked numerous fan-made [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]], several of them becoming standalone games, notably ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Day of Defeat]]'' and ''[[Sven Co-op]]''. A sequel, ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', was released in 2004, followed by [[Half-Life 2: Episode One|episodic]] [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|extensions]], and ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'' in 2020.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Halflife ingame.jpg|thumb|left|In this scene, the player must bypass a dam reservoir guarded by an [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache]] attack helicopter, a squad of soldiers, and a gun emplacement.]]\n\n''Half-Life'' is a [[first-person shooter]] that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike most of its peers at the time, ''Half-Life'' used scripted sequences, such as a [[Vortigaunt]] ramming down a door, to advance major plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on [[cutscene|cut-scene intermissions]] to detail their plotlines, ''Half-Life''{{'}}s story is told mostly using scripted sequences (bar one short cutscene), keeping the player in control of the [[first-person (video games)|first-person viewpoint]]. In line with this, the player rarely loses the ability to control the [[player character]], who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees \"through his eyes\" for the entire length of the game. ''Half-Life'' has no \"levels\"; it instead divides the game into chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous, except for short pauses for loading.<ref name=\"game guide\">{{cite book |title=Half-Life : Prima's Official Strategy Guide |author=Bell, Joe Grant |date=November 25, 1998 |publisher=[[Prima Games]] |isbn=0-7615-1360-4}}</ref>\n\nThe game regularly integrates puzzles, such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to. Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning a valve to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the boss. Late in the game, the player receives a \"long jump module\" for the [[HEV suit]], which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping. The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style [[jumping puzzles]] in [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] toward the end of the game.<ref name=\"game guide\" />\n\nFor the most part the player battles through the game alone, but is occasionally assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player; the guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information. An array of alien enemies populate the game, including [[headcrab]]s, [[Creatures in the Half-Life series|bullsquids]], and [[Headcrab#Headcrab zombie|headcrab zombies]]. The player also faces human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins.\n\n''Half-Life'' includes online multiplayer support for both individual and team-based [[deathmatch]] modes.<ref name=\"IGNrev\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nPhysicist [[Gordon Freeman]] arrives late for work at the  [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. He dons his Hazardous Environment (HEV) suit to carry out an experiment; pushing an unusual material into a machine for analysis. During the experiment, the spectrometer explodes, creating a \"resonance cascade\" that opens a portal to another dimension, [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]]. Surviving scientists urge Gordon to head to the surface, where he fights his way through Black Mesa and defends himself against hostile Xen creatures and government Marines sent to [[Cover-up|cover up]] the incident.\n\nOn the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have found a way to close the portal. Gordon travels to the other end of the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a [[rocket engine test facility]] to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by marines and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility. There, he discovers Xen specimens collected before the incident. Overwhelmed by the aliens, the Marines pull out of Black Mesa and begin airstrikes. Scaling cliffs, navigating destroyed buildings, and traversing through underground water channels, Gordon arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists learn  the portal is being forced open on the other side by an immensely powerful entity. They have developed teleportation technology that allows Gordon to travel to Xen, where he is tasked to stop the entity.\n\nIn Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers before him and defeats Gonarch, a huge egg-laying headcrab. At a factory creating alien soldiers, he enters a portal that sends him to a vast cave. There, Gordon confronts the Nihilanth, the entity maintaining the rift, and destroys it. Gordon is summoned by the mysterious [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], who has been watching his progress in Black Mesa and praises him. The G-Man explains his \"employers\" wish to employ Gordon. If Gordon refuses, he is teleported to an area full of alien soldiers to be killed immediately. If Gordon accepts, the G-Man congratulates him and places him into stasis to await his task.\n\n== Development ==\n{{quote box| quote = ''Half-Life'' in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization of the experience of the first-person genre. Many of us had fallen in love with video games because of the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] possibilities of the field and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities.

They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game and then spent a month iterating on the level.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\"/> When the rest of the team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as \"''[[Die Hard]]'' meets ''[[Evil Dead]]''\", they agreed to use it as a baseline.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\"/> The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, it had several interesting things happen in it, all triggered by the player rather than a timer, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level responded to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" />\n\nTo move forward with this unified design, Valve sought a game designer but found no one suitable. Instead, Valve created the \"cabal\", initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six-hour meetings four days a week. The cabal was responsible for all elements of design, including level layouts, key events, enemy designs, narrative, and the introduction of gameplay elements relative to the story.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" /> The collaboration proved successful, and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed, mini-cabals formed from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements. Membership in the main cabal rotated since commitment required created [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" />\n\nThe cabal produced a 200-page [[game design document|design document]] detailing nearly every aspect of the game. They also produced a 30-page document for the narrative, and hired science fiction novelist [[Marc Laidlaw]] to help manage that script.<ref name=\"fhhalflife3\" /><ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" /> Laidlaw said his contribution was to add \"old storytelling tricks\" to the team's ambitious designs: \"I was in awe of [the team]. It felt to me like I was just borrowing from old standards while they were the ones doing something truly new.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/marc-laidlaw/|title=Marc Laidlaw (Valve) - Interview|date=2017-07-17|website=Arcade Attack|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> Rather than dictate narrative elements \"from some kind of ivory tower of authorial inspiration\", he worked with the team to improvise ideas, and was inspired by their experiments.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, the opening train ride was conceived after an engineer implemented train code for another concept.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWithin a month of the cabal's formation, the other team members started detailed game development, and within another month began [[playtesting]] through Sierra. The cabal was intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting. They noted any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzles and made them into [[action item]]s to be fixed on the next iteration. Later, with most of the main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to fine-tune levels further.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" /> Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for ''Half-Life''{{'}}s success, and was reused for ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' from the start.<ref name=\"birdwell gamasutra\" />\n\nMuch of the detail of ''Half-Life''{{'}}s development has been lost; according to employee Erik Johnson, two or three months before release, their [[Microsoft Visual SourceSafe|Visual SourceSafe]] \"exploded\"; logs of technical changes from before the final month of development were lost, and code had to be recovered from individual computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291408/Valve_explains_why_well_never_see_the_full_history_of_HalfLifes_development.php |title=Valve explains why we'll never see the full history of Half-Life's development |last=Wawro |first=Alex |date=February 13, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214102632/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291408/Valve_explains_why_well_never_see_the_full_history_of_HalfLifes_development.php |archivedate=February 14, 2017 |url-status=live |accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Half-Life'' was released in November 1998.<ref name=\"fhhalflife5\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part5.html |title=The Final Hours of Half-Life: Reassembling the Pieces |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225022620/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part5.html |archivedate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref> The revised version of ''Half-Life'' shown at E3 1998 was given [[Game Critics Awards]] for \"Best PC Game\" and \"Best Action Game\".<ref name=\"fhhalflife4\" /> Valve released two [[game demo|demos]] for ''Half-Life.''

However, it does take advantage of [[shader|vertex and pixel shaders]] for more realistic water effects, as well as ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from ''Half-Life 2'', including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in ''Half-Life 2'''s Source engine, along with 3D [[skybox (video games)|skybox]] replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies.

[[Valve Hammer Editor|Worldcraft]], the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but those plans never materialized. Valve also released a [[software development kit]], enabling developers to modify the game and create [[mod (video gaming)|mods]]. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the [[Software versioning|version]] 1.1.0.0 [[patch (computing)|patch]]. Supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and level editors such as the multiple engine editor [[Quake Army Knife|QuArK]]) were either created or updated to work with ''Half-Life''.\n\nThe ''Half-Life'' software development kit served as the development base for many multiplayer mods, including the Valve-developed ''Team Fortress Classic'' and ''Deathmatch Classic'' (a remake of ''Quake''{{'}}s multiplayer deathmatch mode in the GoldSrc engine).<ref>{{cite web |title=Valve releases Deathmatch Classic mod for Half-Life |first=Trey |last=Walker |date=June 7, 2001 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-releases-deathmatch-classic-mod-for-half-life/1100-2771202/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022201459/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-releases-deathmatch-classic-mod-for-half-life/1100-2771202/ |archivedate=October 22, 2016}}</ref> Other mods such as ''Counter-Strike'' and ''[[Day of Defeat]]'' (''DOD'') began life as the work of independent developers (self-termed \"modders\") who later received aid from Valve. Other multiplayer mods include ''[[Action Half-Life]]'', ''[[Firearms (video game)|Firearms]]'', ''[[Science and Industry]]'', ''[[The Specialists (mod)|The Specialists]]'', ''[[Pirates, Vikings and Knights]]'', ''[[Natural Selection (video game)|Natural Selection]]'' and ''[[Sven Co-op]]''.\n\nNumerous single-player mods have also been created. Notable examples include ''[[USS Darkstar]]'' (1999, a futuristic action-adventure on board a zoological research spaceship), ''[[They Hunger]]'' (2000\u20132001, a [[survival horror]] [[Total conversion (gaming)|total conversion]] trilogy involving zombies), ''[[Poke646]]'' (2001, a follow-up to the original ''Half-Life'' story with improved graphics), and ''[[Someplace Else]]'' (2002, a side-story to the original ''Half-Life'').\n\nIn 2003, Valve's network was infiltrated by hackers. Among the files that were stolen included an unreleased ''Half-Life'' modification: ''Half-Life: Threewave'', a canceled remake of the mod ''[[Malice (video game mod)|Threewave CTF]]'' from ''Quake''. The files were later found by independent reporter Tyler McVicker of ''Valve News Network'' on a Vietnamese [[File transfer protocol|FTP server]] in February 2016, and were unofficially released to the public in September 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Orland |first1=Kyle |title=The unreleased Half-Life multiplayer mod that you can play now |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-unreleased-half-life-multiplayer-mod-that-you-can-play-now/ |accessdate=September 22, 2016 |work=Ars Technica |date=September 21, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922000920/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-unreleased-half-life-multiplayer-mod-that-you-can-play-now/ |archivedate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Mod-derived standalone games ===\n{{Main|Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike: Condition Zero|Day of Defeat|Gunman Chronicles|Sven Co-op|Team Fortress Classic}}\n\nSome ''Half-Life'' modifications eventually landed on retail shelves. ''Counter-Strike'' was the most successful, having been released in six different editions: as a standalone product (2000), as part of the ''Platinum Pack'' (2000), as an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version (2003), and as a single-player spin-off titled ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' (2004), as well as in two versions using the Source engine. ''Team Fortress Classic'', ''Day of Defeat'', ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000, a futuristic [[Western (genre)|Western movie]]-style [[Total conversion (gaming)|total conversion]] with emphasis on its single-player mode) and ''Sven Co-op'' were also released as standalone products.\n\n=== Sequels ===\n{{Main|Half-Life 2|Half-Life 2: Episode One|Half-Life 2: Episode Two}}\n\n''[[Half-Life 2]]'' was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in May 2003 and released on November 16, 2004. The player controls Gordon Freeman 20 years after the Black Mesa incident in the [[dystopia|dystopic]] [[City 17]], where he must fight as part of a rebellion against an alien regime. It was followed by two [[Episodic video game|episodic]] sequels, ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' (2006) and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"ep2.ep3.confirmation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-one-gold-two-dated-three-announced/1100-6151796/|title=Half-Life 2: Episode One gold, Two dated, Three announced|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|date=May 24, 2006|website=GameSpot|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125150657/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-one-gold-two-dated-three-announced/1100-6151796/|archivedate=November 25, 2013|accessdate=April 27, 2007}}</ref> A prequel, ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'', was released in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975423/half-life-alyx-vr-price-release-date-screenshots-trailer-valve-steam|title=Half-Life: Alyx is officially coming March 2020, and here\u2019s your first look|last=Hollister|first=Sean|date=2019-11-21|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Sales===\nAccording to Newell, ''Half-Life'' was budgeted with the expectation of lifetime sales around 180,000 units.<ref name=bizjournals1 /> However, following its November 19 release,<ref name=stormy /> the game became a surprise hit.<ref name=bizjournals1 /> In the United States, ''Half-Life'' debuted at #8 on [[PC Data]]'s weekly computer game sales chart for the November 15\u201321 period, with an average retail price (ARP) of $49.<ref name=nov1521>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406152939/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/016/013/pc_data_112198.html |url=http://www.cdmag.com:80/articles/016/013/pc_data_112198.html |title=''Deer Hunter II'' Returns to the Throne |date=December 9, 1998 |author=Mayer, Robert |work=[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |archivedate=April 6, 2005 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 22, 2018 }}</ref> It rose to sixth place the following week,<ref name=nextweek>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000614043550/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_12/09_pc_pcdata/index.html |url=http://headline.gamespot.com:80/news/98_12/09_pc_pcdata/index.html |title=PC Data Best Sellers |date=December 9, 1998 |archivedate=June 14, 2000 |work=[[GameSpot]] |url-status=dead |access-date=July 22, 2018 }}</ref> before dropping to position 10 for the week ending December 5.<ref name=thirdweek>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621170836/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_12/15_pc_chart/index.html |url=http://headline.gamespot.com:80/news/98_12/15_pc_chart/index.html |title=Tiny Plastic Woman Beats on ''Half-Life'' |date=December 15, 1998 |archivedate=June 21, 2000 |work=[[GameSpot]] |url-status=dead |access-date=July 22, 2018 }}</ref> During the December 6\u201312 period, the game climbed back to sixth place;
