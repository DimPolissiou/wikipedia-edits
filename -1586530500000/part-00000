Among the audience is a girl named Courtney Lane ([[Tammin Sursok]]). Interspersed with the scenes of the band playing, singer Nikko Alexander ([[Nolan Gerard Funk]]) calmly walks into the club through the back, barely making his cue for \"'''Don't Tell Me'''\". At the end of the song, he kicks over one of the amps, destroying it for effect. After the performance, the other members of ''Flux'', upset by his carelessness, kick him out of the band; Nikko's girlfriend Amy ([[Britt Irvin]]), who is also in the band, dumps him. After the band members leave, Courtney frantically attempts to recruit Nikko into a [[show choir]] named \"''Spectacular!'',\" of which she is leader. Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects her offer, Courtney begs him to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make his decision.\n\nThe next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the ''Spectacular!'' show choir perform \"'''Eye of the Tiger'''\". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group's performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering him half the group's earnings from the contest in exchange for his consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that he isn't interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named ''Ta-da'' performs \"'''Things We Do for Love'''\". The lead singers are Royce ([[Simon Curtis (actor)|Simon Curtis]]), who used to be the lead singer for ''Spectacular!'' but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi ([[Victoria Justice]]), Royce's new girlfriend who is a snobby and selfish girl. It is hinted she was a member of \"Spectacular!\" because of the number of times Courtney calls her a backstabber and that the letter I in her name stand for the \"ice in her veins\". Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson, who informs him that he has a shot at getting a record deal if he can raise enough money for equipment for his demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney's offer of half the earnings from the contest ''Spectacular!'' plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for his demo. When he approaches the choir Courtney remembers his mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let him join, but acquiesces after Nikko demonstrates his talent by performing \"'''Break My Heart'''\" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by his vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with his older brother Stavros ([[Christopher Jacot]]), does not inform his brother that he has joined show choir or that he is attempting to get a record deal because he knows Stavros would not approve.\n\nSeveral days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and his old band, ''Flux'', had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into his old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from ''Flux''. Meanwhile, ''Ta-da'', who are also at the club, performs their song \"'''Lonely Love Song'''\". Nikko discovers from the other ''Spectacular!'' members that Royce is Courtney's ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing ''Ta-da's'' good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help ''Spectacular!'' win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs \"'''Your Own Way'''\", persuading the others to join in. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney's wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko's house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney she would be impressed and may agree to change the group's style. The choir assembles at Nikko's house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon.\n\nNikko learns of ''Spectacular!''{{'}}s tradition of gathering for a bowling night the week before a competition. Only four members, including Nikko and Courtney, show up at the bowling alley, where they discover that Tammi and Royce are already bowling in their lane. After a brief confrontation between the two groups, Nikko persuades the others to perform a song using \"Rock The World,\" a spoof of the real-life video game [[Rock Band]]. Random selection chooses a song called \"'''For the First Time'''\", which was Courtney and Royce's old duet. She and Nikko sing it, much to Royce's jealousy, and Nikko and Courtney are becoming attracted to each other. Nikko invites Courtney over to his house for a surprise, and when they get there the whole group has assembled on Nikko's rooftop, where they all perform \"'''Your Own Way'''\" for Courtney. Courtney, instead of being impressed, is upset, accusing Nikko to have betrayed her by practicing another routine behind her back, and then leaves.\n\nLater that night, Nikko goes to Courtney's house to apologize and almost has a fistfight with Royce, who has come to ask Courtney to get back together with him. Courtney rejects Royce, who tauntingly tells Nikko that ''Ta-Da'' will beat ''Spectacular!'' at the competition in the \"weirdest trash talk that [Nikko's] ever heard.\" After Royce leaves, Nikko apologizes to Courtney for taking control of the group behind her back and offers to do things her way, but Courtney admits that the group needs a change. Courtney's mother tells Nikko that he can bring some good and change to the \"Spectacular!\" group and that Courtney will know how far they are actually able to push the envelope to win. The two of them decide to combine their talents and perform a song that everyone can agree upon, and Mr. Romano ([[Greg Germann]]), their music teacher, suggests a song called \"'''Something to Believe In'''\". ''Spectacular!'' begins intense rehearsals and all seems well (\"'''Just Freak'''\"), until Mr. Dickinson pays Nikko and Stavros a visit and informs them that his boss is offering Nikko and ''Flux'' a record deal after an audition and will only be available on Saturday night. Knowing that ''Spectacular!'' is scheduled to perform at the concert on Saturday night, Nikko is torn between his commitment to the choir and his one shot at getting a record deal. He tries to inform Courtney of his decision to audition for the record deal, but cannot bring himself to do it. Meanwhile, Amy informs Stavros that Nikko has joined choir and Stavros confronts Nikko in front of the members of ''Spectacular!'', insisting that Niko drop out of choir and audition for the record deal instead. The other members of ''Spectacular!'' are upset at Nikko for bailing on them at the last minute, and Courtney feels that Nikko has betrayed her again.\n\nMr. Romano visits Nikko, who is having a tough time deciding what to do, at his house and reveals that he was once in a famous band as Joey Rome that could have been more successful if he hadn't flopped and broke his contract due to his fear of taking risks. Before leaving to go audition for the record deal, Courtney shows up. Nikko fears that she is mad at him for turning his back on \"Spectacular!\" but instead she kisses him on the cheek and wishes him luck. On concert night, ''Ta-Da'' performs \"'''On The Wings Of A Dream'''\" and earns much applause and acclaim from the audience. Meanwhile, Nikko and ''Flux'' perform at their audition for the record deal, but Nikko's heart is not in it and the producers notice and tell him they are not interested; Stavros says that Nikko is just warming up, and that he is better than what he is giving out. Nikko begs them to let him show where his \"heart is.\" When it is ''Spectacular!''s turn to sing \"'''Something to Believe In'''\" at the national competition, Nikko, much to Courtney's surprise and delight, arrives onstage right before the chorus, belting out a long note. ''Flux'' joins him, playing background music, and Mr. Romano reprises his dream as a rock star by playing a guitar during the song.  Nikko and Courtney reconcile, and the group earns a standing ovation.\n\n''Ta-Da'' is announced as the winner of the contest and ''Spectacular!'' is disqualified because ''Flux'' were unregistered members of the act. Tammi reveals to Royce that she had only used him to win the contest and breaks up with him. Even though ''Spectacular!'' lost the contest, Nikko's amazing performance got him the record deal. After everyone leaves, Nikko and Courtney share a kiss. It ends with ''Spectacular!'', ''Flux'', and Mr. Romano in a studio together recording a song, suitably named \"'''Everything Can Change'''\", with Nikko and Courtney as the lead singers in the song.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nolan Gerard Funk]] as Nigel \"Nikko\" Alexander\n* [[Tammin Sursok]] as Courtney Lane\n* [[Victoria Justice]] as Tammi\n* [[Simon Curtis (actor)|Simon Curtis]] as Royce Du Lac\n* [[Matthew Bennett]] as Rick Dickinson\n* [[Andrea Lewis]] as Robin\n* [[Harris Allan]] as Eric\n* Joel Ballard as Caspian\n* [[Avan Jogia]] as Tajid\n* [[Shannon Chan-Kent]] as Janet\n* [[Christopher Jacot]] as Stavros\n* [[Britt Irvin]] as Amy\n* [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Nils\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Mr. Virgil Romano\n* [[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Uncle Sam\n* Troy Hatt as Swanee Boy\n* [[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]] as Star Spangled Boy\n* [[Venus Terzo]] as Marion\n* Rukiya Bernard as Receptionist\n* Anthony St. John as Anthony Gage\n* David Quinlan as Emcee\n\n==Musical numbers==\nThe order of the songs on the soundtrack, and the order of musical performances in the movie are minor changes.

Among the audience is a girl named Courtney Lane ([[Tammin Sursok]]). Interspersed with the scenes of the band playing, singer Nikko Alexander ([[Nolan Gerard Funk]]) calmly walks into the club through the back, barely making his cue for \"'''Don't Tell Me'''\". At the end of the song, he kicks over one of the amps, destroying it for effect. After the performance, the other members of ''Flux'', upset by his carelessness, kick him out of the band; Nikko's girlfriend Amy ([[Britt Irvin]]), who is also in the band, dumps him. After the band members leave, Courtney frantically attempts to recruit Nikko into a [[show choir]] named \"''Spectacular!'',\" of which she is leader. Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects her offer, Courtney begs him to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make his decision.\n\nThe next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the ''Spectacular!'' show choir perform \"'''Eye of the Tiger'''\". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group's performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering him half the group's earnings from the contest in exchange for his consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that he isn't interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named ''Ta-da'' performs \"'''Things We Do for Love'''\". The lead singers are Royce ([[Simon Curtis (actor)|Simon Curtis]]), who used to be the lead singer for ''Spectacular!'' but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi ([[Victoria Justice]]), Royce's new girlfriend who is a snobby and selfish girl. It is hinted she was a member of \"Spectacular!\" because of the number of times Courtney calls her a backstabber and that the letter I in her name stand for the \"ice in her veins\". Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson, who informs him that he has a shot at getting a record deal if he can raise enough money for equipment for his demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney's offer of half the earnings from the contest ''Spectacular!'' plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for his demo. When he approaches the choir Courtney remembers his mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let him join, but acquiesces after Nikko demonstrates his talent by performing \"'''Break My Heart'''\" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by his vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with his older brother Stavros ([[Christopher Jacot]]), does not inform his brother that he has joined show choir or that he is attempting to get a record deal because he knows Stavros would not approve.\n\nSeveral days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and his old band, ''Flux'', had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into his old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from ''Flux''. Meanwhile, ''Ta-da'', who are also at the club, performs their song \"'''Lonely Love Song'''\". Nikko discovers from the other ''Spectacular!'' members that Royce is Courtney's ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing ''Ta-da's'' good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help ''Spectacular!'' win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs \"'''Your Own Way'''\", persuading the others to join in. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney's wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko's house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney she would be impressed and may agree to change the group's style. The choir assembles at Nikko's house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon.\n\nNikko learns of ''Spectacular!''{{'}}s tradition of gathering for a bowling night the week before a competition. Only four members, including Nikko and Courtney, show up at the bowling alley, where they discover that Tammi and Royce are already bowling in their lane. After a brief confrontation between the two groups, Nikko persuades the others to perform a song using \"Rock The World,\" a spoof of the real-life video game [[Rock Band]]. Random selection chooses a song called \"'''For the First Time'''\", which was Courtney and Royce's old duet. She and Nikko sing it, much to Royce's jealousy, and Nikko and Courtney are becoming attracted to each other. Nikko invites Courtney over to his house for a surprise, and when they get there the whole group has assembled on Nikko's rooftop, where they all perform \"'''Your Own Way'''\" for Courtney. Courtney, instead of being impressed, is upset, accusing Nikko to have betrayed her by practicing another routine behind her back, and then leaves.\n\nLater that night, Nikko goes to Courtney's house to apologize and almost has a fistfight with Royce, who has come to ask Courtney to get back together with him. Courtney rejects Royce, who tauntingly tells Nikko that ''Ta-Da'' will beat ''Spectacular!'' at the competition in the \"weirdest trash talk that [Nikko's] ever heard.\" After Royce leaves, Nikko apologizes to Courtney for taking control of the group behind her back and offers to do things her way, but Courtney admits that the group needs a change. Courtney's mother tells Nikko that he can bring some good and change to the \"Spectacular!\" group and that Courtney will know how far they are actually able to push the envelope to win. The two of them decide to combine their talents and perform a song that everyone can agree upon, and Mr. Romano ([[Greg Germann]]), their music teacher, suggests a song called \"'''Something to Believe In'''\". ''Spectacular!'' begins intense rehearsals and all seems well (\"'''Just Freak'''\"), until Mr. Dickinson pays Nikko and Stavros a visit and informs them that his boss is offering Nikko and ''Flux'' a record deal after an audition and will only be available on Saturday night. Knowing that ''Spectacular!'' is scheduled to perform at the concert on Saturday night, Nikko is torn between his commitment to the choir and his one shot at getting a record deal. He tries to inform Courtney of his decision to audition for the record deal, but cannot bring himself to do it. Meanwhile, Amy informs Stavros that Nikko has joined choir and Stavros confronts Nikko in front of the members of ''Spectacular!'', insisting that Niko drop out of choir and audition for the record deal instead. The other members of ''Spectacular!'' are upset at Nikko for bailing on them at the last minute, and Courtney feels that Nikko has betrayed her again.\n\nMr. Romano visits Nikko, who is having a tough time deciding what to do, at his house and reveals that he was once in a famous band as Joey Rome that could have been more successful if he hadn't flopped and broke his contract due to his fear of taking risks. Before leaving to go audition for the record deal, Courtney shows up. Nikko fears that she is mad at him for turning his back on \"Spectacular!\" but instead she kisses him on the cheek and wishes him luck. On concert night, ''Ta-Da'' performs \"'''On The Wings Of A Dream'''\" and earns much applause and acclaim from the audience. Meanwhile, Nikko and ''Flux'' perform at their audition for the record deal, but Nikko's heart is not in it and the producers notice and tell him they are not interested; Stavros says that Nikko is just warming up, and that he is better than what he is giving out. Nikko begs them to let him show where his \"heart is.\" When it is ''Spectacular!''s turn to sing \"'''Something to Believe In'''\" at the national competition, Nikko, much to Courtney's surprise and delight, arrives onstage right before the chorus, belting out a long note. ''Flux'' joins him, playing background music, and Mr. Romano reprises his dream as a rock star by playing a guitar during the song.  Nikko and Courtney reconcile, and the group earns a standing ovation.\n\n''Ta-Da'' is announced as the winner of the contest and ''Spectacular!'' is disqualified because ''Flux'' were unregistered members of the act. Tammi reveals to Royce that she had only used him to win the contest and breaks up with him. Even though ''Spectacular!'' lost the contest, Nikko's amazing performance got him the record deal. After everyone leaves, Nikko and Courtney share a kiss. It ends with ''Spectacular!'', ''Flux'', and Mr. Romano in a studio together recording a song, suitably named \"'''Everything Can Change'''\", with Nikko and Courtney as the lead singers in the song.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nolan Gerard Funk]] as Nigel \"Nikko\" Alexander\n* [[Tammin Sursok]] as Courtney Lane\n* [[Victoria Justice]] as Tammi\n* [[Simon Curtis (actor)|Simon Curtis]] as Royce Du Lac\n* [[Matthew Bennett]] as Rick Dickinson\n* [[Andrea Lewis]] as Robin\n* [[Harris Allan]] as Eric\n* Joel Ballard as Caspian\n* [[Avan Jogia]] as Tajid\n* [[Shannon Chan-Kent]] as Janet\n* [[Christopher Jacot]] as Stavros\n* [[Britt Irvin]] as Amy\n* [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Nils\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Mr. Virgil Romano\n* [[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Uncle Sam\n* Troy Hatt as Swanee Boy\n* [[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]] as Star Spangled Boy\n* [[Venus Terzo]] as Marion\n* Rukiya Bernard as Receptionist\n* Anthony St. John as Anthony Gage\n* David Quinlan as Emcee\n\n==Musical numbers==\nThe order of the songs on the soundtrack, and the order of musical performances in the movie are minor changes.

When the band members got into the studio, [[The Rev]] recorded all the drums in one take, and the other members of the band added their parts to what he had laid down. Zacky Vengeance played lead guitar originally. When [[Synyster Gates]] joined the band in early 2001, they recorded a heavy metal version of \"To End the Rapture\", with Gates playing lead guitar. This version was first seen on the ''[[Warmness on the Soul]]'' single, and was later featured on the re-release of ''Sounding the Seventh Trumpet''. This is the only album to feature bassist Justin Sane, who is also credited as playing piano in the original releases. He was briefly replaced by Dameon Ash as a touring bassist after the touring cycle, who was then replaced by [[Johnny Christ]].\n\n==Release==\nThe release date of this album is theorized in many sources. On the band's official website, it's given as January 31, 2001. However, on archived versions of the website, news updates explain that the album, distributed by Lumberjack Distributions, was originally planned for a late April 2001 release. Due to unknown reasons, it had to be pushed back multiple times, at first for a June 10, then for a June 20 release.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

FC Schweinfurt 05 team in 1905]]\n\nAt a time when football became more and more popular among the middle class, 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was founded on 5 May 1905 by a number of sports enthusiasts. Pepi Popp, the club's first chairman, designed the still unchanged FC05 logo. The team played in various local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nWith the introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\nOn the occasion of the club's 50th anniversary in 1955, Schweinfurt could demonstrate its then level when the team achieved a 1\u20131 draw against [[Everton F.C.]], and defeated German champion [[Rot-Weiss Essen]] 3\u20131.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

FC Schweinfurt 05 was founded on 5 May 1905 by a number of sports enthusiasts around first chairman Pepi Popp, who also designed the still unchanged club's logo. Until beginning of the [[First World War]], the team played in various local leagues. At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nWith the introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\nOn the occasion of the club's 50th anniversary in 1955, Schweinfurt could demonstrate its then level when the team achieved a 1\u20131 draw against [[Everton F.C.]], and defeated German champion [[Rot-Weiss Essen]] 3\u20131.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008.

It also surrounds the tiny Spanish [[exclave]] of [[Ll\u00edvia]], and thus has two distinct borders with Spain. In 2016, it had a population of 474,369.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, most of the present department was part of the former [[Principality of Catalonia]], within the [[Crown of Aragon]], therefore part of the [[Crown_of_Aragon#Union_with_Castile|Kingdom of Spain]], so the majority of it has historically been [[Catalan language|Catalan-speaking]], and it is still referred to as [[Northern Catalonia]].\n\nThe modern department was created early during the [[French Revolution]] on 9 February 1790 under the name of ''Roussillon'', also the name of the pre-[[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] [[provinces of France|province]] of [[Roussillon]] to which it almost exactly corresponds, although the department also includes [[Fenouill\u00e8des]], a small piece of territory which had formerly been on the southern edge of [[Languedoc]]. The name therefore changed on February 26, 1790 to ''Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales''.<ref>{{66 PHPC}}</ref>\n\nInvaded by Spain in April 1793, the area was recaptured thirteen months later during the [[War of the Pyrenees|War of the Roussillon]].\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales proved one of the most consistently republican departments in France. The intellectual and republican politician [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]], who, during the early months of the [[French Second Republic|short-lived Second Republic]] in 1848, was briefly [[French Executive Commission (1848)|de facto Head of state]], came from [[Estagel]] in the east of the department.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Th\u00e9mis.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Themis (solar power plant)|Themis Solar Power tower]]]]\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales has an area of 4,115&nbsp;km\u00b2. and a population of 422,000, of whom just over a quarter live in the capital, [[Perpignan]]. Other towns above 10,000 inhabitants include [[Canet-en-Roussillon]], [[Saint-Est\u00e8ve]], [[Saint-Cyprien, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Saint-Cyprien]] and [[Argel\u00e8s-sur-Mer]]. They are followed in decreasing order by [[Cabestany]], [[Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque]], [[Rivesaltes]], [[C\u00e9ret]], [[Elne]], [[Pia, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Pia]], [[Thuir]], [[Bompas, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Bompas]], [[Le Soler]], [[Prades, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Prades]] and [[Toulouges]], each of 6-10,000 inhabitants.\n\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales consists of three river valleys in the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range \u2013from north to south, those of the [[Agly]], [[T\u00eat (river)|T\u00eat]] and [[Tech (river)|Tech]] \u2013 and the eastern Plain of Roussillon into which they converge. Most of the population and agricultural production are concentrated in the plain, with only 30% of the area. There is one water reservoir at [[Lac de Matemale]]. There is also a lake, [[Casteilla]].\n\nThe upper T\u00eat valley comprises the departments westernmost third, with just over a tenth of the total population. To the south-east, the Tech valley and the [[C\u00f4te Vermeille]] contain nearly 100,000 inhabitants. The Agly basin in the north-east has much in common with neighboring areas of Aude.  [[Ll\u00edvia]] is a town of [[Cerdanya]], province of [[Girona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], that forms a Spanish exclave surrounded by French territory.\n\n==Economy==\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales is a [[wine]]-growing area and a tourist destination.\n\n==Demographics==\nPopulation development since 1793:{{historical populations|11=1793|12=105,171|13=1801|14=110,732|15=1806|16=126,692|17=1821|18=143,054|19=1831|20=157,052|21=1841|22=173,592|23=1851|24=181,955|25=1861|26=181,763|27=1872|28=191,856|29=1881|30=208,855|31=1891|32=210,125|33=1901|34=212,121|35=1911|36=212,986|37=1921|38=217,503|39=1931|40=238,647|41=1936|42=233,347|43=1946|44=228,776|45=1954|46=230,285|47=1962|48=251,231|49=1968|50=281,976|51=1975|52=299,506|53=1982|54=334,557|55=1990|56=363,796|57=1999|58=392,803|59=2006|60=432,116|61=2011|62=457,000|63=2016|64=474,369|align=middle|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://splaf.free.fr/ Site sur la Population et les Limites Administratives de la France]</ref>}}[[French language|French]] is spoken by almost all the population. Minority languages in the region are [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which between them are estimated to be spoken by 34% of the population and understood by an additional 21%.\n\nOn 10 December 2007, the [[General Council of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Departmental Council of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] recognized Catalan as a regional language of the department, though French is still the only official language in France, according to the Constitution.<ref>See Article 1 of the [http://www.cg66.fr/202-charte-en-faveur-du-catalan.htm \"Charter of the Catalan Language\"]</ref>\n\nThe area is traditionally divided into [[comarca|comarques]], of which five ([[French Cerdagne]], [[Capcir]], [[Conflent]], [[Roussillon]] and [[Vallespir]]) are historically Catalan-speaking and one ([[Fenouill\u00e8des]]) is historically Occitan-speaking. The five Catalan-speaking comarques were historically part of the [[Kingdom of Majorca]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{Politics of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales}}\nThe d\u00e9partement is managed by the [[General Council of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Departmental Council of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]] in [[Perpignan]]. The Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales is part of the region of [[Occitanie]]. The Departmental Council of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales is more and more involved with the [[European Union]] to create, together with the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] and [[Andorra]], a Eurodistrict.\n\n===Politics===\n====Departmental Council of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales====\nThe Departmental Council of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales has 34 seats.

It also surrounds the tiny Spanish [[exclave]] of [[Ll\u00edvia]], and thus has two distinct borders with Spain. In 2016, it had a population of 474,369.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, most of the present department was part of the former [[Principality of Catalonia]], within the [[Crown of Aragon]], therefore part of the [[Crown_of_Aragon#Union_with_Castile|Kingdom of Spain]], so the majority of it has historically been [[Catalan language|Catalan-speaking]], and it is still referred to as [[Northern Catalonia]].\n\nThe modern department was created early during the [[French Revolution]] on 9 February 1790 under the name of ''Roussillon'', also the name of the pre-[[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] [[provinces of France|province]] of [[Roussillon]] to which it almost exactly corresponds, although the department also includes [[Fenouill\u00e8des]], a small piece of territory which had formerly been on the southern edge of [[Languedoc]]. The name therefore changed on February 26, 1790 to ''Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales''.<ref>{{66 PHPC}}</ref>\n\nInvaded by Spain in April 1793, the area was recaptured thirteen months later during the [[War of the Pyrenees|War of the Roussillon]].\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales proved one of the most consistently republican departments in France. The intellectual and republican politician [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]], who, during the early months of the [[French Second Republic|short-lived Second Republic]] in 1848, was briefly [[French Executive Commission (1848)|de facto Head of state]], came from [[Estagel]] in the east of the department.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Th\u00e9mis.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Themis (solar power plant)|Themis Solar Power tower]]]]\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales has an area of 4,115&nbsp;km\u00b2. and a population of 422,000, of whom just over a quarter live in the capital, [[Perpignan]]. Other towns above 10,000 inhabitants include [[Canet-en-Roussillon]], [[Saint-Est\u00e8ve]], [[Saint-Cyprien, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Saint-Cyprien]] and [[Argel\u00e8s-sur-Mer]]. They are followed in decreasing order by [[Cabestany]], [[Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque]], [[Rivesaltes]], [[C\u00e9ret]], [[Elne]], [[Pia, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Pia]], [[Thuir]], [[Bompas, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Bompas]], [[Le Soler]], [[Prades, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Prades]] and [[Toulouges]], each of 6-10,000 inhabitants.\n\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales consists of three river valleys in the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range \u2013from north to south, those of the [[Agly]], [[T\u00eat (river)|T\u00eat]] and [[Tech (river)|Tech]] \u2013 and the eastern Plain of Roussillon into which they converge. Most of the population and agricultural production are concentrated in the plain, with only 30% of the area. There is one water reservoir at [[Lac de Matemale]]. There is also a lake, [[Casteilla]].\n\nThe upper T\u00eat valley comprises the departments westernmost third, with just over a tenth of the total population. To the south-east, the Tech valley and the [[C\u00f4te Vermeille]] contain nearly 100,000 inhabitants. The Agly basin in the north-east has much in common with neighboring areas of Aude.  [[Ll\u00edvia]] is a town of [[Cerdanya]], province of [[Girona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], that forms a Spanish exclave surrounded by French territory.\n\n==Economy==\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales is a [[wine]]-growing area and a tourist destination.\n\n==Demographics==\nPopulation development since 1793:{{historical populations|11=1793|12=105,171|13=1801|14=110,732|15=1806|16=126,692|17=1821|18=143,054|19=1831|20=157,052|21=1841|22=173,592|23=1851|24=181,955|25=1861|26=181,763|27=1872|28=191,856|29=1881|30=208,855|31=1891|32=210,125|33=1901|34=212,121|35=1911|36=212,986|37=1921|38=217,503|39=1931|40=238,647|41=1936|42=233,347|43=1946|44=228,776|45=1954|46=230,285|47=1962|48=251,231|49=1968|50=281,976|51=1975|52=299,506|53=1982|54=334,557|55=1990|56=363,796|57=1999|58=392,803|59=2006|60=432,116|61=2011|62=457,000|63=2016|64=474,369|align=middle|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://splaf.free.fr/ Site sur la Population et les Limites Administratives de la France]</ref>}}[[French language|French]] is spoken by almost all the population.

The city, whose population is estimated at almost 120,000 (2015), forms an urban district of its own ({{lang-de|Stadtkreis}}) and is the administrative seat of the [[Alb-Donau (district)|Alb-Donau district]]. Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former [[free imperial city]] ({{lang-de|freie Reichsstadt}}). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of the [[University of Ulm]]. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world ({{convert|161.53|m|abbr=on|2|disp=or}}), the Gothic minster ([[Ulm Minster]], German: Ulmer M\u00fcnster), and as the birthplace of [[Albert Einstein]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ulm Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzone.jpg|thumb|left|View from the [[Ulm Munster|M\u00fcnster]] towards Hirschstra\u00dfe.]]\nUlm lies at the point where the rivers [[Blau (Danube)|Blau]] and [[Iller]] join the [[Danube]], at an altitude of {{convert|479|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the left bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, G\u00f6gglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the right bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the [[twin cities|twin city]] of [[Neu-Ulm]] in the state of [[Bavaria]], smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).\n\nExcept for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over {{convert|620|m|2|abbr=off|lk=out}}, some of them part of the [[Swabian Alb]]. South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the [[Alps]], which are approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.\n\nThe city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine [[Foreland basin]], where the basin reaches the [[Swabian Alb]]. The [[Turritellenplatte]] of Ermingen (\"Erminger Turritellenplatte\") is a famous palaeontological site of [[Burdigalian]] age.\n\n== Neighboring communes ==\n[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_190v191r_1.jpg|thumb|Ulm in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.]]\nOn the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town [[Neu-Ulm]]. On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighboring communes of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg are the following: [[Illerkirchberg]], [[Staig]], [[H\u00fcttisheim]], [[Erbach an der Donau|Erbach (Donau)]], [[Blaubeuren]], [[Blaustein]], [[Dornstadt]], [[Beimerstetten]] and [[Langenau]] as well as the eastern neighboring community [[Elchingen]].\n\n== Town subdivisions ==\nThe&nbsp;city&nbsp;is&nbsp;divided into 18 districts ({{lang-de|[[:de:Stadtteile|Stadtteile]]}}): Ulm-Mitte, B\u00f6fingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, G\u00f6gglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen, Oststadt, S\u00f6flingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.\n\nNine districts that were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s (Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, G\u00f6gglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen und Unterweiler). They have own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Free Imperial City of Ulm}}\n[[File:Braun Ulm UBHD.jpg|thumb|Ulm in 1572 by [[Georg Braun|Frans Hogenberg]]]]\nThe oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early [[Neolithic]] period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King [[Louis the German]] signed a document in the King's palace of \"Hulma\" in the [[Duchy of Swabia]].<ref name=\"500px\">{{cite web|title=ulm-by-michael-vogt|url=http://500px.com/photo/9821081/ulm-by-michael-vogt|work=500px.com|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}</ref> The city was declared an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial City]] ({{lang-de|Reichsstadt}}) by [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich Barbarossa]] in 1181.\n\nAt&nbsp;first,&nbsp;Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a ''K\u00f6nigspfalz'', a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds ({{lang-de|Gro\u00dfer Schw\u00f6rbrief}}), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church ([[Ulm Minster]], 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality [[textiles]]. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for [[painting|painter]]s and [[sculpture|sculptors]] like [[Hans Multscher]] and [[J\u00f6rg Syrlin the Elder]]. During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the [[New World]] (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), the city began to decline gradually. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701-1714), it was alternately invaded several times by [[France|French]] and [[Bavaria]]n soldiers.\n\n[[File:Charles Th\u00e9venin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|The capitulation of Ulm. General Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered to [[Napoleon]].]]\nIn the wars following the [[French Revolution]], the city was alternately occupied by French and [[Austria]]n forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into [[Bavaria]]. During the campaign of 1805, [[Napoleon]] managed to trap the invading Austrian army of [[Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and forced it to surrender in the [[Battle of Ulm]]. In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as [[Neu-Ulm]] (New Ulm).\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the city was [[Fortresses of the German Confederation|designated a fortress]] of the [[German Confederation]] with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of [[industrialisation]] in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844\u201391) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, a [[concentration camp]] primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The [[Jews]] of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their [[synagogue]] was torn down during [[Kristallnacht]] in November 1938. Of 116 Jews deported from Ulm during World War <small>II</small> (45 were sent to Theresienstadt on Aug. 22, 1942), only four returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ulm|title=Ulm|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> Approximately 25 Jews were living in Ulm in 1968.\n\nThe sole RAF [[strategic bombing during World War II]] against Ulm occurred on December 17, 1944, against the two large [[Transportation Plan|lorry factories]] of [[Meillerwagen|Magirus]]-Deutz and [[Karl K\u00e4ssbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|K\u00e4ssbohrer]], as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm.

Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstra\u00dfe part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, [[Ulm University]] was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Nokia]] and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a [[twin cities|twin city]] of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of [[Neu-Ulm]], and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]] and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.\n\n{{wide image|Ulm360.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Ulm}}\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n!

The city, whose population is estimated at almost 120,000 (2015), forms an urban district of its own ({{lang-de|Stadtkreis}}) and is the administrative seat of the [[Alb-Donau (district)|Alb-Donau district]]. Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former [[free imperial city]] ({{lang-de|freie Reichsstadt}}). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of the [[University of Ulm]]. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world ({{convert|161.53|m|abbr=on|2|disp=or}}), the Gothic minster ([[Ulm Minster]], German: Ulmer M\u00fcnster), and as the birthplace of [[Albert Einstein]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ulm Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzone.jpg|thumb|left|View from the [[Ulm Munster|M\u00fcnster]] towards Hirschstra\u00dfe.]]\nUlm lies at the point where the rivers [[Blau (Danube)|Blau]] and [[Iller]] join the [[Danube]], at an altitude of {{convert|479|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the left bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, G\u00f6gglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the right bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the [[twin cities|twin city]] of [[Neu-Ulm]] in the state of [[Bavaria]], smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).\n\nExcept for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over {{convert|620|m|2|abbr=off|lk=out}}, some of them part of the [[Swabian Alb]]. South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the [[Alps]], which are approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.\n\nThe city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine [[Foreland basin]], where the basin reaches the [[Swabian Alb]]. The [[Turritellenplatte]] of Ermingen (\"Erminger Turritellenplatte\") is a famous palaeontological site of [[Burdigalian]] age.\n\n== Neighboring communes ==\n[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_190v191r_1.jpg|thumb|Ulm in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.]]\nOn the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town [[Neu-Ulm]]. On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighboring communes of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg are the following: [[Illerkirchberg]], [[Staig]], [[H\u00fcttisheim]], [[Erbach an der Donau|Erbach (Donau)]], [[Blaubeuren]], [[Blaustein]], [[Dornstadt]], [[Beimerstetten]] and [[Langenau]] as well as the eastern neighboring community [[Elchingen]].\n\n== Town subdivisions ==\nThe&nbsp;city&nbsp;is&nbsp;divided into 18 districts ({{lang-de|[[:de:Stadtteile|Stadtteile]]}}): Ulm-Mitte, B\u00f6fingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, G\u00f6gglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen, Oststadt, S\u00f6flingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.\n\nNine districts that were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s (Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, G\u00f6gglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen und Unterweiler). They have own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Free Imperial City of Ulm}}\n[[File:Braun Ulm UBHD.jpg|thumb|Ulm in 1572 by [[Georg Braun|Frans Hogenberg]]]]\nThe oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early [[Neolithic]] period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King [[Louis the German]] signed a document in the King's palace of \"Hulma\" in the [[Duchy of Swabia]].<ref name=\"500px\">{{cite web|title=ulm-by-michael-vogt|url=http://500px.com/photo/9821081/ulm-by-michael-vogt|work=500px.com|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}</ref> The city was declared an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial City]] ({{lang-de|Reichsstadt}}) by [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich Barbarossa]] in 1181.\n\nAt&nbsp;first,&nbsp;Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a ''K\u00f6nigspfalz'', a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds ({{lang-de|Gro\u00dfer Schw\u00f6rbrief}}), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church ([[Ulm Minster]], 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality [[textiles]]. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for [[painting|painter]]s and [[sculpture|sculptors]] like [[Hans Multscher]] and [[J\u00f6rg Syrlin the Elder]]. During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the [[New World]] (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), the city began to decline gradually. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701-1714), it was alternately invaded several times by [[France|French]] and [[Bavaria]]n soldiers.\n\n[[File:Charles Th\u00e9venin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|The capitulation of Ulm. General Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered to [[Napoleon]].]]\nIn the wars following the [[French Revolution]], the city was alternately occupied by French and [[Austria]]n forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into [[Bavaria]]. During the campaign of 1805, [[Napoleon]] managed to trap the invading Austrian army of [[Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and forced it to surrender in the [[Battle of Ulm]]. In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as [[Neu-Ulm]] (New Ulm).\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the city was [[Fortresses of the German Confederation|designated a fortress]] of the [[German Confederation]] with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of [[industrialisation]] in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844\u201391) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, a [[concentration camp]] primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The [[Jews]] of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their [[synagogue]] was torn down during [[Kristallnacht]] in November 1938. Of 116 Jews deported from Ulm during World War <small>II</small> (45 were sent to Theresienstadt on Aug. 22, 1942), only four returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ulm|title=Ulm|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> Approximately 25 Jews were living in Ulm in 1968.\n\nThe sole RAF [[strategic bombing during World War II]] against Ulm occurred on December 17, 1944, against the two large [[Transportation Plan|lorry factories]] of [[Meillerwagen|Magirus]]-Deutz and [[Karl K\u00e4ssbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|K\u00e4ssbohrer]], as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 Wehrmacht establishments destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |title=RAF History - Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless and after all the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nMost of the city was rebuilt in the plain and simple style of the 1950s and 1960s, but some of the historic landmark buildings have been restored. Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstra\u00dfe part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, [[Ulm University]] was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Nokia]] and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a [[twin cities|twin city]] of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of [[Neu-Ulm]], and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]] and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.\n\n{{wide image|Ulm360.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Ulm}}\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n!

It was one of the seven countries that competed at the first contest. Italy competed at the contest frequently until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]. After a 14-year absence, the country returned to the contest in {{escyr|2011}}. Italy has won the contest twice.\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]], [[Domenico Modugno]] finished third with the song \"Nel blu, dipinto di blu\". Renamed \"[[Volare (song)|Volare]]\", the song became a huge international hit, reaching the US number one spot. [[Emilio Pericoli]] also finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], before Italy won for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]] with [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and \"[[Non ho l'et\u00e0]]\". Cinquetti returned to the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] and finished second with the song \"[[Si (song)|Si]]\", losing to [[ABBA]]. Italy then finished third in 1975 with [[Wess]] and [[Dori Ghezzi]] and the song \"[[Era (song)|Era]]\". The country's best result of the 1980s was [[Umberto Tozzi]] and [[Raffaele Riefoli|Raf]] finishing third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]]. Italy's second victory in the contest came in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]] with [[Toto Cutugno]] and the song \"[[Insieme: 1992]]\". Other good 1990s results were [[Mia Martini]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992]] and [[Jalisse]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], who both finished fourth. After 1997, Italy withdrew from the competition.\n\nOn 31 December 2010, the EBU announced that Italy would be returning to the contest as part of the \"Big Five\", meaning that it automatically qualified for the final.<ref name=\"Italy return\">{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=43 nations on 2011 participants list|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22833&_t=43+nations+on+2011+participants+list!|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=31 December 2010|date=2010-12-31}}</ref> Italy's return to the contest has proved to be successful, finishing in the top ten in seven of the last nine contests (2011\u201319), including second places for [[Raphael Gualazzi]] ({{escyr|2011}}) and [[Mahmood (singer)|Mahmood]] in ({{escyr|2019}}), and [[Il Volo]] finishing third in {{escyr|2015}}. Il Volo won the televoting, receiving votes from all countries, but the juries placed them sixth. Since the introduction of the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Voting Systems|50/50 voting system]] in 2009, this was the first time that the winner of the viewers vote did not win the contest.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Absences ===\nItaly has withdrawn from the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] a number of times. The first withdrawal was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]], when [[RAI]] stated that interest had diminished in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=297|title=History - Eurovision Song Contest 1981|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> This absence continued through [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|the following year]], before Italy returned in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Italy again withdrew in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]] when RAI decided not to enter the contest.\nFrom [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]] to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]] Italy withdrew again, with RAI citing a lack of interest in participating. Italy returned in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], before withdrawing again without explanation, and the country did not participate again until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]].\n\nNone of the Eurovision winning songs were particularly successful in the Italian charts. \"[[Non ho l'eta]]\" by Gigliola Cinquetti (Grand Prix 1964) was a hit in February 1964 when the song won the Sanremo festival, but according to the official \"Hit Parade Italia\" website, \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\", \"[[Ding-A-Dong]]\", \"[[Puppet on a String]]\", \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\" and even Italy's own winning entry of 1990, \"[[Insieme: 1992]]\", all failed to enter the top ten of the records sales charts. A notable exception to this rule was, however, the 1984 entry \"[[I treni di Tozeur]]\" by [[Alice (Italian singer)|Alice]] and [[Franco Battiato]] which shared 5th position in the final but still became a #3 hit in Italy and was also placed at #20 on the chart of the best-selling singles in Italy of 1984.<ref>[http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/hp_weeks/index.html Hit Parade Italia, chart entry \"I Treni di Tozeur\"]</ref>\n\n=== TV censorship of the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 ===\nItaly refused to broadcast the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974]] on [[RAI]] because of a song sung by [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] which coincided with the intense political campaigning for the [[1974 Italian referendum on divorce]] which was held a month later in May. Despite the Eurovision contest's taking place more than a month before the planned vote, Italian censors refused to allow the contest and song to be shown or heard. RAI censors felt that the song, which was titled \"[[S\u00ec (song)|S\u00ec]]\" (''Yes''), and which contained [http://www.diggiloo.net/?1974it lyrics] constantly repeating the aforementioned word could be accused of being [[subliminal messaging]] and a form of [[propaganda]] to influence the Italian voting public to vote 'yes' in the referendum ('yes' to repeal the law that allowed divorce). The song thus remained censored on most Italian state TV and radio stations for over a month. At the contest in [[Brighton]], Cinquetti finished second, losing to [[ABBA]]. \"S\u00ec\" went on to be a UK top ten hit, peaking at number eight. It also reached the German top 20.\n\n=== A new interest? ===\nHowever, in 2008 two noted Italian musicians, Vince Tempera (who was the conductor for Malta in 1975 and had helped San Marino take part in the ESC in 2008) and Eurovision winner [[Toto Cutugno]] expressed their sorrow at Italy's non-participation and called for the country to return to the contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/10782/italy_maestro_tempera_calls_italy_back_to_eurovision|title=Italy: Maestro Tempera calls Italy back to Eurovision|publisher=ESCToday|last=Kasapoglou|first=Yiorgos|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=7 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/history?id=1143|title=Cutugno: \"Italy's absence unfortunate\"|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=16 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nContestants from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]], starting with the winner [[Dima Bilan]] appeared on the Italian show ''Carramba!

Whether this was an initiative by Carr\u00e0 (who presented three shows in [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] concerning the event) to try to bring Eurovision back to Italy is not clear, but Sietse Bakker, Manager Communications & PR of the Eurovision Song Contest, reiterated that \"Italy is still very much welcome to take part in the competition.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12307/italy_eurovision_stars_guests_on_rai_uno|title=Italy: Eurovision stars guests on Rai Uno|last=Hondal|first=V\u00edctor|date=19 September 2008|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=20 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=1367|title=Eurovision stars going to Italy!|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=17 September 2008|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=20 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nShortly after revealing the list of participants for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 Contest]] the EBU announced that, for the 2010 Contest, they would work harder to bring Italy back into the contest, along with former participants [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monaco]] and [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/12899/ebu_working_for_eurovision_full_house_in_2010| title=EBU working for Eurovision full house in 2010 |last=floras|first=stella|date=13 January 2009|publisher=ESCTodayaccessdate=30 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Successful return to the contest===\nAt a press conference presenting the fourth edition of the [[X Factor (Italian TV series)|Italian ''X Factor'']], [[Rai 2]] director Massimo Liofredi announced that the winner of the competition might advance to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest, rather than participate in the [[Sanremo Festival]], as in previous years. On 2 December 2010, it was officially announced by the Eurovision Song Contest official website that Italy had applied to compete in the 2011 Contest.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=Italy applied for 2011 Eurovision Song Contest!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22443&_t=italy_applied_for_2011_eurovision_song_contest|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=2 December 2010|date=2 December 2010}}</ref> Their participation was further confirmed on 31 December with the announcement of the official participant list.<ref name=\"Italy return\" />\n\nItaly's return to the contest after a 14-year absence has been successful, finishing in the top ten in seven of the last nine contests (2011\u201319). In 2011, [[Raphael Gualazzi]] finished second, Italy's best result since 1990. Italy actually came first with the jury vote, but only 11th in the televote to place second overall behind winners Azerbaijan. [[Nina Zilli]] in 2012 and [[Marco Mengoni]] in 2013 were able to achieve a top 10 position (9th and 7th respectively). This trend had a stop when [[Emma Marrone]], selected internally, ended in 21st place, worst position ever of an Italian entry. In 2015, winners of Sanremo [[Il Volo]] finished third with 292 points, behind Sweden and Russia. Italy placed first in the televote with 366 points, but sixth in the jury vote. Since the introduction of the 50/50 split vote voting system, this was the first time that the winner of the televote did not win the contest. Francesca Michielin, selected among competitors of 2016 Sanremo Festival after the waiver of the winners [[Stadio]], ended in 16th place. [[Francesco Gabbani]], a fan favourite with \"Occidentali's Karma\", earned a 6th place in 2017. The year after, although not initially a big favourite with the bookies, [[Ermal Meta]] and [[Fabrizio Moro]] returned Italy to the top 5 with \"[[Non mi avete fatto niente]]\" aided significantly by finishing third in the televote which heavily counterbalanced the 17th place of the jury, finishing fifth overall. In 2019 [[Mahmood (singer)|Mahmood]] placed second with 465 points, Italy's best result since 2011.\n\n== Italy's return and the \"Big Five\" ==\nSince 2000, four countries - the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] - have automatically qualified for the final of the Contest regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous contests.<ref name=\"50yrs\">{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=John Kennedy|year=2005|title=The Eurovision Song Contest 50 Years The Official History|publisher=Carlton Books Limited|location=[[London]]|isbn=1-84442-586-X}}</ref> They earned this status by being the four biggest financial contributors to the EBU.

It was one of the seven countries that competed at the first contest. Italy competed at the contest frequently until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]. After a 14-year absence, the country returned to the contest in {{escyr|2011}}. Italy has won the contest twice.\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]], [[Domenico Modugno]] finished third with the song \"Nel blu, dipinto di blu\". Renamed \"[[Volare (song)|Volare]]\", the song became a huge international hit, reaching the US number one spot. [[Emilio Pericoli]] also finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], before Italy won for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]] with [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and \"[[Non ho l'et\u00e0]]\". Cinquetti returned to the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] and finished second with the song \"[[Si (song)|Si]]\", losing to [[ABBA]]. Italy then finished third in 1975 with [[Wess]] and [[Dori Ghezzi]] and the song \"[[Era (song)|Era]]\". The country's best result of the 1980s was [[Umberto Tozzi]] and [[Raffaele Riefoli|Raf]] finishing third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]]. Italy's second victory in the contest came in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]] with [[Toto Cutugno]] and the song \"[[Insieme: 1992]]\". Other good 1990s results were [[Mia Martini]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992]] and [[Jalisse]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], who both finished fourth. After 1997, Italy withdrew from the competition.\n\nOn 31 December 2010, the EBU announced that Italy would be returning to the contest as part of the \"Big Five\", meaning that it automatically qualified for the final.<ref name=\"Italy return\">{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=43 nations on 2011 participants list|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22833&_t=43+nations+on+2011+participants+list!|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=31 December 2010|date=2010-12-31}}</ref> Italy's return to the contest has proved to be successful, finishing in the top ten in seven of the last nine contests (2011\u201319), including second places for [[Raphael Gualazzi]] ({{escyr|2011}}) and [[Mahmood (singer)|Mahmood]] in ({{escyr|2019}}), and [[Il Volo]] finishing third in {{escyr|2015}}. Il Volo won the televoting, receiving votes from all countries, but the juries placed them sixth. Since the introduction of the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest#Voting Systems|50/50 voting system]] in 2009, this was the first time that the winner of the viewers vote did not win the contest.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Absences ===\nItaly has withdrawn from the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] a number of times. The first withdrawal was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]], when [[RAI]] stated that interest had diminished in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=297|title=History - Eurovision Song Contest 1981|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> This absence continued through [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|the following year]], before Italy returned in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Italy again withdrew in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]] when RAI decided not to enter the contest.\nFrom [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]] to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]] Italy withdrew again, with RAI citing a lack of interest in participating. Italy returned in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], before withdrawing again without explanation, and the country did not participate again until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]].\n\nNone of the Eurovision winning songs were particularly successful in the Italian charts. \"[[Non ho l'eta]]\" by Gigliola Cinquetti (Grand Prix 1964) was a hit in February 1964 when the song won the Sanremo festival, but according to the official \"Hit Parade Italia\" website, \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\", \"[[Ding-A-Dong]]\", \"[[Puppet on a String]]\", \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\" and even Italy's own winning entry of 1990, \"[[Insieme: 1992]]\", all failed to enter the top ten of the records sales charts. A notable exception to this rule was, however, the 1984 entry \"[[I treni di Tozeur]]\" by [[Alice (Italian singer)|Alice]] and [[Franco Battiato]] which shared 5th position in the final but still became a #3 hit in Italy and was also placed at #20 on the chart of the best-selling singles in Italy of 1984.<ref>[http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/hp_weeks/index.html Hit Parade Italia, chart entry \"I Treni di Tozeur\"]</ref>\n\n=== TV censorship of the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 ===\nItaly refused to broadcast the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974]] on [[RAI]] because of a song sung by [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] which coincided with the intense political campaigning for the [[1974 Italian referendum on divorce]] which was held a month later in May. Despite the Eurovision contest's taking place more than a month before the planned vote, Italian censors refused to allow the contest and song to be shown or heard. RAI censors felt that the song, which was titled \"[[S\u00ec (song)|S\u00ec]]\" (''Yes''), and which contained [http://www.diggiloo.net/?1974it lyrics] constantly repeating the aforementioned word could be accused of being [[subliminal messaging]] and a form of [[propaganda]] to influence the Italian voting public to vote 'yes' in the referendum ('yes' to repeal the law that allowed divorce). The song thus remained censored on most Italian state TV and radio stations for over a month. At the contest in [[Brighton]], Cinquetti finished second, losing to [[ABBA]]. \"S\u00ec\" went on to be a UK top ten hit, peaking at number eight. It also reached the German top 20.\n\n=== A new interest? ===\nHowever, in 2008 two noted Italian musicians, Vince Tempera (who was the conductor for Malta in 1975 and had helped San Marino take part in the ESC in 2008) and Eurovision winner [[Toto Cutugno]] expressed their sorrow at Italy's non-participation and called for the country to return to the contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/10782/italy_maestro_tempera_calls_italy_back_to_eurovision|title=Italy: Maestro Tempera calls Italy back to Eurovision|publisher=ESCToday|last=Kasapoglou|first=Yiorgos|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=7 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/history?id=1143|title=Cutugno: \"Italy's absence unfortunate\"|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=16 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nContestants from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]], starting with the winner [[Dima Bilan]] appeared on the Italian show ''Carramba!

Whether this was an initiative by Carr\u00e0 (who presented three shows in [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] concerning the event) to try to bring Eurovision back to Italy is not clear, but Sietse Bakker, Manager Communications & PR of the Eurovision Song Contest, reiterated that \"Italy is still very much welcome to take part in the competition.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12307/italy_eurovision_stars_guests_on_rai_uno|title=Italy: Eurovision stars guests on Rai Uno|last=Hondal|first=V\u00edctor|date=19 September 2008|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=20 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=1367|title=Eurovision stars going to Italy!|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|date=17 September 2008|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=20 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nShortly after revealing the list of participants for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 Contest]] the EBU announced that, for the 2010 Contest, they would work harder to bring Italy back into the contest, along with former participants [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monaco]] and [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/12899/ebu_working_for_eurovision_full_house_in_2010| title=EBU working for Eurovision full house in 2010 |last=floras|first=stella|date=13 January 2009|publisher=ESCTodayaccessdate=30 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Successful return to the contest===\nAt a press conference presenting the fourth edition of the [[X Factor (Italian TV series)|Italian ''X Factor'']], [[Rai 2]] director Massimo Liofredi announced that the winner of the competition might advance to represent Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest, rather than participate in the [[Sanremo Festival]], as in previous years. On 2 December 2010, it was officially announced by the Eurovision Song Contest official website that Italy had applied to compete in the 2011 Contest.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|title=Italy applied for 2011 Eurovision Song Contest!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22443&_t=italy_applied_for_2011_eurovision_song_contest|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=2 December 2010|date=2 December 2010}}</ref> Their participation was further confirmed on 31 December with the announcement of the official participant list.<ref name=\"Italy return\" />\n\nItaly's return to the contest after a 14-year absence has been successful, finishing in the top ten in seven of the last nine contests (2011\u201319). In 2011, [[Raphael Gualazzi]] finished second, Italy's best result since 1990. Italy actually came first with the jury vote, but only 11th in the televote to place second overall behind winners Azerbaijan. [[Nina Zilli]] in 2012 and [[Marco Mengoni]] in 2013 were able to achieve a top 10 position (9th and 7th respectively). This trend had a stop when [[Emma Marrone]], selected internally, ended in 21st place, worst position ever of an Italian entry. In 2015, winners of Sanremo [[Il Volo]] finished third with 292 points, behind Sweden and Russia. Italy placed first in the televote with 366 points, but sixth in the jury vote. Since the introduction of the 50/50 split vote voting system, this was the first time that the winner of the televote did not win the contest. Francesca Michielin, selected among competitors of 2016 Sanremo Festival after the waiver of the winners [[Stadio]], ended in 16th place. [[Francesco Gabbani]], a fan favourite with \"Occidentali's Karma\", earned a 6th place in 2017. The year after, although not initially a big favourite with the bookies, [[Ermal Meta]] and [[Fabrizio Moro]] returned Italy to the top 5 with \"[[Non mi avete fatto niente]]\" aided significantly by finishing third in the televote which heavily counterbalanced the 17th place of the jury, finishing fifth overall.
