The child can't yet perform the abstract thinking operations. The child has to be able to see what is being talked about, because they do not understand the concepts of logic, betrayal, contemplation, etc. This means that they think literally: if a child is told that they have to go to bed because \"night is falling\", they will ask how can the night (literally) fall from the sky. They also see the human characteristics in every object, e.g. the table \"is bad\" if they accidentally hit it with their foot and it hurts. They also exhibit egocentrism; not to be confused with egoism; that being said, they do not comprehend that the other person has beliefs and the children at this age think that what they think, everybody thinks. There is also a matter of perceptive [[centration]], which causes the children to primarily see what is visually most prominent on someone/something, e.g. if a man has long hair, the child will think he's a woman.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Social-emotional growth and development===\nThis includes children understanding a sense of 'self', relationships with others and sociability. The emotional development includes expressions, attachment and personality.<ref>Doherty, J. and Hughes, M. (2009) Child Development; Theory into Practice 0\u201311 (1st Edn).

Boys are usually more aggressive, whilst girls are more caring. However, aggression is manifested in two different ways: boys are more physically aggressive, while the girls are more socially aggressive (name-calling and ignoring). In this stage the individual differences become more prominent.\n\n==Physical development==\n\n===Gross motor skills===\nBetween ages 2 and 3 years, young children stop using the awkward, wide-legged robot-like stance that is the hallmark of new walkers. As they develop a smoother gait, they also develop the ability to run, jump, and hop. Children of this age can participate in throwing and catching games with larger balls. They can also push themselves around with their feet while sitting on a riding toy.<ref>Oswalt, A (No Year).

Skills that appear are basic locomotor, ball-handling, fine eye\u2013hand coordination, walking leads to running, jumping, hopping, galloping, and skipping, climbing evolves from creeping.\n\n===Fine motor skills===\n{{Main|Fine motor skill}}\n\nThere are several developmental expectations for children to reach by the time they reach the age of 2. Children are expected to be able to draw simple shapes such as circles, squares and triangles. The development of holding the pencil starts with a supinated grip and finishes with a \"dynamic tripod\" grip which involves three fingers stabilizing the utensil near the tip. They should also be able to cut out such shapes as these. By doing such activities as these develops the children's fine motor skills, by strengthening their fingers and developing their finger control.<ref>No author (2011) Expected Developmental Milestones.

Burton, Y (2008). Early Childhood Education: Issues and Developments. New York: Nova Sciences Publishers, Inc.</ref> Social, emotional, cognitive, language, and physical lessons are not learned separately by very young children. Adults who are most helpful to young children interact in ways that understand that the child is learning from the whole experience, not just that part of the experience to which the adult gives attention.\n\nThe most information learned occurs between birth and the age of three, during this time humans develop more quickly and rapidly than they would at any other point in their life. Love, affection, encouragement and mental stimulation from the parents or guardians of these young children aid in development. At this time in life, the brain is growing rapidly and it is easier for information to be absorbed; parts of the brain can nearly double in a year. During this stage, children need vital nutrients and personal interaction for their brain to grow properly. Children's brains will expand and become more developed in these early years. Although adults play a huge part in early childhood development, the most important way children develop is interaction with other children.\nChildren develop close relationships with the children they spend a large period of time with. Close relationships with peers develop strong social connections that can be transferred later in life, even children at an early age have a preference of whom they want to interact with or form friendships with. Howes (1983) research suggested that there are distinctive characteristics of friendships, for infants, toddler and pre-school aged children.<ref>No author (2013).

They also exhibit egocentrism; not to be confused with egoism; that being said, they do not comprehend that the other person has beliefs and the children at this age think that what they think, everybody thinks. There is also a matter of perceptive [[centration]], which causes the children to primarily see what is visually most prominent on someone/something, e.g. if a man has long hair, the child will think he's a woman.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Social-emotional growth and development===\nThis includes children understanding a sense of 'self', relationships with others and sociability. The emotional development includes expressions, attachment and personality.<ref>Doherty, J. and Hughes, M. (2009) Child Development; Theory into Practice 0\u201311 (1st Edn). Harlow, Essex; Pearson.pp 8.</ref>\nChildren manifest fear of dark and monsters and around the age of three notice whether they are a boy or a girl and start acting that way. Boys are usually more aggressive, whilst girls are more caring. However, aggression is manifested in two different ways: boys are more physically aggressive, while the girls are more socially aggressive (name-calling and ignoring). In this stage the individual differences become more prominent.\n\n==Physical development==\n\n===Gross motor skills===\nBetween ages 2 and 3 years, young children stop using the awkward, wide-legged robot-like stance that is the hallmark of new walkers. As they develop a smoother gait, they also develop the ability to run, jump, and hop. Children of this age can participate in throwing and catching games with larger balls. They can also push themselves around with their feet while sitting on a riding toy.<ref>Oswalt, A (No Year).

Skills that appear are basic locomotor, ball-handling, fine eye\u2013hand coordination, walking leads to running, jumping, hopping, galloping, and skipping, climbing evolves from creeping.\n\n===Fine motor skills===\n{{Main|Fine motor skill}}\n\nThere are several developmental expectations for children to reach by the time they reach the age of 2. Children are expected to be able to draw simple shapes such as circles, squares and triangles. The development of holding the pencil starts with a supinated grip and finishes with a \"dynamic tripod\" grip which involves three fingers stabilizing the utensil near the tip. They should also be able to cut out such shapes as these. By doing such activities as these develops the children's fine motor skills, by strengthening their fingers and developing their finger control.<ref>No author (2011) Expected Developmental Milestones.

Burton, Y (2008). Early Childhood Education: Issues and Developments. New York: Nova Sciences Publishers, Inc.</ref> Social, emotional, cognitive, language, and physical lessons are not learned separately by very young children. Adults who are most helpful to young children interact in ways that understand that the child is learning from the whole experience, not just that part of the experience to which the adult gives attention.\n\nThe most information learned occurs between birth and the age of three, during this time humans develop more quickly and rapidly than they would at any other point in their life. Love, affection, encouragement and mental stimulation from the parents or guardians of these young children aid in development. At this time in life, the brain is growing rapidly and it is easier for information to be absorbed; parts of the brain can nearly double in a year. During this stage, children need vital nutrients and personal interaction for their brain to grow properly. Children's brains will expand and become more developed in these early years. Although adults play a huge part in early childhood development, the most important way children develop is interaction with other children.\nChildren develop close relationships with the children they spend a large period of time with. Close relationships with peers develop strong social connections that can be transferred later in life, even children at an early age have a preference of whom they want to interact with or form friendships with. Howes (1983) research suggested that there are distinctive characteristics of friendships, for infants, toddler and pre-school aged children.<ref>No author (2013).

The highway spans the southeastern [[United States]] and is close to the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] for much of its length. The highway's southern terminus is at [[Punta Gorda, Florida]], at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 41|US&nbsp;41]].  Traveling north, US&nbsp;17 joins up with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] in [[Paris, Virginia]], and the northern terminus of US 17 is in downtown [[Winchester, Virginia]]. This is also the point at which the portion of US 50 called the [[Northwestern Turnpike]] begins.\n\nThough [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] is generally considered to be the highway that runs alongside [[Interstate 95]] (I-95), US 17 runs parallel to I-95 for much of its extent, and even shares the same physical road for short spans in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], and [[Ridgeland, South Carolina]]. As such, US&nbsp;17 is out of sequence in the U.S. Highway numbering plan (US 17 would, under the plan, run parallel to and between [[U.S. Route 15|US&nbsp;15]] and [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]]; the U.S. Highway following that path is instead marked [[U.S. Route 219|US&nbsp;219]]).\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table}}\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in Florida|FL]]\n|294\n|473\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in Georgia|GA]]\n|143\n|230\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina|SC]]\n|221\n|356\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina|NC]]\n|284\n|457\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|VA]]\n|255.09\n|410.53\n|-\n|Total\n|1189\n|1,914\n|}\n\n===Florida===\n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in Florida|U.S. Route 92|Roosevelt Boulevard (Jacksonville)}}\nUS 17 begins in downtown [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]], [[Florida]], at [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|US 41]] (Cross Street), just to the west of [[Tamiami Trail]].  After running east, it runs roughly north along the [[Peace River (Florida)|Peace River]], through [[Arcadia, Florida|Arcadia]], [[Zolfo Springs, Florida|Zolfo Springs]] (where it crosses the Peace River), and [[Wauchula, Florida|Wauchula]].  At [[Fort Meade, Florida|Fort Meade]], it joins with [[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|US 98]], which follows it northward (westward on US 98) until [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]].  While US 98 goes northwest, US 17 goes northeast.\n\nUS 17 begins a long concurrency with US 92 just north of [[Winter Haven, Florida|Winter Haven]] in [[Lake Alfred, Florida|Lake Alfred]] (US 92 following eastbound), which takes both highways through [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], where they join [[U.S. Route 192|US 192]]. Like US 92, US 17 roughly parallels [[Interstate 4]] along the overlap. When all three meet [[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|US 441]], US 192 follows US 441 southbound, while US 17/92 follows US 441 north into downtown [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].  US 17/92 then splits from US 441 at [[Florida State Road 50|SR 50]] (Colonial Drive) and jogs east, splitting back north from SR 50 when it meets [[Florida State Road 15|SR 15]] (Mills Avenue).\n\n[[File:US 17 sign.JPG|thumb|A US 17 highway sign in [[McIntosh County, Georgia]], USA]]\nIn [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]], the redevelopment of the 17\u201392 Community Redevelopment Area is handled by the US 17\u201392 Community Redevelopment Agency, a component unit of the County government.  In [[Sanford, Florida]], US 17/92 crosses the [[St. Johns River]] into [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]] via the Bill Benedict Bridge.\n\nUS 92 then splits away from US 17 north of [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]], with US 92 continuing east to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] as International Speedway Boulevard, while US 17 continues north toward [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]], where it again crosses the St. Johns River.\n\nIn [[Clay County, Florida|Clay County]], US 17 runs through suburban [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].  The northern stretch of US 17 in Clay County is known as Park Avenue.\n\nIn [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the southern portion of US 17 is known as Roosevelt Boulevard.  Here, the highway goes past [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]] (NAS Jax).  Near downtown Jacksonville, US 17 joins [[Interstate 10 in Florida|Interstate 10]] for approximately one mile, before merging into [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]].  US 17 then exits onto Union Street and continues as North Main Street until the [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau County]] border. It then continues until it reaches the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] border, crossing over the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Marys River]].\n\n===Georgia===\n[[File:US 17 canopy of Oaks D7A 1540.jpg|thumb|left|A canopy of oak trees over a section of US 17 in McIntosh County, Georgia]] \n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in Georgia}}\nIn [[Woodbine, Georgia|Woodbine]], US 17 crosses the [[Satilla River]] by way of the [[J.

In [[Brunswick, Georgia|Brunswick]], the route traverses the South [[Brunswick River (Georgia)|Brunswick River]] over the [[Sidney Lanier Bridge]], then across the [[Altamaha River]] bridge between [[Glynn County, Georgia|Glynn County]] and [[McIntosh County, Georgia|McIntosh County]]. At the [[South Carolina]] state line, US 17 crosses the [[Savannah River]] on the [[Talmadge Memorial Bridge]].\n\nThe section of US 17 known as the \"Gateway to Historic Brunswick and The Golden Isles\" was included in [[The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s 2006 list of ''Places in Peril''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://savannahgetaways.net/blog/index.php/tag/places-in-peril/|title=Places in Peril Archives \u2013 Savannah Getaways|website=Savannah Getaways}}</ref>\n\n===South Carolina===\n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina}}\n\nUS 17 enters South Carolina in [[Jasper County, South Carolina|Jasper County]] as a two-lane road and within {{convert|8|mi}} enters [[Hardeeville, South Carolina|Hardeeville]], where it becomes a four-lane configuration.  US 17 intersects [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]] in Hardeeville and runs parallel to Interstate 95 until [[Ridgeland, South Carolina|Ridgeland]], where it merges with the interstate until [[Point South, South Carolina|Point South]].  At Point South, US 17 leaves Interstate 95 and heads eastward into northern [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort County]], sharing a concurrency with [[U.S. 21]] until Gardens Corner.  US 21 splits off to [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]] while US 17 heads northeast into the [[ACE Basin]] and [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton County]].  This stretch of road has been upgraded from a two-lane to a four-lane configuration, due to safety concerns.\n\nOnce in [[Jacksonboro, South Carolina|Jacksonboro]], the road enters [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston County]], crossing the [[Edisto River]] and maintains a four-lane configuration for the remainder of the state. The road passes through several rural communities as it approaches Charleston from the west. In [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], the {{convert|3.6|mi|km|adj=on}} section running from S.C. Highway 171 to Sam Rittenberg Boulevard has been named the \"Charleston Nine Memorial Highway\", in honor of nine Charleston firefighters killed in the line of duty in the [[Charleston Sofa Super Store fire]] on June 18, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Smith |url=http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/mar/25/u_s_stretch_honor_firefighters34880/ |title=U.S. 17 stretch to honor firefighters who died in sofa store blaze |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017154809/http://charleston.net/news/2008/mar/25/u_s_stretch_honor_firefighters34880/ |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Post and Courier]] |date=March 25, 2008 }}</ref>  US 17 passes through the West Ashley community before it traverses the [[Ashley River (South Carolina)|Ashley River]] Drawbridges to the Charleston Peninsula.

Upon reaching the [[Interstate 26]] terminus, US 17 becomes limited-access and above grade as it approaches the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]] via the [[Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge]]. The stretch of US&nbsp;17 in Charleston is infamous among locals for its traffic congestion, especially on weekday mornings.\n\nUpon crossing the river, the highway enters [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]] at grade and is signalized for several miles up through the second interchange with [[Interstate 526]] and connecting roads to the [[Isle of Palms, South Carolina|Isle of Palms]] and [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]].

US 17's route through Georgetown is a major thoroughfare through the city and skirts the historic district. the City of Georgetown has made several upgrades since 2005 to address growing drainage concerns. After going through Georgetown and passing by [[DeBordieu, South Carolina|DeBordieu]], [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina|Pawleys Island]], and [[Litchfield Beach, South Carolina|Litchfield Beach]], [[Murrells Inlet, South Carolina|Murrells Inlet]] US 17 enters [[Horry County, South Carolina|Horry County]], passes [[Garden City, South Carolina|Garden City Beach]], [[Surfside Beach, South Carolina|Surfside Beach]], and arrives in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], where it splits between a business route and the standard route, which remains west of the beach and tourist areas served by Business 17.  The roads rejoin north of the city and continue as US 17 through [[Atlantic Beach, South Carolina|Atlantic Beach]], [[North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|North Myrtle Beach]] and [[Little River, South Carolina|Little River]] before crossing into North Carolina.\n\n===North Carolina===\n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina}}\n\n[[Image:C.

Between [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and [[James City, North Carolina|James City]], US 17 (concurrent with [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|US 70]] and [[NC 55]]) crosses the [[Trent River (North Carolina)|Trent River]] by way of the [[Freedom Memorial Bridge]]. Farther east, between [[James City, North Carolina|James City]] and [[Bridgeton, North Carolina|Bridgeton]], US 17, still concurrent with NC 55, crosses the [[Neuse River]] over the [[Neuse River Bridge]].\n\nIn [[Washington, North Carolina|Washington]], US 17 crosses the [[Pamlico River]] over the [[Pamlico-Tar River Bridge]]. Farther along, in [[Williamston, North Carolina|Williamston]], US 17 (concurrent with [[US 13]]) crosses the [[Roanoke River]], then the [[Cashie River]] at [[Windsor, North Carolina|Windsor]]. At the [[Bertie County, North Carolina|Bertie County]]-[[Chowan County, North Carolina|Chowan County]] line, US 17 traverses the [[Chowan River]] on the [[Chowan River Bridge]], one of the longest bridges along US 17's route. In [[Perquimans County, North Carolina|Perquimans County]], US 17 (here concurrent with [[NC 37]]) crosses the [[Yeopim River]] and the [[Perquimans River]] at [[Hertford, North Carolina|Hertford]]. Crossing into [[Pasquotank County, North Carolina|Pasquotank County]] over the [[Little River (Albemarle Sound)|Little River]], US 17 enters [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina|Elizabeth City]] and begins a short concurrency with [[US 158]]. At [[Morgan's Corner, North Carolina|Morgan's Corner]], the US 158 concurrency ends, and US 17 crosses the [[Pasquotank River]] into [[Camden County, North Carolina|Camden County]] before heading north into [[Virginia]].\n\n===Virginia===\n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in Virginia}}\nUS 17 enters Virginia into the city of [[Chesapeake, Virginia]], running along the border of the Great Dismal Swamp. It runs through more of Chesapeake and the city of [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth,]] before it crosses the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] between [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight County]] on the [[James River Bridge]], a [[Moveable bridge|drawbridge]] which was formerly a [[toll bridge]] but is now toll-free, concurrent with [[U.S. Route 258]]. The route also crosses the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] between [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]] and [[York County, Virginia|York County]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] on the [[George P. Coleman Bridge]], a [[swing bridge]] which is also a (north-bound only) [[toll bridge]]. Finally, US 17 traverses the [[Rappahannock River]] between [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] and [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania County]] at [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] as it overlaps [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]]. Then it traverses the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and crosses the towns of [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]] and [[Marshall, Virginia|Marshall]] to end up at a junction with [[US Route 11]] (see [[US Route 11 in Virginia]]) and [[US Route 522]] in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Florida===\n[[Image:US 17 (FL).svg|70px|thumb|right|A US 17 shield used in Florida prior to 1993]]\nFrom 1956 until 1993, US 17 signs in Florida featured black numbering on a yellow shield.

The highway spans the southeastern [[United States]] and is close to the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] for much of its length. The highway's southern terminus is at [[Punta Gorda, Florida]], at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 41|US&nbsp;41]].  Traveling north, US&nbsp;17 joins up with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] in [[Paris, Virginia]], and the northern terminus of US 17 is in downtown [[Winchester, Virginia]]. This is also the point at which the portion of US 50 called the [[Northwestern Turnpike]] begins.\n\nThough [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] is generally considered to be the highway that runs alongside [[Interstate 95]] (I-95), US 17 runs parallel to I-95 for much of its extent, and even shares the same physical road for short spans in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], and [[Ridgeland, South Carolina]]. As such, US&nbsp;17 is out of sequence in the U.S. Highway numbering plan (US 17 would, under the plan, run parallel to and between [[U.S. Route 15|US&nbsp;15]] and [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]]; the U.S. Highway following that path is instead marked [[U.S. Route 219|US&nbsp;219]]).\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table}}\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in Florida|FL]]\n|294\n|473\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in Georgia|GA]]\n|143\n|230\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina|SC]]\n|221\n|356\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina|NC]]\n|284\n|457\n|-\n|[[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|VA]]\n|255.09\n|410.53\n|-\n|Total\n|1189\n|1,914\n|}\n\n===Florida===\n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in Florida|U.S. Route 92|Roosevelt Boulevard (Jacksonville)}}\nUS 17 begins in downtown [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]], [[Florida]], at [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|US 41]] (Cross Street), just to the west of [[Tamiami Trail]].  After running east, it runs roughly north along the [[Peace River (Florida)|Peace River]], through [[Arcadia, Florida|Arcadia]], [[Zolfo Springs, Florida|Zolfo Springs]] (where it crosses the Peace River), and [[Wauchula, Florida|Wauchula]].  At [[Fort Meade, Florida|Fort Meade]], it joins with [[U.S. Route 98 in Florida|US 98]], which follows it northward (westward on US 98) until [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]].  While US 98 goes northwest, US 17 goes northeast.\n\nUS 17 begins a long concurrency with US 92 just north of [[Winter Haven, Florida|Winter Haven]] in [[Lake Alfred, Florida|Lake Alfred]] (US 92 following eastbound), which takes both highways through [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], where they join [[U.S. Route 192|US 192]]. Like US 92, US 17 roughly parallels [[Interstate 4]] along the overlap. When all three meet [[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|US 441]], US 192 follows US 441 southbound, while US 17/92 follows US 441 north into downtown [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].  US 17/92 then splits from US 441 at [[Florida State Road 50|SR 50]] (Colonial Drive) and jogs east, splitting back north from SR 50 when it meets [[Florida State Road 15|SR 15]] (Mills Avenue).\n\n[[File:US 17 sign.JPG|thumb|A US 17 highway sign in [[McIntosh County, Georgia]], USA]]\nIn [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole County]], the redevelopment of the 17\u201392 Community Redevelopment Area is handled by the US 17\u201392 Community Redevelopment Agency, a component unit of the County government.  In [[Sanford, Florida]], US 17/92 crosses the [[St. Johns River]] into [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]] via the Bill Benedict Bridge.\n\nUS 92 then splits away from US 17 north of [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]], with US 92 continuing east to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] as International Speedway Boulevard, while US 17 continues north toward [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]], where it again crosses the St. Johns River.\n\nIn [[Clay County, Florida|Clay County]], US 17 runs through suburban [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].  The northern stretch of US 17 in Clay County is known as Park Avenue.\n\nIn [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the southern portion of US 17 is known as Roosevelt Boulevard.  Here, the highway goes past [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]] (NAS Jax).  Near downtown Jacksonville, US 17 joins [[Interstate 10 in Florida|Interstate 10]] for approximately one mile, before merging into [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]].  US 17 then exits onto Union Street and continues as North Main Street until the [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau County]] border. It then continues until it reaches the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] border, crossing over the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Marys River]].\n\n===Georgia===\n[[File:US 17 canopy of Oaks D7A 1540.jpg|thumb|left|A canopy of oak trees over a section of US 17 in McIntosh County, Georgia]] \n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in Georgia}}\nIn [[Woodbine, Georgia|Woodbine]], US 17 crosses the [[Satilla River]] by way of the [[J.

At the [[South Carolina]] state line, US 17 crosses the [[Savannah River]] on the [[Talmadge Memorial Bridge]].\n\nThe section of US 17 known as the \"Gateway to Historic Brunswick and The Golden Isles\" was included in [[The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s 2006 list of ''Places in Peril''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://savannahgetaways.net/blog/index.php/tag/places-in-peril/|title=Places in Peril Archives \u2013 Savannah Getaways|website=Savannah Getaways}}</ref>\n\n===South Carolina===\n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina}}\n\nUS 17 enters South Carolina in [[Jasper County, South Carolina|Jasper County]] as a two-lane road and within {{convert|8|mi}} enters [[Hardeeville, South Carolina|Hardeeville]], where it becomes a four-lane configuration.  US 17 intersects [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]] in Hardeeville and runs parallel to Interstate 95 until [[Ridgeland, South Carolina|Ridgeland]], where it merges with the interstate until [[Point South, South Carolina|Point South]].  At Point South, US 17 leaves Interstate 95 and heads eastward into northern [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort County]], sharing a concurrency with [[U.S. 21]] until Gardens Corner.  US 21 splits off to [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]] while US 17 heads northeast into the [[ACE Basin]] and [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton County]].  This stretch of road has been upgraded from a two-lane to a four-lane configuration, due to safety concerns.\n\nOnce in [[Jacksonboro, South Carolina|Jacksonboro]], the road enters [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston County]], crossing the [[Edisto River]] and maintains a four-lane configuration for the remainder of the state. The road passes through several rural communities as it approaches Charleston from the west. In [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], the {{convert|3.6|mi|km|adj=on}} section running from S.C.

US 17's route through Georgetown is a major thoroughfare through the city and skirts the historic district. the City of Georgetown has made several upgrades since 2005 to address growing drainage concerns. After going through Georgetown and passing by [[DeBordieu, South Carolina|DeBordieu]], [[Pawleys Island, South Carolina|Pawleys Island]], and [[Litchfield Beach, South Carolina|Litchfield Beach]], [[Murrells Inlet, South Carolina|Murrells Inlet]] US 17 enters [[Horry County, South Carolina|Horry County]], passes [[Garden City, South Carolina|Garden City Beach]], [[Surfside Beach, South Carolina|Surfside Beach]], and arrives in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], where it splits between a business route and the standard route, which remains west of the beach and tourist areas served by Business 17.  The roads rejoin north of the city and continue as US 17 through [[Atlantic Beach, South Carolina|Atlantic Beach]], [[North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|North Myrtle Beach]] and [[Little River, South Carolina|Little River]] before crossing into North Carolina.\n\n===North Carolina===\n{{main|U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina}}\n\n[[Image:C.

The route also crosses the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] between [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]] and [[York County, Virginia|York County]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] on the [[George P. Coleman Bridge]], a [[swing bridge]] which is also a (north-bound only) [[toll bridge]]. Finally, US 17 traverses the [[Rappahannock River]] between [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] and [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania County]] at [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] as it overlaps [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]]. Then it traverses the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and crosses the towns of [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]] and [[Marshall, Virginia|Marshall]] to end up at a junction with [[US Route 11]] (see [[US Route 11 in Virginia]]) and [[US Route 522]] in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Florida===\n[[Image:US 17 (FL).svg|70px|thumb|right|A US 17 shield used in Florida prior to 1993]]\nFrom 1956 until 1993, US 17 signs in Florida featured black numbering on a yellow shield.
