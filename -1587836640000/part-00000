Netherton also neighbours [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton Village]].\n\nNetherton is a mostly residential area, comprising the semi-rural '''Netherton Village,''' (which consists of privately owned houses set around the old Village Green) and the large [[council estate]] built by the former Bootle Borough Council on the other side of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]].\n\nThe estate is unusual in the fact that many of the houses are still occupied by the same residents who moved in as young couples with families when the houses were brand new.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The social profile of the first resident population does not comply to modern notions of council estate dwellers.  Many of these people were hard working people with middle class aspirations, whose lives and careers were interrupted and often changed forever by the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} However, the demographics of the Netherton area have changed significantly over time. A large number of the male residents moved in from all parts of the country to be key skilled workers at the English Electric factory heavy engineering works on Dunnings Bridge Road.\n\nThe main estate, centred on '''Marian Square,''' was built in the mid 1950s to alleviate housing shortages in Bootle after the heavy bombing the town suffered during the Second World War.  Historical records show that of about 18,000 houses in Bootle, only about 1,000 survived the German bombings completely intact. A remaining 16,000 houses were partially damaged and over a thousand completely destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n'''The Sefton Estate''' (which includes Stonyfield, Waterside, Harrops Croft and Higher End Park) was built by Lancashire County Council some ten years after the Netherton estate in the mid 1960s and were the first council houses in the area to have [[central heating]].\n\nMarian Square is opposite the health centre in Magdalene Square (the two squares are divided by Glovers Lane, and should not be confused). The first shops (approximately five, including a health clinic and opticians) were built on Magdalene Square and were later demolished when the new shops and first new post office on Marian Square were opened. The original plans for the redevelopment for Magdalene Square, which were on view as a model in Bootle Town Hall in 1965, were for a 22 storey tower block and a leisure complex including swimming pool, neither of which were built (probably due to a lack of further investment in the area).\n\nThere were also plans for a large ring road to link the motorways at Switch Island, running across fields to the north of the Sefton estate with the centre of Bootle and the landward side of [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], along a corridor of land which included the Rimrose Valley.  The council purchased land along this corridor but the road was never built.  There is a large mound of earth next to the small church near the Cabbage Inn (near the present fire station); which shows the start of the earthworks for the flyover linking the proposed ring road to the goods depot on the railway line near the Girobank building on Netherton Way. The proposed ring road is shown on some old Liverpool A to Z street plans.\n\nThe unused land in the Rimrose Valley was made into an area of parkland, and new houses are being built on the old allotments at the other end of the Rimrose Valley in Litherland.\n\nNotable firms which hold, or once held, premises in Netherton include:- Braby's; English Electric; Forticrete; Metal Box; Movie (cleaning products); National Girobank; Peerless Refining Co.; North West Timber; Porter Chadburn; Post Office Telecommunications (British Telecom.); Scott's Bakery (now part of Allied Bakeries) and now the site of a large trading estate including cinema, Matalan store and a pub called the Bakers Dozen; Wimpey and to [[Alliance and Leicester]].\n\nNetherton was formerly the home of the [[Everton F.C.]] youth academy, which has now been relocated to [[Finch Farm]]. The land was previously a fire station (the old brick building on the site) and the grounds of Littlewoods Social Club. This area has now been turned into a Goals football centre.\n\nOn 19 August 2015 the Thornton to Switch Island link road ([[A5758 road|A5758]]) was opened.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sefton.gov.uk/parking,-roads-travel/broom%E2%80%99s-cross-road-%28thornton-to-switch-island-link%29.aspx|title=Broom\u2019s Cross Road (Thornton to Switch Island Link)|publisher=Sefton Council|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Chanel The Parrot'''\n\nOn 20th April 2020, national focus fell on the town after a parrot named \u2018Chanel\u2019 flew out of her owners garden towards Dunnings Bridge Road or possibly the canal after hearing a noise. Flocks of people from the local area heeded a call to arms from the parrots mother who beckoned the African grey with chants of \u2018Chanel\u2019 which echoed out through the various estates. \n\nAlmost 40 minutes after Chanel\u2019s shocking escape, she was reunited with her mother in an emotional video which was shared with the world via Facebook. During the video, the bird is seen nibbling on the mouth of its mother, clearly delighted to be retuning to its home near Marian Square.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.insider.com/parrot-lost-chanel-livestream-facebook-live-sandra-2020-4%3famp|title= A British woman lost her parrot named Chanel and livestreamed the harrowing journey to recover her, and the riveting clips are going viral|accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nNetherton was anciently a [[township (England)|township]] associated with the [[parish]] of Sefton, becoming an independent [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in 1866.

The residual parish no longer exists, forming part of [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton]] parish.\n\nThe area has been a part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]] since local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974.\n\nFor [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary elections]] Netherton is within the [[Bootle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bootle]] constituency represented by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Peter Dowd]].\n\nFor elections to [[Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council|Sefton Council]] Netherton is split between the [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral wards]] of [[Netherton and Orrell (ward)|Netherton and Orrell]], whose three representatives are [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=605 Susan Ellen Bradshaw], [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=162 Robert John Brennan], and [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.asp?UID=218 Ian Ralph Maher], and [[St. Oswald (ward)|St. Oswald]], whose three representatives are [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=184 Paula Spencer], [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=185 Carla Thomas] and [http://modgov.sefton.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=219 Linda Cluskey]. All six councillors who represent the Netherton area are members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe oldest houses are to be found at the heart of the old hamlet of Netherton, clustered around the green in what is now known as Netherton Village, just north of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The old catholic [[St Benet's Chapel, Netherton|church of St. Benet]] nearby was built in 1793.<ref>[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]], Nikolaus - The Buildings of England: South Lancashire, 1969.</ref> Unusually it appears as an ordinary house from the road with the church backing onto what was once open fields. A modern church was built over the road in the 1970s.\n\nNowadays, Netherton is formed with many modern housing, the most recent being the [[George Wimpey]] estate, completed in 2000, built just {{convert|100|yd|m|-2}} from Netherton Village green.  Housing in this part of Netherton is considered rather desirable, unlike the council-owned housing closer to the town's shopping amenities.\n\n==Education==\nNetherton is home to one secondary school, [[Savio High School]]. Formerly there was St Ambrose Barlow High School, Bootle Grammar School and Warwick Bolam County Secondary School as well as a Girl's County Secondary School. In August 2009, [[Bootle High School]] closed its doors for the last time as students transferred to [[Litherland High School]].  In December 2009, works started to demolish the school on Browns Lane.\nNow however the properties on the council estate are mostly privately owned and were bought under the [[right to buy scheme]] brought in by the conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. St Ambrose Barlow was formerly St. Catherine's Roman Catholic High School and was for girls only, also closed on 11 November 2016. The corresponding boy's school was St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic High School, situated approximately on mile away on the other side of the canal.\n\n==Transport==\nNetherton is served by two railway-stations: [[Aintree railway station|Aintree]] and [[Old Roan railway station|Old Roan]], on the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] of the [[Merseyrail]] network. The Old Roan station is technically in Aintree, but is on the border between the two areas. Old Roan bus station is next to the railway-station. Buses run from here and Magdalene Square into central [[Liverpool]] (those from Magdalene Square also serve parts of [[Bootle]]) as well as North to [[Maghull]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Southport]].\n\nThe area is situated close to the major interchange, [[Switch Island]], at the end of the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M58 motorway|M58]] motorways.\n\nThe [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] flows through Netherton and whilst this provides a local amenity, there is very little boat traffic on this stretch of its course.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Netherton, Merseyside}}\n*[http://liverpoolstreetgallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=32 Liverpool Street Gallery - Liverpool 30]\n*[http://www.emmanuelnetherton.org Netherton Baptist Church]\n*[http://www.seftonarts.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ Netherton Arts Centre]\n*[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10373864 Netherton on a Vision of Britain website]\n*[https://www.sefton.gov.uk/parking,-roads-travel/broom%E2%80%99s-cross-road-%28thornton-to-switch-island-link%29.aspx ]\n{{Metropolitan Borough of Sefton}}\n\n[[Category:Towns and villages in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2008}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country = England\n|coordinates = {{coord|53.4938|-2.9677|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name = Netherton\n|label_position = left\n|population =   \n|population_ref =    \n|metropolitan_borough = [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]]\n|metropolitan_county = [[Merseyside]]\n|region = North West England\n|constituency_westminster = [[Bootle (UK Parliament constituency)|Bootle]]\n|post_town = BOOTLE\n|postcode_district = L30\n|postcode_area = L   \n|dial_code = 0151\n|os_grid_reference = SJ352997\n|map_type = Merseyside\n|static_image_name = Netherton Village.JPG\n|static_image_caption = Netherton Village\n}}\n'''Netherton''' is an area of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]], in [[Merseyside]], [[England]].\n\n==Description==\nSituated in the southern part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, north east of the centre of [[Bootle]], Netherton is also north of [[Litherland]] and to the west of [[Aintree]].

The old catholic [[St Benet's Chapel, Netherton|church of St. Benet]] nearby was built in 1793.<ref>[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]], Nikolaus - The Buildings of England: South Lancashire, 1969.</ref> Unusually it appears as an ordinary house from the road with the church backing onto what was once open fields. A modern church was built over the road in the 1970s.\n\nNowadays, Netherton is formed with many modern housing, the most recent being the [[George Wimpey]] estate, completed in 2000, built just {{convert|100|yd|m|-2}} from Netherton Village green.  Housing in this part of Netherton is considered rather desirable, unlike the council-owned housing closer to the town's shopping amenities.\n\n==Education==\nNetherton is home to one secondary school, [[Savio High School]]. Formerly there was St Ambrose Barlow High School, Bootle Grammar School and Warwick Bolam County Secondary School as well as a Girl's County Secondary School. In August 2009, [[Bootle High School]] closed its doors for the last time as students transferred to [[Litherland High School]].  In December 2009, works started to demolish the school on Browns Lane.\nNow however the properties on the council estate are mostly privately owned and were bought under the [[right to buy scheme]] brought in by the conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. St Ambrose Barlow was formerly St. Catherine's Roman Catholic High School and was for girls only, also closed on 11 November 2016. The corresponding boy's school was St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic High School, situated approximately on mile away on the other side of the canal.\n\n==Transport==\nNetherton is served by two railway-stations: [[Aintree railway station|Aintree]] and [[Old Roan railway station|Old Roan]], on the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] of the [[Merseyrail]] network. The Old Roan station is technically in Aintree, but is on the border between the two areas. Old Roan bus station is next to the railway-station. Buses run from here and Magdalene Square into central [[Liverpool]] (those from Magdalene Square also serve parts of [[Bootle]]) as well as North to [[Maghull]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Southport]].\n\nThe area is situated close to the major interchange, [[Switch Island]], at the end of the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M58 motorway|M58]] motorways.\n\nThe [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] flows through Netherton and whilst this provides a local amenity, there is very little boat traffic on this stretch of its course.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Netherton, Merseyside}}\n*[http://liverpoolstreetgallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=32 Liverpool Street Gallery - Liverpool 30]\n*[http://www.emmanuelnetherton.org Netherton Baptist Church]\n*[http://www.seftonarts.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ Netherton Arts Centre]\n*[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10373864 Netherton on a Vision of Britain website]\n*[https://www.sefton.gov.uk/parking,-roads-travel/broom%E2%80%99s-cross-road-%28thornton-to-switch-island-link%29.aspx ]\n{{Metropolitan Borough of Sefton}}\n\n[[Category:Towns and villages in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]]\n", "name_user": "NormanP20", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDescription:Added a viral event that is highly important to the overall description of the town.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherton,_Merseyside"}

establish Charged HK, with the 5 founders as follows: Mark Webb-Johnson (original chairman), Edwin Lee King-Yan (original vice-chairman), Sony Wong Siu Keung (original treasurer), Core K\u00e5re Lohse (original secretary) and Kristy Lau Kwan Yin (original membership). A competition had been set up to design the future logo of Charged Hong Kong, and the logo submitted by Ricky Sun was selected.\n\nOn 15 April 2015, Charged Hong Kong was assigned society registration certificate #54000, and 4 days later, on 19 April 2015, the first Charged Hong Kong meet-up took place. On 29 April 2015, three of the Charged Hong Kong members participated in an internal conference about EVs in the Hong Kong SAR government, being the only representatives of EV owners present. On 14 June 2015, Charged Hong Kong took part in the Electric Vehicle Fiesta 2015. On 5 September 2015, Charged Hong Kong received charitable status, as Hong Kong registered charity #91/14340, and just after that, Charged Hong Kong hosted the first ever National Drive Electric Week outside of North America (12 \u2013 20 September 2015).

And from that time, it was continuously used for the York Agricultural Fair.<ref>Prior to that, the York Fair was in front of the York Hotel below [[Faversham House]]</ref>  In 1885 the Society procured a 99 year lease from the Government of that land for a peppercorn rent.<ref>Lands and Surveys Dept File: York Crown Lands, PRO. The land is York Town Lots 11 and 12.</ref>\n\nThe land immediately to the north, between what is now Christie Retreat and Macartney Street, was unused, but was one of the few pieces of land that the public could enter along the Avon River. The Society used the land which it leased to display and auction animals, but the whole of the land alongside Bland\u2019s Pool was used as a fair ground.<ref>Clack, AM: A Bathing House on the Avon, Hedley Creek, 1999, pp.5-7.</ref>\n\nIn May, 1890, the Commissioners of the York Agricultural Society requested the York Municipal Council grant them the strip of land between lots 10 and 11, on the undeveloped extension of Mcartney Street between Lowe Street and the river.  This would have meant that the York Agricultural Society would have been in possession of the rotunda and to the Municipality, this was unacceptable.  The Council decided \u201cto take no further interest in the matter\u201d.<ref>York Municipal Council Minutes, 6 June 1890.</ref>\n\nA month later, the Society demanded that not only the Macartney strip of land but the entire reserve (lots 9 and 10) be \u201chanded over\u201d to the Society for the purpose of extending the show ground.<ref>York Municipal Council Minutes, 18 August 1890.</ref> At that time, the Mayor was Kenneth Edwards, who was also Vice-Chairman of the York Agricultural Society.  Two other Councillors were also members of the Society.\n\nThe York Municipal Council\u2019s response was to declare and establish Avon Park on the land to the north of Macartney Street on 20 August 1891. {{quotation|The ceremony of opening the new public park in this township was performed on Thursday afternoon last by the Mayor (Mr. W. Dinsdale) in the presence of the members of the Municipal Council and a few other citizens. Previous to the ceremony the ground was inspected and properly marked out. This having been done, a hole was dug into which the Mayor placed a small ornamental tree, at the same lime declaring the park open. At the invitation of the Mayor the company then adjourned to the \"York Hotel\" where refreshments were partaken of. The health of the Mayor proposed in very flattering terms by Mr. Frank Craig was warmly received, and suitably responded to. Success to Avon Park was also drunk, after which the company separated.<ref>Eastern Districts Chronicle, 22 August 1891, p.2.</ref>}}\n\nAt the time, the Mayor lived and ran a business from his property immediately above the park at [[Dinsdale\u2019s Shoe Emporium]].

And from that time, it was continuously used for the York Agricultural Fair. <ref>Prior to that, the York Fair was in front of the York Hotel below [[Faversham House]]</ref>  In 1885 the Society procured a 99 year lease from the Government of that land for a peppercorn rent. <ref>Lands and Surveys Dept File: York Crown Lands, PRO. The land is York Town Lots 11 and 12. </ref>\n\nThe land immediately to the north, between what is now Christie Retreat and Macartney Street, was unused, but was one of the few pieces of land that the public could enter along the Avon River. The Society used the land which it leased to display and auction animals, but the whole of the land alongside Bland\u2019s Pool was used as a fair ground. <ref>Clack, AM: A Bathing House on the Avon, Hedley Creek, 1999, pp.5-7. </ref>\n\nIn May, 1890, the Commissioners of the York Agricultural Society requested the York Municipal Council grant them the strip of land between lots 10 and 11, on the undeveloped extension of Mcartney Street between Lowe Street and the river.  This would have meant that the York Agricultural Society would have been in possession of the rotunda and to the Municipality, this was unacceptable.  The Council decided \u201cto take no further interest in the matter\u201d. <ref>York Municipal Council Minutes, 6 June, 1890. </ref>\n\nA month later, the Society demanded that not only the Macartney strip of land but the entire reserve (lots 9 and 10) be \u201chanded over\u201d to the Society for the purpose of extending the show ground. ref>York Municipal Council Minutes, 18 August, 1890. </ref>At that time, the Mayor was Kenneth Edwards, who was also Vice-Chairman of the York Agricultural Society.  Two other Councillors were also members of the Society.\n\nThe York Municipal Council\u2019s response was to declare and establish Avon Park on the land to the north of Macartney Street on 20 August 1891. {{quotation|The ceremony of opening the new public park in this township was performed on Thursday afternoon last by the Mayor (Mr. W. Dinsdale) in the presence of the members of the Municipal Council and a few other citizens. Previous to the ceremony the ground was inspected and properly marked out. This having been done, a hole was dug into which the Mayor placed a small ornamental tree, at the same lime declaring the park open. At the invitation of the Mayor the company then adjourned to the \"York Hotel\" where refreshments were partaken of. The health of the Mayor proposed in very flattering terms by Mr. Frank Craig was warmly received, and suitably responded to. Success to Avon Park was also drunk, after which the company separated. <ref>Eastern Districts Chronicle, 22 August 1891, p.2.</ref>}}\n\nAt the time, the Mayor lived and ran a business from his property immediately above the park at [[Dinsdale\u2019s Shoe Emporium]].
