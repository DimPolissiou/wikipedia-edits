Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton.

Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, [[Newcastle West End F.C.]] formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into [[St James' Park]].<ref name=formation>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/ClubHistory/0,,10278~2108980,00.html\n |title=The Formation of Newcastle United\n |author=P.

Its lease was then bought by [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.<ref name=formation /><ref name=st_james>{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |work=nufc.co.uk |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |accessdate=13 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archivedate=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Mike Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium.<ref name=off_market /><ref name=direct>{{cite news\n| url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8342406.stm\n| title      = Newcastle reveal new stadium name\n|work=BBC Sport\n| date       = 4 November 2009\n| accessdate =4 November 2009\n| location   = London\n}}</ref> This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the [[2009\u201310 Newcastle United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]], but lasted until November 2011.<ref name=direct /><ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Newcastle-owner-Mike-Ashley-has-spent-a-staggering-285-8million-on-the-club-so-far-it-can-be-revealed-today-article718115.html\n| title       = Newcastle 'have cost Ashley \u00a3285.8m so far'\n| first       = Simon\n| last        = Bird\n| date        = 29 March 2011\n| work=Daily Mirror |location=UK\n| accessdate  =13 April 2011\n}}</ref> On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium.

The [[Russian Federation]] has rejected the declaration and considers it illegal.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/15/russia.kosovo Kosovo breakaway illegal, says Putin], ''The Guardian'', 2008-02-15.</ref> In May 2008, Russia, China, and India released a joint statement calling for new negotiations between [[Belgrade]] and [[Pristina]].<ref name=\"Ekaterinburg2\">[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/15/content_8179173.htm Russia, India, China urge resumption of Kosovo talks], Xinhua, 2008-05-15.</ref>\n\nAlthough EU member states individually decide whether to recognise Kosovo, by consensus the EU has commissioned the [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo]] (EULEX) to ensure peace and continued external oversight.

In spite of Russian and Serbian protests, the UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] proceeded with the reconfiguration plan. On 15 July 2008, he stated: \"In the light of the fact that the Security Council is unable to provide guidance, I have instructed my [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Kosovo|Special Representative]] to move forward with the reconfiguration of UNMIK&nbsp;... in order to adapt UNMIK to a changed reality.\" According to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]], the \"United Nations has maintained a position of strict neutrality on the question of Kosovo's status\".<ref>[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N08/412/84/IMG/N0841284.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo], 15 July 2008 (S/2008/458), United Nations, 2008-07-18.</ref> On 26 November 2008, the UNSC gave the green light to the deployment of the EULEX mission in Kosovo.
