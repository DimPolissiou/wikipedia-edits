It was rented out from 1907 to the Sandon Studios Society, an independent art school and art society. The building's future still unsecured, it took the intervention of the architect [[Charles Herbert Reilly]], head of the Liverpool School of Architecture. He convinced the industrialist [[William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme|William Lever]] to rent Bluecoat Chambers in 1909 and subsequently buy it, renaming it Liberty Buildings.<ref>Richmond, 2001, pp. 57 ss.</ref> Sharing the space with the Sandon Society, Reilly moved in with his School of Architecture from 1909 until shortly after [[World War I]].<ref>Richmond, 2001, p. 72.</ref> In 1913-14, Lever entertained the thought of a larger building scheme to transform Liberty Buildings into an art centre but, by 1918, got tired with the idea.<ref>Richmond, 2001, p. 71.</ref> \nLever's death in 1925 again led to proposals for demolition.

It was reopened in March 2008 to coincide with Liverpool's year as [[European Capital of Culture]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe Bluecoat is built in brick with painted stone dressings and a slate roof. H-shaped in plan, originally the rear of the school resembled the front but in 1821 it was remodeled giving it a convex-shaped elevation. The front encloses three sides of a quadrangle and is separated from School Lane by a low wall with railings and gatepiers. The central block of five bays has two storeys with round-arched windows; the central three bays project forwards under a [[pediment]] containing a clock which has only an hour hand. On the roof is an octagonal [[cupola]] with round-arched openings, attached [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns and a copper cap with a [[finial]].  The wings have three storeys; they are eleven bays long and one bay wide.  On the ground and first floor the windows are square-headed while those on the top floor are oval.  The end elevations have arched windows which match the central block.  All the large windows have [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] with [[Putto|cherubs]]' heads.  The main door in the centre of the central block has Ionic columns with a broken pediment containing a [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] of the [[coat of arms|arms]] of Liverpool.  Each wing has three square-headed doors approached by steps.<ref name=pev/><ref name=images/>  The wall, railings and gate [[pier (architecture)|piers]] on School Lane are also listed at Grade&nbsp;I.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1073446|desc= Railings gates and gate piers Old Bluecoat School, Liverpool |access-date= 4 July 2013|mode=cs2 |fewer-links=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe 2005-2008 renovation at a cost of \u00a314 million also included a new 2250 square metre extension, the architects being BIQ Architecten.  The architects found that there were 32 different floor levels in the old building.  They carried out much structural change to produce exhibition areas with better accessibility.  The new extension is built mainly in brick to link with the old building, although it has a copper roof and more modern materials internally.  The new wing houses a flexible performance area and four art galleries.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://www.e-architect.co.uk/liverpool/bluecoat_arts_centre.htm |title= biq complete the Bluecoat, Liverpool |accessdate=2008-10-11 |publisher= e-architect }}</ref>  In addition to performance areas and art galleries, the complex provides studios for artists and craftspeople, a restaurant and a caf\u00e9 and a number of retail outlets.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/content/view/9/26/ |title= What's Available |accessdate=2008-10-12 |publisher= Bluecoat Chambers}}</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions and events==\nOver the years the Bluecoat hosted a range of cultural and arts-associated events.

It was reopened in March 2008 to coincide with Liverpool's year as [[European Capital of Culture]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe Bluecoat is built in brick with painted stone dressings and a slate roof. H-shaped in plan, originally the rear of the school resembled the front but in 1821 it was remodeled giving it a convex-shaped elevation. The front encloses three sides of a quadrangle and is separated from School Lane by a low wall with railings and gatepiers. The central block of five bays has two storeys with round-arched windows; the central three bays project forwards under a [[pediment]] containing a clock which has only an hour hand. On the roof is an octagonal [[cupola]] with round-arched openings, attached [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns and a copper cap with a [[finial]].  The wings have three storeys; they are eleven bays long and one bay wide.  On the ground and first floor the windows are square-headed while those on the top floor are oval.  The end elevations have arched windows which match the central block.  All the large windows have [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] with [[Putto|cherubs]]' heads.  The main door in the centre of the central block has Ionic columns with a broken pediment containing a [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] of the [[coat of arms|arms]] of Liverpool.  Each wing has three square-headed doors approached by steps.<ref name=pev/><ref name=images/>  The wall, railings and gate [[pier (architecture)|piers]] on School Lane are also listed at Grade&nbsp;I.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1073446|desc= Railings gates and gate piers Old Bluecoat School, Liverpool |access-date= 4 July 2013|mode=cs2 |fewer-links=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe 2005-2008 renovation at a cost of \u00a314 million also included a new 2250 square metre extension, the architects being BIQ Architecten.  The architects found that there were 32 different floor levels in the old building.  They carried out much structural change to produce exhibition areas with better accessibility.  The new extension is built mainly in brick to link with the old building, although it has a copper roof and more modern materials internally.  The new wing houses a flexible performance area and four art galleries.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://www.e-architect.co.uk/liverpool/bluecoat_arts_centre.htm |title= biq complete the Bluecoat, Liverpool |accessdate=2008-10-11 |publisher= e-architect }}</ref>  In addition to performance areas and art galleries, the complex provides studios for artists and craftspeople, a restaurant and a caf\u00e9 and a number of retail outlets.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/content/view/9/26/ |title= What's Available |accessdate=2008-10-12 |publisher= Bluecoat Chambers}}</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions and events==\nOver the years the Bluecoat hosted a range of cultural and arts-associated events.

{"title_page": "Thadou people", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\nThe '''Thadous''' (''Thadou / Thado te'') are an ethnic group inhabiting [[Northeast India|North-east India]], [[Chin State|Chin state]] in [[Burma]] and eastern [[Bangladesh]]. [[Thadou dialect|Thadou]] is a dialect of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] family. It is spoken in different parts of [[Manipur]].  It is the second largest dialect after [[Meitei language|Meeteilon (Meitei language)]]. In Manipur, the Thadous are  found in all the  district. They are the second largest in terms of population  in Manipur, next to [[Meitei language|Meetei]] according to Manipur census 2011. Thadous people lives in [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Assam]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]] and different parts of the world. Thadous share a common culture with all the sisters [[Kuki people|Kuki tribes]].\n\n==Religion==\nA great majority of the Thadou people are [[Christians]]. [[Christianity]] among the Thadous can be traced back to an [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] named [[William Pettigrew]] who worked in [[Manipur]] as a missionary from 1894. The 100th anniversary of the Thadou people embracing Christianity was held at [https://motbungbaptistchurch.org Motbung], [[Sadar Hills]], [[Manipur]], [[India]] on 13 December 2008 under the aegis of the [https://thadoubaptistassociation.org Thadou Baptist Association]. Some 10% of the Thadou populace around the world are following [[Judaism]] as they are believed to be descendants of [[Manasseh]], one of the 12 tribes of [[Israel]]. Some 5000 of Thadou people are now settled in [[Israel]].\n\n==History==\nThe Thadou people believed that Chongthu, a great Chief of the Thadous, emerged out from a cave called \"Chhinlung or [[Sinlung|Shinlung]] or Khul\" the location of which was believed to be somewhere in [[Central China]], whereas others claimed it to be in [[Tibet]]. (Ginzatuang 1973:5) Mc. Culloch (1857:55). Those ancestors emerging from the cave include Chongthu/Songthu, Khupngam, Vangalpa and some clansmen, leaving behind Noimangpa, Chongja and others of the group.\n\nWilliam Shaw's (1929) description about the origin of Thadou is recorded from collected oral traditionals. According to the Thadou narrative recorded by Shaw (1929), Noimangpa was the chief of subterranean region. Chongthu, a relative of Noimangpa, while hunting in the jungle with his dog, discovered a large cave. Chongthu, rejoiced at this discovery, gave up his hunting and went back to his village. He conjured up ideas of forming his own village on the earth. Meanwhile, Noimangpa the chief of the underworld was performing the \u2018chon\u2019 festival, in which everyone including chongja, the elder brother of Chongthu, Noimangpa\u2019s son Chonkim participated. During this feast Chongthu started waving his sword so vigorously that he injured some of the people present, at which all were annoyed. This action of Chongthu was premeditated so that he can find an excuse to go to the upper world to form a village of his own. When Noimangpa came to know this he wanted Chongthu dead. Chongthu on hearing Noimangpa\u2019s wrath, prepared to leave for the uninhabited earth, \u2018khul\u2019, as spoken of by the Thadous. So, Chongja and Chongthu along with the cavemen feasted before their departure. On their journey to the upper crust of the earth there was a great darkness, which lasted for seven days and seven nights, called \u201cThimzin\u201d by the Thadous. They found a stone blocking their passage out and after making many attempts Chongja and party gave up and returned to Noimangpa and reported the result\u2019.

The Thadous called it \"Thadou gaal\". The [[Meiteis]] called it \"Khongjai Laal\"(Khongjai war). The [[Zou people|Zous]] called it Zougal . However, in the official records of [[Manipur]] it was known as Kuki Rebellion 1917\u20131919. It commenced from 17 March 1917 and concluded on 20 May 1919.\n\nAs a mark of protest against the [[British Empire|British]] and to stop further recruitment of the Thadous and its cognate tribes in the non-combatant force at the battlefront in [[France]] in the [[First world war|First World War]] as per the appeal received from the [[Secretary of State for India]], [[London]], in his telegram dated 28 January 1917, the Thadous in Manipur openly fought against the British in the month of December 1917. The Chief of Aisan, '''Chengjapao Doungel''', who was the \"Piba\" or head of the Thadou tribe, sent orders to all the leading Thadou chiefs to resist the British with force, if necessary. A very important meeting was held at Jampi Village. The chiefs who attended the meeting were:\n\n#Pu '''Khotinthang Sitlhou''' alias '''Kilkhong''', Chief of Jampi\n#Pu '''Khupkhotintong (Tintong) Haokip'''\n#Pu '''Songchung Sitlhou''', Chief of Sangnao\n#Pu '''Lunkholal Sitlhou''', Chief of Chongjang\n#Pu '''Vumngul Kipgen''', Chief of Tujang\n#Pu '''Lhunjangul Kipgen''', son of Vumngul Kipgen\n#Pu '''Enjakhup Kholhou''', Chief of Thenjang\n#Pu '''Leothang Haokip''', Chief of Goboh\n#Pu '''Mangkho-on Haokip''', Chief of Tingkai\n#Pu '''Heljason Haokip''', Chief of Loibol\n#Pu '''Onpilen Haokip''', Chief of Joupi\n#Pu '''Onpilal Haokip''', Chief of Santing\n#Pu '''Jamkhokhup''', Chief of Boljang\n#Pu '''Nguljahen Haokip''' of Boljang\n\nKhotinthang Sitlhou (Kilkhong), the Chief of Jampi killed one Mithun to entertain the chiefs and \"Sajam\" was distributed to all the chiefs. Thus, a powerful conspiracy of the Thadou chiefs was established. And the '''Singson''' chief cut off the tail of a mithun as a mark of declaration of war against the British government on behalf of his clan. In Manipur, the rebellion spread like wild-fire, particularly in the Kuki inhabited areas \u2013 Jampi, Dulen, Sangnao, Khauchangbung and Laijang in the west; Chasat and Maokot in the east; Mombi and Lonza in the south-east and Henglep and Loikhai/Ukha in the southwest.\n\nAfter many months of aggressive fight between the tenacious Thadou warriors and the mighty British force the Kuki Rebellion finally came to an end on 20 May 1919, with the subjugation of the Thadous by the British Rulers. The colonial authorities recorded the war as 'Kuki Rebellion\". however, the Thadou and its cognate tribes called it Thadou gal. Sir [[Nicholas Beatson-Bell|Nicholar Beatson Bell]], the former [[Chief Commissioner of Assam]], also said that the Anglo-Kuki Rebellion, 1917\u201319 was confined entirely to the Thadous.\n\nTo commemorate the centenary celebration of the Anglo-Thadou War 1917-19 the Anglo-Thadou War (1917-1919), a Centenary Celebration was held on 17 March 2017 \nat Taloulong Village, [[Kangpokpi district|Kangpokpi district.]]{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Modern history===\nThadous<ref> are the single largest tribe in Manipur as per population census 2011.</ref> has been recognised as [[List of Scheduled Tribes in India|Scheduled Tribe in India]] since 1956.

The latter two, sahapsat, jol-lhah', are non-ceremonial betrothal forms akin to [[elopement]]. The first of these forms involves the following elements.\n\n#The negotiation of a bride-price between the parents of the groom and the parents of the bride (however one must note that the concept of 'bride price' mentioned here is very different from the Hindu concept of the '[[Dowry system in India|dowry system]]')\n#The establishment of a date for the departure of the bride from her parents' house to that of her husband\n#The sending (by the groom) of strong young men to bring the bride to her new home; ceremonial feasting and wrestling then followed\n#The triumphant return of the groom's representatives with the bride\n\nThe 'sahapsat' marriage form contains only the marital negotiations between families. The \"jol-lhah\" marriage is resorted to in the case of a pregnancy resulting from premarital relationships. In this case, a bride-price is usually agreed upon before the cohabitation process, which begins  immediately when the pregnancy is discovered.  The \"kijam mang\" is a marital arrangement that results from the union of two parties Without the consent of the parents of either bride, groom, or both by eloping. The bride-price is settled at some point after the union takes place. Post-marital residence is patrilocal . Inheritance is exclusively through the male line, i.e., eldest son. Thadou women are the chief agents of socialisation among the Thadou society. Children are permitted a great degree of independence once they learn to walk. Little structured education is provided by the parents, thereby leaving the Thadou child to learn through experiential means.\n\n==Literature==\nDr. G.C. Crozier along with his wife Mrs M.B.

[[Thadou dialect|Thadou]] is a dialect of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] family. It is spoken in different parts of [[Manipur]].  It is the Second largest dialect after [[Meitei language|Meeteilon (Meitei language)]]. In Manipur, the Thadous are  found in all the  district. They are the second largest in terms of population  in Manipur, next to [[Meitei language|Meetei]] according to Manipur census 2011. Thadous people lives in [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Assam]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]] and different parts of the world. Thadous share a common culture with all the sisters [[Kuki people|Kuki tribes]].\n\n==Religion==\nA great majority of the Thadou people are [[Christians]]. [[Christianity]] among the Thadous can be traced back to an [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] named [[William Pettigrew]] who worked in [[Manipur]] as a missionary from 1894. The 100th anniversary of the Thadou people embracing Christianity was held at [https://motbungbaptistchurch.org Motbung], [[Sadar Hills]], [[Manipur]], [[India]] on 13 December 2008 under the aegis of the [https://thadoubaptistassociation.org Thadou Baptist Association]. Some 10% of the Thadou populace around the world are following [[Judaism]] as they are believed to be descendants of [[Manasseh]], one of the 12 tribes of [[Israel]]. Some 5000 of Thadou people are now settled in [[Israel]].\n\n==History==\nThe Thadou people believed that Chongthu, a great Chief of the Thadous, emerged out from a cave called \"Chhinlung or [[Sinlung|Shinlung]] or Khul\" the location of which was believed to be somewhere in [[Central China]], whereas others claimed it to be in [[Tibet]]. (Ginzatuang 1973:5) Mc. Culloch (1857:55). Those ancestors emerging from the cave include Chongthu/Songthu, Khupngam, Vangalpa and some clansmen, leaving behind Noimangpa, Chongja and others of the group.\n\nWilliam Shaw's (1929) description about the origin of Thadou is recorded from collected oral traditionals. According to the Thadou narrative recorded by Shaw (1929), Noimangpa was the chief of subterranean region. Chongthu, a relative of Noimangpa, while hunting in the jungle with his dog, discovered a large cave. Chongthu, rejoiced at this discovery, gave up his hunting and went back to his village. He conjured up ideas of forming his own village on the earth. Meanwhile, Noimangpa the chief of the underworld was performing the \u2018chon\u2019 festival, in which everyone including chongja, the elder brother of Chongthu, Noimangpa\u2019s son Chonkim participated. During this feast Chongthu started waving his sword so vigorously that he injured some of the people present, at which all were annoyed. This action of Chongthu was premeditated so that he can find an excuse to go to the upper world to form a village of his own. When Noimangpa came to know this he wanted Chongthu dead. Chongthu on hearing Noimangpa\u2019s wrath, prepared to leave for the uninhabited earth, \u2018khul\u2019, as spoken of by the Thadous. So, Chongja and Chongthu along with the cavemen feasted before their departure. On their journey to the upper crust of the earth there was a great darkness, which lasted for seven days and seven nights, called \u201cThimzin\u201d by the Thadous. They found a stone blocking their passage out and after making many attempts Chongja and party gave up and returned to Noimangpa and reported the result\u2019. Pi Nemneh, wife of Songja, cursed Chongthu and party for leaving them at doom in \u2018Khul\u2019. It is also believed that Chongja, Noimangpa and other clansmen who were left behind are assimilated with the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] people.\n[[File:Thadou men.jpg|thumb|right|A group of Thadou men]]\n\n===The Anglo-Thadou war (1917\u201319)===\n[[File:Pu Khotinthang Sitlhou @ Kilkhong.jpg|thumbnail|right|A life size statue of Pu Khotinthang Sitlhou (Chief of Jampi)]]\nThe Anglo-Thadou War (1917\u201319) was one of the important uprisings against the [[British imperialism]] which went on par with the [[Indian independence movement|Indian National Movement for Freedom.]] This movement was known by different names.
