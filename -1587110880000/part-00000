They have no connection with the [[Ranghar]] [[Khokhar]] of [[Moradabad district]] in western [[Uttar Pradesh]], another community of [[Muslim]] [[Khokhar]]s settled in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The [[Khokhar]] are a well known tribe, found mainly in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] region of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]. The Khokhar Khanzada are a sub-community within the larger [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] community of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]].<ref>Fatehpur District : A Gazetteer Volume XX, District Gazetteers of the United Provinces edited by H Neville</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe Khokhar Pathan claim descent from Malik Babur, who said to have come from [[Kapurthala|kabool]] & Iran He was sent to [[Fatehpur district|Fatehpur]] by the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] authorities in [[Delhi]] to suppress the [[Bhar]]s, a tribe that controlled most of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The [[Malik]] successfully defeated the [[Bhar]]s, and the grateful [[Alauddin Khalji]], the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]] granted several villages as a  [[jagir]] (estate) in [[Fatehpur district]], the main one being [[Kot, Fatehpur|Kot, shivpuri, manmai]]. In addition to the settlement at [[Kot, Fatehpur|Kot]], they are also found in the villages of Arhaiya, Urha, Shahnagar, Rahmatpur, Shivpuri, Kulli, Ghazipur and Parvezpur. Other than the [[jagirdar]] families, the majority of the [[Fatehpur district|Fatehpur]] Khokhar are small to medium-sized farmers. With the abolishment of [[zamindar]]i system of feudal ownership by the Indian government in 1949, this has had a strong impact on the large landowning families, as much of their land has been redistributed. A further change has been that many Khokhar Khanzada have also emigrated to [[Pakistan]], and are now found mainly in [[Karachi]].\n\n==Customs and Traditions==\nThey are [[Shia|Shias]] [[Muslim]]s,  and have customs similar to other [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] communities in the region. The community is largely endogamous, although there are cases of intermarriage with the [[Gautam Khanzada]], a neighbouring [[Muslim Rajput]] population. But most marriages are with a close kin, with the community practicing both parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages. The community speak [[Urdu]], as well as the [[Awadhi]] dialect.<ref>Fatehpur District : A Gazetteer Volume XX, District Gazetteers of the United Provinces edited by H Neville</ref>\n\n==Khokhar Ranghar==\nThe town of [[Sambhal]] in [[Moradabad District]] is also home to several families of [[Khokhar]]s, who have said to have emigrated from [[Gujrat District|Gujrat]] in what is now [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Pakistani Punjab]] during the reign of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Babur|Babar]]. As most [[Rajput]] converts to [[Islam]] were in common parlance referred to as [[Ranghar]], these [[Khokhar]]s were also referred to as the Khokhar. The Emperor Babar himself is said to have granted the Khokhars [[jagir]] for the town of the [[Sambhal]]. They played a particularly important role in [[Rohilkhand]] politics during the period of [[Rohilla]] rule. The Khokhar were the effective rulers of the town of [[Sambhal]] and the adjoining countryside until the establishment of [[United Kingdom|British]] rule after the [[Rohilla War]] of 1774. Although the Khokhars lost independent power, they remained one of the larger landowners in the district till 1949, when the newly independent [[India]] carried out substantive land reform, and broke up the large estates. The Khokhars remain a substantial element in the population of [[Sambhal]].<ref>Moradabad District United Provinces District Gazetteers edited by H Neville</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Khokhar]]\n* [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Indian Muslim}}\n{{Muhajir communities}}\n\n[[Category:Khanzada]]\n[[Category:Rajput clans]]\n[[Category:Social groups of Uttar Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities of Uttar Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Muhajir communities]]\n", "name_user": "Kinginsin", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khokhar_Khanzada"}

Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it.

This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}\n\nThe talks were very popular.

He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian<ref>Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up \"G.

(Rep. by [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0499.html ''CERC: Catholic Education Research Center''].)</ref> and [[apologist]], debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name=\"Father Brown on Chesterton,\"/> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845\u20131961'', 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html \"G.K. Chesterton, the Eccentric Prince of Paradox,\"] ''Christianity Today'', 8 January 2001.</ref><ref>Gray, Robert.

Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the [[carpe diem]] religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward, and respect for, each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:\n\n{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will \u2026 If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}\n\n[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K. Chesterton.png|thumb|Title page of the 1909 edition of ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'', first published in the previous year]]\nThis style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' \u2013 that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':\n\n<blockquote>The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless \u2013 one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is \u2013 well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html|title=The Suicide of Thought>|work=dmu.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Blunders of Our Parties| newspaper = Illustrated London News | date = 19 April 1924}}.</ref> He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holroyd |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0701133504 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 214] |url=https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 }}</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary and friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|Edmund Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]].  Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form.  Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.\n\n===Charges of \"anti-Semitism\"===\n\nChesterton faced accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] during his lifetime, saying in chapter 13 of ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'' (1920) that it was something \"for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled\". Despite his prostestations to the contrary, the accusation continues to be repeated.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1455054,00.html | title = Last orders | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 9 April 2005}}.</ref> An early supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus|Captain Dreyfus]], by 1906 he had turned into an [[Dreyfus Affair|anti-dreyfusard]].<ref>Chesterton, Gilbert.

Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a \"tender father of his people\" for \"breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth\". He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Anthony | last = Julius | authorlink = Anthony Julius | title = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010 | page = 422| title-link = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = G.

We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.</blockquote> In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as \"a parable\" and \"a flippant fancy\") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that \"The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\"\n\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.<ref name = \"Pearce2005\">{{cite book | last = Pearce|first= Joseph|authorlink= Joseph Pearce| title= Literary Giants, Literary Catholics | year = 2005 | publisher = Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-58617-077-6|page= 95}}</ref> As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937 : \n<blockquote>When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit.

His own bones are the sacred relics; his own blood is the [[Januarius#Blood|blood of St. Januarius]].\"<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\">{{cite book|pages=85\u201387|title=Chesterton's Jews: Stereotypes and Caricatures in the Literature and Journalism of G.K.

In ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' (1920) he said that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race.\"<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/>\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Man'', while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about [[Blood libel|Jews killing children]] might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote: <blockquote>the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/><ref name=Everlasting>{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|author=G.

Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\"<ref name=Eugenics/> He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point \u2026 we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.\"<ref name=Eugenics>{{cite book|title=Eugenics and Other Evils|author=Gilbert Keith Chesterton|publisher=Cassell and Company, Ltd|location=London, UK|year=1922}}</ref>\n\nHe derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, \"as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one's fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment\".<ref name=Eugenics/>\n\nChesterton also mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: \"[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies \u2026 The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed. They are, in cold fact, what Dickens describes: 'a dustbin of individual accidents,' of damaged dignity, and often of damaged gentility.\"<ref name=Eugenics/>\n\n===\"Chesterbelloc\"===\n{{See also|G.

There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think.

Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Chesterton |first=G.

This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}\n\nThe talks were very popular.

His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name=\"Father Brown on Chesterton,\"/> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845\u20131961'', 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D.

Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the [[carpe diem]] religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward, and respect for, each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:\n\n{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will \u2026 If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}\n\n[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K. Chesterton.png|thumb|Title page of the 1909 edition of ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'', first published in the previous year]]\nThis style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' \u2013 that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':\n\n<blockquote>The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless \u2013 one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is \u2013 well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html|title=The Suicide of Thought>|work=dmu.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Blunders of Our Parties| newspaper = Illustrated London News | date = 19 April 1924}}.</ref> He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holroyd |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0701133504 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 214] |url=https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 }}</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary and friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|Edmund Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]].  Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form.  Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.\n\n===Charges of anti-Semitism===\n\nChesterton faced accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] during his lifetime, saying in chapter 13 of ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'' (1920) that it was something \"for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled\".

Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a \"tender father of his people\" for \"breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth\". He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Anthony | last = Julius | authorlink = Anthony Julius | title = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010 | page = 422| title-link = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = G.

We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.</blockquote> In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as \"a parable\" and \"a flippant fancy\") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that \"The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\"\n\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.<ref name = \"Pearce2005\">{{cite book | last = Pearce|first= Joseph|authorlink= Joseph Pearce| title= Literary Giants, Literary Catholics | year = 2005 | publisher = Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-58617-077-6|page= 95}}</ref> As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937 : \n<blockquote>When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit.

In ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' (1920) he said that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race.\"<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/>\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Man'', while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about [[Blood libel|Jews killing children]] might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote: <blockquote>the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/><ref name=Everlasting>{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|author=G.

Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\"<ref name=Eugenics/> He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs.

It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed.

The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'<ref>Chesterton, G. K. (1929).

The music was composed by the duo [[Sabesh-Murali]] with cinematography by [[M. S. Prabhu]] and editing by [[B. Lenin]]. The film released on 2 December 2005.\n\nThe film won the [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare]]. At 275 minutes, it is the second [[List of longest films in India|longest Indian film]] by runtime.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/india/hindustan-times-bathinda/20130429/page/8/textview |title=Cinema Records |date=29 April 2013 |work=Hindustan Times |access-date=13 September 2019}}</ref><ref>https://m.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/slideshow/10-of-the-longest-films-in-tamil-cinema/thavamai-thavamirundhu.html</ref> The feature was received well at the box office.\n\nThe film is a penetrating and artistic depiction of familial bond, underscored by a set of life value messages. It explores the father-son relationship, and particularly charts the travails an Indian father goes through in raising his sons. The film received positive reviews from critics praising the film's plot, performances, and cinematography but criticized the film's lengthy running time. The movie briefly touches upon other relationships, such as the relationship of married couples and of two brothers. The main story, however, revolves around the important role a father plays in today's society. It sensitively portrays the struggles of a father whose main priority in life is the well-being of his children, and who is determined to see his children grow up to become decent, successful people.\n\nIt also conveys how love and affection can immensely help a family tide over all the highs and lows of life. This movie is really special in the sense that there are many Indian films that touch upon maternity and the central role of a mother in the well-being of a family, but this is one of the few films that focuses on the important role played by the father in a family.\n\nIt is a very touching portrayal of the parental roles \u2014 the father by Rajkiran and the mother by Saranya. Director Cheran has excelled in his role as a confused youth unable to resist the temptations of an adolescent life and later as the head of the family who takes care of his parents, wife, and children. The modern viewer can appreciate the life lessons witnessed in Cheran's ''Thavamai Thavamirundhu''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe movie begins with Muthaiah ([[Rajkiran]]) being admitted into the hospital due to a serious head injury. The incident that led to the injury is kept in suspense for the audience.\n\nThe story is narrated by Muthaiah's second son Ramalingam ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]), when he comes to visit his father in the hospital. Overcome by emotions, he recollects, along his trip, bits and pieces of memories from his younger days with his father.\n\nThe first part of the story is about how Muthaiah, a father in a lower-middle-class family, struggles to raise his children. Muthaiah runs a printing press and works really hard to make ends meet, but he still has to borrow money from the exploitive local moneylenders to give his sons a good education. There is a scene where the children are eagerly expecting their father to return home with gifts during festive season, and the father encounters a setback in the cash flow in his business, and yet seizes an opportunity to make some money by working throughout the night. This scene encapsulates the sacrifices the father makes for the happiness of his sons.\n\nThe story then moves to the teenage years of the children, where they find it hard to resist the temptations of the adolescent stage of life. Ramalingam is a good student and gets admitted to an engineering college, where he gradually falls in love with his classmate Vasanthi ([[Padmapriya]]). Ramalingam finds freedom when he moves from his home to his college residence. When Ramalingam is madly in love with the girl, there is an opportunity for them to have moments of privacy, and they succumb to temptation. This leads to an accidental pregnancy and raises questions about their future. Meanwhile, Ramalingam's brother Ramanathan ([[Senthil Kumar]]) was married and just had a child. Ramanathan has a misunderstanding with his father and walks out of his parent's home. The main cause of friction within the family is the lack of privacy for Ramanathan and his wife ([[Meenal]]) and a lack of freedom for the young couple to run the day-to-day affairs of their family.\n\nAlas, the father expects his sons to help him repay the loans he had to borrow for their education, and they reconcile with each other. During this chaos, Ramalingam is not able find an opportunity to confess his mistake to his parents. As time runs out, Ramalingam and Vasanthi elope to Chennai, unable to reveal the truth about the pregnancy to their respective parents and face a very uncertain future. They decide to get married and search for jobs. Ramalingam is unable to find a well-paying job and takes up a job in a printing press as a stop-gap arrangement. He has to console Vasanthi in a few situations when he himself is facing a lot of trials and tubulations. Ramalingam and Vasanthi are a loving couple in spite of being in a poor financial situation.\n\nVasanthi eventually gives birth to a daughter, but Ramalingam struggles to pay for medical expenses. He calls his former classmate and borrows money from his friend. The friend informs Ramalingam's father about Ramalingam's situation. Muthaiah comes to meet Ramalingam and gives him some cash for the sake of the new born child. He also recalls how he himself faced a cash crunch when Ramalingam was born. Ramalingam and Vasanthi are touched by Muthaiah's gesture and decide to move back to Ramalingam's village to get the support from his family in raising the child. They find acceptance from their parents and are relieved. Slowly, Ramalingam finds a good job and moves up in his career. The family becomes more comfortable, and they move to Madurai. They become very close-knit. Ramalingam is responsible and cares for his parents.\n\nRamalingam facilitates a family reunion with his brother's family, and they reconcile with each other. Meanwhile, Ramalingam's mother Saradha ([[Saranya Ponvannan|Saranya]]) passes away after many years of happy and satisfying family life with Ramalingam's family.

At 275 minutes, it is the second [[List of longest films in India|longest Indian film]] by runtime.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/india/hindustan-times-bathinda/20130429/page/8/textview |title=Cinema Records |date=29 April 2013 |work=Hindustan Times |access-date=13 September 2019}}</ref><ref>https://m.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/slideshow/10-of-the-longest-films-in-tamil-cinema/thavamai-thavamirundhu.html</ref> The feature was received well at the box office.\n\nThe film is a penetrating and artistic depiction of familial bond, underscored by a set of life value messages. It explores the father-son relationship, and particularly charts the travails an Indian father goes through in raising his sons. The film received positive reviews from critics praising the film's plot, performances, and cinematography but criticized the film's lengthy running time. The movie briefly touches upon other relationships, such as the relationship of married couples and of two brothers. The main story, however, revolves around the important role a father plays in today's society. It sensitively portrays the struggles of a father whose main priority in life is the well-being of his children, and who is determined to see his children grow up to become decent, successful people.\n\nIt also conveys how love and affection can immensely help a family tide over all the highs and lows of life. This movie is really special in the sense that there are many Indian films that touch upon maternity and the central role of a mother in the well-being of a family, but this is one of the few films that focuses on the important role played by the father in a family.\n\nIt is a very touching portrayal of the parental roles \u2014 the father by Rajkiran and the mother by Saranya. Director Cheran has excelled in his role as a confused youth unable to resist the temptations of an adolescent life and later as the head of the family who takes care of his parents, wife, and children. The modern viewer can appreciate the life lessons witnessed in Cheran's ''Thavamai Thavamirundhu''.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe movie begins with Muthaiah ([[Rajkiran]]) being admitted into the hospital due to a serious head injury. The incident that led to the injury is kept in suspense for the audience.\n\nThe story is narrated by Muthaiah's second son Ramalingam ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]), when he comes to visit his father in the hospital. Overcome by emotions, he recollects, along his trip, bits and pieces of memories from his younger days with his father.\n\nThe first part of the story is about how Muthaiah, a father in a lower-middle-class family, struggles to raise his children.

During the [[American Revolution]], a group of Rebels, hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the [[Leng (plateau)|plains of Leng]] filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!

During the [[American Revolution]], a group of Rebels, hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the [[Leng (plateau)|plains of Leng]] filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!
