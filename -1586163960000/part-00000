For example, Article 115(11) of the Penal Code ({{lang-pl|Kodeks karny}}) uses the term \"the closest person\", which covers romantic relations that are not legally formalised. The status of \"the closest person\" gives the right of refusal to testify against the partner. The term \"partner\" includes same-sex couples.\n\nA resolution of the Supreme Court from 28 November 2012 (''III CZP 65/12'') on the interpretation of the term \"a person who has lived actually in cohabitation with the tenant\" was issued with regard to the case of a gay man who was the partner of a deceased person, the main tenant of the apartment. The Court interpreted the law in a way that recognised the surviving partner as authorised to take over the right to tenancy. The Court stated that the person actually remaining in cohabitation with the tenant - in the meaning of Article 691 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code - is a person connected with the tenant by a bond of emotional, physical and economic nature. This also includes a person of the same sex.<ref>[https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf/ Formalisation of legal family formats in Poland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619113200/https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf |date=19 June 2018 }}.

For example, Article 115(11) of the Penal Code ({{lang-pl|Kodeks karny}}) uses the term \"the closest person\", which covers romantic relations that are not legally formalised. The status of \"the closest person\" gives the right of refusal to testify against the partner. The term \"partner\" includes same-sex couples.\n\nA resolution of the Supreme Court from 28 November 2012 (''III CZP 65/12'') on the interpretation of the term \"a person who has lived actually in cohabitation with the tenant\" was issued with regard to the case of a gay man who was the partner of a deceased person, the main tenant of the apartment. The Court interpreted the law in a way that recognised the surviving partner as authorised to take over the right to tenancy. The Court stated that the person actually remaining in cohabitation with the tenant - in the meaning of Article 691 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code - is a person connected with the tenant by a bond of emotional, physical and economic nature. This also includes a person of the same sex.<ref>[https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf/ Formalisation of legal family formats in Poland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619113200/https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf |date=19 June 2018 }}.

The Democratic Left Alliance, Modern, [[Labor United]], [[Your Movement]], and [[Spring (political party)|Spring]] are supporters of LGBT rights. More right-wing parties, such as [[Civic Platform|PO]], [[Law and Justice|PiS]] and [[Polish People's Party|PSL]], are generally against any changes in legislation. Out of these, PiS takes the strongest oppositional stance on homosexual issues.\n\n===Law and Justice===\nAfter the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 elections]], the [[Law and Justice]] party (PiS) came to power. They formed a coalition government with the [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR) and the [[Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland|Self-Defence Party]] (Samoobrona).

The mutations at the splice junction of exon 10 of tau lead to the selective deposition of the repetitive tau in neurons and glia.

The presence of tau deposits within glia is also variable in families with mutations outside of exon 10. This disease is now informally designated FTDP-17T.

Many research groups have begun using techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional imaging and cortical thickness measurements in an attempt to offer an earlier diagnosis to the FTD patient. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans classically show frontal and/or anterior temporal hypometabolism, which helps differentiate the disease from Alzheimer's disease.

There are distinct differences in the behavioral and emotional symptoms of the two dementias, notably, the blunting of emotions seen in FTD patients.<ref name=\"Snowden 2002\" /> In the early stages of FTD, anxiety and depression are common, which may result in an ambiguous diagnosis. However, over time, these ambiguities fade away as this dementia progresses and defining symptoms of apathy, unique to FTD, start to appear.\n\nRecent studies over several years have developed new criteria for the diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD).  Six distinct clinical features have been identified as symptoms of bvFTD.<ref name=\"Rascovsky 2011\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rascovsky K, Hodges JR, Knopman D |displayauthors=etal   |title=Sensitivity of revised diagnostic criteria for the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia |journal=Brain |volume=134 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=2456\u201377 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21810890 |pmc=3170532 |doi=10.1093/brain/awr179 |url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-pdf/134/9/2456/17346405/awr179.pdf}}</ref>\n#[[Disinhibition]]\n#[[Apathy]]/Inertia\n#Loss of [[Sympathy]]/[[Empathy]]\n#[[Perseveration|Perseverative]]/[[compulsive behavior]]s\n#Hyperorality\n#[[Dysexecutive syndrome|Dysexecutive neuropsychological profile]]\n\nOf the six features, three must be present in a patient to diagnose one with possible bvFTD.  Similar to standard FTD, the primary diagnosis stems from clinical trials that identify the associated symptoms, instead of imaging studies.<ref name=\"Rascovsky 2011\" /> The above criteria are used to distinguish bvFTD from disorders such as Alzheimer's and other causes of dementia.  In addition, the new criteria allow for a diagnostic hierarchy distinguished possible, probable, and definite bvFTD based on the number of symptoms present.\n\n===Neuropsychological tests===\nThe progression of the degeneration caused by bvFTD may follow a predictable course. The degeneration begins in the orbitofrontal cortex and medial aspects such as ventromedial cortex. In later stages, it gradually expands its area to the dorsolateral cortex and the temporal lobe.<ref name=\"Krueger2009\">{{cite journal |author=Krueger, C.E. |author2=Bird, A.C. |author3=Growdon, M.E. |author4=Jang, J.Y. |author5=Miller, B.L. |author6=Kramer, J.K. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Conflict in monitoring early frontotemporal dementia |journal=Neurology |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=349\u201355 |year=2009 |doi=10.1212/wnl.0b013e3181b04b24|pmid=19652138 |pmc=2725928 }}</ref> Thus, the detection of dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial cortex is important in the detection of early stage bvFTD. As stated above, a behavioural change may occur before the appearance of any atrophy in the brain in the course of the disease. Because of that, image scanning such as MRI can be insensitive to the early degeneration and it is difficult to detect early-stage bvFTD.\n\nIn neuropsychology, there is an increasing interest in using neuropsychological tests such as the [[Iowa gambling task]] or [[Social-Emotional Agnosia#Faux Pas Test|Faux Pas Recognition test]] as an alternative to imaging for the diagnosis of bvFTD.<ref name=\"Torralva2009\">{{cite journal |author=Torralva, T |author2=Roca, M |author3=Gleichgerrcht, E |author4=Bekinschtein, T |author5=Manes, F |last-author-amp=yes|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-pdf/132/5/1299/17862773/awp041.pdf |title=A neuropsychological battery to detect specific executive and social cognitive impairments in early frontotemporal dementia |journal=Brain |volume=132 |issue=5 |pages=1299\u20131309 |year=2009 |doi=10.1093/brain/awp041 |pmid=19336463}}</ref> Both the Iowa gambling task and the Faux Pas test are known to be sensitive to dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex.\n\nFaux Pas Recognition test is intended to measure one\u2019s ability to detect faux pas types of social blunders (accidentally make a statement or an action that offends others).

The impairment in self-monitoring leads to a lack of social emotion signals. The social emotions such as embarrassment are important in the way that they signal the individual to adapt social behaviour in an appropriate manner to maintain relationships with others. Though patients with damage to the OFC retain intact knowledge of social norms, they fail to apply it to actual behaviour because they fail to generate social emotions that promote adaptive social behaviour.<ref name=\"Beer2006\"/>\n\nThe other test, the Iowa gambling task, is a psychological test intended to simulate real-life decision making. The underlying concept of this test is the [[somatic marker hypothesis]]. This hypothesis argues that when people have to make complex uncertain decisions, they employ both cognitive and emotional processes to assess the values of the choices available to them. Each time a person makes a decision, both physiological signals and evoked emotion (somatic marker) are associated with their outcomes and it accumulates as experience. People tend to choose the choice which might produce the outcome reinforced with positive stimuli, thus it biases decision-making towards certain behaviours while avoiding others.<ref name=\"Damasio1996\">{{cite journal |author=Damasio, A.R. |title=The Somatic marker hypothesis and the possible functions of the prefrontal cortex |journal=Phil.

However, as self-monitoring and somatic marker processes are so complex, it likely involves other brain regions. Therefore, neuropsychological tests are sensitive to the dysfunction of orbitofrontal cortex, yet not specific to it. The weakness of these tests is that they do not necessarily show dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, some researchers combined neuropsychological tests which detect the dysfunction of orbitofrontal cortex into one so that it increases its specificity to the degeneration of the frontal lobe in order to detect the early-stage bvFTD. They invented the [[Executive and Social Cognition Battery]] which comprises five neuropsychological tests.\n\n*[[Iowa gambling task]]\n*[[Social-emotional agnosia#Faux Pas test|Faux Pas test]]\n*Hotel task\n*Mind in the Eyes\n*Multiple Errands Task\n\nThe result has shown that this combined test is more sensitive in detecting the deficits in early bvFTD.<ref name=\"Torralva2009\"/>\n\n==Management==\nCurrently, there is no cure for FTD. Treatments are available to manage the behavioral symptoms.  Disinhibition and compulsive behaviors can be controlled by [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs).<ref name=\"Swartz 1997\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Swartz JR, Miller BL, Lesser IM, Darby AL |title=Frontotemporal dementia: treatment response to serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=212\u20136 |date=May 1997 |pmid=9184615 |doi= 10.4088/jcp.v58n0506|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.ucsf.edu/ftd/overview/ftd/treatment/multiple/behavioral|title=Medications for behavioral symptoms|work=ucsf.edu|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> Although Alzheimer's and FTD share certain symptoms, they cannot be treated with the same pharmacological agents because the [[cholinergic]] systems are not affected in FTD.<ref name=\"Snowden 2002\" />\n\nBecause FTD often occurs in younger people (i.e. in their 40s or 50s), it can severely affect families.

However, over time, these ambiguities fade away as this dementia progresses and defining symptoms of apathy, unique to FTD, start to appear.\n\nRecent studies over several years have developed new criteria for the diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD).

In addition, the new criteria allow for a diagnostic hierarchy distinguished possible, probable, and definite bvFTD based on the number of symptoms present.\n\n===Neuropsychological tests===\nThe progression of the degeneration caused by bvFTD may follow a predictable course. The degeneration begins in the orbitofrontal cortex and medial aspects such as ventromedial cortex. In later stages, it gradually expands its area to the dorsolateral cortex and the temporal lobe.<ref name=\"Krueger2009\">{{cite journal |author=Krueger, C.E. |author2=Bird, A.C. |author3=Growdon, M.E. |author4=Jang, J.Y. |author5=Miller, B.L. |author6=Kramer, J.K. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Conflict in monitoring early frontotemporal dementia |journal=Neurology |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=349\u201355 |year=2009 |doi=10.1212/wnl.0b013e3181b04b24|pmid=19652138 |pmc=2725928 }}</ref> Thus, the detection of dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial cortex is important in the detection of early stage bvFTD.

The impairment in self-monitoring leads to a lack of social emotion signals. The social emotions such as embarrassment are important in the way that they signal the individual to adapt social behaviour in an appropriate manner to maintain relationships with others. Though patients with damage to the OFC retain intact knowledge of social norms, they fail to apply it to actual behaviour because they fail to generate social emotions that promote adaptive social behaviour.<ref name=\"Beer2006\"/>\n\nThe other test, the Iowa gambling task, is a psychological test intended to simulate real-life decision making. The underlying concept of this test is the [[somatic marker hypothesis]]. This hypothesis argues that when people have to make complex uncertain decisions, they employ both cognitive and emotional processes to assess the values of the choices available to them. Each time a person makes a decision, both physiological signals and evoked emotion (somatic marker) are associated with their outcomes and it accumulates as experience. People tend to choose the choice which might produce the outcome reinforced with positive stimuli, thus it biases decision-making towards certain behaviours while avoiding others.<ref name=\"Damasio1996\">{{cite journal |author=Damasio, A.R. |title=The Somatic marker hypothesis and the possible functions of the prefrontal cortex |journal=Phil.

However, as self-monitoring and somatic marker processes are so complex, it likely involves other brain regions. Therefore, neuropsychological tests are sensitive to the dysfunction of orbitofrontal cortex, yet not specific to it. The weakness of these tests is that they do not necessarily show dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, some researchers combined neuropsychological tests which detect the dysfunction of orbitofrontal cortex into one so that it increases its specificity to the degeneration of the frontal lobe in order to detect the early-stage bvFTD.
