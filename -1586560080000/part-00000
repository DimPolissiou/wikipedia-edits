In Chicago, the telephones were restricted to police use, but the boxes also contained a dial mechanism which members of the public could use to signal different types of alarms via telegraph: there were 11 signals, including \"[[Police car|Police Wagon]] Required\", \"Thieves\", \"Forgers\", \"Murder\", \"Accident\", \"Fire\" and \"Drunkard\".<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp |4}}\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:Glasgow police box advertisement 1894.png|thumb|An 1894 advertisement for the \"Glasgow Style Police Signal Box System\", sold by the [[National Telephone Company]].]]\nThe first public police telephones in Britain were introduced in Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, [[cast iron|cast-iron]] boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, as well as a mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a master key carried by a policeman.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp |5}} A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />\n\nRectangular, wooden, garden shed style police boxes were introduced in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in 1923 by Chief Constable Frederick J.

As the main functions of the boxes were superseded by the rise of portable telecommunications devices like the [[walkie-talkie]] and the near universal access by the public to telephones and the [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999 emergency number]], very few police boxes remain in Britain today. Some have been converted into [[High Street]] coffee bars. These are common in [[Edinburgh]], though the city also has dozens that remain untouched \u2014 most in various states of disrepair.
