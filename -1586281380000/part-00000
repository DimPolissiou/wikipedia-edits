Most of the words are the most frequently learned, most commonly used English words. Both tools use these words. But many words are chosen for the intended purpose. For example, [[Special English]] uses words a US government news broadcaster might need, such as Congress, federal, administration, capitalism and recession. Specialized replaces some of these words with words used for religious subjects, such as blessing, prayer, miracle, and faith. Further revisions of the Specialized English list were made in 2000 and 2007, in the light of experience. Still, the overlap of the two vocabularies is 91.3%. The Specialized English word list allows greater breadth of meaning in some of the words used in both lists. For example, the word ''joint'':\n\n;Special: \n''joint'' - ad. shared by two or more\n\n;Specialized:\n''joint'' - ad. shared by two or more; n. the place where two parts or things are :fixed together.\n\nSpecialized also allows more prefixes and suffixes, which has allowed some words to be removed from the core list.

They currently play in the [[Southern_Football_League#Premier_South|Southern League Premier South]], at the seventh tier of the [[English football league system]]. They are the highest ranked club from Cornwall.\n\nThe club had previously played in what was known as the [[Conference South]] in 2011, following five promotions in six seasons. They were relegated at the end of the 2012\u201313 season after going into administration, but returned to that level, now known as the [[National League South]], in 2015, before being relegated back to the [[Southern_Football_League#Premier_South|Southern League]] in 2019.\n\nThey were founding members of the [[South Western League]] in 1951 and won the title five times in their history. Apart from a three-season spell in the 1970s, when they played in the [[Cornwall Combination]] after losing their ground as part of a by-pass development, they remained in the South Western League until 2006, when they joined the [[Western Football League]], achieving promotion from Division One to the Premier Division in their first season.\n\nTruro were [[FA Cup]] regulars throughout the 1950s, but subsequently they were sporadic entrants until a permanent return to the competition in the 2006\u201307 season, their first appearance in 13 years, then in 2017 they reached the first round for the first time in their history losing away to Charlton Athletic. They won the [[FA Vase]] in 2006\u201307.\n\n==History==\nIn 1889 Truro City became one of the founding members of the [[Cornwall County Football Association]] (CCFA).  Later in 1889, they played their first game at [[Truro School]] against [[Penzance A.F.C.|Penzance]], winning 7\u20131.  They then switched to Tolgarrick for their future games.  Six years later in 1895, they won their first, the [[Cornwall Senior Cup]], beating [[Launceston F.C.|Launceston]] 5\u20130.\n\nIn the 1930s Truro left Cornish football for a time, joining the Plymouth and District League, which they went on to win in 1936\u201337. However, as a result of this switch, they were barred from competing the Cornwall Senior Cup, although they were re-admitted again in 1938.\n\nThey were founding members of the South Western League in 1951, but stumbled in the initial years, requiring re-election in both of their first two seasons to remain in the league. However, they won the championship five times since, and were only out of the division for three seasons when they lost their ground due to road widening.\n\n===The 2000s===\n====Wembley triumph====\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, they finished runners-up in the South Western League and were promoted to the [[Western Football League|Western League]] Division One, becoming champions at the first attempt.  They also won the 2006\u201307 [[FA Vase]], beating [[AFC Totton]] 3\u20131 in the final, held at the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in front of an FA Vase record crowd of 36,232 fans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/2364461.totton_smash_vase_record_after_fa_admit_blunder/ |title=Totton smash Vase record after FA admit blunder |publisher=Southern Daily Echo |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref> becoming the first Cornish football club to win a national trophy.\n\n====Promotion to the Southern League====\nIn their first season in the [[Western Football League|Western League]] Premier Division, Truro gained promotion to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] at the first attempt, and became the first Cornish side ever to play in the Southern League, only three promotions from the Football League. They were faced with the longest travelling mileage of any club at their level due to the prevalence of [[Wiltshire]]-based clubs in the Western League.\n\nTowards the end of the 2007\u201308 season, after the club's promotion to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] was earned, chairman Kevin Heaney issued a statement reversing an earlier decision to turn the club fully professional for the following season,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.trurocityfc.co.uk/NewsItemViewer.aspx?nid=165 | title=TCFC OFFICIAL STATEMENT | publisher=trurocityfc.co.uk | date=16 April 2008 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> which led to the resignation of boss Dave Leonard.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144125&command=displayContent&sourceNode=232451&contentPK=20413241&folderPk=110118&pNodeId=251468 | title=LEONARD QUITS | publisher=thisiscornwall.co.uk | date=17 April 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> For the remainder of the season, Director of Football Chris Webb took charge, assisted by former boss Dave Newton.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7354243.stm | title= Truro City boss Leonard resigns | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=18 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nHeaney owned a housing company<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk:80/homepagenews/Exclusive-West-Briton-reports-liquidation-Kevin-Heaney-8217-s-development-company/article-401814-detail/article.html | title=Exclusive: West Briton reports on liquidation of Kevin Heaney's development company | publisher=West Briton | date=15 October 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019025808/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/homepagenews/Exclusive-West-Briton-reports-liquidation-Kevin-Heaney-8217-s-development-company/article-401814-detail/article.html | archivedate=19 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and despite a slump in the housing market, the club were able to attract many players on higher wages from higher leagues.

[[Truro]], [[Cornwall]]. They currently play in the [[Southern_Football_League#Premier_South|Southern League Premier South]], at the seventh tier of the [[English football league system]]. They are the highest ranked club from Cornwall.\n\nThe club had previously played in what was known as the [[Conference South]] in 2011, following five promotions in six seasons. They were relegated at the end of the 2012\u201313 season after going into administration, but returned to that level, now known as the [[National League South]], in 2015, before being relegated back to the [[Southern_Football_League#Premier_South|Southern League]] in 2019.\n\nThey were founding members of the [[South Western League]] in 1951 and won the title five times in their history. Apart from a three-season spell in the 1970s, when they played in the [[Cornwall Combination]] after losing their ground as part of a by-pass development, they remained in the South Western League until 2006, when they joined the [[Western Football League]], achieving promotion from Division One to the Premier Division in their first season.\n\nTruro were [[FA Cup]] regulars throughout the 1950s, but subsequently they were sporadic entrants until a permanent return to the competition in the 2006\u201307 season, their first appearance in 13 years, then in 2017 they reached the first round for the first time in their history losing away to Charlton Athletic. They won the [[FA Vase]] in 2006\u201307.\n\n==History==\nIn 1889 Truro City became one of the founding members of the [[Cornwall County Football Association]] (CCFA).  Later in 1889, they played their first game at [[Truro School]] against [[Penzance A.F.C.|Penzance]], winning 7\u20131.  They then switched to Tolgarrick for their future games.  Six years later in 1895, they won their first, the [[Cornwall Senior Cup]], beating [[Launceston F.C.|Launceston]] 5\u20130.\n\nIn the 1930s Truro left Cornish football for a time, joining the Plymouth and District League, which they went on to win in 1936\u201337. However, as a result of this switch, they were barred from competing the Cornwall Senior Cup, although they were re-admitted again in 1938.\n\nThey were founding members of the South Western League in 1951, but stumbled in the initial years, requiring re-election in both of their first two seasons to remain in the league. However, they won the championship five times since, and were only out of the division for three seasons when they lost their ground due to road widening.\n\n===The 2000s===\n====Wembley triumph====\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, they finished runners-up in the South Western League and were promoted to the [[Western Football League|Western League]] Division One, becoming champions at the first attempt.  They also won the 2006\u201307 [[FA Vase]], beating [[AFC Totton]] 3\u20131 in the final, held at the new [[Wembley Stadium]] in front of an FA Vase record crowd of 36,232 fans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/2364461.totton_smash_vase_record_after_fa_admit_blunder/ |title=Totton smash Vase record after FA admit blunder |publisher=Southern Daily Echo |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref> becoming the first Cornish football club to win a national trophy.\n\n====Promotion to the Southern League====\nIn their first season in the [[Western Football League|Western League]] Premier Division, Truro gained promotion to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] at the first attempt, and became the first Cornish side ever to play in the Southern League, only three promotions from the Football League. They were faced with the longest travelling mileage of any club at their level due to the prevalence of [[Wiltshire]]-based clubs in the Western League.\n\nTowards the end of the 2007\u201308 season, after the club's promotion to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] was earned, chairman Kevin Heaney issued a statement reversing an earlier decision to turn the club fully professional for the following season,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.trurocityfc.co.uk/NewsItemViewer.aspx?nid=165 | title=TCFC OFFICIAL STATEMENT | publisher=trurocityfc.co.uk | date=16 April 2008 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> which led to the resignation of boss Dave Leonard.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144125&command=displayContent&sourceNode=232451&contentPK=20413241&folderPk=110118&pNodeId=251468 | title=LEONARD QUITS | publisher=thisiscornwall.co.uk | date=17 April 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> For the remainder of the season, Director of Football Chris Webb took charge, assisted by former boss Dave Newton.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7354243.stm | title= Truro City boss Leonard resigns | publisher=bbc.co.uk | date=18 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nHeaney owned a housing company<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk:80/homepagenews/Exclusive-West-Briton-reports-liquidation-Kevin-Heaney-8217-s-development-company/article-401814-detail/article.html | title=Exclusive: West Briton reports on liquidation of Kevin Heaney's development company | publisher=West Briton | date=15 October 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019025808/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/homepagenews/Exclusive-West-Briton-reports-liquidation-Kevin-Heaney-8217-s-development-company/article-401814-detail/article.html | archivedate=19 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and despite a slump in the housing market, the club were able to attract many players on higher wages from higher leagues.

Newer versions (with different music) were recorded right up through the 19th century. [[Francis James Child]] recorded several versions in his [[Child Ballads]] (catalogued as number 26). A [[Scots language]] ballad called \"'''Twa Corbies'''\" (\"Two Ravens\" or \"Two Crows\") has lyrics based on \"The Three Ravens\" with a similar general story, but with a darker twist. Twa Corbies is sung to a different melody.\n\nThe ballad takes the form of three scavenger birds conversing about where and what they should eat. One tells of a newly slain knight, but they find he is guarded by his loyal hawks and hounds. Furthermore, a \"fallow doe\", an obvious metaphor for the knight's pregnant (\"as great with young as she might go\") lover or mistress (see \"[[wikt:leman|leman]]\") comes to his body, kisses his wounds, bears him away, and buries him, leaving the ravens without a meal. The narrative ends with \"God send euery gentleman / Such haukes, such hounds, and such a Leman\".\n\n==Text of the ballad==\nThe lyrics to \"The Three Ravens\" are here transcribed using 1611 orthography.  They can be sung either straight through in stanzas of four lines each, or in stanzas of two lines each repeating the first line three times depending on how long the performer would like the ballad to last. The second method appears to be the more canonical, so that is what is illustrated below.  The refrains are sung in all stanzas, but they will only be shown for the first.\n\n:There were three rauens<ref>In printed text of the time, ''u'' and ''v'' were often used interchangeably.</ref> sat on a tree,\n:''downe a downe, hay downe, hay downe,''<ref>The refrain consists of nonsense words that create a vocal musical interlude between lines of the stanza.  See [[Puirt a beul]].</ref>\n:There were three rauens sat on a tree,\n:''with a downe,''\n:There were three rauens sat on a tree,\n:They were as blacke as they might be.\n:''With a downe, derrie, derrie, derrie, downe, downe.''\n\n:The one of them said to his mate,\n:Where shall we our breakfast take?\n\n:Downe in yonder greene field,\n:There lies a Knight slain under his shield,\n\n:His hounds they lie downe at his feete,\n:So well they can their Master keepe,\n\n:His Hawkes they flie so eagerly,\n:There's no fowle dare him come nie<ref>''Nie'': Variant of ''nigh''.</ref>\n\n:Downe there comes a fallow Doe,\n:As great with yong as she might goe,\n\n:She lift up his bloudy head,\n:And kist his wounds that were so red,\n\n:She got him up upon her backe,\n:And carried him to earthen lake,<ref>''Lake'': Pit.</ref>\n\n:She buried him before the prime,<ref>''Prime'', ''Euen-song'': see [[Canonical hours]].</ref>\n:She was dead her self ere euen-song time.\n\n:God send euery gentleman,\n:Such haukes, such hounds, and such a Leman.<ref>''Leman'': Sweetheart or mistress</ref>\n\n==The Twa Corbies==\nWritten heavily in the [[Scots language]], \"The Twa Corbies\" probably dates from the 18th century and was first published in Walter Scott's ''Minstrelsy'' in 1812. Child (I, 253) quotes a letter from  Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe to Walter Scott (August 8, 1802): \"The song of 'The Twa Corbies' was given to me by Miss Erskine of Alva (now Mrs Kerr), who, I think, said that she had written it down from the recitation of an old woman at Alva.\".<ref>See Malcolm Douglas's post in the [https://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=9564&messages=47#1238100 mudcat.org] thread on the subject, which gives more detailed references.</ref>\n\nIt has a more dark and cynical tone than the Three Ravens, from which its lyrics were clearly derived.  There are only two scavengers in \u201cThe Twa Corbies\u201d, but this is the least of the differences between the songs, though they do begin the same. Rather than commenting on the loyalty of the knight's beasts, the corbies tell that the hawk and the hound have forsaken their master, and are off chasing other game, while his mistress has already taken another lover. The ravens are therefore given an undisturbed meal, as nobody else knows where the man lies, or even that he is dead. They talk in gruesome detail about the meal they will make of him, plucking out his eyes and using his hair for their nests. Some themes believed to be portrayed in \"Twa Corbies\" are: the fragility of life, the idea life goes on after death, and a more pessimistic viewpoint on life. The loneliness and despair of the song are summed up in the final couplets;\n\n:O'er his banes [bones], when they are bare,\n:The wind sall [shall] blaw for evermair\n\nThere are a few different versions of this anonymously authored poem. The full text of at least one version of the poem is as follows:\n\n:As I was walking all alane,<ref>alone</ref>\n:I heard twa<ref>two</ref> corbies<ref>[[carrion crow]]s</ref> making a mane;<ref>moan</ref>\n:The tane<ref>one</ref> unto the t'other say,\n:\u2018Where sall we gang and dine to-day?\u2019\n\n:\u2018In behint yon auld fail<ref>turf</ref> dyke,\n:I wot<ref>know</ref> there lies a new slain knight;\n:And naebody kens<ref>knows</ref> that he lies there,\n:But his hawk, his hound, and lady fair.\n\n:\u2018His hound is to the hunting gane,<ref name=\"gone\">gone</ref>\n:His hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame,<ref>home</ref>\n:His lady's taen<ref>taken</ref> another mate,\n:So we may mak our dinner sweet.\n\n:\u2018Ye'll sit on his white hause-bane,<ref>breast bone</ref>\n:And I'll pike<ref>peck</ref> out his bonny blue een;<ref>eyes</ref>\n:Wi ae lock o his gowden<ref>with a lock of his golden</ref> hair\n:We'll theek<ref>feather</ref> our nest when it grows bare.\n\n:\u2018Mony<ref>many</ref> a one for him makes mane,<ref>a moan</ref>\n:But nane sall ken<ref>none shall know</ref> where he is gane;<ref name=\"gone\"/>\n:Oer<ref>over</ref> his white banes,<ref>bones</ref> when they are bare,\n:The wind sall blaw<ref>shall blow</ref> for evermair.<ref>evermore</ref>\u2019\n\nThis ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in ''Ballads Weird and Wonderful'' (1912) and illustrated by [[Vernon Hill (sculptor)|Vernon Hill]].\n\n==Recordings==\n\n\"The Three Ravens\" or \"Twa Corbies\" have been performed and recorded by artists such as [[Heather Alexander]], [[Annwn (band)|Annwn]], A Chorus of Two, [[Ronn McFarlane|Ayreheart]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M77zcwXJXcI&list=PLwYbinufcqp082veA2_J3l_uj13SKR7gu&index=6 Damh the Bard], [[Bishnu Priya|Bishi]], [[Boiled in Lead]], [[Scott Boswell]], [[:fr:Djazia Satour|Djazia Satour]], [[C\u00e9cile Corbel]], Clam Chowder, [[Corries|The Corries]], Crooked Mouth, [[Alfred Deller]], The Duplets, [[Frances Faye]], [[Richard Dyer-Bennet]], [[Fiddler's Dram]], Ray & Archie Fisher, John Fleagle and [[Ewan MacColl]], [[John Harle]], The Hare and The Moon, [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[Joel Cohen (musician)|Joel Cohen]], [[Kalin Sivov]], Andrew King, Mandala Folk, Marie Little, [[Malinky]], [[Old Blind Dogs]], [[Omnia (band)|Omnia]], [[Kate Price (musician)|Kate Price]], [[Schelmish]], [[Sol Invictus (band)|Sol Invictus]], [[Sonne Hagal]], [[Sequester (band)|Sequester]], [[Steeleye Span]], [[Andreas Scholl]], [[Hamish Imlach]], [[Libera (choir)]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Ariella Uliano]], [[Diana Obscura]], Terre di mezzo, [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]], [[Custer LaRue]] and [[The Baltimore Consort]], Merry Wives of Windsor, Sportive Tricks, The Creepy Bard, [[The Sands Family]], Alice Moving Under Skies, Astral Weeks, [[Winterfylleth (band)|Winterfylleth]] and [[Faun (band)|Faun]]. The album [[Farewell Aldebaran]] contains a song clearly based on Three Ravens but the lyric credits go to [[Judy Henske]], music by Jerry Yester.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The popular American rock band [[The Horrible Crowes]] takes its name from \"Twa Corbies\".\n*The song is featured in [[The Adventure Company|The Adventure Company's]] game [[Jack the Ripper (video game)|Jack the Ripper]] and plays a major role in the gameplay.\n*The song is mentioned in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s novel [[The Fiery Cross (novel)|The Fiery Cross]], when Roger MacKenzie encounters some crows in the woods.\n*The song appears in the 1922 fantasy novel ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'', by [[Eric R\u00fccker Eddison]], sung by the Lady Mevrian in mourning for her lost brother. The novel was one of the favourites of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]].\n*[[Dorothy L.

Newer versions (with different music) were recorded right up through the 19th century. [[Francis James Child]] recorded several versions in his [[Child Ballads]] (catalogued as number 26). A [[Scots language]] ballad called \"'''Twa Corbies'''\" (\"Two Ravens\" or \"Two Crows\") has lyrics based on \"The Three Ravens\" with a similar general story, but with a darker twist. Twa Corbies is sung to a different melody.\n\nThe ballad takes the form of three scavenger birds conversing about where and what they should eat. One tells of a newly slain knight, but they find he is guarded by his loyal hawks and hounds. Furthermore, a \"fallow doe\", an obvious metaphor for the knight's pregnant (\"as great with young as she might go\") lover or mistress (see \"[[wikt:leman|leman]]\") comes to his body, kisses his wounds, bears him away, and buries him, leaving the ravens without a meal. The narrative ends with \"God send euery gentleman / Such haukes, such hounds, and such a Leman\".\n\n==Text of the ballad==\nThe lyrics to \"The Three Ravens\" are here transcribed using 1611 orthography.  They can be sung either straight through in stanzas of four lines each, or in stanzas of two lines each repeating the first line three times depending on how long the performer would like the ballad to last. The second method appears to be the more canonical, so that is what is illustrated below.  The refrains are sung in all stanzas, but they will only be shown for the first.\n\n:There were three rauens<ref>In printed text of the time, ''u'' and ''v'' were often used interchangeably.</ref> sat on a tree,\n:''downe a downe, hay downe, hay downe,''<ref>The refrain consists of nonsense words that create a vocal musical interlude between lines of the stanza.  See [[Puirt a beul]].</ref>\n:There were three rauens sat on a tree,\n:''with a downe,''\n:There were three rauens sat on a tree,\n:They were as blacke as they might be.\n:''With a downe, derrie, derrie, derrie, downe, downe.''\n\n:The one of them said to his mate,\n:Where shall we our breakfast take?\n\n:Downe in yonder greene field,\n:There lies a Knight slain under his shield,\n\n:His hounds they lie downe at his feete,\n:So well they can their Master keepe,\n\n:His Hawkes they flie so eagerly,\n:There's no fowle dare him come nie<ref>''Nie'': Variant of ''nigh''.</ref>\n\n:Downe there comes a fallow Doe,\n:As great with yong as she might goe,\n\n:She lift up his bloudy head,\n:And kist his wounds that were so red,\n\n:She got him up upon her backe,\n:And carried him to earthen lake,<ref>''Lake'': Pit.</ref>\n\n:She buried him before the prime,<ref>''Prime'', ''Euen-song'': see [[Canonical hours]].</ref>\n:She was dead her self ere euen-song time.\n\n:God send euery gentleman,\n:Such haukes, such hounds, and such a Leman.<ref>''Leman'': Sweetheart or mistress</ref>\n\n==The Twa Corbies==\nWritten heavily in the [[Scots language]], \"The Twa Corbies\" probably dates from the 18th century and was first published in Walter Scott's ''Minstrelsy'' in 1812. Child (I, 253) quotes a letter from  Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe to Walter Scott (August 8, 1802): \"The song of 'The Twa Corbies' was given to me by Miss Erskine of Alva (now Mrs Kerr), who, I think, said that she had written it down from the recitation of an old woman at Alva.\".<ref>See Malcolm Douglas's post in the [https://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=9564&messages=47#1238100 mudcat.org] thread on the subject, which gives more detailed references.</ref>\n\nIt has a more dark and cynical tone than the Three Ravens, from which its lyrics were clearly derived.  There are only two scavengers in \u201cThe Twa Corbies\u201d, but this is the least of the differences between the songs, though they do begin the same. Rather than commenting on the loyalty of the knight's beasts, the corbies tell that the hawk and the hound have forsaken their master, and are off chasing other game, while his mistress has already taken another lover. The ravens are therefore given an undisturbed meal, as nobody else knows where the man lies, or even that he is dead. They talk in gruesome detail about the meal they will make of him, plucking out his eyes and using his hair for their nests. Some themes believed to be portrayed in \"Twa Corbies\" are: the fragility of life, the idea life goes on after death, and a more pessimistic viewpoint on life. The loneliness and despair of the song are summed up in the final couplets;\n\n:O'er his banes [bones], when they are bare,\n:The wind sall [shall] blaw for evermair\n\nThere are a few different versions of this anonymously authored poem. The full text of at least one version of the poem is as follows:\n\n:As I was walking all alane,<ref>alone</ref>\n:I heard twa<ref>two</ref> corbies<ref>[[carrion crow]]s</ref> making a mane;<ref>moan</ref>\n:The tane<ref>one</ref> unto the t'other say,\n:\u2018Where sall we gang and dine to-day?\u2019\n\n:\u2018In behint yon auld fail<ref>turf</ref> dyke,\n:I wot<ref>know</ref> there lies a new slain knight;\n:And naebody kens<ref>knows</ref> that he lies there,\n:But his hawk, his hound, and lady fair.\n\n:\u2018His hound is to the hunting gane,<ref name=\"gone\">gone</ref>\n:His hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame,<ref>home</ref>\n:His lady's taen<ref>taken</ref> another mate,\n:So we may mak our dinner sweet.\n\n:\u2018Ye'll sit on his white hause-bane,<ref>breast bone</ref>\n:And I'll pike<ref>peck</ref> out his bonny blue een;<ref>eyes</ref>\n:Wi ae lock o his gowden<ref>with a lock of his golden</ref> hair\n:We'll theek<ref>feather</ref> our nest when it grows bare.\n\n:\u2018Mony<ref>many</ref> a one for him makes mane,<ref>a moan</ref>\n:But nane sall ken<ref>none shall know</ref> where he is gane;<ref name=\"gone\"/>\n:Oer<ref>over</ref> his white banes,<ref>bones</ref> when they are bare,\n:The wind sall blaw<ref>shall blow</ref> for evermair.<ref>evermore</ref>\u2019\n\nThis ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in ''Ballads Weird and Wonderful'' (1912) and illustrated by [[Vernon Hill (sculptor)|Vernon Hill]].\n\n==Recordings==\n\n\"The Three Ravens\" or \"Twa Corbies\" have been performed and recorded by artists such as [[Heather Alexander]], [[Annwn (band)|Annwn]], A Chorus of Two, [[Ronn McFarlane|Ayreheart]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M77zcwXJXcI&list=PLwYbinufcqp082veA2_J3l_uj13SKR7gu&index=6 Damh the Bard], [[Bishnu Priya|Bishi]], [[Boiled in Lead]], [[Scott Boswell]], [[:fr:Djazia Satour|Djazia Satour]], [[C\u00e9cile Corbel]], Clam Chowder, [[Corries|The Corries]], Crooked Mouth, [[Alfred Deller]], The Duplets, [[Frances Faye]], [[Richard Dyer-Bennet]], [[Fiddler's Dram]], Ray & Archie Fisher, John Fleagle and [[Ewan MacColl]], [[John Harle]], The Hare and The Moon, [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[Joel Cohen (musician)|Joel Cohen]], [[Kalin Sivov]], Andrew King, Mandala Folk, Marie Little, [[Malinky]], [[Old Blind Dogs]], [[Omnia (band)|Omnia]], [[Kate Price (musician)|Kate Price]], [[Schelmish]], [[Sol Invictus (band)|Sol Invictus]], [[Sonne Hagal]], [[Sequester (band)|Sequester]], [[Steeleye Span]], [[Andreas Scholl]], [[Hamish Imlach]], [[Libera (choir)]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Ariella Uliano]], [[Diana Obscura]], Terre di mezzo, [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]], [[Custer LaRue]] and [[The Baltimore Consort]], Merry Wives of Windsor, Sportive Tricks, The Creepy Bard, [[The Sands Family]], Alice Moving Under Skies, Astral Weeks, [[Winterfylleth (band)|Winterfylleth]] and [[Faun (band)|Faun]].

PAOK had to relocate and a 7.5 acres area, owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]] at [[Toumba (Thessaloniki)|Toumba district]] was chosen as the adequate location. The purchase cost was set at 1.5 million [[drachmas]] and was paid by PAOK administration in 20 six-month instalments of 75,000 drachmas each. On 7 February 1958, a committee of [[NRDC-GR|III Army Corps]] officers delivered the land to PAOK representatives.\n\nThere were still barracks on the premises, housing victims of the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]]. Relocating all these people cost the club 70,000 drachmas. The total cost of the stadium's construction amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1.1&nbsp;million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention. In spring of 1958 construction work started, based on the plans of architect Minas Trempelas and civil engineer Antonis Triglianos. In an attempt to collect the necessary funds, the club issued the \"Lottery for the construction of PAOK New Stadium\" in April 1958 at a cost of 20 drachmas each. Since 1956, the administration was withholding 15% of the gate income in order to fund the construction of the new stadium. Many PAOK fans, apart from money, also contributed to construction by volunteering to work as builders. The construction of the stadium was completed at a record time of one year.\n\nThe inauguration event was scheduled for Sunday 6 September 1959 with a friendly encounter against [[AEK FC]] (PAOK prevailed 1\u20130 with a goal by Kostas Kiourtzis). Prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]'s attendance was cancelled at the last minute. However, several ministers of his government were there for the occasion. As for the ball for the first kick-off, it fell at 17:30 off an airplane of Sedes Military Air Base.

It would increase to 20,000 seats in the following months until it reached a 45,000-seat capacity in the mid-'70s through extensive expansion work.\n\nThe attendance record remains at 45,252 tickets and was registered on 19 December 1976 in the goalless draw against [[AEK Athens FC|AEK]].

PAOK had to relocate and a 7.5 acres area, owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]] at [[Toumba (Thessaloniki)|Toumba district]] was chosen as the adequate location. The purchase cost was set at 1.5 million [[drachmas]] and was paid by PAOK administration in 20 six-month instalments of 75,000 drachmas each. On 7 February 1958, a committee of [[NRDC-GR|III Army Corps]] officers delivered the land to PAOK representatives.\n\nThere were still barracks on the premises, housing victims of the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]]. Relocating all these people cost the club 70,000 drachmas. The total cost of the stadium's construction amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1.1&nbsp;million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention. In spring of 1958 construction work started, based on the plans of architect Minas Trempelas and civil engineer Antonis Triglianos. In an attempt to collect the necessary funds, the club issued the \"Lottery for the construction of PAOK New Stadium\" in April 1958 at a cost of 20 drachmas each. Since 1956, the administration was withholding 15% of the gate income in order to fund the construction of the new stadium. Many PAOK fans, apart from money, also contributed to construction by volunteering to work as builders. The construction of the stadium was completed at a record time of one year.\n\nThe inauguration event was scheduled for Sunday 6 September 1959 with a friendly encounter against [[AEK FC]] (PAOK prevailed 1\u20130 with a goal by Kostas Kiourtzis). Prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]'s attendance was cancelled at the last minute. However, several ministers of his government were there for the occasion.

The SNS is responsible for the [[fight-or-flight response]], which is triggered by experiences such as [[exercise]] or [[fear]]-causing situations. This response [[Mydriasis|dilates pupils]], increases heart rate, mobilizes energy, and diverts blood flow from non-essential organs to [[skeletal muscle]]. These effects together tend to increase physical performance momentarily.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of catecholamine research}}{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width1 = 150\n| image1 = Adrenalin - Adrenaline.svg\n| caption1 = [[Epinephrine]]\n| image2 = Noradrenalin - Noradrenaline.svg\n| width2 = 130\n| caption2 = [[Norepinephrine]]\n}}\nBy the turn of the 19th century, it was agreed that the stimulation of sympathetic nerves could cause different effects on body tissues, depending on the conditions of stimulation (such as the presence or absence of some toxin). Over the first half of the 20th century, two main proposals were made to explain this phenomenon:\n\n# There were (at least) two different types of neurotransmitters released from sympathetic nerve terminals, or\n# There were (at least) two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter.\n\nThe first hypothesis was championed by [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cannon WB, Rosenbluth A | date= 31 May 1933| title = Studies On Conditions Of Activity In Endocrine Organs XXVI: Sympathin E and Sympathin I | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume= 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 557\u2013574 | doi= 10.1152/ajplegacy.1933.104.3.557}}</ref> who interpreted many experiments to then propose that there were two neurotransmitter substances, which they called sympathin E (for 'excitation') and sympathin I (for 'inhibition').\n\nThe second hypothesis found support from 1906 to 1913, when [[Henry Hallett Dale]] explored the effects of adrenaline (which he called adrenine at the time), injected into animals, on blood pressure.  Usually, adrenaline would increase the blood pressure of these animals. Although, if the animal had been exposed to [[ergot]]oxine, the blood pressure decreased.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On some physiological actions of ergot | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 163\u2013206 | date = May 1906 | pmid = 16992821 | doi =  10.1113/jphysiol.1906.sp001148 | pmc=1465771}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On the action of ergotoxine; with special reference to the existence of sympathetic vasodilators | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 291\u2013300 | date = Jun 1913 | pmid = 16993202 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1913.sp001592 | pmc=1420444}}</ref> He proposed that the ergotoxine caused \"selective paralysis of motor myoneural junctions\" (i.e. those tending to increase the blood pressure) hence revealing that under normal conditions that there was a \"mixed response\", including a mechanism that would relax smooth muscle and cause a fall in blood pressure. This \"mixed response\", with the same compound causing either contraction or relaxation, was conceived of as the response of different types of junctions to the same compound.\n\nThis line of experiments were developed by several groups, including DT Marsh and colleagues,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh DT, Pelletier MH, Rose CA | title = The comparative pharmacology of the N-alkyl-arterenols | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 108\u201320 | date = Feb 1948 | pmid = 18903395 }}</ref> who in February 1948 showed that a series of compounds structurally related to adrenaline could also show either contracting or relaxing effects, depending on whether or not other toxins were present. This again supported the argument that the muscles had two different mechanisms by which they could respond to the same compound. In June of that year, [[Raymond Ahlquist]], Professor of Pharmacology at Medical College of Georgia, published a paper concerning adrenergic nervous transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahlquist RP | title = A study of the adrenotropic receptors | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 586\u2013600 | date = Jun 1948 | pmid = 18882199 | doi =  10.1152/ajplegacy.1948.153.3.586| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24c73eb8823d260c3c8d19467e62fc81215b384d }}</ref> In it, he explicitly named the different responses as due to what he called \u03b1 receptors and \u03b2 receptors, and that the only sympathetic transmitter was adrenaline. While the latter conclusion was subsequently shown to be incorrect (it is now known to be noradrenaline), his receptor nomenclature and concept of ''two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter'', remains.  In 1954, he was able to incorporate his findings in a textbook, ''Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Drill|first=Victor Alexander|name-list-format=vanc|date=1954|title=Pharmacology in medicine: a collaborative textbook|url=https://archive.org/details/pharmacologyinme00dril|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=|isbn=}}</ref> and thereby promulgate the  role played by \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor sites in the adrenaline/noradrenaline cellular mechanism. These concepts would revolutionise advances in pharmacotherapeutic research, allowing the selective design of specific molecules to target medical ailments rather than rely upon traditional research into the efficacy of pre-existing herbal medicines.\n\n==Categories==\n[[Image:Adrenoceptor-Signal transduktion.PNG|thumb|400px|The mechanism of adrenoreceptors. Adrenaline or noradrenaline are [[receptor ligands]] to either [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] or \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] couples to [[Gq alpha subunit|G<sub>q</sub>]], which results in increased intracellular [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and subsequent [[smooth muscle]] contraction. [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]], on the other hand, couples to [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>]], which causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release, as well as a decrease of [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity resulting in smooth muscle contraction. \u03b2 receptors couple to [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]], and increases intracellular [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity, resulting in e.g. [[heart muscle]] contraction, smooth muscle relaxation and [[glycogenolysis]].|alt=]]\nThere are two main groups of adrenoreceptors, \u03b1 and \u03b2, with 9 subtypes in total:\n* \u03b1 are divided to [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] (a [[G protein|G<sub>q</sub>]] coupled receptor) and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] (a G<sub>i</sub> coupled receptor)<ref name=\":1\" />\n**\u03b1<sub>1</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>1B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1D</sub>{{efn|name=d}}\n**\u03b1<sub>2</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>2A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>2B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>2C</sub>\n* \u03b2 are divided to [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>3</sub>]]. All 3 are coupled to [[Gs protein|G<sub>s</sub> proteins]], but \u03b2<sub>2</sub> and \u03b2<sub>3</sub> also couple to G<sub>i</sub><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nG<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> are linked to [[adenylyl cyclase]]. [[Agonist]] binding thus causes a rise in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger(Gi inhibits the production of cAMP)  [[cyclic AMP|cAMP]]. Downstream effectors of cAMP include [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]] (PKA), which mediates some of the intracellular events following hormone binding.\n\n===Roles in circulation===\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) reacts with both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors, causing vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Although \u03b1 receptors are less sensitive to epinephrine, when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the vasodilation mediated by \u03b2-adrenoreceptors because there are more peripheral \u03b1<sub>1</sub> receptors than \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating epinephrine cause vasoconstriction. However, the opposite is true in the coronary arteries, where \u03b2<sub>2</sub> response is greater than that of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, resulting in overall dilation with increased sympathetic stimulation. At lower levels of circulating epinephrine (physiologic epinephrine secretion), \u03b2-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since epinephrine has a higher affinity for the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor than the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> adrenoreceptor, producing vasodilation followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Subtypes===\nSmooth muscle behavior is variable depending on anatomical location. Smooth muscle contraction/relaxation is generalized below.  One important note is the differential effects of increased cAMP in smooth muscle compared to cardiac muscle.  Increased cAMP will promote relaxation in smooth muscle, while promoting increased contractility and pulse rate in cardiac muscle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" |

The SNS is responsible for the [[fight-or-flight response]], which is triggered by experiences such as [[exercise]] or [[fear]]-causing situations. This response [[Mydriasis|dilates pupils]], increases heart rate, mobilizes energy, and diverts blood flow from non-essential organs to [[skeletal muscle]].

Over the first half of the 20th century, two main proposals were made to explain this phenomenon:\n\n# There were (at least) two different types of neurotransmitters released from sympathetic nerve terminals, or\n# There were (at least) two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter.\n\nThe first hypothesis was championed by [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cannon WB, Rosenbluth A | date= 31 May 1933| title = Studies On Conditions Of Activity In Endocrine Organs XXVI: Sympathin E and Sympathin I | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume= 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 557\u2013574 | doi= 10.1152/ajplegacy.1933.104.3.557}}</ref> who interpreted many experiments to then propose that there were two neurotransmitter substances, which they called sympathin E (for 'excitation') and sympathin I (for 'inhibition').\n\nThe second hypothesis found support from 1906 to 1913, when [[Henry Hallett Dale]] explored the effects of adrenaline (which he called adrenine at the time), injected into animals, on blood pressure.  Usually, adrenaline would increase the blood pressure of these animals. Although, if the animal had been exposed to [[ergot]]oxine, the blood pressure decreased.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On some physiological actions of ergot | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 163\u2013206 | date = May 1906 | pmid = 16992821 | doi =  10.1113/jphysiol.1906.sp001148 | pmc=1465771}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On the action of ergotoxine; with special reference to the existence of sympathetic vasodilators | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 291\u2013300 | date = Jun 1913 | pmid = 16993202 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1913.sp001592 | pmc=1420444}}</ref> He proposed that the ergotoxine caused \"selective paralysis of motor myoneural junctions\" (i.e. those tending to increase the blood pressure) hence revealing that under normal conditions that there was a \"mixed response\", including a mechanism that would relax smooth muscle and cause a fall in blood pressure. This \"mixed response\", with the same compound causing either contraction or relaxation, was conceived of as the response of different types of junctions to the same compound.\n\nThis line of experiments were developed by several groups, including DT Marsh and colleagues,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh DT, Pelletier MH, Rose CA | title = The comparative pharmacology of the N-alkyl-arterenols | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 108\u201320 | date = Feb 1948 | pmid = 18903395 }}</ref> who in February 1948 showed that a series of compounds structurally related to adrenaline could also show either contracting or relaxing effects, depending on whether or not other toxins were present. This again supported the argument that the muscles had two different mechanisms by which they could respond to the same compound. In June of that year, [[Raymond Ahlquist]], Professor of Pharmacology at Medical College of Georgia, published a paper concerning adrenergic nervous transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahlquist RP | title = A study of the adrenotropic receptors | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 586\u2013600 | date = Jun 1948 | pmid = 18882199 | doi =  10.1152/ajplegacy.1948.153.3.586| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24c73eb8823d260c3c8d19467e62fc81215b384d }}</ref> In it, he explicitly named the different responses as due to what he called \u03b1 receptors and \u03b2 receptors, and that the only sympathetic transmitter was adrenaline. While the latter conclusion was subsequently shown to be incorrect (it is now known to be noradrenaline), his receptor nomenclature and concept of ''two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter'', remains.  In 1954, he was able to incorporate his findings in a textbook, ''Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Drill|first=Victor Alexander|name-list-format=vanc|date=1954|title=Pharmacology in medicine: a collaborative textbook|url=https://archive.org/details/pharmacologyinme00dril|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=|isbn=}}</ref> and thereby promulgate the  role played by \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor sites in the adrenaline/noradrenaline cellular mechanism. These concepts would revolutionise advances in pharmacotherapeutic research, allowing the selective design of specific molecules to target medical ailments rather than rely upon traditional research into the efficacy of pre-existing herbal medicines.\n\n==Categories==\n[[Image:Adrenoceptor-Signal transduktion.PNG|thumb|400px|The mechanism of adrenoreceptors. Adrenaline or noradrenaline are [[receptor ligands]] to either [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] or \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] couples to [[Gq alpha subunit|G<sub>q</sub>]], which results in increased intracellular [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and subsequent [[smooth muscle]] contraction. [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]], on the other hand, couples to [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>]], which causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release, as well as a decrease of [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity resulting in smooth muscle contraction. \u03b2 receptors couple to [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]], and increases intracellular [[cyclic amp|cAMP]] activity, resulting in e.g. [[heart muscle]] contraction, smooth muscle relaxation and [[glycogenolysis]].|alt=]]\nThere are two main groups of adrenoreceptors, \u03b1 and \u03b2, with 9 subtypes in total:\n* \u03b1 are divided to [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>]] (a [[G protein|G<sub>q</sub>]] coupled receptor) and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b1<sub>2</sub>]] (a G<sub>i</sub> coupled receptor)<ref name=\":1\" />\n**\u03b1<sub>1</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>1A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>1B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1D</sub>{{efn|name=d}}\n**\u03b1<sub>2</sub> has 3 subtypes: \u03b1<sub>2A</sub>, \u03b1<sub>2B</sub> and \u03b1<sub>2C</sub>\n* \u03b2 are divided to [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|\u03b2<sub>3</sub>]].

[[Agonist]] binding thus causes a rise in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger(Gi inhibits the production of cAMP)  [[cyclic AMP|cAMP]]. Downstream effectors of cAMP include [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]] (PKA), which mediates some of the intracellular events following hormone binding.\n\n===Roles in circulation===\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) reacts with both \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors, causing vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Although \u03b1 receptors are less sensitive to epinephrine, when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the vasodilation mediated by \u03b2-adrenoreceptors because there are more peripheral \u03b1<sub>1</sub> receptors than \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating epinephrine cause vasoconstriction. However, the opposite is true in the coronary arteries, where \u03b2<sub>2</sub> response is greater than that of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, resulting in overall dilation with increased sympathetic stimulation. At lower levels of circulating epinephrine (physiologic epinephrine secretion), \u03b2-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since epinephrine has a higher affinity for the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor than the \u03b1<sub>1</sub> adrenoreceptor, producing vasodilation followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Subtypes===\nSmooth muscle behavior is variable depending on anatomical location. Smooth muscle contraction/relaxation is generalized below.  One important note is the differential effects of increased cAMP in smooth muscle compared to cardiac muscle.  Increased cAMP will promote relaxation in smooth muscle, while promoting increased contractility and pulse rate in cardiac muscle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" |
