Associated Press. Oakland Tribune. June 7, 2011. The Surfing Madonna \u2013 more correctly known as the \"Save the Ocean Mosaic\" is now re-installed on the wall of Cafe Ipe at the corner of Jasper Street and Pacific Coast Highway in Leucadia, CA 92024</ref>\n\n===Museums and other points of interest===\n[[File:Boathouses, Encinitas.JPG|thumb|Built in the late 1920s, [http://www.encinitashistoricalsociety.org/the-boathouses/ the boathouses] are historic landmarks in Encinitas]]\nThe [http://www.luxartinstitute.com/ Lux Art Institute], [[San Dieguito Heritage Museum]], and [https://encinitashistoricalsociety.org/ Encinitas Historical Society] are located in Encinitas. Other points of interest include the [[San Diego Botanic Garden]], [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] temple and Hermitage, as well as the gardens which are routinely open to the public, the historic [[La Paloma Theater]], Moonlight Beach, and one of California's classic downtown areas along historic Coast Highway 101. Surfing is a popular activity in Encinitas, particularly at [[Swami's (surfing)|Swami's]], which is rated in the top 5 surf locations in the world, and is mentioned in a verse of [[The Beach Boys]]' song \"[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]\" A bronze statue \"Humanity\" was installed at J Street Overview in 2018. Sculptress is Maidy Morhous. Donors are Sue & Jay Vicory.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Manchester Reserve is great for nature walk and light hiking.\n\n=== Cardiff Kook - Magic Carpet Ride ===\n{{Main|Cardiff Kook}}\n\nThe Magic Carpet Ride, or more affectionately known by Encinitas locals as the [[Cardiff Kook]], is a 16&nbsp;ft bronze statue located in [[Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Encinitas, California|Cardiff-by-the-Sea]], in the city of Encinitas. The San Diego Architectural Foundation, in its annual \"Orchids & Onions\" awards for the best and worst architecture of the year, awarded the Kook an Onion in 2007. The nickname comes from a derogatory surfer slang term for a \"wannabe\" surfer, as surfers in the area realized that the statue's form whilst \"surfing\" was far from correct. However, the Kook has become a local favorite in the city and has many wonderful traditions associated with it. At various times during the year, the Kook is \"vandalized\" and dressed up (wearing a lucha libre mask, being eaten by a paper-mache shark, wearing a full Uncle Sam costume for Independence Day, used by local high school students to ask each other to school dances) bringing local flair and tourists constantly to the statue.\n\n==Economy==\nSince 1982, the Encinitas 101 Main Street Association has helped keep downtown Encinitas economically viable yet historic & beachy.

The San Diego Architectural Foundation, in its annual \"Orchids & Onions\" awards for the best and worst architecture of the year, awarded the Kook an Onion in 2007. The nickname comes from a derogatory surfer slang term for a \"wannabe\" surfer, as surfers in the area realized that the statue's form whilst \"surfing\" was far from correct. However, the Kook has become a local favorite in the city and has many wonderful traditions associated with it. At various times during the year, the Kook is \"vandalized\" and dressed up (wearing a lucha libre mask, being eaten by a paper-mache shark, wearing a full Uncle Sam costume for Independence Day, used by local high school students to ask each other to school dances) bringing local flair and tourists constantly to the statue.\n\n==Economy==\nSince 1982, the Encinitas 101 Main Street Association has helped keep downtown Encinitas economically viable yet historic & beachy.
