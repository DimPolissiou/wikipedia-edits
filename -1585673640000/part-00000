The beam is directed towards the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector located  295 km away in [[Hida, Gifu|Hida]]-city [[Gifu prefecture|Gifu]]. The properties and composition of the neutrino flux are first measured by a system of near detectors located 280 m from the beam production place at the J-PARC site, and then again in the Super-Kamiokande detector. Comparison of the content of different neutrino flavours in these two locations allows measurement of the oscillations probability on the way between near and far detectors. Super-Kamiokande is able to detect interactions of both, muon and electron neutrinos, and thus measure the disappearance of muon neutrino flux, as well as electron neutrino appearance in the

Focusing Section.jpg|thumb|Final stage of the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469}}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the Time Projection Chambres in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is plastic scintillator. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic [[scintillator]] bars and planes is collected by wavelength-shifting fibres and detected by Hamamatsu Multi-pixel photon counters installed/located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambres, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8 cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref>{{cite journal |author=S.

TPCs are filled with argon-based drift gas under atmospheric pressure. Charged particles crossing TPC ionise the gas along their track. The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time. In the magnetic field, the curvature of this path allows to determine [[electric charge|charge]] and [[momentum]] of the particle, and the amount of the ionisation electrons per unit distance is used to identify particles based on the [[Bethe formula|Bethe-Bloch formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=T2K ND280 TPC collaboration |title=Time projection chambers for the T2K near detectors |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=May 2011 |volume=637 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201346 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2011.02.036|arxiv=1012.0865}}</ref>\n\n====Fine-grained detectors====\n\nTwo fine-grained detectors (FGDs) are placed after the first and second TPCs. Together the FGDs and TPCs make up the tracker of ND280. The FGDs provide the active target mass for the neutrino interactions and are able to measure the short tracks of proton recoil. The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water. The second FGD is partially composed of water because the detector at Super-Kamiokande is water-based. Cross sections on carbon and on the water can be determined from a comparison of neutrino interactions in the two FGDs.\n\n====Electromagnetic Calorimeter====\n\nThe Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the inner detectors (P0D, TPCs, FGDs) and consists of scintillator layers sandwiched with lead absorber sheets. Its role is to detect neutral particles, especially photons, and measure their energy and direction, as well as to detect charged particles providing additional information relevant for their identification.\n\n====Side Muon Range Detector====\n\nThe Side Muon Range Detector (SMRD) consists of scintillator modules which are inserted into the gaps in the magnet. The SMRD records muons escaping the inner parts of the detector at large angles with respect to the beam direction. It can also act as a trigger for [[cosmic rays]]. Finally, it can help identify beam interactions in the surrounding walls and in the magnet itself.\n\n==Super-Kamiokande==\n{{main|Super-Kamiokande}}\n\nSuper-Kamiokande detector is located 1000 m underground in the Mozumi Mine, under Mount Ikeno in the Kamoka area of Hida city. It is a [[stainless steel]] [[cylinder|cylindrical]] tank of about 40 m height and diameter, filled with 50,000 tons of [[water]] and instrumented with around 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes (PMT). It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal\n |author=Yuichi Oyama\n |year=2006\n |title=Results from K2K and status of T2K\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5ByTrijMjAC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=%22Results+from+K2K+and+status+of+T2K%22#v=onepage&q=%22Results%20from%20K2K%20and%20status%20of%20T2K%22&f=false\n |journal=[[Nuclear Science and Safety in Europe]]\n |volume=2006 |issue= |pages=113\u2013124\n |isbn=978-1-4020-4964-4\n |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4965-1_9\n |arxiv=hep-ex/0512041 \n|series=NATO Security through Science Series\n }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=September 2012}}\n\n'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

The beam is directed towards the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector located  295 km away in [[Hida, Gifu|Hida]]-city [[Gifu prefecture|Gifu]]. The properties and composition of the neutrino flux are first measured by a system of near detectors located 280 m from the beam production place at the J-PARC site, and then again in the Super-Kamiokande detector. Comparison of the content of different neutrino flavours in these two locations allows measurement of the oscillations probability on the way between near and far detectors. Super-Kamiokande is able to detect interactions of both, muon and electron neutrinos, and thus measure the disappearance of muon neutrino flux, as well as electron neutrino appearance in the

3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam.

By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref>{{cite journal |author=S.

TPCs are filled with argon-based drift gas under atmospheric pressure. Charged particles crossing TPC ionise the gas along their track. The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time. In the magnetic field, the curvature of this path allows to determine [[electric charge|charge]] and [[momentum]] of the particle, and the amount of the ionisation electrons per unit distance is used to identify particles based on the [[Bethe formula|Bethe-Bloch formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=T2K ND280 TPC collaboration |title=Time projection chambers for the T2K near detectors |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=May 2011 |volume=637 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201346 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2011.02.036|arxiv=1012.0865}}</ref>\n\n====Fine-grained detectors====\n\nTwo fine-grained detectors (FGDs) are placed after the first and second TPCs. Together the FGDs and TPCs make up the tracker of ND280. The FGDs provide the active target mass for the neutrino interactions and are able to measure the short tracks of proton recoil. The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water. The second FGD is partially composed of water because the detector at Super-Kamiokande is water-based. Cross sections on carbon and on the water can be determined from a comparison of neutrino interactions in the two FGDs.\n\n====Electromagnetic Calorimeter====\n\nThe Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the inner detectors (P0D, TPCs, FGDs) and consists of scintillator layers sandwiched with lead absorber sheets. Its role is to detect neutral particles, especially photons, and measure their energy and direction, as well as to detect charged particles providing additional information relevant for their identification.\n\n====Side Muon Range Detector====\n\nThe Side Muon Range Detector (SMRD) consists of scintillator modules which are inserted into the gaps in the magnet. The SMRD records muons escaping the inner parts of the detector at large angles with respect to the beam direction. It can also act as a trigger for [[cosmic rays]]. Finally, it can help identify beam interactions in the surrounding walls and in the magnet itself.\n\n==Super-Kamiokande==\n{{main|Super-Kamiokande}}\n\nSuper-Kamiokande detector is located 1000 m underground in the Mozumi Mine, under Mount Ikeno in the Kamoka area of Hida city. It is a [[stainless steel]] [[cylinder|cylindrical]] tank of about 40 m height and diameter, filled with 50,000 tons of [[water]] and instrumented with around 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes (PMT). It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal\n |author=Yuichi Oyama\n |year=2006\n |title=Results from K2K and status of T2K\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5ByTrijMjAC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=%22Results+from+K2K+and+status+of+T2K%22#v=onepage&q=%22Results%20from%20K2K%20and%20status%20of%20T2K%22&f=false\n |journal=[[Nuclear Science and Safety in Europe]]\n |volume=2006 |issue= |pages=113\u2013124\n |isbn=978-1-4020-4964-4\n |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4965-1_9\n |arxiv=hep-ex/0512041 \n|series=NATO Security through Science Series\n }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Batmann", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePhysics program:wiki link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque.

The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks.

To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Due to ethnic migration, [[Ilocano people]] have settled in some areas of the province.\n\nPangasinan is the name for the province, the people, and the language spoken in the province. Indigenous Pangasinan speakers are estimated to number at least 2 million. The Pangasinan language, which is official in the province, is one of the officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines. In Pangasinan, there were several ethnic groups who enriched the cultural fabric of the province. Almost all of the people are Pangasinans and the rest are descendants of Bolinao and Ilocano, who settled the eastern and western parts of the province.<ref>[https://psa.gov.ph/content/pangasinan-most-populated-province-philippines-results-2000-census-population-and-housing]</ref> Pangasinan is spoken as a second-language by many of the ethnic minorities in Pangasinan. The secondary ethnic groups are the [[Sambal people|Bolinaos]] (who are essentially [[Sambal people]]) and the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]].\n\nThe name ''Pangasinan'' (pronounced \"Pang-ASINan\") means \"place of salt\" or \"place of salt-making\"; it is derived from the prefix ''pang'', meaning \"for\", the root word ''asin'', meaning \"salt\u201d, and suffix ''an'', signifying \"location\". At present it is pronounced \"Pa\u014bgasinan\" based on the Spanish pronunciation. The province is a major producer of salt in the Philippines. Its major products include [[bagoong]] (\"salted-[[krill]]\") and alamang (\"shrimp-paste\").\n\nPangasinan was first founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' by at least 2500 BC. A kingdom called ''Luyag na [[Caboloan]]'', which expanded to incorporate much of northwestern Luzon, existed in Pangasinan before the Spanish conquest that began in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\">{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific|date=10 June 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598846607|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&pg=PT305&lpg=PT305&dq=luyag+na+Kaboloan#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref> The Kingdom of ''Luyag na Kaboloan'' was known as the [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] in Chinese records. The ancient Pangasinan people were skilled navigators and the [[Shipping|maritime]] [[trade]] network that once flourished in ancient [[Luzon]] connected Pangasinan with other peoples of [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and the rest of the [[Pacific]]. The ancient kingdom of Luyag na Caboloan was in fact mentioned in Chinese and Indian records as being an important kingdom on ancient trade routes.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\"/>\n\nPopular tourist attractions in Pangasinan include the [[Hundred Islands National Park]] in [[Alaminos City]] and the white-sand beaches of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]]. [[Dagupan City]] is known for its Bangus Festival (\"Milkfish Festival\"). Pangasinan is also known for its delicious mangoes and ceramic oven-baked [[Calasiao, Pangasinan|Calasiao]] ''puto'' (\"native rice cake\"). Pangasinan occupies a [[strategic]] [[geo-political]] position in the central plain of Luzon. Pangasinan has been described as a gateway to northern Luzon.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe Pangasinan people, like most of the people in the [[Malay Archipelago]], are descendants of the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] who settled in Southeast Asia since prehistoric times. Comparative genetics, linguistics and archaeological studies locate the origin of the [[Austronesian languages]] in [[Sundaland]], which was populated as early as 50,000 years ago by modern humans.<ref>[http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/080523.html New DNA evidence overturns population migration theory in Island Southeast Asia \u2013 University of Oxford<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028020123/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/080523.html |date=2011-10-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/uol-nrf052308.php New research forces U-turn in population migration theory<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Farming and language in Island Southeast Asia: Reframing Austronesian history|author1=Mark Donohue |author2=Tim Denham |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=51 |issue=2 |date=2010|pages=223\u2013256|doi=10.1086/650991}}</ref> The Pangasinan language is one of many languages that belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages]] family.\n\n===Southeast Asian maritime trade network===\nA vast maritime trade network connected the distant [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] settlements in [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The Pangasinan people were part of this ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] civilization.\n\nThe ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] were expert navigators. Their outrigger canoes and sailboats were capable of crossing the distant seas. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] sailed from the Malay archipelago to [[Madagascar]], an island across the Indian Ocean, and probably reached Africa. As the possible predecessors of the [[Polynesians]], large seagoing canoes called \"bangka\" (\"[[vaka (sailing)|vaka]]\" in several Polynesian dialects and \"[[waka (canoe)|waka]]\" in Maori) were first developed by Austronesians in the Philippine archipelago which were then used to settle and establish long-distance trade networks with distant Pacific islands from the [[Micronesia]]n island nations of [[Guam]] and [[Palau]] as far away as [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]] and probably reached the Pacific coastline of the Americas. Proof of these trade exchanges are the prevalence of \"kumara\" or [[sweet potato]] in the Pacific Islands which is endemic to South America, and the abundance of chicken bones in ancient South American archaeological dig sites whose closest genetic relatives are those of chickens from Asia. At least three hundred years before the arrival of Europeans, the [[Makasar]] and the [[Bugis]] from [[Sulawesi]], in what is now [[Indonesia]], as well as the [[Sama-Bajau]]s of the Malay Archipelago, carried out long-distance commerce with their ''prau'' or ''paraw'' (\"sailboat\") and established settlements in north [[Australia]], which they called ''Marege''.<ref>[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011346 PLoS ONE: The History of Makassan Trepang Fishing and Trade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nPangasinan was founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' during the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion from Taiwan and Southern China in about 5000\u20132500 BC or the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] dispersal from [[Sundaland]] at least 7,000 years ago after the last Ice Age. ''Anakbanwa'' means \u201cchild of ''banwa.''\u201d ''Banwa'' (also spelled ''banua'' or ''vanua'') is an Austronesian concept that could mean territory, homeland, habitat, society, civilization or cosmos. The Pangasinan people identified or associated ''banwa'' with the sun, which was their symbol for their ''banwa''. The Pangasinan people are closely related to the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] in the neighboring province of [[Benguet]] and other peoples of [[Luzon]]. The ''Anakbanwa'' established their settlements in the banks of the [[Agno River]] and the coasts of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. The coastal area came to be known as ''Pangasinan'', and the interior area came to be known as ''Kaboloan''. Eventually, the whole region, its people and the used language came to be known as Pangasinan. Archaeological evidence and early [[Chinese history|Chinese]] and [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] records show that the inhabitants of Pangasinan traded with [[India]], [[Arabia]], [[China]] and [[Japan]] as early as the 8th century A.D.\n\n===''Wangdom'' of Pangasinan (''Luyag na Caboloan'')===\nThe [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] (as known in Chinese records) and locally known as the ancient kingdom or state called ''Luyag na Caboloan'' (also spelled ''Kaboloan''), with ''Binalatongan'' as its capital, existed in the fertile [[Agno River]] valley. Around the same period, the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] empires arose in [[Indonesia]] that extended their influence to much of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. [[Urduja]]/Udaya, a legendary woman warrior who [[Ibn Battuta]] called a rival of the Mongol Empire, is believed to have ruled in Pangasinan around the 14th century. The ''Luyag na Caboloan'' expanded the territory and influence of Pangasinan to what are now the neighboring provinces of [[Tarlac]], [[La Union]], [[Zambales]], [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Benguet]]. Pangasinan enjoyed full [[independence]] until the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest.\n\n===''Anito'' and ''mana'' beliefs and practices===\nThe ancient Pangasinan people, like other [[Austronesian peoples]], practiced ''[[anito]]'' worship. An ''anito'' was believed to be the spirit or divine power of an ancestor or the god or divine power in nature or natural phenomena. They believed in [[mana]], an Austronesian concept which can be described as the divine power or vital or spiritual essence of every being and everything that exists. To the Pangasinan people, ''mana'' can be transferred, inherited or acquired, like from an ancestor, nature, or natural phenomena. Their belief or practice is similar to [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] or [[animism|animist]] beliefs and rituals. They worshipped a pantheon of ''[[anito]]'' (\"spirit\" or \"deity\"). Their [[dambana|temples or altars]] were dedicated to a chief ''anito'' called Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\">https://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca-3/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/northern-cultural-communities/the-lowland-cultural-community-of-pangasinan/</ref> (\u201cSupreme Father\u201d), who communicated through mediums or priests called ''[[babaylan|manag-anito]]''. These ''manag-anito'' wore special costumes when serving an ''anito'' and they made offerings of oils, ointments, essences, and perfumes in exquisite vessels. In contrast, the [[Sambal people]] of the west also revered their own pantheon of deities, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\">https://www.aswangproject.com/sambal-mythology-pantheon-of-deities-and-beings/</ref>\n\n===Spanish accounts of pre-Hispanic Pangasinan===\nIn the sixteenth-century Pangasinan was called the \"Port of Japan\" by the Spanish. The locals wore native apparel typical of other maritime Southeast Asian ethnic groups in addition to Japanese and Chinese silks. Even common people were clad in Chinese and Japanese cotton garments. They blackened their teeth and were disgusted by the white teeth of foreigners, which were likened to that of animals. They used porcelain jars typical of Japanese and Chinese households. Japanese-style gunpowder weapons were encountered in naval battles in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=187}}</ref> In exchange for these goods, traders from all over Asia would come to trade primarily for gold and slaves, but also for deerskins, civet and other local products. Other than a notably more extensive trade network with Japan and China, they were culturally similar to other Luzon groups to the south.\n\nPangasinans were also described as a warlike people who were long known for their resistance to Spanish conquest. Bishop Domingo Salazar described them as really the worst people, the fiercest and cruelest in the land. There was evidence of Christian influence even before Spanish colonization; they used vintage wine in small quantities for their sacramental practices. The church bragged that they won the northern part of the Philippines for Spain not Spanish military. They were unusually strict against adulterers, with the punishment being death for both parties. Pangasinans were known to take defeated [[Zambales#History|Zambal]] ([[Aeta]]) and [[Negrito]] warriors to sell as slaves to Chinese traders.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=248\u2013249}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nIn 1324, [[Odoric of Pordenone]], a Franciscan missionary from [[Friuli]], Italy, is believed by some to have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], which is generally regarded as the [[first mass in the Philippines]], by some 197 years. However, historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is no reason to think that he celebrated mass.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=William Henry |title=Prehispanic source materials for the study of Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSlwAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=New Day Publishers|isbn=978-971-10-0226-8|pages=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nOn April 27, 1565, the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] arrived in the Philippine islands with about 500 soldiers to establish a Spanish settlement and begin the conquest of the archipelago. On May 24, 1570, the Spanish forces defeated [[Rajah Sulayman]] and other rulers of Manila and later declared [[Manila]] as the new capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]]. After securing Manila, the Spanish forces continued to conquer the rest of the island of Luzon, including Pangasinan.\n\n====Provincia de Pangasinan====\nIn 1571, the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan began with an expedition by the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Mart\u00edn de Goiti]], who came from the Spanish settlement in [[Manila]] through [[Pampanga]]. About a year later, another Spanish conquistador, [[Juan de Salcedo]], sailed to [[Lingayen Gulf]] and landed at the mouth of the [[Agno River]]. [[Limahong]], a Chinese pirate, fled to Pangasinan after his fleet was driven away from Manila in 1574. Limahong failed to establish a colony in Pangasinan, as an army led by Juan de Salcedo chased him out of Pangasinan after a seven-month siege.\n\nThe province of Pangasinan dates its actual beginnings as an administrative and judicial district, with Lingayen as the capital, to as early as 1580, but its territorial boundaries were first delineated in 1611. Lingayen has remained the capital of the province except for a brief period during the revolutionary Era when San Carlos served as temporary administrative headquarters, and during the slightly longer Japanese Occupation when Dagupan was the capital.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\">{{cite web|title=History of Pangasinan|url=http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905174851/http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|archive-date=5 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe province of Pangasinan was formerly classified as an alcaldia mayor de termino, or first class civil province, during the Spanish regime and has, in fact, remained a first class-A province up to the present. Its territorial jurisdiction once included the entire province of Zambales and portions of what are now Tarlac and La Union provinces.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\"/>\n\n====Rebellion against the Spanish rule====\n\n====Malong liberation====\nAndres Malong, a native chief of the town of Binalatongan (now named San Carlos City), liberated the province from Spanish rule in December 1660. The people of Pangasinan proclaimed Andres Malong ''Ari na Pangasinan'' (\"King of Pangasinan\"). Pangasinan armies attempted to liberate the neighboring provinces of Pampanga and Ilocos, but were repelled by a Spanish-led coalition of loyalist tribal warriors and mercenaries. In February 1661, the newly independent Kingdom of Pangasinan fell to the Spanish.\n\n====Palaris liberation====\nOn November 3, 1762, the people of Pangasinan proclaimed independence from Spain after a rebellion led by [[Juan de la Cruz Palaris]] overthrew Spanish rule in Pangasinan. The Pangasinan revolt was sparked by news of the fall of Manila to the British on October 6, 1762. However, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] on March 1, 1763 that closed the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain, France and Spain, the Spanish colonial forces made a counter-attack. On January 16, 1765, Juan de la Cruz Palaris was captured and Pangasinan independence was again lost.\n\n===Philippine revolution against Spain===\n{{Main|Philippine Revolution Against Spain}}\n\nThe [[Katipunan]], a nationalist secret society, was founded on July 7, 1892 with the aim of uniting the peoples of the Philippines and fighting for independence and religious freedom. The [[Philippine Revolution]] began on August 26, 1896 and was led by [[Andres Bonifacio]], the leader of the Katipunan. On November 18, 1897, a Katipunan council was formed in western Pangasinan with Roman Manalang as Presidente Generalisimo and Mauro Ortiz as General. General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. [[Dagupan City]], the major commercial center of Pangasinan, was surrounded by Katipunan forces by July 18, 1898. The Battle of Dagupan lasted from July 18 to July 23 of that year with the surrender of 1,500 soldiers of the Spanish forces under Commander Federico J. Ceballos and Governor Joaquin de Orengochea.\n\n[[File:Andres Urdaneta monumentua, Urdaneta City, Philippines.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Andres Urdaneta monument, in front of the City Hall.]]\n\nThe Battle of Dagupan, fought fiercely by local Katipuneros under the overall command of General Francisco Makabulos, chief of the Central and Directive Committee of Central and Northern Luzon, and the last remnants of the once mighty Spanish Army under General Francisco Ceballos, led to the liberation of Pangasinan from the Spaniards. The five-day battle was joined by three local heroes: Don Daniel Maramba from Santa Barbara, Don Vicente Prado from San Jacinto and Don Juan Quezada from Dagupan. Their armies massed in Dagupan to lay siege on the Spanish forces, making a last stand at the brick-walled Catholic Church.\n\n[[File:Maramba67jf.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Grave of Don Daniel B. Maramba ([[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan|Santa Barbara]])]]\n[[File:Maramba33jf.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Daniel B. Maramba Monument and 1970 NHI Marker]]\n\nMaramba led the liberation of the town of Santa Barbara on March 7, 1898 following a signal for simultaneous attack from Makabulos. Hearing that Santa Barbara fell into rebel hands, the Spanish forces in Dagupan attempted to retake the town, but were repulsed by Maramba's forces. Thus, after the setback, the Spaniards decided to concentrate their forces in Lingayen to protect the provincial capital. This enabled Maramba to expand his operations to Malasiqui, Urdaneta and Mapandan, taking them one after the other. He took one more town, Mangaldan, before proceeding to Dagupan to lay siege on the last Spanish garrison. Also on March 7, 1898, the rebels under the command of Prado and Quesada attacked convents in a number of towns in Zambales province, located west of Lingayen, which now constitute the western parts of Pangasinan.\n\nAttacked and brought under Filipino control were Alaminos, Agno, Anda, Alos, Bani, Balincaguin, Bolinao, Dasol, Eguia and Potot. The revolt then spread to Labrador, Sual, Salasa and many other towns in the west. The towns of Sual, Labrador, Lingayen, Salasa and Bayambang were occupied first by the forces of Prado and Quesada before they proceeded to attack Dagupan.\n\nAt an assembly convened to organize a central governing body for Central and Northern Luzon on April 17, 1898, General Makabulos appointed Prado as politico-military governor of Pangasinan, with Quesada as his second in command. His appointment came a few days before the return of General Emilio Aguinaldo in May 1898 from his exile in Hong Kong following the signing of the Pact of Biac-na-Bato in December 1897. Aguinaldo's return gave fresh impetus to the renewal of the flame of the revolution. Thus, on June 3, 1898, General Makabulos entered Tarlac and from that day on, the fires of revolution spread.\n\nSo successful were the Filipinos in their many pitched battles against the Spaniards that on June 30, 1898, Spanish authorities decided to evacuate all their forces to Dagupan where a last stand against the rebels was to be made. They were ordered to go to Dagupan were all civilian and military personnel, including members of the volunteer locales of towns not yet in rebel hands. Those who heeded this order were the volunteer forces of Mangaldan, San Jacinto, Pozorrubio, Manaoag, and Villasis. Among the items brought to Dagupan was the image of the Most Holy Rosary of the Virgin of Manaoag, which was already the patron saint of Pangasinan.\n\nWhen the forces of Maramba from the east and Prado from the west converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898, the siege began. The arrival of General Makabulos strengthened the rebel forces until the Spaniards, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later. Armed poorly, the Filipinos were no match at the very start with Spanish soldiers holed inside the Church. They just became mere sitting ducks to Spanish soldiers shooting with their rifles from a distance. But the tempo of battle changed when the attackers, under Don Vicente Prado, devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing. This happened when they rolled trunks of bananas, bundled up in sawali, that enabled them to inch their way to the Church.\n\n===Northern Zambales ceded to Pangasinan===\n\nOn November 30, 1903, several municipalities of northern Zambales, namely, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini, were ceded to Pangasinan by the American colonial government in a bid for [[gerrymandering]]. These municipalities were traditional homelands of the [[Sambal people]], who wanted to remain part of [[Zambales]] province, their ethnic province. This 1903 colonial decision has yet to be reverted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bautista|first1=Joseph|title=Agno Rustic Pangasinan 0|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/agno-rustic-pangasinan/371628/|website=The Manila Times|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American colonization and the Philippine Commonwealth regime===\nPangasinan and other parts of the [[Spanish East Indies]] were ceded to the Americans after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] that closed the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. During the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Lieutenant Col. [[Jose Torres Bugallon]] from the town of Salasa fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna to defend the [[First Philippine Republic]] against American colonization of Northern Luzon. Bugallon was killed in battle on February 5, 1899. The First Philippine Republic was abolished in 1901. In 1907, the Philippine Assembly was established and for the first time, five residents of Pangasinan were elected as its district representatives. In 1921, Mauro Navarro, representing Pangasinan in the [[Philippine Assembly]], sponsored a law to rename the town of Salasa to Bugallon in order to honor General Bugallon.\n\nDuring the Philippine Commonwealth regime, [[Manuel L. Quezon]] was inaugurated as the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under the collaboration from the [[United States of America]] on November 15, 1935.\n\nThe 21st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFFE was found military establishment and built of the general headquarters was active on July 26, 1941 to June 30, 1946 and they stationed in Pangasinan during the pre-World War II era. From the conflict engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial military operations included the fall of Bataan and Corregidor and aiding the USAFFE ground force from January to May 1942 and the Japanese Insurgencies and Allied Liberation in Pangasinan from 1942 to 1945 and some parts in North-Central Luzon and helps local guerrillas and American forces against the Japanese.\n\n===Philippine Republic===\n\n====National====\n\n====1946\u20131986====\nAfter the declaration of Independence in [[Manila]] on July 4, 1946, Eugenio Perez, a [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] congressman representing the [[Legislative districts of Pangasinan#4th District|fourth district]] of Pangasinan, was elected Speaker of the lower [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Legislative House]]. He led the House until 1953, when the [[Nacionalista Party]] became the dominant party.\n\nPangasinan, which is historically and geographically part of the [[Central Luzon Region]], is made politically part of the [[Ilocos Region]] (Region I) in the gerrymandering of the [[Philippines]] by [[Ferdinand Marcos]], despite the fact that Pangasinan has its distinct primary language, which is Pangasinan. The political classification of Pangasinan as part of the Ilocos Region has generated confusion among some Filipinos that the residents of Pangasinan are Ilocanos, even though Ilocanos only constitute a significant minority in the province. Pangasinan has a distinct primary language, ethnic group and culture, its economy is bigger than the predominantly Ilocano provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union and its population is more than 50 percent of the population of Region 1.\n\n====1986\u2013present====\nIn February 1986, Vice Chief of Staff General [[Fidel V. Ramos]], head of the Philippine Integrated National Police and a native of Lingayen, Pangasinan, became one of the instrumental figures of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA people power revolution]] that led to the overthrow of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n\nAfter the downfall of Marcos, all local government unit executives in the Philippines were ordered by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] to vacate their posts. Some local executives were ordered to return to their seats as in the case of Mayor Ludovico Espinosa of [[Dasol]], where he claims he joined the UNIDO, Mrs. Aquino's party during the height of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]]. Fidel Ramos was appointed as AFP Chief of Staff and later as Defense Secretary replacing [[Juan Ponce Enrile]]. [[Oscar Orbos]], a congressman from Bani, Pangasinan, was appointed by Aquino as head of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications]] and later as Executive Secretary.\n\nOn May 11, 1992, Fidel V. Ramos [[1992 Philippine general election|ran]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He was elected and became the first Pangasinan President of the Philippines. Through his leadership, the Philippines recovered from a severe economy after the oil and power crisis of 1991. His influence also sparked the economic growth of Pangasinan when it hosted the 1995 ''Palarong Pambansa'' (Philippine National Games).\n\n[[Jose de Venecia]], who represented the same district as Eugenio Perez, was the second Pangasinan to be Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1992. He was reelected for the same position in 1995. De Venecia was selected by the Ramos' administration party Lakas NUCD to be its presidential candidate in 1998. De Venecia [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] but lost to [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Joseph Estrada]]. Oscar Orbos, who served as Pangasinan governor from 1995, [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] for Vice President, but lost to [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], whose mother, former [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Eva Macapagal|Evangelina Macaraeg-Macapagal]], hails from Binalonan, Pangasinan.\n\nArroyo later ascended to the presidency after the second [[EDSA II|EDSA Revolution]] when President [[Joseph Estrada]] was overthrown.\n\nIn May 2004, actor-turned-politician [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]], whose family is from San Carlos City, Pangasinan, ran for President against incumbent [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] during the [[2004 Philippine general election|Philippine general election in 2004]]. The Pangasinan vote was almost evenly split by the two presidential candidates who both have Pangasinan roots. Arroyo was elected President, but her victory was tainted by charges of electoral fraud and vote-buying.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical===\nPangasinan is located on the west central area of the island of [[Luzon]] in the Philippines. It is bordered by [[La Union]] to the north, [[Benguet]] and [[Nueva Vizcaya]] to the northeast, [[Nueva Ecija]] to the southeast, and [[Zambales]] and [[Tarlac]] to the south. To the west of Pangasinan is the [[South China Sea]]. The province also encloses the [[Lingayen Gulf]].\n\nThe province has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}.{{PSGC detail|nscb}} It is {{convert|170|km}} north of [[Manila]], {{convert|50|km}} south of [[Baguio City]], {{convert|115|km}} north of Subic International Airport and Seaport, and {{convert|80|km2}} north of [[Clark International Airport]]. At the coast of [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], the [[Hundred Islands National Park|Hundred islands]] have become a famous tourist spot.\n\nThe terrain of the province, as part of the Central Luzon plains, is typically flat, with a few parts being hilly and/or mountainous. The northeastern municipalities of [[San Manuel, Pangasinan|San Manuel]], [[San Nicolas, Pangasinan|San Nicolas]], [[Natividad, Pangasinan|Natividad]], [[San Quintin, Pangasinan|San Quintin]] and [[Umingan, Pangasinan|Umingan]] have hilly to mountainous areas, situated at the tip of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera mountains]]. The [[Zambales mountains]] extend to the province's western towns of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]], [[Bugallon, Pangasinan|Bugallon]], [[Aguilar, Pangasinan|Aguilar]], [[Mangatarem, Pangasinan|Mangatarem]], [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]], and [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] forming the mountainous portions of those towns.\n\nThe [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] (PHIVOLCS) reported several [[Volcano#Popular classification of volcanoes|inactive volcano]]es in the province: [[Mount Amorong|Amorong]], [[Mount Balungao|Balungao]], Cabaluyan, Cahelietan, Candong, and Malabobo. PHIVOLCS reported no active or potentially active volcanoes in Pangasinan. A [[caldera]]-like [[landform]] is located between the towns of [[Malasiqui]] and [[Villasis]] with a center at about 15\u00b0 55\u2032 N and 120\u00b0 30\u2032 E near the Cabaruan Hills.\n\nSeveral rivers traverse the province. The longest is the [[Agno River]], which originates from the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Mountains]] of [[Benguet]], eventually emptying its waters into the [[Lingayen Gulf]]. Other major rivers include the [[Bued River]], Angalacan River, Sinocalan River, Patalan River and the Cayanga River.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Mainlist|Administrative divisions of Pangasinan}}\n\nThe province of Pangasinan is subdivided into 44 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], 4 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and 1,364 ''[[barangay]]'' (which means \"village\" or \"community\").

The estimated population of the indigenous speakers of the Pangasinan language in the province of Pangasinan is almost 2 million and is projected to double in about 30 years. According to the 2000 census, 47 percent of the population are native Pangasinan and 44 percent are [[Ilocano people|Ilocano settlers]]. Indigenous [[Sambal people]] predominate in the westernmost municipalities of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]].

It belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]] and is the primary language of the province of Pangasinan, as well as northern Tarlac and southwestern La Union. The Pangasinan language is similar to the other [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] of the [[Philippines]], as well as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. It is closely related to the [[Ibaloi]] language spoken in the neighboring province of [[Benguet]], located northwest of Pangasinan. The Pangasinan language along with Ibaloi are classified under the Pangasinic group of languages. The other Pangasinic languages are:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em|style=font-size:95%}}\n* Karao\n* Iwaak\n* Keley-I\n* I-Kallahan\n{{div col end}}\n\nAside from their native language, some educated Pangasinans are highly proficient in [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[English language|English]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. Pangasinan is mostly spoken in the central part of the province in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and is the second language in other parts of Pangasinan. [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] is widely spoken in the westernmost and easternmost parts of Pangasinan in the 1st, 5th and 6th districts, and is the second language in other parts of Pangasinan. Ilocanos and Pangasinans speak Ilocano with a Pangasinan accent, as descendants of Ilocanos from first generation who lived within Pangasinan population learned Pangasinan language. [[Bolinao language|Bolinao]], a [[Sambalic languages|Sambalic language]] is widely spoken in the western tip of the province in the towns of Bolinao and Anda.\n\n===Religion===\nThe religion of the people of Pangasinan is predominantly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]] with [[Roman Catholicism]] as the overwhelming majority at 80% affiliation in the population. The second major denomination in the province is the [[Aglipayan Church]] with at least 15% of the population. Other religious denominations are divided with other Christian groups such as Members Church of God International, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Baptist, Methodist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon), Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-day Adventist. Few are strict believers and continue to practice their indigenous [[anito]] beliefs and rituals, like most of the people of the Philippines.\n\n[[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[United States|American]] missionaries introduced Christianity to Pangasinan. Prior to the Spanish conquest in 1571, the predominant religion of the people of Pangasinan was similar to the indigenous religion of the highland [[Igorot]] or the inhabitants of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] on the island of Luzon, who mostly retained their indigenous culture and religion. A translation of the New Testament (excluding Revelation) in the Pangasinan language by Fr. Nicolas Manrique Alonzo Lallave, a Spanish Dominican friar assigned in Urdaneta, was the first ever translation of a complete portion of the Bible in a Philippine language. Pangasinan was also influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]] to a lesser extent, before the introduction of Christianity. Some Pangasinense people have reverted to their indigenous religion headed by their supreme deity, Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay,<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\"/> while some [[Sambal people]] of the west have also reverted to their indigenous religion, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:saltfarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Commercial salt industry in [[Dasol]]]]\n\nThe province's '''economy''' is mainly agricultural due to its vast fertile plains.

It has extensive fishponds, mostly for raising ''bangus'' or \"milkfish\", along the coasts of the [[Lingayen Gulf]] and the [[South China Sea]]. Pangasinan's aquaculture includes oyster and sea urchin farms.\n\nSalt is also a major industry. In [[salt evaporation pond]]s seawater is mixed with [[sodium bicarbonate]] until the water evaporates and the salt remains.

Many Pangasinans go to [[Metro Manila]], Baguio City, and the [[United States]] for tertiary and higher education.\n\nPangasinan has 51 hospitals and clinics and 68 rural health units (as of July 2002). Although some residents go to other parts of the Philippines, Metro Manila, Europe and the United States for extensive medical tests and treatment, almost all Pangasinans go to the major medical centers in the cities of [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]], [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos]] and [[Urdaneta City|Urdaneta]].\n\n==Culture==\nThe culture of Pangasinan is a blend of the indigenous Malayo-Polynesian and western Hispanic culture, with some [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] influences and minor American influences. Today, Pangasinan is very much westernized, yet retains a strong, native Austronesian background.\n\nThe main centers of Pangasinan culture are [[Dagupan City]], [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]], [[Manaoag, Pangasinan|Manaoag]], [[Calasiao]], and [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos City]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Celestejf.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Siblings Margaret F.

Due to ethnic migration, [[Ilocano people]] have settled in some areas of the province.\n\nPangasinan is the name for the province, the people, and the language spoken in the province. Indigenous Pangasinan speakers are estimated to number at least 2 million. The Pangasinan language, which is official in the province, is one of the officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines. In Pangasinan, there were several ethnic groups who enriched the cultural fabric of the province. Almost all of the people are Pangasinans and the rest are descendants of Bolinao and Ilocano, who settled the eastern and western parts of the province.<ref>[https://psa.gov.ph/content/pangasinan-most-populated-province-philippines-results-2000-census-population-and-housing]</ref> Pangasinan is spoken as a second-language by many of the ethnic minorities in Pangasinan. The secondary ethnic groups are the [[Sambal people|Bolinaos]] (who are essentially [[Sambal people]]) and the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]].\n\nThe name ''Pangasinan'' (pronounced \"Pang-ASINan\") means \"place of salt\" or \"place of salt-making\"; it is derived from the prefix ''pang'', meaning \"for\", the root word ''asin'', meaning \"salt\u201d, and suffix ''an'', signifying \"location\". At present it is pronounced \"Pa\u014bgasinan\" based on the Spanish pronunciation. The province is a major producer of salt in the Philippines. Its major products include [[bagoong]] (\"salted-[[krill]]\") and alamang (\"shrimp-paste\").\n\nPangasinan was first founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' by at least 2500 BC. A kingdom called ''Luyag na [[Caboloan]]'', which expanded to incorporate much of northwestern Luzon, existed in Pangasinan before the Spanish conquest that began in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\">{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific|date=10 June 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598846607|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&pg=PT305&lpg=PT305&dq=luyag+na+Kaboloan#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref> The Kingdom of ''Luyag na Kaboloan'' was known as the [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] in Chinese records. The ancient Pangasinan people were skilled navigators and the [[Shipping|maritime]] [[trade]] network that once flourished in ancient [[Luzon]] connected Pangasinan with other peoples of [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and the rest of the [[Pacific]]. The ancient kingdom of Luyag na Caboloan was in fact mentioned in Chinese and Indian records as being an important kingdom on ancient trade routes.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\"/>\n\nPopular tourist attractions in Pangasinan include the [[Hundred Islands National Park]] in [[Alaminos City]] and the white-sand beaches of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]]. [[Dagupan City]] is known for its Bangus Festival (\"Milkfish Festival\"). Pangasinan is also known for its delicious mangoes and ceramic oven-baked [[Calasiao, Pangasinan|Calasiao]] ''puto'' (\"native rice cake\"). Pangasinan occupies a [[strategic]] [[geo-political]] position in the central plain of Luzon. Pangasinan has been described as a gateway to northern Luzon.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe Pangasinan people, like most of the people in the [[Malay Archipelago]], are descendants of the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] who settled in Southeast Asia since prehistoric times.

The Pangasinan people were part of this ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] civilization.\n\nThe ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] were expert navigators. Their outrigger canoes and sailboats were capable of crossing the distant seas. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] sailed from the Malay archipelago to [[Madagascar]], an island across the Indian Ocean, and probably reached Africa. As the possible predecessors of the [[Polynesians]], large seagoing canoes called \"bangka\" (\"[[vaka (sailing)|vaka]]\" in several Polynesian dialects and \"[[waka (canoe)|waka]]\" in Maori) were first developed by Austronesians in the Philippine archipelago which were then used to settle and establish long-distance trade networks with distant Pacific islands from the [[Micronesia]]n island nations of [[Guam]] and [[Palau]] as far away as [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]] and probably reached the Pacific coastline of the Americas. Proof of these trade exchanges are the prevalence of \"kumara\" or [[sweet potato]] in the Pacific Islands which is endemic to South America, and the abundance of chicken bones in ancient South American archaeological dig sites whose closest genetic relatives are those of chickens from Asia. At least three hundred years before the arrival of Europeans, the [[Makasar]] and the [[Bugis]] from [[Sulawesi]], in what is now [[Indonesia]], as well as the [[Sama-Bajau]]s of the Malay Archipelago, carried out long-distance commerce with their ''prau'' or ''paraw'' (\"sailboat\") and established settlements in north [[Australia]], which they called ''Marege''.<ref>[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011346 PLoS ONE: The History of Makassan Trepang Fishing and Trade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nPangasinan was founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' during the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion from Taiwan and Southern China in about 5000\u20132500 BC or the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] dispersal from [[Sundaland]] at least 7,000 years ago after the last Ice Age. ''Anakbanwa'' means \u201cchild of ''banwa.''\u201d ''Banwa'' (also spelled ''banua'' or ''vanua'') is an Austronesian concept that could mean territory, homeland, habitat, society, civilization or cosmos. The Pangasinan people identified or associated ''banwa'' with the sun, which was their symbol for their ''banwa''. The Pangasinan people are closely related to the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] in the neighboring province of [[Benguet]] and other peoples of [[Luzon]]. The ''Anakbanwa'' established their settlements in the banks of the [[Agno River]] and the coasts of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. The coastal area came to be known as ''Pangasinan'', and the interior area came to be known as ''Kaboloan''. Eventually, the whole region, its people and the used language came to be known as Pangasinan. Archaeological evidence and early [[Chinese history|Chinese]] and [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] records show that the inhabitants of Pangasinan traded with [[India]], [[Arabia]], [[China]] and [[Japan]] as early as the 8th century A.D.\n\n===''Wangdom'' of Pangasinan (''Luyag na Caboloan'')===\nThe [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] (as known in Chinese records) and locally known as the ancient kingdom or state called ''Luyag na Caboloan'' (also spelled ''Kaboloan''), with ''Binalatongan'' as its capital, existed in the fertile [[Agno River]] valley. Around the same period, the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] empires arose in [[Indonesia]] that extended their influence to much of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. [[Urduja]]/Udaya, a legendary woman warrior who [[Ibn Battuta]] called a rival of the Mongol Empire, is believed to have ruled in Pangasinan around the 14th century. The ''Luyag na Caboloan'' expanded the territory and influence of Pangasinan to what are now the neighboring provinces of [[Tarlac]], [[La Union]], [[Zambales]], [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Benguet]]. Pangasinan enjoyed full [[independence]] until the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest.\n\n===''Anito'' and ''mana'' beliefs and practices===\nThe ancient Pangasinan people, like other [[Austronesian peoples]], practiced ''[[anito]]'' worship. An ''anito'' was believed to be the spirit or divine power of an ancestor or the god or divine power in nature or natural phenomena. They believed in [[mana]], an Austronesian concept which can be described as the divine power or vital or spiritual essence of every being and everything that exists. To the Pangasinan people, ''mana'' can be transferred, inherited or acquired, like from an ancestor, nature, or natural phenomena. Their belief or practice is similar to [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] or [[animism|animist]] beliefs and rituals. They worshipped a pantheon of ''[[anito]]'' (\"spirit\" or \"deity\"). Their [[dambana|temples or altars]] were dedicated to a chief ''anito'' called Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\">https://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca-3/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/northern-cultural-communities/the-lowland-cultural-community-of-pangasinan/</ref> (\u201cSupreme Father\u201d), who communicated through mediums or priests called ''[[babaylan|manag-anito]]''. These ''manag-anito'' wore special costumes when serving an ''anito'' and they made offerings of oils, ointments, essences, and perfumes in exquisite vessels. In contrast, the [[Sambal people]] of the west also revered their own pantheon of deities, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\">https://www.aswangproject.com/sambal-mythology-pantheon-of-deities-and-beings/</ref>\n\n===Spanish accounts of pre-Hispanic Pangasinan===\nIn the sixteenth-century Pangasinan was called the \"Port of Japan\" by the Spanish. The locals wore native apparel typical of other maritime Southeast Asian ethnic groups in addition to Japanese and Chinese silks. Even common people were clad in Chinese and Japanese cotton garments. They blackened their teeth and were disgusted by the white teeth of foreigners, which were likened to that of animals. They used porcelain jars typical of Japanese and Chinese households. Japanese-style gunpowder weapons were encountered in naval battles in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=187}}</ref> In exchange for these goods, traders from all over Asia would come to trade primarily for gold and slaves, but also for deerskins, civet and other local products. Other than a notably more extensive trade network with Japan and China, they were culturally similar to other Luzon groups to the south.\n\nPangasinans were also described as a warlike people who were long known for their resistance to Spanish conquest. Bishop Domingo Salazar described them as really the worst people, the fiercest and cruelest in the land. There was evidence of Christian influence even before Spanish colonization; they used vintage wine in small quantities for their sacramental practices. The church bragged that they won the northern part of the Philippines for Spain not Spanish military. They were unusually strict against adulterers, with the punishment being death for both parties. Pangasinans were known to take defeated [[Zambales#History|Zambal]] ([[Aeta]]) and [[Negrito]] warriors to sell as slaves to Chinese traders.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=248\u2013249}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nIn 1324, [[Odoric of Pordenone]], a Franciscan missionary from [[Friuli]], Italy, is believed by some to have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], which is generally regarded as the [[first mass in the Philippines]], by some 197 years. However, historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is no reason to think that he celebrated mass.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=William Henry |title=Prehispanic source materials for the study of Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSlwAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=New Day Publishers|isbn=978-971-10-0226-8|pages=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nOn April 27, 1565, the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] arrived in the Philippine islands with about 500 soldiers to establish a Spanish settlement and begin the conquest of the archipelago. On May 24, 1570, the Spanish forces defeated [[Rajah Sulayman]] and other rulers of Manila and later declared [[Manila]] as the new capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]]. After securing Manila, the Spanish forces continued to conquer the rest of the island of Luzon, including Pangasinan.\n\n====Provincia de Pangasinan====\nIn 1571, the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan began with an expedition by the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Mart\u00edn de Goiti]], who came from the Spanish settlement in [[Manila]] through [[Pampanga]]. About a year later, another Spanish conquistador, [[Juan de Salcedo]], sailed to [[Lingayen Gulf]] and landed at the mouth of the [[Agno River]]. [[Limahong]], a Chinese pirate, fled to Pangasinan after his fleet was driven away from Manila in 1574. Limahong failed to establish a colony in Pangasinan, as an army led by Juan de Salcedo chased him out of Pangasinan after a seven-month siege.\n\nThe province of Pangasinan dates its actual beginnings as an administrative and judicial district, with Lingayen as the capital, to as early as 1580, but its territorial boundaries were first delineated in 1611. Lingayen has remained the capital of the province except for a brief period during the revolutionary Era when San Carlos served as temporary administrative headquarters, and during the slightly longer Japanese Occupation when Dagupan was the capital.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\">{{cite web|title=History of Pangasinan|url=http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905174851/http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|archive-date=5 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe province of Pangasinan was formerly classified as an alcaldia mayor de termino, or first class civil province, during the Spanish regime and has, in fact, remained a first class-A province up to the present. Its territorial jurisdiction once included the entire province of Zambales and portions of what are now Tarlac and La Union provinces.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\"/>\n\n====Rebellion against the Spanish rule====\n\n====Malong liberation====\nAndres Malong, a native chief of the town of Binalatongan (now named San Carlos City), liberated the province from Spanish rule in December 1660. The people of Pangasinan proclaimed Andres Malong ''Ari na Pangasinan'' (\"King of Pangasinan\"). Pangasinan armies attempted to liberate the neighboring provinces of Pampanga and Ilocos, but were repelled by a Spanish-led coalition of loyalist tribal warriors and mercenaries. In February 1661, the newly independent Kingdom of Pangasinan fell to the Spanish.\n\n====Palaris liberation====\nOn November 3, 1762, the people of Pangasinan proclaimed independence from Spain after a rebellion led by [[Juan de la Cruz Palaris]] overthrew Spanish rule in Pangasinan. The Pangasinan revolt was sparked by news of the fall of Manila to the British on October 6, 1762. However, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] on March 1, 1763 that closed the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain, France and Spain, the Spanish colonial forces made a counter-attack. On January 16, 1765, Juan de la Cruz Palaris was captured and Pangasinan independence was again lost.\n\n===Philippine revolution against Spain===\n{{Main|Philippine Revolution Against Spain}}\n\nThe [[Katipunan]], a nationalist secret society, was founded on July 7, 1892 with the aim of uniting the peoples of the Philippines and fighting for independence and religious freedom. The [[Philippine Revolution]] began on August 26, 1896 and was led by [[Andres Bonifacio]], the leader of the Katipunan. On November 18, 1897, a Katipunan council was formed in western Pangasinan with Roman Manalang as Presidente Generalisimo and Mauro Ortiz as General. General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. [[Dagupan City]], the major commercial center of Pangasinan, was surrounded by Katipunan forces by July 18, 1898. The Battle of Dagupan lasted from July 18 to July 23 of that year with the surrender of 1,500 soldiers of the Spanish forces under Commander Federico J. Ceballos and Governor Joaquin de Orengochea.\n\n[[File:Andres Urdaneta monumentua, Urdaneta City, Philippines.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Andres Urdaneta monument, in front of the City Hall.]]\n\nThe Battle of Dagupan, fought fiercely by local Katipuneros under the overall command of General Francisco Makabulos, chief of the Central and Directive Committee of Central and Northern Luzon, and the last remnants of the once mighty Spanish Army under General Francisco Ceballos, led to the liberation of Pangasinan from the Spaniards. The five-day battle was joined by three local heroes: Don Daniel Maramba from Santa Barbara, Don Vicente Prado from San Jacinto and Don Juan Quezada from Dagupan. Their armies massed in Dagupan to lay siege on the Spanish forces, making a last stand at the brick-walled Catholic Church.\n\n[[File:Maramba67jf.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Grave of Don Daniel B. Maramba ([[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan|Santa Barbara]])]]\n[[File:Maramba33jf.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Daniel B. Maramba Monument and 1970 NHI Marker]]\n\nMaramba led the liberation of the town of Santa Barbara on March 7, 1898 following a signal for simultaneous attack from Makabulos. Hearing that Santa Barbara fell into rebel hands, the Spanish forces in Dagupan attempted to retake the town, but were repulsed by Maramba's forces. Thus, after the setback, the Spaniards decided to concentrate their forces in Lingayen to protect the provincial capital. This enabled Maramba to expand his operations to Malasiqui, Urdaneta and Mapandan, taking them one after the other. He took one more town, Mangaldan, before proceeding to Dagupan to lay siege on the last Spanish garrison. Also on March 7, 1898, the rebels under the command of Prado and Quesada attacked convents in a number of towns in Zambales province, located west of Lingayen, which now constitute the western parts of Pangasinan.\n\nAttacked and brought under Filipino control were Alaminos, Agno, Anda, Alos, Bani, Balincaguin, Bolinao, Dasol, Eguia and Potot. The revolt then spread to Labrador, Sual, Salasa and many other towns in the west. The towns of Sual, Labrador, Lingayen, Salasa and Bayambang were occupied first by the forces of Prado and Quesada before they proceeded to attack Dagupan.\n\nAt an assembly convened to organize a central governing body for Central and Northern Luzon on April 17, 1898, General Makabulos appointed Prado as politico-military governor of Pangasinan, with Quesada as his second in command. His appointment came a few days before the return of General Emilio Aguinaldo in May 1898 from his exile in Hong Kong following the signing of the Pact of Biac-na-Bato in December 1897. Aguinaldo's return gave fresh impetus to the renewal of the flame of the revolution. Thus, on June 3, 1898, General Makabulos entered Tarlac and from that day on, the fires of revolution spread.\n\nSo successful were the Filipinos in their many pitched battles against the Spaniards that on June 30, 1898, Spanish authorities decided to evacuate all their forces to Dagupan where a last stand against the rebels was to be made. They were ordered to go to Dagupan were all civilian and military personnel, including members of the volunteer locales of towns not yet in rebel hands. Those who heeded this order were the volunteer forces of Mangaldan, San Jacinto, Pozorrubio, Manaoag, and Villasis. Among the items brought to Dagupan was the image of the Most Holy Rosary of the Virgin of Manaoag, which was already the patron saint of Pangasinan.\n\nWhen the forces of Maramba from the east and Prado from the west converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898, the siege began. The arrival of General Makabulos strengthened the rebel forces until the Spaniards, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later. Armed poorly, the Filipinos were no match at the very start with Spanish soldiers holed inside the Church. They just became mere sitting ducks to Spanish soldiers shooting with their rifles from a distance. But the tempo of battle changed when the attackers, under Don Vicente Prado, devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing. This happened when they rolled trunks of bananas, bundled up in sawali, that enabled them to inch their way to the Church.\n\n===Northern Zambales ceded to Pangasinan===\n\nOn November 30, 1903, several municipalities of northern Zambales, namely, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini, were ceded to Pangasinan by the American colonial government in a bid for [[gerrymandering]]. These municipalities were traditional homelands of the [[Sambal people]], who wanted to remain part of [[Zambales]] province, their ethnic province. This 1903 colonial decision has yet to be reverted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bautista|first1=Joseph|title=Agno Rustic Pangasinan 0|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/agno-rustic-pangasinan/371628/|website=The Manila Times|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American colonization and the Philippine Commonwealth regime===\nPangasinan and other parts of the [[Spanish East Indies]] were ceded to the Americans after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] that closed the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. During the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Lieutenant Col. [[Jose Torres Bugallon]] from the town of Salasa fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna to defend the [[First Philippine Republic]] against American colonization of Northern Luzon. Bugallon was killed in battle on February 5, 1899. The First Philippine Republic was abolished in 1901. In 1907, the Philippine Assembly was established and for the first time, five residents of Pangasinan were elected as its district representatives. In 1921, Mauro Navarro, representing Pangasinan in the [[Philippine Assembly]], sponsored a law to rename the town of Salasa to Bugallon in order to honor General Bugallon.\n\nDuring the Philippine Commonwealth regime, [[Manuel L. Quezon]] was inaugurated as the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under the collaboration from the [[United States of America]] on November 15, 1935.\n\nThe 21st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFFE was found military establishment and built of the general headquarters was active on July 26, 1941 to June 30, 1946 and they stationed in Pangasinan during the pre-World War II era. From the conflict engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial military operations included the fall of Bataan and Corregidor and aiding the USAFFE ground force from January to May 1942 and the Japanese Insurgencies and Allied Liberation in Pangasinan from 1942 to 1945 and some parts in North-Central Luzon and helps local guerrillas and American forces against the Japanese.\n\n===Philippine Republic===\n\n====National====\n\n====1946\u20131986====\nAfter the declaration of Independence in [[Manila]] on July 4, 1946, Eugenio Perez, a [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] congressman representing the [[Legislative districts of Pangasinan#4th District|fourth district]] of Pangasinan, was elected Speaker of the lower [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Legislative House]]. He led the House until 1953, when the [[Nacionalista Party]] became the dominant party.\n\nPangasinan, which is historically and geographically part of the [[Central Luzon Region]], is made politically part of the [[Ilocos Region]] (Region I) in the gerrymandering of the [[Philippines]] by [[Ferdinand Marcos]], despite the fact that Pangasinan has its distinct primary language, which is Pangasinan. The political classification of Pangasinan as part of the Ilocos Region has generated confusion among some Filipinos that the residents of Pangasinan are Ilocanos, even though Ilocanos only constitute a significant minority in the province. Pangasinan has a distinct primary language, ethnic group and culture, its economy is bigger than the predominantly Ilocano provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union and its population is more than 50 percent of the population of Region 1.\n\n====1986\u2013present====\nIn February 1986, Vice Chief of Staff General [[Fidel V. Ramos]], head of the Philippine Integrated National Police and a native of Lingayen, Pangasinan, became one of the instrumental figures of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA people power revolution]] that led to the overthrow of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n\nAfter the downfall of Marcos, all local government unit executives in the Philippines were ordered by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] to vacate their posts. Some local executives were ordered to return to their seats as in the case of Mayor Ludovico Espinosa of [[Dasol]], where he claims he joined the UNIDO, Mrs. Aquino's party during the height of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]]. Fidel Ramos was appointed as AFP Chief of Staff and later as Defense Secretary replacing [[Juan Ponce Enrile]]. [[Oscar Orbos]], a congressman from Bani, Pangasinan, was appointed by Aquino as head of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications]] and later as Executive Secretary.\n\nOn May 11, 1992, Fidel V. Ramos [[1992 Philippine general election|ran]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He was elected and became the first Pangasinan President of the Philippines. Through his leadership, the Philippines recovered from a severe economy after the oil and power crisis of 1991. His influence also sparked the economic growth of Pangasinan when it hosted the 1995 ''Palarong Pambansa'' (Philippine National Games).\n\n[[Jose de Venecia]], who represented the same district as Eugenio Perez, was the second Pangasinan to be Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1992. He was reelected for the same position in 1995. De Venecia was selected by the Ramos' administration party Lakas NUCD to be its presidential candidate in 1998. De Venecia [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] but lost to [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Joseph Estrada]]. Oscar Orbos, who served as Pangasinan governor from 1995, [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] for Vice President, but lost to [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], whose mother, former [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Eva Macapagal|Evangelina Macaraeg-Macapagal]], hails from Binalonan, Pangasinan.\n\nArroyo later ascended to the presidency after the second [[EDSA II|EDSA Revolution]] when President [[Joseph Estrada]] was overthrown.\n\nIn May 2004, actor-turned-politician [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]], whose family is from San Carlos City, Pangasinan, ran for President against incumbent [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] during the [[2004 Philippine general election|Philippine general election in 2004]]. The Pangasinan vote was almost evenly split by the two presidential candidates who both have Pangasinan roots. Arroyo was elected President, but her victory was tainted by charges of electoral fraud and vote-buying.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical===\nPangasinan is located on the west central area of the island of [[Luzon]] in the Philippines. It is bordered by [[La Union]] to the north, [[Benguet]] and [[Nueva Vizcaya]] to the northeast, [[Nueva Ecija]] to the southeast, and [[Zambales]] and [[Tarlac]] to the south. To the west of Pangasinan is the [[South China Sea]]. The province also encloses the [[Lingayen Gulf]].\n\nThe province has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}.{{PSGC detail|nscb}} It is {{convert|170|km}} north of [[Manila]], {{convert|50|km}} south of [[Baguio City]], {{convert|115|km}} north of Subic International Airport and Seaport, and {{convert|80|km2}} north of [[Clark International Airport]]. At the coast of [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], the [[Hundred Islands National Park|Hundred islands]] have become a famous tourist spot.\n\nThe terrain of the province, as part of the Central Luzon plains, is typically flat, with a few parts being hilly and/or mountainous.

The [[Zambales mountains]] extend to the province's western towns of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]], [[Bugallon, Pangasinan|Bugallon]], [[Aguilar, Pangasinan|Aguilar]], [[Mangatarem, Pangasinan|Mangatarem]], [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]], and [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] forming the mountainous portions of those towns.\n\nThe [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] (PHIVOLCS) reported several [[Volcano#Popular classification of volcanoes|inactive volcano]]es in the province: [[Mount Amorong|Amorong]], [[Mount Balungao|Balungao]], Cabaluyan, Cahelietan, Candong, and Malabobo. PHIVOLCS reported no active or potentially active volcanoes in Pangasinan. A [[caldera]]-like [[landform]] is located between the towns of [[Malasiqui]] and [[Villasis]] with a center at about 15\u00b0 55\u2032 N and 120\u00b0 30\u2032 E near the Cabaruan Hills.\n\nSeveral rivers traverse the province. The longest is the [[Agno River]], which originates from the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Mountains]] of [[Benguet]], eventually emptying its waters into the [[Lingayen Gulf]]. Other major rivers include the [[Bued River]], Angalacan River, Sinocalan River, Patalan River and the Cayanga River.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Mainlist|Administrative divisions of Pangasinan}}\n\nThe province of Pangasinan is subdivided into 44 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], 4 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and 1,364 ''[[barangay]]'' (which means \"village\" or \"community\").

Pangasinan people were known as traders, businesspeople, farmers and fishers. Pangasinan is the third most-populated province in the Philippines. The estimated population of the indigenous speakers of the Pangasinan language in the province of Pangasinan is almost 2 million and is projected to double in about 30 years. According to the 2000 census, 47 percent of the population are native Pangasinan and 44 percent are [[Ilocano people|Ilocano settlers]]. Indigenous [[Sambal people]] predominate in the westernmost municipalities of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]]. The Pangasinan people are closely related to the [[Austronesian people|Austronesian-speaking peoples]] of the other parts of the [[Philippines]], as well as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].\n\n===Languages===\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Languages Spoken (2010)<ref>[http://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/PANGASINAN_FINAL%20PDF.pdf Table 10.

It belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]] and is the primary language of the province of Pangasinan, as well as northern Tarlac and southwestern La Union. The Pangasinan language is similar to the other [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] of the [[Philippines]], as well as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. It is closely related to the [[Ibaloi]] language spoken in the neighboring province of [[Benguet]], located northwest of Pangasinan. The Pangasinan language along with Ibaloi are classified under the Pangasinic group of languages. The other Pangasinic languages are:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em|style=font-size:95%}}\n* Karao\n* Iwaak\n* Keley-I\n* I-Kallahan\n{{div col end}}\n\nAside from their native language, some educated Pangasinans are highly proficient in [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[English language|English]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. Pangasinan is mostly spoken in the central part of the province in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and is the second language in other parts of Pangasinan. [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] is widely spoken in the westernmost and easternmost parts of Pangasinan in the 1st, 5th and 6th districts, and is the second language in other parts of Pangasinan. Ilocanos and Pangasinans speak Ilocano with a Pangasinan accent, as descendants of Ilocanos from first generation who lived within Pangasinan population learned Pangasinan language. [[Bolinao language|Bolinao]], a [[Sambalic languages|Sambalic language]] is widely spoken in the western tip of the province in the towns of Bolinao and Anda.\n\n===Religion===\nThe religion of the people of Pangasinan is predominantly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]] with [[Roman Catholicism]] as the overwhelming majority at 80% affiliation in the population. The second major denomination in the province is the [[Aglipayan Church]] with at least 15% of the population. Other religious denominations are divided with other Christian groups such as Members Church of God International, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Baptist, Methodist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon), Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-day Adventist. Few are strict believers and continue to practice their indigenous [[anito]] beliefs and rituals, like most of the people of the Philippines.\n\n[[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[United States|American]] missionaries introduced Christianity to Pangasinan. Prior to the Spanish conquest in 1571, the predominant religion of the people of Pangasinan was similar to the indigenous religion of the highland [[Igorot]] or the inhabitants of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] on the island of Luzon, who mostly retained their indigenous culture and religion. A translation of the New Testament (excluding Revelation) in the Pangasinan language by Fr. Nicolas Manrique Alonzo Lallave, a Spanish Dominican friar assigned in Urdaneta, was the first ever translation of a complete portion of the Bible in a Philippine language. Pangasinan was also influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]] to a lesser extent, before the introduction of Christianity. Some Pangasinense people have reverted to their indigenous religion headed by their supreme deity, Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay,<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\"/> while some [[Sambal people]] of the west have also reverted to their indigenous religion, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:saltfarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Commercial salt industry in [[Dasol]]]]\n\nThe province's '''economy''' is mainly agricultural due to its vast fertile plains. More than 44 percent of its agricultural area is devoted to crop production. Aside from being one of the Philippine's rice granaries, '''Pangasinan''' is also a major producer of coconut, mango and eggplant, Pangasinan is the richest province in Ilocos Region of the Philippines.<ref>http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units-lgus/category/6072-2015?download=28070:annual-financial-report-for-local-government-volume-i</ref>\n\n===Energy===\nThe [[Sual Power Station|1200 megawatt Sual coal-fired power plant]], and [[San Roque Dam (Philippines)|345 megawatt San Roque multi-purpose dam]], in the municipalities of Sual and San Manuel respectively, are the primary sources of energy of the province.\n\n===Marine===\nPangasinan is a major fish supplier in Luzon, and a major producer of salt in the Philippines. It has extensive fishponds, mostly for raising ''bangus'' or \"milkfish\", along the coasts of the [[Lingayen Gulf]] and the [[South China Sea]]. Pangasinan's aquaculture includes oyster and sea urchin farms.\n\nSalt is also a major industry. In [[salt evaporation pond]]s seawater is mixed with [[sodium bicarbonate]] until the water evaporates and the salt remains. This is their ancient tradition inspired from Egypt.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe major crops in Pangasinan are [[rice]], [[mangoes]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[sugar cane]]. Pangasinan has a land area of 536,819 hectares, and 44 percent{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} of the total land area of Pangasinan is devoted to agricultural production.\n\n===Financial===\nPangasinan has 593 banking and financing institutions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Labor===\nPangasinan has a labor force of about 1.52 million, and 87 percent of the labor force are gainfully employed.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Health and education==\nThere are thousands of public schools and hundreds of private schools across the province for primary and secondary education. Many Pangasinans go to [[Metro Manila]], Baguio City, and the [[United States]] for tertiary and higher education.\n\nPangasinan has 51 hospitals and clinics and 68 rural health units (as of July 2002). Although some residents go to other parts of the Philippines, Metro Manila, Europe and the United States for extensive medical tests and treatment, almost all Pangasinans go to the major medical centers in the cities of [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]], [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos]] and [[Urdaneta City|Urdaneta]].\n\n==Culture==\nThe culture of Pangasinan is a blend of the indigenous Malayo-Polynesian and western Hispanic culture, with some [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] influences and minor American influences. Today, Pangasinan is very much westernized, yet retains a strong, native Austronesian background.\n\nThe main centers of Pangasinan culture are [[Dagupan City]], [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]], [[Manaoag, Pangasinan|Manaoag]], [[Calasiao]], and [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos City]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Celestejf.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Siblings Margaret F.

Gender restrictions on careers and jobs create an environment where women are only welcomed into careers which match traditional female roles: primarily domestic, secretarial, or factory work.<ref name=\"Gaetano\" /> Gender discrimination also affects women of reproductive age, who are frequently passed over due to a potential future loss of productivity resulting from pregnancy.<ref name=\"Bulger\" /> [[Ageism]] affects many women, especially those working in the service industry (where youth is a key component of workplace success).<ref name=\"osburg\" /> In this sector, women over age 30 are frequently denied jobs.<ref name=\"Z\" /> Female job-seekers over age 40 are especially subject to ageism in most industries, despite being past child-bearing age.<ref name=\"Z\" /> The age limit for men is more relaxed, usually 40 or 45 years of age.<ref name=\"Z\" /> Although laws are in place to prevent hiring discrimination, there is little enforcement.<ref name=\"Gaetano\" />\n\n===Impact of foreign direct investment on wages===\n[[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) has significantly impacted employment in China.

Gender restrictions on careers and jobs create an environment where women are only welcomed into careers which match traditional female roles: primarily domestic, secretarial, or factory work.<ref name=\"Gaetano\" /> Gender discrimination also affects women of reproductive age, who are frequently passed over due to a potential future loss of productivity resulting from pregnancy.<ref name=\"Bulger\" /> [[Ageism]] affects many women, especially those working in the service industry (where youth is a key component of workplace success).<ref name=\"osburg\" /> In this sector, women over age 30 are frequently denied jobs.<ref name=\"Z\" /> Female job-seekers over age 40 are especially subject to ageism in most industries, despite being past child-bearing age.<ref name=\"Z\" /> The age limit for men is more relaxed, usually 40 or 45 years of age.<ref name=\"Z\" /> Although laws are in place to prevent hiring discrimination, there is little enforcement.<ref name=\"Gaetano\" />\n\n===Impact of foreign direct investment on wages===\n[[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) has significantly impacted employment in China.

It is rare in Chinese society to challenge the idea of women sacrificing their professional career, because Chinese society has a \"relative[ly] ambiguous boundary between public and private spheres\".<ref name=\":4\">Fei, Xiaotong 1992[1947] CH.1 \u201cSpecial Characteristics of Rural Society.\u201d &Ch.4: \u201cChaxuGeju: the Differential Mode of Association.\u201d In ''From the Soil, the Foundations of Chinese Society: a Translation of Fei Jiaotong's Xiangtu Zhongguo, with an Introduction and Epilogue''.

Societal adherence to strict Confucian values about filial piety and women's obedience to men, intended to create hierarchies in the home which produce harmony in society, produces a patrilineal, patriarchal system which discourages gender equality.<ref name=\"Jackson\">{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Stevi|title=East Asia Sexualities: Modernity, Gender and New Sexual Cultures|date=2008|publisher=Zed Books|location=New York|pages=1\u201330}}</ref> Marriage pressures stem from Confucian values which promote the necessity for women to marry to continue the family lineage by bearing a son.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>\n\nFamily pressure has been, and continues to be, a main driving force of Chinese marriages.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with founding year in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli Prize]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/chancellor-fall.html|title=Fall Quarter greetings|website=UC Santa Cruz News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=special-reports |url=https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/special-reports/128401/internationally-famous-vietnamese-scientists.html |title=Internationally famous Vietnamese scientists - News VietNamNet |publisher=English.vietnamnet.vn |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\n* [[Marconi Prize]] (1975)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1110|title=2011 Marconi Society Symposium Comes to UC San Diego|website=ucsd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/nri-scientist-aj-paulraj-wins-tech-nobel-2014-marconi-prize/articleshow/29232251.cms|title=NRI scientist AJ Paulraj wins tech 'Nobel'- 2014 Marconi Prize|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=23 January 2014|last1=Rajghatta|first1=Chidanand}}</ref><ref name=turing/>\n\n====Computer science====\n* [[Turing Award]] (1966)<ref name=turing/><ref name=turing2007/><ref name=turing2014/>\n* [[Nevanlinna Prize|IMU Abacus Medal]] (1982)<sup>1</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/imu-abacus-medal/|author=Katie Steckles|date=23 May 2019|title=IMU Abacus Medal|website=spektrum.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/who-was-nevanlinna-and-what-is-his-prize/|author=John Cook|date=22 September 2013|title=Who was Nevanlinna and what is his prize?|website=scientificamerican.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yale.edu/2010/08/19/yale-computer-scientist-wins-prestigious-nevanlinna-prize|date=19 August 2010|title=Yale Computer Scientist Wins Prestigious Nevanlinna Prize|website=yale.edu}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n* 1: The IMU Abacus Medal is awarded once every 4 years to a mathematician/computer scientist under '''40''' years of age on the occasion of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM).\n}}</small>\n\n====Economics====\n* [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (1969)\n* [[John Bates Clark Medal]] (1947)<sup>1</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/974259/stanfords-dave-donaldson-2017-clark-medal-winner-explains-the-flaws-in-anti-free-trade-arguments/|title=The Stanford economist who won the latest 'Baby Nobel' explains the biggest flaws in anti-free trade arguments|author=Dan Kopf|website=qz.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/Baby-Nobel-for-Delhi-born-US-economist-Raj-Chetty/articleshow/19567003.cms|title='Baby Nobel' for Delhi-born US economist Raj Chetty|author=Chidanand Rajghatta|website=indiatimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/04/22/handicapping-economics-baby-nobel-the-clark-medal/|title=Handicapping Economics' 'Baby Nobel,' the Clark Medal|author=Justin Lahart|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=23 April 2010}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n* 1: The Clark Medal is awarded annually (biennially before 2009) to an economist under '''40''' years of age who work in the US at the time of the award, regardless of his/her nationality.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation.

The diplobiontic species, such as ''[[Ulva]]'', follow a reproductive cycle called [[alternation of generations]] in  which two multicellular forms, haploid and diploid, alternate, and these may or may not be isomorphic (having the same morphology).  In haplobiontic species only the haploid generation, the [[gametophyte]] is multicellular. The fertilized egg cell, the diploid [[zygote]], undergoes [[meiosis]], giving rise to haploid cells which will become new gametophytes. The diplobiontic forms, which evolved from haplobiontic ancestors, have both a multicellular haploid generation and a multicellular diploid generation. Here the zygote divides repeatedly by [[mitosis]] and grows into a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis that germinate to produce a multicellular gametophyte. All [[Embryophyte|land plants]] have a diplobiontic common ancestor, and diplobiontic forms have also evolved independently within [[Ulvophyceae]] more than once (as has also occurred in the red and brown algae).<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ulvophyceae Alternation of Generations and Vascular Plant Features]</ref><ref name=Trillo>{{cite book |last1=Trillo |first1=Inaki Ruiz |last2=Nedelcu |first2=Aurora M |date=2015 |title=Evolutionary transitions to multicellular life: Principles and mechanisms |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-017-9642-2 }}</ref>\n\nDiplobiontic green algae include isomorphic and heteromorphic forms. In isomorphic algae, the morphology is identical in the haploid and diploid generations. In heteromorphic algae, the morphology and size are different in the gametophyte and sporophyte.<ref name=Kazuhiro>{{cite journal |first1=Kazuhiro |last1=Bessho |first2=Yoh |last2=Iwasa |title=Heteromorphic and isomorphic alternations of generations in macroalgae as adaptations to a seasonal environment |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |date=2009 |volume=11 |pages=691\u2013711 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1632/736c0ff6225722d8643a06136da55e0ea37f.pdf }}</ref>\n\nReproduction varies from fusion of identical cells ([[isogamy]]) to [[fertilisation|fertilization]] of a large non-motile cell by a smaller motile one ([[oogamy]]). However, these traits show some variation, most notably among the basal green algae called [[prasinophyte]]s.\n\nHaploid algal cells (containing only one copy of their DNA) can fuse with other haploid cells to form diploid zygotes. When filamentous algae do this, they form bridges between cells, and leave empty cell walls behind that can be easily distinguished under the light microscope. This process is called ''conjugation'' and occurs for example in ''[[Spirogyra]]''.\n\n===Sex pheromone===\n[[Sex pheromone]] production is likely a common feature of green algae, although only studied in detail in a few model organisms. ''[[Volvox]]'' is a genus of [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]].  Different species form spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. One well-studied species, ''[[Volvox carteri]]'' (2,000 \u2013 6,000 cells) occupies temporary pools of water that tend to dry out in the heat of late summer.  As their environment dries out, asexual ''V. carteri'' quickly die.  However, they are able to escape death by switching, shortly before drying is complete, to the sexual phase of their life cycle that leads to production of dormant desiccation-resistant [[zygote]]s. Sexual development is initiated by a [[glycoprotein]] pheromone (Hallmann et al., 1998).  This pheromone is one of the most potent known biological effector molecules.  It can trigger sexual development at concentrations as low as 10<sup>\u221216</sup>M.<ref name=Hallmann>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallmann A, Godl K, Wenzl S, Sumper M | title = The highly efficient sex-inducing pheromone system of Volvox | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 185\u20139 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9614342 | doi = 10.1016/s0966-842x(98)01234-7 }}</ref>  Kirk and Kirk<ref name=\"pmid3941891\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirk DL, Kirk MM | title = Heat shock elicits production of sexual inducer in Volvox | journal = Science | volume = 231 | issue = 4733 | pages = 51\u20134 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 3941891 | doi = 10.1126/science.3941891 | bibcode = 1986Sci...231...51K }}</ref>  showed that sex-inducing pheromone production can be triggered experimentally in [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells by [[heat shock]].

The diplobiontic species, such as ''[[Ulva]]'', follow a reproductive cycle called [[alternation of generations]] in  which two multicellular forms, haploid and diploid, alternate, and these may or may not be isomorphic (having the same morphology).  In haplobiontic species only the haploid generation, the [[gametophyte]] is multicellular. The fertilized egg cell, the diploid [[zygote]], undergoes [[meiosis]], giving rise to haploid cells which will become new gametophytes. The diplobiontic forms, which evolved from haplobiontic ancestors, have both a multicellular haploid generation and a multicellular diploid generation. Here the zygote divides repeatedly by [[mitosis]] and grows into a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis that germinate to produce a multicellular gametophyte. All [[Embryophyte|land plants]] have a diplobiontic common ancestor, and diplobiontic forms have also evolved independently within [[Ulvophyceae]] more than once (as has also occurred in the red and brown algae).<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ulvophyceae Alternation of Generations and Vascular Plant Features]</ref><ref name=Trillo>{{cite book |last1=Trillo |first1=Inaki Ruiz |last2=Nedelcu |first2=Aurora M |date=2015 |title=Evolutionary transitions to multicellular life: Principles and mechanisms |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-017-9642-2 }}</ref>\n\nDiplobiontic green algae include isomorphic and heteromorphic forms.

However, these traits show some variation, most notably among the basal green algae called [[prasinophyte]]s.\n\nHaploid algal cells (containing only one copy of their DNA) can fuse with other haploid cells to form diploid zygotes. When filamentous algae do this, they form bridges between cells, and leave empty cell walls behind that can be easily distinguished under the light microscope. This process is called ''conjugation'' and occurs for example in ''[[Spirogyra]]''.\n\n===Sex pheromone===\n[[Sex pheromone]] production is likely a common feature of green algae, although only studied in detail in a few model organisms. ''[[Volvox]]'' is a genus of [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]].  Different species form spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. One well-studied species, ''[[Volvox carteri]]'' (2,000 \u2013 6,000 cells) occupies temporary pools of water that tend to dry out in the heat of late summer.  As their environment dries out, asexual ''V. carteri'' quickly die.  However, they are able to escape death by switching, shortly before drying is complete, to the sexual phase of their life cycle that leads to production of dormant desiccation-resistant [[zygote]]s. Sexual development is initiated by a [[glycoprotein]] pheromone (Hallmann et al., 1998).  This pheromone is one of the most potent known biological effector molecules.  It can trigger sexual development at concentrations as low as 10<sup>\u221216</sup>M.<ref name=Hallmann>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallmann A, Godl K, Wenzl S, Sumper M | title = The highly efficient sex-inducing pheromone system of Volvox | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 185\u20139 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9614342 | doi = 10.1016/s0966-842x(98)01234-7 }}</ref>  Kirk and Kirk<ref name=\"pmid3941891\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirk DL, Kirk MM | title = Heat shock elicits production of sexual inducer in Volvox | journal = Science | volume = 231 | issue = 4733 | pages = 51\u20134 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 3941891 | doi = 10.1126/science.3941891 | bibcode = 1986Sci...231...51K }}</ref>  showed that sex-inducing pheromone production can be triggered experimentally in [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells by [[heat shock]].
