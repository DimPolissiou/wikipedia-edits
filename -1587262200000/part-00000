Comprising the provinces of [[Province of Albacete|Albacete]], [[Province of Ciudad Real|Ciudad Real]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], [[Province of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] and [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]], it was created in 1982. It is bordered by [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]], [[Aragon]], [[Valencian community|Valencia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], [[Andalusia]], and [[Extremadura]]. It is one of the most sparsely populated of Spain's regions. [[Albacete]] is the largest and most populous city. The government headquarters are in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and the [[High Court of Justice of Castile-La Mancha|High Court]] headquarters are in [[Albacete]].\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha was formerly grouped with the [[Provinces of Spain|province]] of Madrid into [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] (''Castilla la Nueva''), but with the advent of the modern Spanish system of autonomous communities (''Estado de las autonom\u00edas''), it was separated due to great demographic disparity between the capital and the remaining New-Castilian provinces. Also, distinct from the former New Castile, Castilla\u2013La Mancha added the province of [[Albacete (province)|Albacete]], which had been part of [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]; adding Albacete placed all of the historic region of [[La Mancha]] within this single region.\n\nIt is mostly in this region where the story of the famous Spanish novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] is situated, due to which La Mancha is internationally well-known.  Although La Mancha is a windswept, battered plateau, it remains a symbol of Spanish culture with its vineyards, sunflowers, mushrooms, olive plantations, windmills, [[Manchego cheese]], and ''Don Quixote''.\n\n==History==\nThe origins of Castilla\u2013La Mancha lay in the Muslim period between the 8th and 14th century. Castilla\u2013La Mancha was the region of many historical battles between Christian crusaders and Muslim forces during the period from 1000 to the 13th century. It was also the region where the [[Crown of Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] were unified in 1492 under [[Catholic Monarchs|Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand]].\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha is the successor to [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] (''Castilla la Nueva''), which in turn traces back to the [[Muslim]] [[Taifa of Toledo]], one of the ''[[taifa]]s'' of [[Al Andalus]]. [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]] conquered the region from the Muslims, taking [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085. The ''[[Reconquista]]'' (\"Reconquest\") took [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]] in 1177. Other provinces to the south\u2014the [[Campo de Calatrava]], the Valle de Alcudia, and the Alfoz de Alcaraz ([[Campo de Montiel (Ciudad Real)|Campo de Montiel]] and [[Sierra de Alcaraz]])\u2014were consolidated during the reign of [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]] (reigned 1158\u20131214), whose conquests were completed by the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212). That victory assured Castilian domination of the region and hastened the decline of the [[Almohad Dynasty]]. From the time of the ''Reconquista'', Castilla\u2013La Mancha formed part of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Four centuries later, in 1605, Cervantes' ''Don Quixote'' gave the world an indelible picture of [[La Mancha]].\n\nIn 1785, the territorial organization by the reformer [[Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Floridablanca]] divided the region into the provinces of Cuenca, Guadalajara, Madrid, La Mancha, and Toledo. Albacete, [[Chinchilla de Monte-Arag\u00f3n|Chinchilla]], [[Almansa]], [[Hell\u00edn]] and [[Yeste, Albacete|Yeste]], however, became part of Murcia. In 1833 [[Javier de Burgos]] [[1833 territorial division of Spain|modified the provincial borders]]; most of the province of La Mancha was transferred to the province of Ciudad Real, with smaller parts incorporated into the provinces of Cuenca, Toledo and the newly created province of Albacete. Albacete, in turn, also incorporated parts of the territories of the old provinces of Cuenca and Murcia. Albacete was administered as part of the Region of Murcia until the 1978 configuration of autonomous regions. Nonetheless, during the [[First Spanish Republic]], Albacete was one of the signatories to the Pacto Federal Castellano (1869) and in 1924 its deputation favored the formation of a \"Comunidad Manchega\" that would have recognized La Mancha (including Albacete) as a region.\n[[File:Women at the Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar in Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Two women and a man at the Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar in Toledo]]\nThe autonomous community of Castilla\u2013La Mancha dates from 15 November 1978 as one of the many autonomous regions defined by the Spanish central government. (More precisely, each of these regions was initially a ''preautonom\u00eda'', a \"pre-autonomous\" region, until establishing its [[Statute of Autonomy]]). The new, hyphenated name constituted an effort to bridge two distinct regionalisms: that of the larger Castilla (extending beyond this autonomous region) and that of the smaller onetime province of [[La Mancha]]. The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla\u2013La Mancha was approved August 10, 1982 and took effect August 17, 1982.<ref>The statute is L.O. [ley org\u00e1nica, \"organic law\"] 9/1982</ref>\n\n==Regional divisions==\n[[File:Toledo Skyline Panorama, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|right|277px|The Old City of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] was declared a World Heritage Site for its extensive cultural and monumental heritage. Toledo is the capital of Castilla\u2013La Mancha]]\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha is divided into 5 provinces named after their capital cities. The following category includes:\n[[File:Casas Colgadas - Cuenca (Explorer) (3080665244).jpg|thumb|right|277px|Casas Colgadas in [[Cuenca, Spain]].]]\n*[[Province of Albacete|Albacete]]\n*[[Province of Ciudad Real|Ciudad Real]]\n*[[Province of Cuenca (Spain)|Cuenca]]\n*[[Province of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]\n*[[Province of Toledo|Toledo]]\n\nAccording to the official data of the [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]], Castilla\u2013La Mancha consists of 919 municipalities, which amount to 11.3 percent of all the municipalities in Spain. 496 of these have less than 500 inhabitants, 231 have between 501 and 2,000 inhabitants, 157 between 2,000 and 10,000 inhabitants, and only 35 have more than 10,000 inhabitants. The municipalities in the north are small and numerous, while in the south they are larger and fewer.

Among the proposed anthems have been the \"Canci\u00f3n del Sembrador\" (\"Song of the Sower\") from the [[zarzuela]] ''La rosa del azafr\u00e1n'' by [[Jacinto Guerrero]], the \"Canto a la Mancha\" (\"Song of La Mancha\") by Tom\u00e1s Barrera, and many others, such as one presented by a group of citizens from [[Villarrobledo]] with the title \"Patria sin fin\" (\"Fatherland without end\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Himno de Castilla-La Mancha |url=http://webs.ono.com/federnes/himnoman.htm |access-date=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023163848/http://webs.ono.com/federnes/himnoman.htm |archive-date=23 October 2008 |language=es |date=2 February 2001 |first=Federico J. |last=Garc\u00eda Mariana |work=Proyecto de himno oficial para CASTILLA-LA MANCHA}}</ref>\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\nArticle 8 of the Statute of Autonomy states that the powers of the region are exercised through the Junta of Communities of Castilla\u2013La Mancha (''Junta de Comunidades de Castilla\u2013La Mancha''). Organs of the Junta are the [[Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha]], the President of the Junta and the Council of Government.\n\n=== Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha ===\n{{main|Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha}}\n[[File:Primera jornada del Debate de Investidura en las Cortes de Castilla-La Mancha (19105931029).jpg|thumb|Plenary chamber of the Cortes]]\nThe Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha represent the [[popular sovereignty|popular will]] through 33 deputies elected by [[universal adult suffrage]] through the [[secret ballot]]. They are elected for a term of four years under a [[proportional representation|proportional]] system intended to guarantee representation to the various territorial zones of Castilla\u2013La Mancha. The electoral [[constituency]] is at the level of each [[province]], with provinces being assigned the following number of deputies as of 2009: Albacete, 6; Ciudad Real, 8; Cuenca, 5; Guadalajara, 5; and Toledo, 9. Article 10 of the Statute of Autonomy states that elections will be convoked by the President of the Junta of Communities, following the General Electoral Regime (''R\u00e9gimen Electoral General''), on the fourth Sunday in May every four years. This stands in contrast to the autonomous communities of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Andalusia]] and the [[Valencian Community]]  where the president has the power to convoke elections at any time. (In the Valencian Community that power has never been exercised. Elections there have, in practice, taken place on a four-year cycle.)\n\nSince the [[Castile-La Mancha parliamentary election, 2015|Spanish regional elections of 2015]], the Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha has consisted of 16 deputies from the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], 15 from the socialist [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] and 2 from the left-wing [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]]. The Cortes sits in the former [[Franciscan]] convent in Toledo, the ''Edificio de San Gil'' (\"San Gil building\").\n\n=== Council of Government ===\nThe Council of Government is the collegial executive organ of the region. It directs regional political and administrative action, exercises an executive function and regulatory powers under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], the Statute of Autonomy, and the laws of the nation and region. The Council of Government consists of the president, vice presidents (if any) and the Councilors.\n\n=== President of the Junta ===\nThe President of the Junta directs the Council of Government and coordinates the functions of its members. The president is elected by the Cortes from among its members, then formally named by the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarch of Spain]].

The Submeseta Sur (and the autonomous community) is separated from the Submeseta Norte (and the community of [[Castilla y Le\u00f3n]]) by the mountain range known as the [[Sistema Central]]. Despite this, the region has no shortage of mountain landscapes: the southern slopes of the aforementioned Sistema Central in the north, the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico]] in the northeast, and the [[Sierra Morena]] and [[Montes de Toledo]] in the south.\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha is the third largest of Spain's autonomous regions, with a surface area of {{convert|79463|km2|sqmi}}, representing 15.7 percent of Spain's national territory.\n\n=== Terrain ===\n[[File:LA MANCHA CONSUEGRA.jpg|thumb|left|The Manchegan plain in [[Consuegra]] ([[Province of Toledo|Toledo]]).]]\n[[File:09042009 164759 CEC 0091 - WLE Spain 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Natural land formations in [[Ciudad Encantada]].]]\nThe region has two distinct types of terrain. The Meseta is a vast, uniform plain with little relief. Within that uniformity, the most outstanding variation in altitude is that of the [[Montes de Toledo]], with peaks such as [[La Villuerca]] ({{convert|1601|m|sp=us|ft}}), the highest peak of the Montes de Toledo range, and [[Rocigalgo]] ({{convert|1447|m|sp=us|ft}}). \nAt the south of that system are the Montes de Toledo, which cross the region from west to east, dividing the [[Tagus]] (''Tajo'') and [[Guadiana]] [[drainage basin]]s, forming the southern slope of the basin of the former and the northern slope of the latter.\n\nIn contrast, a more mountainous zone surrounds the Meseta and serves as the region's natural border. In the north of the [[Province of Guadalajara]], bordering Madrid and [[Segovia]], is a mountain range forming part of the [[Sistema Central]], among which can be distinguished the mountain ranges Pela, Ayll\u00f3n, Somosierra, Barahona and Ministra, with the headwaters of the rivers [[Jarama]], [[Ca\u00f1amares (river)|Ca\u00f1amares]] and [[Henares]]. The Sistema Central also penetrates the Province of Toledo, which intersects a southerly part of the [[Sierra de Gredos]], known as the [[Sierra de San Vicente]], delimited on the north by the [[river Ti\u00e9tar]] and on the south by the [[Alberche]] and the Tagus.\n\nOn the northwest is the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico]], where there is important fluvial and especially [[karst]]ic activity, which has given rise to such landscapes as the [[Ciudad Encantada]], the [[Callejones de Las Majadas]] and the [[Hoces del Cabriel]].\n\nIn the southeast is the ridge of the Sierra Morena, the southern border of the Meseta Central and the region's border with [[Andalusia]]. Within the Sierra Morena, distinction can be made between the [[Sierra Madrona]], [[Sierra de Alcudia]] and [[Sierra de San Andr\u00e9s]]. At the other southern extreme of Castilla\u2013La Mancha, the [[Sierra de Alcaraz]] and [[Sierra del Segura]] form part of the [[Sistema B\u00e9tico]].\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n{{see also|Tagus|Guadiana|Guadalquivir|J\u00facar|Segura}}\n[[File:El J\u00facar atravesando Cuenca.jpg|thumb|right|The [[J\u00facar]] passing through Cuenca.]]\n\nThe territory of Castilla\u2013La Mancha is divided into five principal [[drainage divide|watershed]]s.

The continentalized Mediterranean climate is similar to a [[typical Mediterranean climate]], but with more extreme temperatures typical of a continental climate. Lack of a marine influence leads to much more extreme temperatures: hotter summers and quite cold winters, with a daily oscillation of 18.5&nbsp;\u00b0C (33.3&nbsp;\u00b0F).  Summer is the driest season, with temperatures often exceeding {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, sometimes reaching and exceeding {{convert|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. In winter, temperatures often drop below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, producing frosts on clear nights, and occasional snow on cloudy nights.\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha is part of what has traditionally been called ''Espa\u00f1a Seca'' (\"Dry Spain\"). It receives relatively little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], much as in a typical Mediterranean climate. Precipitation presents a notable gradient from the center of the region, where it does not surpass {{convert|400|mm|in}} per year, to the mountains where it can exceed {{convert|1000|mm|in}} per year, on the slopes of the Sierra de Gredos and the [[Serran\u00eda de Cuenca]], as the rain in Spain does not fall mainly in the plains. The greater part of the region has less than {{convert|600|mm|in}} of rain annually. The driest part of the region is along the Albacete-[[Hell\u00edn]] axis, with less than {{convert|360|mm|in}} per year.\n\n== Demography ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]]\n|1857| 1203248\n|1887| 1325744\n|1900| 1394670\n|1910| 1550093\n|1920| 1674207\n|1930| 1849999\n|1940| 1921849\n|1950| 2030598\n|1960| 2015262\n|1970| 1732696\n|1981| 1648634\n|1991| 1658446\n|2001| 1760516\n|2011| 2106331\n|2017| 2040379\n}}\n\n[[File:Densidad de poblacion C-LM.svg|thumb|left|Municipal population density in Castilla\u2013La Mancha (2008): {{legend|#FFD5D5|0\u20139.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FFAAAA|10\u201319.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF8080|20\u201329.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF5555|30\u201339.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF2A2A|40\u201349.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF0000|50\u201359.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#D40000|60\u201369.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#AA0000|70\u201379.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#800000|80\u201389.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#550000|90\u201399.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#2B0000|100+ inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}]]\n[[File:Edad y sexo Castilla-La Mancha.jpg|thumb|right|Composition of the population of Castilla\u2013La Mancha by age and sex.]]\n\n===Number of inhabitants===\nAccording to the official 11 January 2008 data of the [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]] Castilla\u2013La Mancha has 2,043,100 inhabitants in its five provinces. Despite being the third largest of Spains communities by surface area (after Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Andalusia), it is only the ninth most populous.

The population between 16 and 44 years of age represents about 44 percent, from 45 to 64 about 21.3 percent, with those 15 and under constituting 15 percent and those over 65, 18 percent. These data show the progressive aging of the ''castellanomanchego'' population.\n\nThe region has about 9,000 more males than females; in percentage terms, 50.25 percent versus 49.75 percent. This is opposite to Spain as a whole, where women constitute 50.57 percent of the population.\n\n===Birth rate, death rate, life expectancy===\nAccording to 2006 INE numbers, the [[birth rate]] in Castilla\u2013La Mancha is 10.21 per thousand inhabitants, lower than the national average of 10.92 per thousand. The [[death rate]] is 8.83 per thousand inhabitants, higher than the national average of 8.42 per thousand.\n\n[[Life expectancy]] at birth is one of the highest in Spain: 83.67 years for women and 77.99 years for men.\n<!--{| style=background:#eeeeaa align=center\n!

The C-3 to [[Aranjuez]] used to stop at [[Sese\u00f1a]], but service to that station was discontinued in April 2007.\n\n==== Airports ====\nAs of 2009, Castilla\u2013La Mancha had two airports.\n\nThe [[Albacete Airport]] is {{convert|4|km|mi}} south of Albacete, connected by the CM-3203 highway. It has been a civilian airport since July 1, 2003, sharing facilities with the military airbase of Los Llanos. The [[Ciudad Real Central Airport]] is located between Ciudad Real and Puertollano and is Spain's largest private airport. Located adjacent to the A-43 highway (Autov\u00eda Extremadura-Comunidad Valenciana) and a short distance from the AP-41 toll highway (Autov\u00eda Ciudad Real\u2013Puertollano)\n\nResidents of some [[Madrid]] exurbs have easy access to [[Barajas Airport]] in northeast Madrid, as well.\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Castilla\u2013La Mancha continues to be dominated by [[agriculture]] and the raising of [[livestock]], but industry is continually more present, including the processing of agricultural goods. In recent years, tourism has been increasingly important, with the growth of [[agritourism]] in the form of ''casas rurales'', and the establishment of the ''Ruta de Don Quijote'', a campaign of tourism to the locations mentioned in Cervantes novel.\n\n===Economic data===\n\n====Gross domestic product====\n[[File:Crecimientopibclm.jpg|left|thumb|Annual national and regional GDP growth, 2000\u201306]]\n[[File:Estructurapa.jpg|left|thumb|Distribution of employment by sectors, 2006]]\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha generates a [[GDP]] of \u20ac33,077,484,000, 3.4 percent of the Spanish GDP, placing it ninth among the 19 Spanish autonomous communities. GDP has been roughly 3.4 percent of the national GDP since at least 2000. A [[per capita GDP]] of \u20ac17,339 places Castilla\u2013La Mancha 17th among the 19 communities, with only Andalusia and Extremadura having lower per capita GDP; the national average is \u20ac22,152. Nonetheless, in the early to mid-1990s, [[Sonseca]] in the province of Toledo several times had the highest per capita income in Spain.\n\nIn 2005 the Manchego GDP broke down by productive sectors as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=Consejo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Castilla-La Mancha (Producci\u00f3n y sectores productivos) |url=http://www.jccm.es/ces/pdf/ise%202005%201_3.pdf |access-date=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023175206/http://www.jccm.es/ces/pdf/ise%202005%201_3.pdf# |archive-date=23 October 2006 |work=Consejo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Castilla-La Mancha |publisher=Junta de Castilla-La Mancha |language=es}}</ref>\n\n** '''Agriculture''' 11.64%\n** '''Industry''' 14.95%\n** '''Energy''' 3.44%\n** '''Construction''' 10.06%\n** '''Services''' 49.78%\n\n====Work force====\nAccording to the statistics of the INE's Encuesta de Poblaci\u00f3n Activa for the first trimester of 2007, the active work force of Castilla\u2013La Mancha numbered 896,513 persons, of whom 827,113 were employed and 69,900 unemployed, giving a workforce density of 55.5 percent of the population and an unemployment rate of 7.68 percent.\n\n===Economic sectors===\nAs noted [[#Gross domestic product|above]], for statistical purposes the economy of Castilla\u2013La Mancha is divided into agriculture (including livestock husbandry), industry (including agro-industry), energy, construction, and services (including tourism).\n\n=== Agriculture and husbandry ===\n[[File:Vineyard Ciudad Real.jpg|thumb|right|Vineyard in Ciudad Real.]]\n[[File:Meseta herd.jpg|thumb|right|Sheep grazing on the ''meseta''.]]\n\nAgriculture and husbandry, still the foundation of the local economy, constitutes 11.64 percent of regional GDP, and employs 9.9 percent of the active workforce.\n\nFifty-two percent of the soil of Castilla\u2013La Mancha is considered \"dry\". Agricultural activities have historically been based on the cultivation of [[wheat]] (37 percent), [[grape]]s (17.2 percent) and [[olive]]s (6.6 percent). Castilla\u2013La Mancha has some of the most extensive vineyards in Europe, nearly {{convert|700000|ha|acre}}. The vineyards are predominantly, but by no means exclusively, in the west and southwest of La Mancha. In 2005 the region produced {{convert|3074462|MT|ST}} of grapes, constituting 53.40 percent of Spain's national production. After grapes, the next most important agricultural product is [[barley]], {{convert|2272007|MT|ST}}, 25 percent of the national total.\n\nIn terms of agricultural productivity and income, since Spain's incorporation into the [[European Union]] (EU) the [[primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] of the regional economy has evolved dynamically. Among the reasons for this are growth rates higher than the national average, as well as increased capitalization fostering specialization and modernization, including the integration an externalization of the sector, whereby activities previously performed on the farm are now performed elsewhere. These changes have been fostered by the regional articulation of the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. Since 1986, subsidies have played a significant role in this sector.\n\n[[Animal husbandry]] plays a lesser, but not negiglible, role in the regional economy. 2005 statistics show 3,430,501 head of sheep, 1,602,576 pigs, 405,778 goats and 309,672 cattle; these last produce {{convert|224692000|l|sp=us|USgal}} of milk each year. [[Apiculture]] (bee-keeping) is also important, with 180,000 hives.\n\n=== Industry and construction ===\n[[File:PuertollanoEmpetrol.jpg|thumb|right|Partial view of the petrochemical complex at [[Puertollano]].]]\n\nTraditionally, Castilla\u2013La Mancha has had little industrial production, due to several factors among which are low population density and a shortage of qualified workers. However, since Spain's incorporation into the EU, there has been much progress. Industry has been growing as a sector of the regional economy at a faster pace than nationally. July 2006 figures show the region as third among the autonomous communities in the rate of growth of the industrial sector. Regional industrial GDP grew 2.8 percent in 2000\u20132005, compared to 1 percent nationally for the same period.\n\nThe greatest obstacles to industrial growth in the region have been:<ref>{{cite web |title=Pacto por el Desarrollo y la Competitividad en Castilla-La Mancha |url=http://www.aprodel.org/pdf/Pacto%20por%20el%20Desarrollo%20y%20la%20Competitividad.pdf |access-date=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121914/http://www.aprodel.org/pdf/Pacto%20por%20el%20Desarrollo%20y%20la%20Competitividad.pdf |archive-date=28 September 2007 |language=es |work=Asociaci\u00f3n de Profesionales para el Desarrollo Local y la Promoci\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica}}</ref>\n\n* Lack of a dense business fabric.\n* Undersized industrial enterprises.\n* Little specialization of labor.\n* Little investment in [[R & D]].\n* Poor infrastructure with respect to services to enterprises.\n* Little export orientation.\n* Inadequate marketing channels and distribution for regional products.\n\nThe principal industrial areas within the region are [[Sonseca]] and its comarca, the [[Henares Corridor]], [[Puertollano]], [[Talavera de la Reina]], [[La Sagra (Toledo)|La Sagra]] y [[Almansa]], as well as all of the provincial capitals.\n\nAs throughout Spain in recent decades, the construction sector is one of the strongest. It employs 15.6 percent of the work force and produces 10.06 percent of regional GDP. It is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy: growth in 2006 was 13.6 percent. Most of the construction sector, is housing, including a new city of 30,000 inhabitants, [[Ciudad Valdeluz]] in [[Yebes]], Guadalajara; 13,000 dwellings in [[Sese\u00f1a]], Toledo and the [[Reino de Don Quijote]] complex in the province of Ciudad Real, with 9,000 dwellings and 4,000 hotel beds.\n\n=== Energy ===\nAlthough [[wind energy]] and [[solar energy]] have been playing increasingly important roles in Castilla\u2013La Mancha, the majority of the energy generated in the region comes from the region's large [[thermal power station]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" style=\"background:#ffffff\" class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+ align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Thermal power stations in Castilla\u2013La Mancha\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"| Nombre !! style=\"background:#efefef;\"| Locale !! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=350 px| Province !! style=\"background:#efefef;\"| Proprietor\n|-\n| [[Elcogas Thermal Power Station]]||Puertollano ||Ciudad Real||[[Elcogas]]<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://boletines.secv.es/upload/20070112121117.45%5B1%5D28-32.pdf |title=Las escorias de la central t\u00e9rmica GICC ELCOGAS como materia prima para la s\u00edntesis de materiales vitrocer\u00e1micos.

Comprising the provinces of [[Province of Albacete|Albacete]], [[Province of Ciudad Real|Ciudad Real]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], [[Province of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] and [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]], it was created in 1982. It is bordered by [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]], [[Aragon]], [[Valencian community|Valencia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], [[Andalusia]], and [[Extremadura]]. It is one of the most sparsely populated of Spain's regions. [[Albacete]] is the largest and most populous city. The Government headquarters are in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and the [[High Court of Justice of Castile-La Mancha|High Court]] headquarters are in [[Albacete]].\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha was formerly grouped with the [[Provinces of Spain|province]] of Madrid into [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] (''Castilla la Nueva''), but with the advent of the modern Spanish system of autonomous communities (''Estado de las autonom\u00edas''), it was separated due to great demographic disparity between the capital and the remaining New-Castilian provinces. Also, distinct from the former New Castile, Castilla\u2013La Mancha added the province of [[Albacete (province)|Albacete]], which had been part of [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]; adding Albacete placed all of the historic region of [[La Mancha]] within this single region.\n\nIt is mostly in this region where the story of the famous Spanish novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] is situated, due to which La Mancha is internationally well-known.  Although La Mancha is a windswept, battered plateau, it remains a symbol of Spanish culture with its vineyards, sunflowers, mushrooms, olive plantations, windmills, [[Manchego cheese]], and ''Don Quixote''.\n\n==History==\nThe origins of Castilla\u2013La Mancha lay in the Muslim period between the 8th and 14th century. Castilla\u2013La Mancha was the region of many historical battles between Christian crusaders and Muslim forces during the period from 1000 to the 13th century. It was also the region where the [[Crown of Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] were unified in 1492 under [[Catholic Monarchs|Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand]].\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha is the successor to [[New Castile (Spain)|New Castile]] (''Castilla la Nueva''), which in turn traces back to the [[Muslim]] [[Taifa of Toledo]], one of the ''[[taifa]]s'' of [[Al Andalus]]. [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]] conquered the region from the Muslims, taking [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085. The ''[[Reconquista]]'' (\"Reconquest\") took [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]] in 1177. Other provinces to the south\u2014the [[Campo de Calatrava]], the Valle de Alcudia, and the Alfoz de Alcaraz ([[Campo de Montiel (Ciudad Real)|Campo de Montiel]] and [[Sierra de Alcaraz]])\u2014were consolidated during the reign of [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]] (reigned 1158\u20131214), whose conquests were completed by the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212). That victory assured Castilian domination of the region and hastened the decline of the [[Almohad Dynasty]]. From the time of the ''Reconquista'', Castilla\u2013La Mancha formed part of the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Four centuries later, in 1605, Cervantes' ''Don Quixote'' gave the world an indelible picture of [[La Mancha]].\n\nIn 1785, the territorial organization by the reformer [[Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Floridablanca]] divided the region into the provinces of Cuenca, Guadalajara, Madrid, La Mancha, and Toledo. Albacete, [[Chinchilla de Monte-Arag\u00f3n|Chinchilla]], [[Almansa]], [[Hell\u00edn]] and [[Yeste, Albacete|Yeste]], however, became part of Murcia. In 1833 [[Javier de Burgos]] [[1833 territorial division of Spain|modified the provincial borders]]; most of the province of La Mancha was transferred to the province of Ciudad Real, with smaller parts incorporated into the provinces of Cuenca, Toledo and the newly created province of Albacete. Albacete, in turn, also incorporated parts of the territories of the old provinces of Cuenca and Murcia. Albacete was administered as part of the Region of Murcia until the 1978 configuration of autonomous regions. Nonetheless, during the [[First Spanish Republic]], Albacete was one of the signatories to the Pacto Federal Castellano (1869) and in 1924 its deputation favored the formation of a \"Comunidad Manchega\" that would have recognized La Mancha (including Albacete) as a region.\n[[File:Women at the Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar in Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Two women and a man at the Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar in Toledo]]\nThe autonomous community of Castilla\u2013La Mancha dates from 15 November 1978 as one of the many autonomous regions defined by the Spanish central government. (More precisely, each of these regions was initially a ''preautonom\u00eda'', a \"pre-autonomous\" region, until establishing its [[Statute of Autonomy]]). The new, hyphenated name constituted an effort to bridge two distinct regionalisms: that of the larger Castilla (extending beyond this autonomous region) and that of the smaller onetime province of [[La Mancha]]. The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla\u2013La Mancha was approved August 10, 1982 and took effect August 17, 1982.<ref>The statute is L.O. [ley org\u00e1nica, \"organic law\"] 9/1982</ref>\n\n==Regional divisions==\n[[File:Toledo Skyline Panorama, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|right|277px|The Old City of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] was declared a World Heritage Site for its extensive cultural and monumental heritage.

The municipalities in the north are small and numerous, while in the south they are larger and fewer. This reflects different histories of how these sub-regions were repopulated during the ''Reconquista''.\n\nThe 25 most populous municipalities of Castilla\u2013La Mancha as at 2017, according to the INE, are:\n[[File:Molinos de Consuegra.jpg|thumb|right|227px|Group of [[windmill|old windmill]]s at [[Consuegra]] in Castilla\u2013La Mancha.]]\n{| class=\"toc\" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=63% style=\"float:center; text-align:center;clear:all; margin-right:8px; font-size:90%;\"\n!bgcolor=black colspan=8 style=\"color:white;\"|Most populous municipalities of Castilla\u2013La Mancha\n|-bgcolor=#efefef\n!width=4% |Rank\n!width=45% |Municipality\n!width=40% |Province\n!width=11% |Population\n|-\n|1||align=left|'''[[Albacete]]'''||align=center|''Albacete''||align=right|172,816\n|-\n|2||align=left|'''[[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]]'''||align=center|''Guadalajara''||align=right|84,145\n|-\n|3||align=left|'''[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]'''||align=center|''Toledo''||align=right|83,741\n|-\n|4||align=left|'''[[Talavera de la Reina]]'''||align=center|''Toledo''||align=right|83,303\n|-\n|5||align=left|'''[[Ciudad Real]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|74,641\n|-\n|6||align=left|'''[[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]]'''||align=center|''Cuenca''||align=right|54,876\n|-\n|7||align=left|'''[[Puertollano]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|48,477\n|-\n|8|| align=left|'''[[Tomelloso]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|36,281\n|-\n|9|| align=left|'''[[Azuqueca de Henares]]'''||align=center|''Guadalajara''||align=right|34,768\n|-\n|10|| align=left|'''[[Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|30,943\n|-\n|11|| align=left|'''[[Valdepe\u00f1as]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|30,224\n|-\n|12|| align=left|'''[[Hell\u00edn]]'''||align=center|''Albacete''||align=right|30,184\n|-\n|13|| align=left|'''[[Illescas, Toledo|Illescas]]'''||align=center|''Toledo''||align=right|27,332\n|-\n|14|| align=left|'''[[Villarrobledo]]'''||align=center|''Albacete''||align=right|25,317\n|-\n|15|| align=left|'''[[Almansa]]'''||align=center|''Albacete''||align=right|24,566\n|-\n|16|| align=left|'''[[Sese\u00f1a]]'''||align=center|''Toledo''||align=right|22,992\n|-\n|17|| align=left|'''[[Manzanares, Ciudad Real|Manzanares]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|18,206\n|-\n|18|| align=left|'''[[Daimiel]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|18,176\n|-\n|19|| align=left|'''[[La Solana]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|15,640\n|-\n|20|| align=left|'''[[La Roda]]'''||align=center|''Albacete''||align=right|15,603\n|-\n|21|| align=left|'''[[Miguelturra]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|15,225\n|-\n|22|| align=left|'''[[Taranc\u00f3n]]'''||align=center|''Cuenca''||align=right|14,834\n|-\n|23|| align=left|'''[[Campo de Criptana]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|13,763\n|-\n|24|| align=left|'''[[Torrijos, Spain|Torrijos]]'''||align=center|''Toledo''||align=right|13,295\n|-\n|25|| align=left|'''[[Socu\u00e9llamos]]'''||align=center|''Ciudad Real''||align=right|12,342\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Comarcas ===\nAlthough the Statute of Autonomy allows for [[comarca]]s of political/juridical significance, this has never been followed through at the level of the entire region, and there are no comarcas in Castilla\u2013La Mancha with political or juridical functions.

Among the proposed anthems have been the \"Canci\u00f3n del Sembrador\" (\"Song of the Sower\") from the [[zarzuela]] ''La rosa del azafr\u00e1n'' by [[Jacinto Guerrero]], the \"Canto a la Mancha\" (\"Song of La Mancha\") by Tom\u00e1s Barrera, and many others, such as one presented by a group of citizens from [[Villarrobledo]] with the title \"Patria sin fin\" (\"Fatherland without end\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Himno de Castilla-La Mancha |url=http://webs.ono.com/federnes/himnoman.htm |access-date=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023163848/http://webs.ono.com/federnes/himnoman.htm |archive-date=23 October 2008 |language=es |date=2 February 2001 |first=Federico J. |last=Garc\u00eda Mariana |work=Proyecto de himno oficial para CASTILLA-LA MANCHA}}</ref>\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\nArticle 8 of the Statute of Autonomy states that the powers of the region are exercised through the Junta of Communities of Castilla\u2013La Mancha (''Junta de Comunidades de Castilla\u2013La Mancha''). Organs of the Junta are the [[Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha]], the President of the Junta and the Council of Government.\n\n=== Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha ===\n{{main|Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha}}\n[[File:Primera jornada del Debate de Investidura en las Cortes de Castilla-La Mancha (19105931029).jpg|thumb|Plenary chamber of the Cortes]]\nThe Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha represent the [[popular sovereignty|popular will]] through 33 deputies elected by [[universal adult suffrage]] through the [[secret ballot]]. They are elected for a term of four years under a [[proportional representation|proportional]] system intended to guarantee representation to the various territorial zones of Castilla\u2013La Mancha. The electoral [[constituency]] is at the level of each [[province]], with provinces being assigned the following number of deputies as of 2009: Albacete, 6; Ciudad Real, 8; Cuenca, 5; Guadalajara, 5; and Toledo, 9. Article 10 of the Statute of Autonomy states that elections will be convoked by the President of the Junta of Communities, following the General Electoral Regime (''R\u00e9gimen Electoral General''), on the fourth Sunday in May every four years. This stands in contrast to the autonomous communities of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Andalusia]] and the [[Valencian Community]]  where the president has the power to convoke elections at any time. (In the Valencian Community that power has never been exercised. Elections there have, in practice, taken place on a four-year cycle.)\n\nSince the [[Castile-La Mancha parliamentary election, 2015|Spanish regional elections of 2015]], the Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha has consisted of 16 deputies from the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], 15 from the socialist [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] and 2 from the left-wing [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]]. The Cortes sits in the former [[Franciscan]] convent in Toledo, the ''Edificio de San Gil'' (\"San Gil building\").\n\n=== Council of Government ===\nThe Council of Government is the collegial executive organ of the region. It directs regional political and administrative action, exercises an executive function and regulatory powers under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], the Statute of Autonomy, and the laws of the nation and region. The Council of Government consists of the president, vice presidents (if any) and the Councilors.\n\n=== President of the Junta ===\nThe President of the Junta directs the Council of Government and coordinates the functions of its members. The president is elected by the Cortes from among its members, then formally named by the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarch of Spain]].

The Submeseta Sur (and the autonomous community) is separated from the Submeseta Norte (and the community of [[Castilla y Le\u00f3n]]) by the mountain range known as the [[Sistema Central]]. Despite this, the region has no shortage of mountain landscapes: the southern slopes of the aforementioned Sistema Central in the north, the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico]] in the northeast, and the [[Sierra Morena]] and [[Montes de Toledo]] in the south.\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha is the third largest of Spain's autonomous regions, with a surface area of {{convert|79463|km2|sqmi}}, representing 15.7 percent of Spain's national territory.\n\n=== Terrain ===\n[[File:LA MANCHA CONSUEGRA.jpg|thumb|left|The Manchegan plain in [[Consuegra]] ([[Province of Toledo|Toledo]]).]]\n[[File:09042009 164759 CEC 0091 - WLE Spain 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Natural land formations in [[Ciudad Encantada]].]]\nThe region has two distinct types of terrain. The Meseta is a vast, uniform plain with little relief. Within that uniformity, the most outstanding variation in altitude is that of the [[Montes de Toledo]], with peaks such as [[La Villuerca]] ({{convert|1601|m|sp=us|ft}}), the highest peak of the Montes de Toledo range, and [[Rocigalgo]] ({{convert|1447|m|sp=us|ft}}). \nAt the south of that system are the Montes de Toledo, which cross the region from west to east, dividing the [[Tagus]] (''Tajo'') and [[Guadiana]] [[drainage basin]]s, forming the southern slope of the basin of the former and the northern slope of the latter.\n\nIn contrast, a more mountainous zone surrounds the Meseta and serves as the region's natural border. In the north of the [[Province of Guadalajara]], bordering Madrid and [[Segovia]], is a mountain range forming part of the [[Sistema Central]], among which can be distinguished the mountain ranges Pela, Ayll\u00f3n, Somosierra, Barahona and Ministra, with the headwaters of the rivers [[Jarama]], [[Ca\u00f1amares (river)|Ca\u00f1amares]] and [[Henares]]. The Sistema Central also penetrates the Province of Toledo, which intersects a southerly part of the [[Sierra de Gredos]], known as the [[Sierra de San Vicente]], delimited on the north by the [[river Ti\u00e9tar]] and on the south by the [[Alberche]] and the Tagus.\n\nOn the northwest is the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico]], where there is important fluvial and especially [[karst]]ic activity, which has given rise to such landscapes as the [[Ciudad Encantada]], the [[Callejones de Las Majadas]] and the [[Hoces del Cabriel]].\n\nIn the southeast is the ridge of the Sierra Morena, the southern border of the Meseta Central and the region's border with [[Andalusia]]. Within the Sierra Morena, distinction can be made between the [[Sierra Madrona]], [[Sierra de Alcudia]] and [[Sierra de San Andr\u00e9s]]. At the other southern extreme of Castilla\u2013La Mancha, the [[Sierra de Alcaraz]] and [[Sierra del Segura]] form part of the [[Sistema B\u00e9tico]].\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n{{see also|Tagus|Guadiana|Guadalquivir|J\u00facar|Segura}}\n[[File:El J\u00facar atravesando Cuenca.jpg|thumb|right|The [[J\u00facar]] passing through Cuenca.]]\n\nThe territory of Castilla\u2013La Mancha is divided into five principal [[drainage divide|watershed]]s.

The continentalized Mediterranean climate is similar to a [[typical Mediterranean climate]], but with more extreme temperatures typical of a continental climate. Lack of a marine influence leads to much more extreme temperatures: hotter summers and quite cold winters, with a daily oscillation of 18.5&nbsp;\u00b0C (33.3&nbsp;\u00b0F).  Summer is the driest season, with temperatures often exceeding {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, sometimes reaching and exceeding {{convert|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. In winter, temperatures often drop below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, producing frosts on clear nights, and occasional snow on cloudy nights.\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha is part of what has traditionally been called ''Espa\u00f1a Seca'' (\"Dry Spain\"). It receives relatively little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], much as in a typical Mediterranean climate. Precipitation presents a notable gradient from the center of the region, where it does not surpass {{convert|400|mm|in}} per year, to the mountains where it can exceed {{convert|1000|mm|in}} per year, on the slopes of the Sierra de Gredos and the [[Serran\u00eda de Cuenca]], as the rain in Spain does not fall mainly in the plains. The greater part of the region has less than {{convert|600|mm|in}} of rain annually. The driest part of the region is along the Albacete-[[Hell\u00edn]] axis, with less than {{convert|360|mm|in}} per year.\n\n== Demography ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]]\n|1857| 1203248\n|1887| 1325744\n|1900| 1394670\n|1910| 1550093\n|1920| 1674207\n|1930| 1849999\n|1940| 1921849\n|1950| 2030598\n|1960| 2015262\n|1970| 1732696\n|1981| 1648634\n|1991| 1658446\n|2001| 1760516\n|2011| 2106331\n|2017| 2040379\n}}\n\n[[File:Densidad de poblacion C-LM.svg|thumb|left|Municipal population density in Castilla\u2013La Mancha (2008): {{legend|#FFD5D5|0\u20139.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FFAAAA|10\u201319.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF8080|20\u201329.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF5555|30\u201339.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF2A2A|40\u201349.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#FF0000|50\u201359.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#D40000|60\u201369.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#AA0000|70\u201379.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#800000|80\u201389.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#550000|90\u201399.99 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}{{legend|#2B0000|100+ inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>}}]]\n[[File:Edad y sexo Castilla-La Mancha.jpg|thumb|right|Composition of the population of Castilla\u2013La Mancha by age and sex.]]\n\n===Number of inhabitants===\nAccording to the official 11 January 2008 data of the [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]] Castilla\u2013La Mancha has 2,043,100 inhabitants in its five provinces. Despite being the third largest of Spains communities by surface area (after Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Andalusia), it is only the ninth most populous.

The population between 16 and 44 years of age represents about 44 percent, from 45 to 64 about 21.3 percent, with those 15 and under constituting 15 percent and those over 65, 18 percent. These data show the progressive aging of the ''castellanomanchego'' population.\n\nThe region has about 9,000 more males than females; in percentage terms, 50.25 percent versus 49.75 percent. This is opposite to Spain as a whole, where women constitute 50.57 percent of the population.\n\n===Birth rate, death rate, life expectancy===\nAccording to 2006 INE numbers, the [[birth rate]] in Castilla\u2013La Mancha is 10.21 per thousand inhabitants, lower than the national average of 10.92 per thousand. The [[death rate]] is 8.83 per thousand inhabitants, higher than the national average of 8.42 per thousand.\n\n[[Life expectancy]] at birth is one of the highest in Spain: 83.67 years for women and 77.99 years for men.\n<!--{| style=background:#eeeeaa align=center\n!

The C-3 to [[Aranjuez]] used to stop at [[Sese\u00f1a]], but service to that station was discontinued in April 2007.\n\n==== Airports ====\nAs of 2009, Castilla\u2013La Mancha had two airports.\n\nThe [[Albacete Airport]] is {{convert|4|km|mi}} south of Albacete, connected by the CM-3203 highway. It has been a civilian airport since July 1, 2003, sharing facilities with the military airbase of Los Llanos. The [[Ciudad Real Central Airport]] is located between Ciudad Real and Puertollano and is Spain's largest private airport. Located adjacent to the A-43 highway (Autov\u00eda Extremadura-Comunidad Valenciana) and a short distance from the AP-41 toll highway (Autov\u00eda Ciudad Real\u2013Puertollano)\n\nResidents of some [[Madrid]] exurbs have easy access to [[Barajas Airport]] in northeast Madrid, as well.\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Castilla\u2013La Mancha continues to be dominated by [[agriculture]] and the raising of [[livestock]], but industry is continually more present, including the processing of agricultural goods. In recent years, tourism has been increasingly important, with the growth of [[agritourism]] in the form of ''casas rurales'', and the establishment of the ''Ruta de Don Quijote'', a campaign of tourism to the locations mentioned in Cervantes novel.\n\n===Economic data===\n\n====Gross domestic product====\n[[File:Crecimientopibclm.jpg|left|thumb|Annual national and regional GDP growth, 2000\u201306]]\n[[File:Estructurapa.jpg|left|thumb|Distribution of employment by sectors, 2006]]\n\nCastilla\u2013La Mancha generates a [[GDP]] of \u20ac33,077,484,000, 3.4 percent of the Spanish GDP, placing it ninth among the 19 Spanish autonomous communities. GDP has been roughly 3.4 percent of the national GDP since at least 2000. A [[per capita GDP]] of \u20ac17,339 places Castilla\u2013La Mancha 17th among the 19 communities, with only Andalusia and Extremadura having lower per capita GDP; the national average is \u20ac22,152. Nonetheless, in the early to mid-1990s, [[Sonseca]] in the province of Toledo several times had the highest per capita income in Spain.\n\nIn 2005 the Manchego GDP broke down by productive sectors as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=Consejo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Castilla-La Mancha (Producci\u00f3n y sectores productivos) |url=http://www.jccm.es/ces/pdf/ise%202005%201_3.pdf |access-date=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023175206/http://www.jccm.es/ces/pdf/ise%202005%201_3.pdf# |archive-date=23 October 2006 |work=Consejo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Castilla-La Mancha |publisher=Junta de Castilla-La Mancha |language=es}}</ref>\n\n** '''Agriculture''' 11.64%\n** '''Industry''' 14.95%\n** '''Energy''' 3.44%\n** '''Construction''' 10.06%\n** '''Services''' 49.78%\n\n====Work force====\nAccording to the statistics of the INE's Encuesta de Poblaci\u00f3n Activa for the first trimester of 2007, the active work force of Castilla\u2013La Mancha numbered 896,513 persons, of whom 827,113 were employed and 69,900 unemployed, giving a workforce density of 55.5 percent of the population and an unemployment rate of 7.68 percent.\n\n===Economic sectors===\nAs noted [[#Gross domestic product|above]], for statistical purposes the economy of Castilla\u2013La Mancha is divided into agriculture (including livestock husbandry), industry (including agro-industry), energy, construction, and services (including tourism).\n\n=== Agriculture and husbandry ===\n[[File:Vineyard Ciudad Real.jpg|thumb|right|Vineyard in Ciudad Real.]]\n[[File:Meseta herd.jpg|thumb|right|Sheep grazing on the ''meseta''.]]\n\nAgriculture and husbandry, still the foundation of the local economy, constitutes 11.64 percent of regional GDP, and employs 9.9 percent of the active workforce.\n\nFifty-two percent of the soil of Castilla\u2013La Mancha is considered \"dry\". Agricultural activities have historically been based on the cultivation of [[wheat]] (37 percent), [[grape]]s (17.2 percent) and [[olive]]s (6.6 percent). Castilla\u2013La Mancha has some of the most extensive vineyards in Europe, nearly {{convert|700000|ha|acre}}. The vineyards are predominantly, but by no means exclusively, in the west and southwest of La Mancha. In 2005 the region produced {{convert|3074462|MT|ST}} of grapes, constituting 53.40 percent of Spain's national production. After grapes, the next most important agricultural product is [[barley]], {{convert|2272007|MT|ST}}, 25 percent of the national total.\n\nIn terms of agricultural productivity and income, since Spain's incorporation into the [[European Union]] (EU) the [[primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] of the regional economy has evolved dynamically. Among the reasons for this are growth rates higher than the national average, as well as increased capitalization fostering specialization and modernization, including the integration an externalization of the sector, whereby activities previously performed on the farm are now performed elsewhere. These changes have been fostered by the regional articulation of the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. Since 1986, subsidies have played a significant role in this sector.\n\n[[Animal husbandry]] plays a lesser, but not negiglible, role in the regional economy. 2005 statistics show 3,430,501 head of sheep, 1,602,576 pigs, 405,778 goats and 309,672 cattle; these last produce {{convert|224692000|l|sp=us|USgal}} of milk each year. [[Apiculture]] (bee-keeping) is also important, with 180,000 hives.\n\n=== Industry and construction ===\n[[File:PuertollanoEmpetrol.jpg|thumb|right|Partial view of the petrochemical complex at [[Puertollano]].]]\n\nTraditionally, Castilla\u2013La Mancha has had little industrial production, due to several factors among which are low population density and a shortage of qualified workers. However, since Spain's incorporation into the EU, there has been much progress. Industry has been growing as a sector of the regional economy at a faster pace than nationally. July 2006 figures show the region as third among the autonomous communities in the rate of growth of the industrial sector. Regional industrial GDP grew 2.8 percent in 2000\u20132005, compared to 1 percent nationally for the same period.\n\nThe greatest obstacles to industrial growth in the region have been:<ref>{{cite web |title=Pacto por el Desarrollo y la Competitividad en Castilla-La Mancha |url=http://www.aprodel.org/pdf/Pacto%20por%20el%20Desarrollo%20y%20la%20Competitividad.pdf |access-date=12 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121914/http://www.aprodel.org/pdf/Pacto%20por%20el%20Desarrollo%20y%20la%20Competitividad.pdf |archive-date=28 September 2007 |language=es |work=Asociaci\u00f3n de Profesionales para el Desarrollo Local y la Promoci\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica}}</ref>\n\n* Lack of a dense business fabric.\n* Undersized industrial enterprises.\n* Little specialization of labor.\n* Little investment in [[R & D]].\n* Poor infrastructure with respect to services to enterprises.\n* Little export orientation.\n* Inadequate marketing channels and distribution for regional products.\n\nThe principal industrial areas within the region are [[Sonseca]] and its comarca, the [[Henares Corridor]], [[Puertollano]], [[Talavera de la Reina]], [[La Sagra (Toledo)|La Sagra]] y [[Almansa]], as well as all of the provincial capitals.\n\nAs throughout Spain in recent decades, the construction sector is one of the strongest. It employs 15.6 percent of the work force and produces 10.06 percent of regional GDP. It is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy: growth in 2006 was 13.6 percent. Most of the construction sector, is housing, including a new city of 30,000 inhabitants, [[Ciudad Valdeluz]] in [[Yebes]], Guadalajara; 13,000 dwellings in [[Sese\u00f1a]], Toledo and the [[Reino de Don Quijote]] complex in the province of Ciudad Real, with 9,000 dwellings and 4,000 hotel beds.\n\n=== Energy ===\nAlthough [[wind energy]] and [[solar energy]] have been playing increasingly important roles in Castilla\u2013La Mancha, the majority of the energy generated in the region comes from the region's large [[thermal power station]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" style=\"background:#ffffff\" class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+ align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Thermal power stations in Castilla\u2013La Mancha\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"| Nombre !! style=\"background:#efefef;\"| Locale !! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=350 px| Province !! style=\"background:#efefef;\"| Proprietor\n|-\n| [[Elcogas Thermal Power Station]]||Puertollano ||Ciudad Real||[[Elcogas]]<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://boletines.secv.es/upload/20070112121117.45%5B1%5D28-32.pdf |title=Las escorias de la central t\u00e9rmica GICC ELCOGAS como materia prima para la s\u00edntesis de materiales vitrocer\u00e1micos.

The typical CEO is not anticipating many years of income stream since the usual executive contract is only three years. Furthermore, only 2 percent of firms in the S&P 500 reduce any part of the severance package once the executive finds another employer. And if employers are worried about coaxing risk-averse potential employees, why are executives the only ones provided with this treatment? \"Given executives' accumulated wealth and generous retirement benefits they commonly receive after leaving the firm, they are likely to be, if anything, less risk-averse and better able to insure themselves than most other employees.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.134</ref>\n\n====Gratuitous payments====\nAnother practice essentially unknown among non-executive employees is the granting of payments or benefits to executives above and beyond what is in their contract when they quit, are fired, or agree to have their companies bought out.<ref name=\"Fried, 2004 p.87\">Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.87</ref> These are known as \"gratuitous\" payments.\n\nThey may \"include forgiveness of loans, accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock, increases in pension benefits (for example by 'crediting' CEOs with additional years of service), awards of lump-sum cash payments, and promises\" of the previously mentioned consulting contracts.<ref name=\"Fried, 2004 p.87\"/>\n\n====Perks====\nAs part of their retirement, top executives have often been given in-kind benefits or \"perks\" (perquisites). These have included use of corporate jets (sometimes for family and guests as well), chauffeured cars, personal assistants, financial planning, home-security systems, club memberships, sports tickets, office space, secretarial help, and cell phone service.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.107</ref> Unremarked upon when they are used on the job, perks are more controversial in retirement.\n\nPerks lack the flexibility of cash for the beneficiary. For example, if the retired executive thinks $10,000 worth of a perk such as private jet travel is the best way to spend $10,000, then $10,000 in cash and $10,000 in perk have the same value; however, if there are any possible circumstance in which they would prefer spending some or all of the money on something else, then cash is better.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.108</ref>\n\nAlso, rather than being a fixed asset whose use costs a corporation less than its worth, perks often cost more than they might first appear.\n<blockquote>Consider retiree use of corporate jets, now a common perk. Although the marginal cost of allowing a retired executive to use the company jet may appear limited, it can run quite high. Consider the use of a company plane for a flight from New York to California and then back several days later. Because the New York-based aircraft and flight crew will return to the East Coast after dropping the retired exec off, the actual charge to the company is two round trips: a total of eight takeoffs and landings and approximately 20 hours of flying time, most likely costing\u2014from fuel, maintenance, landing fees, extra pilot and crew fees and incidentals, and depreciation (an aircraft\u2019s operating life is reduced for every hour it flies and more important, for every takeoff and landing)\u2014at least $50,000.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004),[47.] p.108</ref></blockquote>\n\nLike other \"separation pay\", perks do have the advantage of not having to be reported to shareholders or the SEC in dollar value.\n\n====Consulting contracts====\nAs of 2002, about one quarter of CEOs negotiated a post-retirement ''consulting'' relationship with their old firm<ref>[48] Ira Kay, cited in [https://www.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-04-25-ceo-consulting-gigs.htm 04/24/2002 CEOs cash in after tenure] by Gary Strauss, USA Today</ref><ref>Bebchuck p.109</ref> despite the fact that few CEOs have been known to seek advice from their predecessors.<ref>[53.] \"How CEOs Retire in Style\" ''Wall Street Journal'', September 13, 2002, B1, Bebchuck p.109</ref> At least one observer\u2014Frank Glassner, CEO of Compensation Design Group\u2014explains the practice as \"disguised severance\", rather than money in exchange for a useful service to the company.<ref name=strauss>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-04-25-ceo-consulting-gigs.htm CEOs cash in after tenure] by Gary Strauss, 04/25/2002, USA Today</ref>\n\nFor a CEO of a large firm, such a contract might be worth $1 million a year or more.

Stock market bubble busts meant drastic cuts in capital gains which were the source of most the equity compensation that made up much or most of CEO pay.\n\nThe divergence in pay peaked in 2000, with average CEO pay being almost 300 times average worker pay. It peaked again in 2007 during another bull market. Both peaks bottomed out with the collapse of the [[Dot-com bubble]] (2002) and [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] (2009) respectively.<ref name=state/> (See graph above.)

According to business writer Mitchell Schnurman, rather than discouraging the practice, the regulation was seen \"as an endorsement\" by \"corporate America\" and \"hundreds of companies adopted\" the payouts for the first time.<ref>Mitchell Schnurman `CEO Pay Is A Real Problem, but This Isn't the Time to Fix It` ''Fort Worth Star Telegram'', September 28, 2008, (not available for free on internet)</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the huge pay packages of two CEOs inspired others to seek big paychecks. Michael Eisner CEO of Disney signed a contract in 1984 that eventually made him the highest-paid CEO up to that point, earning $57 million in 1989. [[Roberto Goizueta]], CEO of [[Coca-Cola]] from 1981 until his death in 1997, was the first \"hired hand\"\u2014someone who had not founded or financed a business\u2014to earn more than $1 billion.<ref name=heist/>\n\n===Rise of incentive pay===\n\nIn 1990, theorists on executive pay, [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] and [[Kevin M. Murphy]], published an article in the [[Harvard Business Review]], in which they argued that the trouble with American business, was that\n<blockquote>`the compensation of top executives is virtually independent of performance. On average, corporate America pays its most important leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then that so many CEOs act like bureaucrats rather than the value-maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance their standing in world markets?`<ref name=\"p.146-7\"/></blockquote>\nThey argued stock options would tie executive pay more closely to performance since the executives' options are valuable only if the stock rises above the \"strike price\".\n\nJensen and Murphy believed companies didn't link pay to performance because of social and political pressure including `Government disclosure rules [that] ensure that executive pay remains a visible and controversial topic.`<ref name=\"p.146-7\">Krugman, Paul, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', 2007, pp.146\u2013147</ref> With the support of institutional investors and federal regulators<ref name=\"Bebchuk.137\"/> three years later a law was passed (Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (1993)) eliminating the tax-deductibility of executive compensation above $1 million unless that compensation was performance-based.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=942667 IRC Section 162(m) and the Law of Unintended Consequences] Kenneth R. Ferris James S. Wallace, November 2006</ref>\n\nThus in the early 1990s, stock options became an increasingly important component of executive compensation.<ref name=\"Bebchuk.137\">Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.137</ref><ref>Kevin J.

The SEC began requiring the listing of compensation in proxy statements in standardized tables in hopes of making more difficult the disguising of pay that didn't incentivize managers, or was unreasonably high.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), pp.67\u201368</ref><ref name=cioppa>Paolo Cioppa, '[http://works.bepress.com/paolocioppa/1/ Executive Compensation: The Fallacy of Disclosure]' 2006</ref>\n\nPrior to this one SEC official complained, disclosure was \"legalistic, turgid, and opaque\":\n\n<blockquote>The typical compensation disclosure ran ten to fourteen pages. Depending on the company's attitude toward disclosure, you might get reference to a $3,500,081 pay package spelled out rather than in numbers. ... buried somewhere in the fourteen pages. Someone once gave a series of institutional investor analysts a proxy statement and asked them to compute the compensation received by the executives covered in the proxy statement. No two analysts came up with the same number. The numbers that were calculated varied widely.`<ref>[footnote 7. Linda C. Quinn, `Executive Compensation Under the New SEC Disclosure Requirements` in Seventh Annual Corporate Law Symposium: Executive Compensation, University of Cincinnati Law Review 63 (1995): 770\u2013771]</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut like the regulation of golden parachutes, this new rule had unintended consequences. According to at least one source, the requirement did nothing to lessen executive pay, in part because the disclosure made it easier for top executives to shop around for higher paying positions.<ref name=cioppa/>\n\n===Post-1992 rise of stock options===\n\nBy 1992 salaries and bonuses made up only 23 percent of the total compensation of the top 500 executives, while gains from exercising stock options representing 59 percent, according to proxy statements.<ref name=Lazonick>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-lazonick/post_3212_b_1403163.html How High CEO Pay Hurts the 99 Percent] William Lazonick.

In 1998 the networking equipment seller [[Cisco Systems]] reported a $1.35 billion profit.

To remedy that problem, firms often \"repriced\" options, i.e. lowered the strike price so that the employee option-holder could still make money on it. In 1998 the FASB did succeed in requiring firms to expense repriced options. Following this, repricing became less popular and was replaced in many firms by what some clinics called \"backdoor repricing\" i.e. issuing of new options with a lower exercise price.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.165</ref><ref>Brian J.

According to the ''Financial Times'', executives at the 25 largest US public firms that went bankrupt between January 2001 and August 2001 sold almost $3 billion worth of their companies' stock during that time and two preceding years as the collective market value of the firms dropped from $210 billion to zero.<ref>[28] Andrew Hill, \"Inside Track\", ''Financial Times'' (London), August 2, 2002, p.10. quoted in Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.181</ref><ref>share prices of several large corporations\u2014[[Enron]], [[Tyco International]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]], [[Peregrine Systems]] [[Kmart]] and [[WorldCom]] -- collapsed in 2002 following [[accounting scandals]]</ref> And among firms whose shares fell by at least 75 percent, 25 had executives sell a total of \"$23 billion before their stocks plummeted.\"<ref>\"You bought, they sold\", Mark Gimein, ''Fortune'', September 2, 2002</ref>\n\nLarge loans to executives were involved in more than a couple of these companies, one of the most notable being WorldCom.

One way is [[Indexing Operating Performance]] to exclude market and sector-wide share price movements. With stock options the exercise price would follow the index. Instead of issuing options to the executive with an exercise price equal to the current market price of (for example) $100, the options strike price would be $100 multiplied by the market index.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004) p.141</ref> Performance conditioned vesting would not adjust the strike price but simply not vest the options unless certain performance targets were met. The adjustments could be designed to be gentle, moderate or aggressive depending on the firm's situation.

The typical CEO is not anticipating many years of income stream since the usual executive contract is only three years. Furthermore, only 2 percent of firms in the S&P 500 reduce any part of the severance package once the executive finds another employer. And if employers are worried about coaxing risk-averse potential employees, why are executives the only ones provided with this treatment? \"Given executives' accumulated wealth and generous retirement benefits they commonly receive after leaving the firm, they are likely to be, if anything, less risk-averse and better able to insure themselves than most other employees.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.134</ref>\n\n====Gratuitous payments====\nAnother practice essentially unknown among non-executive employees is the granting of payments or benefits to executives above and beyond what is in their contract when they quit, are fired, or agree to have their companies bought out.<ref name=\"Fried, 2004 p.87\">Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.87</ref> These are known as \"gratuitous\" payments.\n\nThey may \"include forgiveness of loans, accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock, increases in pension benefits (for example by 'crediting' CEOs with additional years of service), awards of lump-sum cash payments, and promises\" of the previously mentioned consulting contracts.<ref name=\"Fried, 2004 p.87\"/>\n\n====Perks====\nAs part of their retirement, top executives have often been given in-kind benefits or \"perks\" (perquisites). These have included use of corporate jets (sometimes for family and guests as well), chauffeured cars, personal assistants, financial planning, home-security systems, club memberships, sports tickets, office space, secretarial help, and cell phone service.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.107</ref> Unremarked upon when they are used on the job, perks are more controversial in retirement.\n\nPerks lack the flexibility of cash for the beneficiary. For example, if the retired executive thinks $10,000 worth of a perk such as private jet travel is the best way to spend $10,000, then $10,000 in cash and $10,000 in perk have the same value; however, if there are any possible circumstance in which they would prefer spending some or all of the money on something else, then cash is better.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), p.108</ref>\n\nAlso, rather than being a fixed asset whose use costs a corporation less than its worth, perks often cost more than they might first appear.\n<blockquote>Consider retiree use of corporate jets, now a common perk. Although the marginal cost of allowing a retired executive to use the company jet may appear limited, it can run quite high. Consider the use of a company plane for a flight from New York to California and then back several days later. Because the New York-based aircraft and flight crew will return to the East Coast after dropping the retired exec off, the actual charge to the company is two round trips: a total of eight takeoffs and landings and approximately 20 hours of flying time, most likely costing\u2014from fuel, maintenance, landing fees, extra pilot and crew fees and incidentals, and depreciation (an aircraft\u2019s operating life is reduced for every hour it flies and more important, for every takeoff and landing)\u2014at least $50,000.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004),[47.] p.108</ref></blockquote>\n\nLike other \"separation pay\", perks do have the advantage of not having to be reported to shareholders or the SEC in dollar value.\n\n====Consulting contracts====\nAs of 2002, about one quarter of CEOs negotiated a post-retirement ''consulting'' relationship with their old firm<ref>[48] Ira Kay, cited in [https://www.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-04-25-ceo-consulting-gigs.htm 04/24/2002 CEOs cash in after tenure] by Gary Strauss, USA Today</ref><ref>Bebchuck p.109</ref> despite the fact that few CEOs have been known to seek advice from their predecessors.<ref>[53.] \"How CEOs Retire in Style\" ''Wall Street Journal'', September 13, 2002, B1, Bebchuck p.109</ref> At least one observer\u2014Frank Glassner, CEO of Compensation Design Group\u2014explains the practice as \"disguised severance\", rather than money in exchange for a useful service to the company.<ref name=strauss>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-04-25-ceo-consulting-gigs.htm CEOs cash in after tenure] by Gary Strauss, 04/25/2002, USA Today</ref>\n\nFor a CEO of a large firm, such a contract might be worth $1 million a year or more.

Stock market bubble busts meant drastic cuts in capital gains which were the source of most the equity compensation that made up much or most of CEO pay.\n\nThe divergence in pay peaked in 2000, with average CEO pay being almost 300 times average worker pay. It peaked again in 2007 during another bull market. Both peaks bottomed out with the collapse of the [[Dot-com bubble]] (2002) and [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] (2009) respectively.<ref name=state/> (See graph above.)

According to business writer Mitchell Schnurman, rather than discouraging the practice, the regulation was seen \"as an endorsement\" by \"corporate America\" and \"hundreds of companies adopted\" the payouts for the first time.<ref>Mitchell Schnurman `CEO Pay Is A Real Problem, but This Isn't the Time to Fix It` ''Fort Worth Star Telegram'', September 28, 2008, (not available for free on internet)</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the huge pay packages of two CEOs inspired others to seek big paychecks. Michael Eisner CEO of Disney signed a contract in 1984 that eventually made him the highest-paid CEO up to that point, earning $57 million in 1989. [[Roberto Goizueta]], CEO of [[Coca-Cola]] from 1981 until his death in 1997, was the first \"hired hand\"\u2014someone who had not founded or financed a business\u2014to earn more than $1 billion.<ref name=heist/>\n\n===Rise of incentive pay===\n\nIn 1990, theorists on executive pay, [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] and [[Kevin M. Murphy]], published an article in the [[Harvard Business Review]], in which they argued that the trouble with American business, was that\n<blockquote>`the compensation of top executives is virtually independent of performance. On average, corporate America pays its most important leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then that so many CEOs act like bureaucrats rather than the value-maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance their standing in world markets?`<ref name=\"p.146-7\"/></blockquote>\nThey argued stock options would tie executive pay more closely to performance since the executives' options are valuable only if the stock rises above the \"strike price\".\n\nJensen and Murphy believed companies didn't link pay to performance because of social and political pressure including `Government disclosure rules [that] ensure that executive pay remains a visible and controversial topic.`<ref name=\"p.146-7\">Krugman, Paul, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', 2007, pp.146\u2013147</ref> With the support of institutional investors and federal regulators<ref name=\"Bebchuk.137\"/> three years later a law was passed (Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (1993)) eliminating the tax-deductibility of executive compensation above $1 million unless that compensation was performance-based.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=942667 IRC Section 162(m) and the Law of Unintended Consequences] Kenneth R.

The SEC began requiring the listing of compensation in proxy statements in standardized tables in hopes of making more difficult the disguising of pay that didn't incentivize managers, or was unreasonably high.<ref>Bebchuk and Fried, ''Pay Without Performance'' (2004), pp.67\u201368</ref><ref name=cioppa>Paolo Cioppa, '[http://works.bepress.com/paolocioppa/1/ Executive Compensation: The Fallacy of Disclosure]' 2006</ref>\n\nPrior to this one SEC official complained, disclosure was \"legalistic, turgid, and opaque\":\n\n<blockquote>The typical compensation disclosure ran ten to fourteen pages. Depending on the company's attitude toward disclosure, you might get reference to a $3,500,081 pay package spelled out rather than in numbers. ... buried somewhere in the fourteen pages. Someone once gave a series of institutional investor analysts a proxy statement and asked them to compute the compensation received by the executives covered in the proxy statement. No two analysts came up with the same number. The numbers that were calculated varied widely.`<ref>[footnote 7. Linda C.

Burdensome government regulation, such as the [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] law, prevents publicly traded firms from competing with private firms such as [[hedge funds]] where the average compensation for the top 25 managers in 2004 was more than 20 times as much as the average CEO ($251 million).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBusiness leaders have argued that national limits on executive compensation would be self-defeating because the global talent pool for well-qualified executives would lure executives to other areas without such limits. However, according to activist Deborah Hargreaves, there does not seem to be much global employment movement among executives.<blockquote>Not one of the chief executives heading up the 142 American companies in the Fortune Global 500 at the end of 2012, for example, was an external hire from overseas. There was a little movement within Europe, but over all, poaching of chief executives from abroad accounted for only 0.8 percent of C.E.O. appointments in the Fortune Global 500.<ref name=HARGREAVES>{{cite news|last=HARGREAVES|first=DEBORAH|title=Can We Close the Pay Gap?|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/can-we-close-the-pay-gap/|accessdate=March 29, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 29, 2014|quote=After big corporations threatened to quit the country, voters in Switzerland last year rejected a referendum that would have restricted the pay gap to a ratio of 12 to 1.

Murphy, author and adjunct scholar of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[Gold standard|hard money]] [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], challenges those who belittle large corporate compensation, arguing that it is \"no more surprising or outrageous\" in a free market that \"some types of labor command thousands of times more market value\" than it is that some goods \"(such as a house) have a price hundreds of thousands of times higher than the prices of other goods (such as a pack of gum).\" \"Scoffers\" like Warren Buffett, who complain of big executive pay packages (salary, bonuses, perks) even when a company has done poorly, fail to appreciate that this \"doesn\u2019t seem outrageous when the numbers are lower. For example, when GM stock plunged 25 percent,\" did the complainers \"expect the assembly-line workers to give back a quarter of their wages for that year?\" The quality of corporate leadership will suffer (Murphy believes) \"if `outrageous` compensation packages\" are forbidden, just as \"the frequency and quality of brain surgery would plummet\" if the pay of brain surgeons were to be cut.<ref name=murphy/>\n\nThough burdensome government regulation of corporate raiders and new entrants in industry distorts the free market in America (Murphy believes), we{{Who|date=December 2014}} can be sure that \"if CEOs and other members of upper management make incredibly high earnings year after year, it must be that the shareholders find their services worth the expense.

Michael III was the third and traditionally last member of the [[Amorian Dynasty|Amorian (or Phrygian) dynasty]]. He was given the disparaging epithet ''the Drunkard'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2}}) by the hostile historians of the succeeding [[Macedonian dynasty]], but modern historical research has rehabilitated his reputation to some extent, demonstrating the vital role his reign played in the resurgence of Byzantine power in the 9th century.<ref>Gregory, p. 231</ref><ref>Fossier, p. 315</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life and regency===\n[[File:Solidus-Michael III-sb1686.jpg|thumb|200px|left|This coin struck during the regency of [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]] shows how Michael was less prominent than his mother, who is represented as ruler alone on the obverse, and even less than his sister Thecla, who is depicted together with the young Michael on the reverse of this coin.]]\n\nMichael was the youngest child of the emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] and his empress [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]]. The balance of available evidence supports a birthdate in January 840.<ref>Mango, whole article</ref> Already crowned co-ruler by his father in his infancy in 840, Michael had just turned two years old when his father died, and Michael succeeded him as sole emperor on 20 January 842.\n\nDuring his [[Minor (law)|minority]], the empire was governed by a [[regency]] headed by his mother Theodora, her uncle Sergios, and the minister [[Theoktistos]]. The empress had [[iconodule]] sympathies and deposed [[Patriarch John VII of Constantinople]], replacing him with the iconodule [[Patriarch Methodius I of Constantinople]] in 843. This put an end to the second spell of [[iconoclasm]].<ref>Treadgold, p. 447</ref>\n\nAs the emperor was growing up, the courtiers around him fought for influence.  Increasingly fond of his uncle [[Bardas]], Michael invested him with the title ''kaisar'' ([[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] \u2013 at the time a title second only to emperor) and allowed him to murder Theoktistos in November 855.  With the support of Bardas and another uncle, a successful general named [[Petronas (general)|Petronas]], Michael III overthrew the regency on 15 March 856 and relegated his mother and sisters to a monastery in 857.<ref>Treadgold, p. 450</ref>\n\n===Warfare===\n[[File:Coronation of Basil the Macedonian as co-emperor.png|thumb|right|300px|Coronation of Basil the Macedonian as co-emperor (right)]]\nThe internal stabilization of the state was not entirely matched along the frontiers.  Byzantine forces were defeated by the [[Abbasids]] in [[Pamphylia]], [[Crete]], and on the border with [[Syria]], but a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships did score a victory over the [[Arab]]s in 853. There were also many operations around the Aegean and off the Syrian coast by at least three more fleets, numbering 300 ships total.  Following an expedition led by Michael's uncle and general, Petronas, against the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] from the eastern frontier and the Arab borderlands in 856, the imperial government resettled them in [[Thrace]], thus cutting them off from their coreligionists and populating another border region.<ref>Treadgold, pp. 450\u2013451</ref> Michael was also responsible, as per the writings of [[Constantine VII]], for the subjugation of the Slavs settled in the [[Peloponnese]].<ref>Arhweiler and Laiou, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\nA conflict between the Byzantines and [[Bulgarian Empire]] occurred during 855 and 856. The Byzantine Empire wanted to regain its control over some areas of Thrace, including Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]) and the ports around the Gulf of Burgas on the Black Sea. Byzantine forces, led by the emperor and the caesar Bardas, were successful in reconquering a number of cities \u2013 Philippopolis, [[Develtus]], Anchialus and Mesembria among them \u2013 as well as the region of [[Zagore (region)|Zagora]].<ref>Gjuzelev, p. 130</ref><ref>\"TITLE needed\", ''Bulgarian Historical Review'', v.33:no.1-4, p.9.</ref> At the time of this campaign the Bulgarians were distracted by a war with the [[Franks]] under [[Louis the German]] and the [[Croatians]]. In 853 Boris had allied himself to Rastislav of Moravia against the Franks. The Bulgarians were heavily defeated by the Franks; following this, the Moravians changed sides and the Bulgarians then faced threats from Moravia.<ref>Fine, p. 112</ref>\n\nMichael III took an active part in the wars against the Abbasids and their vassals on the eastern frontier from 856 to 863, and particularly in 857 when he sent an army of 50,000 men against [[Emir]] [[Umar al-Aqta]] of [[Melitene]]. In 859, he personally led a siege on [[Samosata]], but in 860 had to abandon the expedition to repel an [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|attack]] by the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] on [[Constantinople]]. In 863, Petronas defeated and killed the emir of Melitene at the [[battle of Lalakaon]], and celebrated a triumph in the capital.<ref>Treadgold, p. 452</ref>\n\n===The ascendency of Bardas and the [[Christianisation of Bulgaria]]===\nBardas justified his usurpation of the regency by introducing various internal reforms. Under the influence of both Bardas and [[Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople|Photios]], Michael presided over the reconstruction of ruined cities and structures, the reopening of closed monasteries, and the reorganization of the imperial [[University of Constantinople|university]] at the Maganaura palace under Leo the Mathematician.<ref>Tougher, p. 69.</ref>  Photios, originally a layman, had entered holy orders and was promoted to the position of patriarch on the dismissal of the troublesome [[Patriarch Ignatius I of Constantinople|Ignatios]] in 858.<ref>On 19 December 858 Photios was a layman, on the 20th he was tonsured and over the next four days was ordained lector, sub-deacon, deacon and priest; on 25 December he was consecrated Patriarch of Constantinople. Photios was a kinsman of both Bardas and Michael III. See Tougher, p 69.</ref>  Although a [[Council of Constantinople (861)|Council of Constantinople]] in 861 confirmed Photios as patriarch, Ignatios appealed to [[Pope Nicholas I]], who declared Photios illegitimate in 863, leading to the [[Photian schism]].  Michael presided over a synod in 867 in which Photios and the three other eastern patriarchs excommunicated Pope Nicholas and condemned the Latin ''[[filioque]]'' clause concerning the procession of the Holy Spirit.<ref>Fossier, p. 325</ref> The conflict over the patriarchal throne and supreme authority within the church was exacerbated by the success of the active missionary efforts launched by Photios.\n\n[[File:57-manasses-chronicle.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The baptism of Boris I of Bulgaria]]\nUnder the guidance of Patriarch Photios, Michael sponsored the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saints Cyril and Methodios]] to the [[Khazar]] [[Khagan]] in an effort to stop the expansion of [[Judaism]] among the Khazars. Although this mission was a failure, their next mission in 863 secured the conversion of [[Great Moravia]] and devised the [[Glagolitic]] alphabet for writing in [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]], thus allowing Slavic-speaking peoples to approach conversion to Orthodox Christianity through their own rather than an alien tongue.<ref>Treadgold, p.452</ref>\n\nFearing the potential conversion of [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] to [[Christianity]] under [[Franks|Frankish]] influence, Michael III and the Caesar Bardas invaded [[Bulgaria]], imposing the conversion of Boris according to the [[Byzantine rite]] as part of the peace settlement in 864. Michael III stood as sponsor, by proxy, for Boris at his baptism. Boris took the additional name of Michael at the ceremony. The Byzantines also allowed the Bulgarians to reclaim the contested border region of Zagora.<ref>Fine, pp. 118\u2013119</ref> The conversion of the Bulgarians has been evaluated as one of the greatest cultural and political achievements of the Byzantine Empire.<ref>Gregory, p. 240</ref>\n\n===The rise of Basil the Macedonian and the assassination of Michael===\n[[File:MadridSkylitzesAssassinationBardasFol80ra.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The assassination of Bardas the Caesar at the feet of Michael III]]\n\nMichael III's marriage with [[Eudokia Dekapolitissa]] was childless, but the emperor did not want to risk a scandal by attempting to marry his mistress [[Eudokia Ingerina]], daughter of the [[Varangian]] (Norse) imperial guard Inger.  The solution he chose was to have Ingerina marry his favorite courtier and chamberlain [[Basil I|Basil the Macedonian]].  While Michael carried on his relationship with Ingerina, Basil was kept satisfied with the emperor's sister Thekla, whom her brother retrieved from a monastery.  Basil gained increasing influence over Michael, and in April 866 he convinced the emperor that the Caesar Bardas was conspiring against him and was duly allowed to murder Bardas.  Now without serious rivals, Basil was crowned co-emperor on 26 May 866 and was adopted by the much younger Michael III.  This curious development may have been intended to legitimize the eventual succession to the throne of Eudokia Ingerina's son [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo]], who was widely believed to be Michael's son. Michael celebrated the birth of Leo with public [[chariot races]], a sport he enthusiastically patronized and participated in.<ref>Treadgold, p, 453</ref>\n\n[[File:The relics of Michael III are transferred to the Holy Apostles.jpg|thumb|right|Leo VI presiding over the transfer of the remains of Michael III to the imperial mausoleum at the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]]]]\n\nIf ensuring Leo's legitimacy had been Michael's plan, it backfired.  Ostensibly troubled by the favour Michael was beginning to show to another courtier, named [[Basiliskianos]], whom he threatened to raise as another co-emperor, Basil had Michael [[assassination|assassinated]] as he lay insensible in his bedchamber following a drinking bout in September 867. Basil with a number of his male relatives, plus other accomplices, entered Michael's apartment; the locks had been tampered with and no guard had been placed.  Michael's end was grisly; a man named John of Chaldia killed him, cutting off both the emperor's hands with a sword before finishing him off with a thrust to the heart. Basil, as the sole remaining emperor (Basiliskianos had presumably been disposed of at the same time as Michael), automatically succeeded as the ruling ''basileus''.<ref>Finlay, pp. 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nMichael's remains were buried in the Philippikos Monastery at Chrysopolis on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros. When Leo VI became ruling emperor in 886, one of his first acts was to have Michael's body exhumed and reburied, with great ceremony, in the imperial mausoleum in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople.<ref>Tougher, p. 62.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Amorian dynasty}}\n\nThe reign and personality of Michael III are difficult to evaluate because of the hostile accounts written by Byzantine authors operating under Basil I and his successors. Byzantine accounts describe Michael's habitual drunkenness, his obsession with chariot racing and his orchestration of public displays mocking the processions and rituals of the church. The impression gained from Arab sources, however, is one of Michael as an active and often successful military commander.<ref>Gregory, p. 231</ref>\n\nThough Michael III was allegedly prone to squander money, his reign stabilized the economy, and by the year 850 the empire's annual revenues had increased to 3,300,000 ''[[nomismata]]''. The definitive end to iconoclasm early in his reign led, unsurprisingly, to a renaissance in visual arts. The Empire made considerable advances in internal organisation and religious cohesion, and it had more than held its own against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Most importantly Bulgaria had been transformed into a religious and cultural satellite of Byzantium. Much of the credit for these achievements, however, must go to Theodora and Theoktistos up to 855, and Bardas and Petronas thereafter.<ref>Treadgold, p.455</ref>\n\n==Family==\nMichael III had no children by his wife [[Eudokia Dekapolitissa]] but was conjectured to have fathered one or two sons by his mistress [[Eudokia Ingerina]], who was married to [[Basil I]]:<ref>Treadgold, p. 462</ref>\n* [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]], who succeeded Basil I as emperor in 886\n* [[Stephen I of Constantinople|Stephen I]], patriarch of Constantinople\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Byzantine Empire}}\n*[[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Michael III|position=left}}\n*Ahrweiler, H. and Laiou, A.E.

Michael III was the third and traditionally last member of the [[Amorian Dynasty|Amorian (or Phrygian) dynasty]]. He was given the disparaging epithet ''the Drunkard'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2}}) by the hostile historians of the succeeding [[Macedonian dynasty]], but modern historical research has rehabilitated his reputation to some extent, demonstrating the vital role his reign played in the resurgence of Byzantine power in the 9th century.<ref>Gregory, p. 231</ref><ref>Fossier, p. 315</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life and regency===\n[[File:Solidus-Michael III-sb1686.jpg|thumb|200px|left|This coin struck during the regency of [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]] shows how Michael was less prominent than his mother, who is represented as ruler alone on the obverse, and even less than his sister Thecla, who is depicted together with the young Michael on the reverse of this coin.]]\n\nMichael was the youngest child of the emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] and his empress [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Theodora]]. The balance of available evidence supports a birthdate in January 840.<ref>Mango, whole article</ref> Already crowned co-ruler by his father in his infancy in 840, Michael had just turned two years old when his father died, and Michael succeeded him as sole emperor on 20 January 842.\n\nDuring his [[Minor (law)|minority]], the empire was governed by a [[regency]] headed by his mother Theodora, her uncle Sergios, and the minister [[Theoktistos]]. The empress had [[iconodule]] sympathies and deposed [[Patriarch John VII of Constantinople]], replacing him with the iconodule [[Patriarch Methodius I of Constantinople]] in 843. This put an end to the second spell of [[iconoclasm]].<ref>Treadgold, p. 447</ref>\n\nAs the emperor was growing up, the courtiers around him fought for influence.  Increasingly fond of his uncle [[Bardas]], Michael invested him with the title ''kaisar'' ([[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] \u2013 at the time a title second only to emperor) and allowed him to murder Theoktistos in November 855.  With the support of Bardas and another uncle, a successful general named [[Petronas (general)|Petronas]], Michael III overthrew the regency on 15 March 856 and relegated his mother and sisters to a monastery in 857.<ref>Treadgold, p. 450</ref>\n\n===Warfare===\n[[File:Coronation of Basil the Macedonian as co-emperor.png|thumb|right|300px|Coronation of Basil the Macedonian as co-emperor (right)]]\nThe internal stabilization of the state was not entirely matched along the frontiers.  Byzantine forces were defeated by the [[Abbasids]] in [[Pamphylia]], [[Crete]], and on the border with [[Syria]], but a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships did score a victory over the [[Arab]]s in 853. There were also many operations around the Aegean and off the Syrian coast by at least three more fleets, numbering 300 ships total.  Following an expedition led by Michael's uncle and general, Petronas, against the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] from the eastern frontier and the Arab borderlands in 856, the imperial government resettled them in [[Thrace]], thus cutting them off from their coreligionists and populating another border region.<ref>Treadgold, pp. 450\u2013451</ref> Michael was also responsible, as per the writings of [[Constantine VII]], for the subjugation of the Slavs settled in the [[Peloponnese]].<ref>Arhweiler and Laiou, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\nA conflict between the Byzantines and [[Bulgarian Empire]] occurred during 855 and 856. The Byzantine Empire wanted to regain its control over some areas of Thrace, including Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]) and the ports around the Gulf of Burgas on the Black Sea. Byzantine forces, led by the emperor and the caesar Bardas, were successful in reconquering a number of cities \u2013 Philippopolis, [[Develtus]], Anchialus and Mesembria among them \u2013 as well as the region of [[Zagore (region)|Zagora]].<ref>Gjuzelev, p. 130</ref><ref>\"TITLE needed\", ''Bulgarian Historical Review'', v.33:no.1-4, p.9.</ref> At the time of this campaign the Bulgarians were distracted by a war with the [[Franks]] under [[Louis the German]] and the [[Croatians]]. In 853 Boris had allied himself to Rastislav of Moravia against the Franks. The Bulgarians were heavily defeated by the Franks; following this, the Moravians changed sides and the Bulgarians then faced threats from Moravia.<ref>Fine, p. 112</ref>\n\nMichael III took an active part in the wars against the Abbasids and their vassals on the eastern frontier from 856 to 863, and particularly in 857 when he sent an army of 50,000 men against [[Emir]] [[Umar al-Aqta]] of [[Melitene]]. In 859, he personally led a siege on [[Samosata]], but in 860 had to abandon the expedition to repel an [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|attack]] by the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] on [[Constantinople]]. In 863, Petronas defeated and killed the emir of Melitene at the [[battle of Lalakaon]], and celebrated a triumph in the capital.<ref>Treadgold, p. 452</ref>\n\n===The ascendency of Bardas and the [[Christianisation of Bulgaria]]===\nBardas justified his usurpation of the regency by introducing various internal reforms. Under the influence of both Bardas and [[Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople|Photios]], Michael presided over the reconstruction of ruined cities and structures, the reopening of closed monasteries, and the reorganization of the imperial [[University of Constantinople|university]] at the Maganaura palace under Leo the Mathematician.<ref>Tougher, p. 69.</ref>  Photios, originally a layman, had entered holy orders and was promoted to the position of patriarch on the dismissal of the troublesome [[Patriarch Ignatius I of Constantinople|Ignatios]] in 858.<ref>On 19 December 858 Photios was a layman, on the 20th he was tonsured and over the next four days was ordained lector, sub-deacon, deacon and priest; on 25 December he was consecrated Patriarch of Constantinople. Photios was a kinsman of both Bardas and Michael III. See Tougher, p 69.</ref>  Although a [[Council of Constantinople (861)|Council of Constantinople]] in 861 confirmed Photios as patriarch, Ignatios appealed to [[Pope Nicholas I]], who declared Photios illegitimate in 863, leading to the [[Photian schism]].

The station is notable for its architecture, adopting a mixture of Eastern and Western designs.\n\nThe station is located along a road named ''Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin'', previously known as Victory Avenue, which in turn was part of Damansara Road. The station is located closely to the similarly designed [[Railway Administration Building, Kuala Lumpur|Railway Administration Building]], as well as the [[Masjid Negara|National Mosque]] and [[Dayabumi|Dayabumi Complex]]. The [[Pasar Seni station]] is located 400 metres away, across the [[Klang River]].\n\n==History==\n===Preceding stations===\nPrior to the construction of the current Kuala Lumpur station, two stations were already operational in the city.\n\nThe first railway station in Kuala Lumpur, nicknamed '''Resident Station''' due to its proximity to the [[Carcosa Seri Negara|residence of British High Commissioner]], was completed and located opposite to the [[Royal Selangor Club|Selangor Club]] (today [[Dataran Merdeka]]) towards the west. Constructed of wood and a [[Nypa fruticans|nipah palm]] roof, the station was the first in Kuala Lumpur, linking Kuala Lumpur to [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] (Pengkalan Batu) via the first railway line to connect the city with the rest of the [[Malay Peninsula]] (officially inaugurated 22 September 1886<!--This passage refers to the railway line, not the station-->).\n\nThe second station, '''[[Sultan Street railway station|Sultan Street station]]''', was constructed in 1892 at Foch Avenue (now Tun Tan Cheng Lock Road), close to the present [[Maybank Tower, Kuala Lumpur|Maybank Tower]], the [[Puduraya]] bus station and {{KLRT color code|AG|8}}{{KLRT color code|SP|8}} [[Plaza Rakyat LRT Station|Plaza Rakyat]]. Its design was based on Resident Station, and was stationed along the Pudu railway line, a new line that branched off north from the 1910 station, and connected mines from [[Ampang District|Ampang]] to the city. The line was unique in that the initial leg of the track approaching Sultan Street Station from the main line was sandwiched between two carriageways of Foch Avenue, cutting across the east side of the city.\n\nResident Station was demolished after construction of the new Kuala Lumpur station was completed. Meanwhile, Sultan Street Station was replaced by a smaller [[terminal station]] when the tracks at Foch Avenue were dismantled for road traffic, and was demolished after 1960. The Ampang-linked route is partially reused by the [[Ampang Line|LRT Ampang line]].\n\n===Design, construction and operation===\n[[Arthur Benison Hubback]], a British Architectural Assistant to the Director of Public Works, undertook the design of the station. He incorporated the unique Anglo-Asian architecture in the region on the station's design. The \"[[Moorish Revival|Neo-Moorish]]/[[Mughal Empire#Mughal influence on the Subcontinent|Mughal]]/[[Indo-Saracenic]]/Neo-Saracenic\" style was not uncommon at the time. Similar structures, such as the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] (designed by A.C. Norman, completed 1897), the Old City Hall (designed by A.B. Hubback, completed 1904) and the [[Masjid Jamek|Jamek Mosque]] (designed by A.B. Hubback, completed 1909), pre-date Kuala Lumpur station.\n\nAt a cost of [[Straits dollars|$]]23,000, the station was completed and operational on 1 August 1910. After the demolition of Resident Station and the isolation of Sultan Street station, the Kuala Lumpur station became the main railway station in Kuala Lumpur.{{nbsp}} A [[Hotel#Railway hotels|railway hotel]], the ''Station Hotel'' (later renamed the ''Heritage Station Hotel'' in 1996), occupied the northern sections of the central station and the upper floors of the station, boasting 170 rooms and an ornate lobby housing Charlies Restaurant & Bar as off the late-2000s. In 1995, access to [[KTM Komuter]] services was introduced at the station.\n\n[[File:KL station railway museum.jpg|thumb|180px|The interior of the station's main hall was refurbished in 1986, which saw some of its original interiors altered and modernised. The area is now used to house exhibits (such as this model of a carriage) after the station was designated a railway museum.]]\n\nAfter the diversion of long-distance intercity rail traffic less than a kilometer south to [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral]] on 15 April 2001, the original station's importance diminished. While intercity trains continue to pass the station, they no longer stop there, relegating the station to being a stop for Komuter and goods services. As a result of declining passenger traffic and patronage, redundant station facilities, such as manned ticket counters for intercity services, station offices and rented businesses spaces, were decommissioned or slowly vacated. The Heritage Station Hotel ceased operation in 2011 following declining patronage and a series of mismanaged renovations in the late-2000s; the hotel was briefly reopened in 2014 before closing the same year.<ref>\u201cA loss to K.L\u201d. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g298570-d637810-r263673793-Heritage_Station_Hotel-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html</ref>{{nbsp}} While the side platforms of the original station, which have already been raised to a leveled height for smooth embarking and disembarking for intercity coaches, were readily usable from KTM Komuter trains, the configuration of the island platform and access to services in the first 15 years of the Komuter's service meant that the original station could not be maximised for use as a transportation stop for electric trains until 2009 renovations raised the last of the original platforms (''see [[#Platforms|platform]]'').\n\nIn the months leading up to 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of [[Hari Merdeka|Malaya's independence]], various sources reported the transfer of various old railway equipment from a railway warehouse in Klang and a few other locations to the old Kuala Lumpur station.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} This included a small restored shunter and an antique fire engine. The station was officially reopened on 31 August 2007 as a railway museum (where exhibitions are placed in the main hall and platform of the station), and was mooted to be converted into a cultural centre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\n===Renovations, upgrades and changes===\n[[File:Trains at Kuala Lumpur.JPG|thumb|left|[[KTM Komuter]] [[KTM Class 92|Class 92]] and [[KTM Class 83|Class 83]] trains waiting at the newer wing of Kuala Lumpur station, built during the 1986 refurbishment.]]\n\nThe station has undergone several major changes in its modern history. The north wing was converted for office use by 1967, closing off the arched verandahs with windows. In 1986, the station was more extensively refurbished, with the interior and relevant windows replaced with modern counterparts while the exterior was repaired and preserved, and additional new facilities and buildings, including air-conditioned waiting halls, tourism information counters and snack bars. Parts of the station's original interior designs and frames are still present in the Heritage Station Hotel.\n\nThe refurbishment also saw an additional extension built on the south wing of the building, sporting \"Raj\" stylings that dominates much of the building, and the addition of a frontal fa\u00e7ade for the north wing that sports similar architectural elements, masking hints of Western designs from the front. These changes resulted in the building sporting two additional [[chhatris]], two on the corner of each wing, alongside the original four.\n\n[[File:Railway station KL 2007 010 pano.jpg|thumb|300px|The 1986 renovation also extended the old station's frontal facade, with the existing northern wing masked by a \"Raj\"-styled edifice.]]\n[[File:Kuala Lumpur - stationboard.JPG|thumb|Kuala Lumpur - stationboard]]\nOther modifications made onto the old building included the rear wall of the station carved open and extended to accommodate a new station entrance, taxi stops, several office and retail spaces, while additional double-storey retail spaces were constructed over one of the two adjacent frontal access roads to the main building. The 1986 remodelling also saw platform extensions to the north and a new station building in the area, which connected to the [[Kuala Lumpur General Post Office|General Post Office]] at the then newly completed [[Dayabumi Complex]] (constructed 1982 to 1984).\n \nWhen [[KTM Komuter]] services were launched in 1995 to serve the [[Rawang-Seremban Route]] and the [[Sentul-Port Klang Route]], ticket counters and [[Turnstile|faregate]]s were added to the station, in common with other KTM Komuter stations. The location of Komuter facilities meant that only the newer island platform could be used by KTM Komuter trains (''see [[#Platforms|platform]]'').\n\nAfter [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral]] assumed the responsibility of receiving intercity operations, portions of station facilities designated for intercity services were decommissioned or removed. Limited intercity services were reintroduced to the station following the station's designation as an [[KTM ETS|ETS]] stop in 2009.\n\n==Platforms==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n\n | image1 = Kuala Lumpur railway station (Rawang-Seremban & Sentul-Port Klang Line) (original terminal), Kuala Lumpur.jpg\n | width1 = 225\n | caption1 = The original platforms of the station (pictured before 2009 platform renovations) retain older architectural elements, such as the large steel-framed pitched-roofed [[train shed]].\n\n | image2 = Kuala Lumpur railway station (Rawang-Seremban & Sentul-Port Klang Line) (extension terminal), Kuala Lumpur.JPG|thumb|\n | width2 = 225\n | caption2 = The station extension added during the 1986 renovation takes on modernist design cues with mild inspirations from both the old station and the neighbouring [[Dayabumi Complex]]. The mismatched pillar in the foreground is of a 2006 addition of canopy roofs.\n\n | footer = \n}}\nThe station contains three [[Railway platform|platforms]] serving four railway tracks, consisting of two [[side platform]]s (platforms 1 and 4) on both sides and one [[island platform]] (platforms 2 and 3) in between. The numbered designations originally applied to the lengths of both the original and extended platforms from the 1986 renovation until the introduction of [[KTM Komuter|Komuter]] in 1995, when extensions of the original platforms 2 and 3 were assigned additional \"a\" suffixes, i.e. platforms 2a and 3a, while designations for platforms 1 and 4 remain unchanged.\n\nWhen the station originally opened in 1910 all platforms were elevated relative to the tracks but were lower than the train floor; all platforms were connected by two tunnels, respectably accessible via stairways for passengers or ramps for trolleys. The 1986 renovation, which added extended platforms elevated to the level of the train floor, had also partially raised the old side platforms to match the height of the 1986 platforms (the tunnel entrances were unaffected by the remodelling as they were located well away from the platform edges), but left the height of the old island platform largely unchanged. As a result, platforms 2 and 3 were unprepared to deal with passengers entering and exiting Komuter trains. In anticipation of the introduction of longer [[KTM ETS|ETS]] and Komuter [[electric multiple unit|EMU]]s, renovation works were conducted in 2009 to raise platforms 2 and 3, removing century-old surface-level tunnel railings and sealing off the stairway exit from one of the tunnels to platforms 2 and 3. Larger capony shelters connecting the old and new train sheds were also added in 2006.\n\nThe platforms have been designated the following functions:\n\n* Until Intercity services moved to Kuala Lumpur Sentral in 2001, platforms 1 and 4 were typically assigned to service Intercity trains. As such, ticket counters for the train services were located within the old and new station buildings. When passenger traffic at the platforms ceased after 2001, the platforms continued to be used to transfer goods to and from trains. The side platforms, like the lobby of the old station building, were open to the public between 2001 and 2011, as Komuter [[Turnstile|faregate]]s were located at the old island platform rather than within the station building. Following renovations in 2009, the platforms were repurposed for use by the ETS in 2011 with tickets sold at counters located in the former railway fan clubhouse.\n* Like the side platforms, the island platforms (platforms 2 and 3, including the 1986 extension) originally served as platforms for Intercity trains services. When Komuter services were introduced in 1995, the 1986 stretch of the island platform was renumbered to platforms 2a and 3a, to be reassigned for trains serving the [[Rawang-Seremban Route|Rawang-Seremban]] and [[Sentul-Port Klang Route]]s. Due to the still low height of the old island platform, Komuter trains could not stop at the original stretch of platforms 2 and 3, and as such ticket faregates for Komuter services were installed towards the northern end of platforms 2 and 3 to the south as well as the modern exit for platforms 2a and 3a to the north. This also left the original platforms 2 and 3 disused following the discontinuation of intercity services in 2001. With the old island platform raised following the 2009 platform renovation, Komuter and ETS trains could stop along the entire stretch of platforms 2 and 3, moving the southern faregates away from the old platform and into the old station building.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:KlRailwayStAndHq.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The frontal design of the station is comparable with that of local buildings in the same architectural style, such as the [[Railway Administration Building]] directly across the road (left) and various administrative buildings around [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur|Merdeka Square]].]]\n\nWhen originally completed in 1910, the Kuala Lumpur railway station consisted of a main terminal building at the front and three [[Railway platform|platform]]s serving four railway tracks at the back.\n\nThe main structure, which contains a main hall, ticket counters, railway offices and the railway hotel, is primarily designed in a \"Raj\" styling, mixture of Western and [[Mughal Empire#Mughal influence on the Subcontinent|Mughal]] similar to [[Moorish Revival]] or [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic]] architecture. Dominated by [[Horseshoe arch|horseshoe]] and [[Ogee|ogee arch]]es, and large [[chhatri]]s (six originally, with two added later) at the corners of the building accompanying smaller variations at the front, the station is comparable to its contemporaries like the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]], surrounding structures constructed around the [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur|Merdeka Square]] and the [[Railway Administration Building]] directly across the street. In addition to the main station building, a three-storey addition at the north wing was added early in its operation, adopting more Westernised vernacular designs with surrounding venrendahs and [[segmental arch]]es of various widths. The fa\u00e7ade of the station is completely plastered, as opposed to buildings of similar styles that opt for exposed brickwork, and painted in light colours (usually white or [[Cream (colour)|cream]]) throughout its service.\n\nThe platforms are covered by large steel-framed shelters, which were initially shorter during the station's early operation. The roofs were originally glazed, and were partially opened to allow smoke from [[steam locomotive]]s to escape; corrugated roof sheets served as replacements later in the station's life. The sides of the platforms not adjoining the main building are surrounded by walls constructed in the same style as the main building. The platforms and main building are linked to each other via two underground passageways.\n\nThe design of the extended platform for the 1986 refurbishment of the station took a more modernist approach, consisting simply of large concrete pillars supporting a [[Latticework|latticed]] roof and a ticket office on concrete slabs at the north end, suspended two stories above ground.

The station is notable for its architecture, adopting a mixture of Eastern and Western designs.\n\nThe station is located along a road named ''Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin'', previously known as Victory Avenue, which in turn was part of Damansara Road. The station is located closely to the similarly designed [[Railway Administration Building, Kuala Lumpur|Railway Administration Building]], as well as the [[Masjid Negara|National Mosque]] and [[Dayabumi|Dayabumi Complex]]. The [[Pasar Seni station]] is located 400 metres away, across the [[Klang River]].\n\n==History==\n===Preceding stations===\nPrior to the construction of the current Kuala Lumpur station, two stations were already operational in the city.\n\nThe first railway station in Kuala Lumpur, nicknamed '''Resident Station''' due to its proximity to the [[Carcosa Seri Negara|residence of the British Resident]], was completed and located opposite to the [[Royal Selangor Club|Selangor Club]] (today [[Dataran Merdeka]]) towards the west. Constructed of wood and a [[Nypa fruticans|nipah palm]] roof, the station was the first in Kuala Lumpur, linking Kuala Lumpur to [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] (Pengkalan Batu) via the first railway line to connect the city with the rest of the [[Malay Peninsula]] (officially inaugurated 22 September 1886<!--This passage refers to the railway line, not the station-->).\n\nThe second station, '''[[Sultan Street railway station|Sultan Street station]]''', was constructed in 1892 at Foch Avenue (now Tun Tan Cheng Lock Road), close to the present [[Maybank Tower, Kuala Lumpur|Maybank Tower]], the [[Puduraya]] bus station and {{KLRT color code|AG|8}}{{KLRT color code|SP|8}} [[Plaza Rakyat LRT Station|Plaza Rakyat]]. Its design was based on Resident Station, and was stationed along the Pudu railway line, a new line that branched off north from the 1910 station, and connected mines from [[Ampang District|Ampang]] to the city. The line was unique in that the initial leg of the track approaching Sultan Street Station from the main line was sandwiched between two carriageways of Foch Avenue, cutting across the east side of the city.\n\nResident Station was demolished after construction of the new Kuala Lumpur station was completed. Meanwhile, Sultan Street Station was replaced by a smaller [[terminal station]] when the tracks at Foch Avenue were dismantled for road traffic, and was demolished after 1960. The Ampang-linked route is partially reused by the [[Ampang Line|LRT Ampang line]].\n\n===Design, construction and operation===\n[[Arthur Benison Hubback]], a British Architectural Assistant to the Director of Public Works, undertook the design of the station. He incorporated the unique Anglo-Asian architecture in the region on the station's design. The \"[[Moorish Revival|Neo-Moorish]]/[[Mughal Empire#Mughal influence on the Subcontinent|Mughal]]/[[Indo-Saracenic]]/Neo-Saracenic\" style was not uncommon at the time. Similar structures, such as the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]] (designed by A.C. Norman, completed 1897), the Old City Hall (designed by A.B. Hubback, completed 1904) and the [[Masjid Jamek|Jamek Mosque]] (designed by A.B. Hubback, completed 1909), pre-date Kuala Lumpur station.\n\nAt a cost of [[Straits dollars|$]]23,000, the station was completed and operational on 1 August 1910. After the demolition of Resident Station and the isolation of Sultan Street station, the Kuala Lumpur station became the main railway station in Kuala Lumpur.{{nbsp}} A [[Hotel#Railway hotels|railway hotel]], the ''Station Hotel'' (later renamed the ''Heritage Station Hotel'' in 1996), occupied the northern sections of the central station and the upper floors of the station, boasting 170 rooms and an ornate lobby housing Charlies Restaurant & Bar as off the late-2000s. In 1995, access to [[KTM Komuter]] services was introduced at the station.\n\n[[File:KL station railway museum.jpg|thumb|180px|The interior of the station's main hall was refurbished in 1986, which saw some of its original interiors altered and modernised. The area is now used to house exhibits (such as this model of a carriage) after the station was designated a railway museum.]]\n\nAfter the diversion of long-distance intercity rail traffic less than a kilometer south to [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral]] on 15 April 2001, the original station's importance diminished. While intercity trains continue to pass the station, they no longer stop there, relegating the station to being a stop for Komuter and goods services. As a result of declining passenger traffic and patronage, redundant station facilities, such as manned ticket counters for intercity services, station offices and rented businesses spaces, were decommissioned or slowly vacated. The Heritage Station Hotel ceased operation in 2011 following declining patronage and a series of mismanaged renovations in the late-2000s; the hotel was briefly reopened in 2014 before closing the same year.<ref>\u201cA loss to K.L\u201d. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g298570-d637810-r263673793-Heritage_Station_Hotel-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html</ref>{{nbsp}} While the side platforms of the original station, which have already been raised to a leveled height for smooth embarking and disembarking for intercity coaches, were readily usable from KTM Komuter trains, the configuration of the island platform and access to services in the first 15 years of the Komuter's service meant that the original station could not be maximised for use as a transportation stop for electric trains until 2009 renovations raised the last of the original platforms (''see [[#Platforms|platform]]'').\n\nIn the months leading up to 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of [[Hari Merdeka|Malaya's independence]], various sources reported the transfer of various old railway equipment from a railway warehouse in Klang and a few other locations to the old Kuala Lumpur station.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} This included a small restored shunter and an antique fire engine. The station was officially reopened on 31 August 2007 as a railway museum (where exhibitions are placed in the main hall and platform of the station), and was mooted to be converted into a cultural centre.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\n===Renovations, upgrades and changes===\n[[File:Trains at Kuala Lumpur.JPG|thumb|left|[[KTM Komuter]] [[KTM Class 92|Class 92]] and [[KTM Class 83|Class 83]] trains waiting at the newer wing of Kuala Lumpur station, built during the 1986 refurbishment.]]\n\nThe station has undergone several major changes in its modern history. The north wing was converted for office use by 1967, closing off the arched verandahs with windows. In 1986, the station was more extensively refurbished, with the interior and relevant windows replaced with modern counterparts while the exterior was repaired and preserved, and additional new facilities and buildings, including air-conditioned waiting halls, tourism information counters and snack bars. Parts of the station's original interior designs and frames are still present in the Heritage Station Hotel.\n\nThe refurbishment also saw an additional extension built on the south wing of the building, sporting \"Raj\" stylings that dominates much of the building, and the addition of a frontal fa\u00e7ade for the north wing that sports similar architectural elements, masking hints of Western designs from the front. These changes resulted in the building sporting two additional [[chhatris]], two on the corner of each wing, alongside the original four.\n\n[[File:Railway station KL 2007 010 pano.jpg|thumb|300px|The 1986 renovation also extended the old station's frontal facade, with the existing northern wing masked by a \"Raj\"-styled edifice.]]\n[[File:Kuala Lumpur - stationboard.JPG|thumb|Kuala Lumpur - stationboard]]\nOther modifications made onto the old building included the rear wall of the station carved open and extended to accommodate a new station entrance, taxi stops, several office and retail spaces, while additional double-storey retail spaces were constructed over one of the two adjacent frontal access roads to the main building. The 1986 remodelling also saw platform extensions to the north and a new station building in the area, which connected to the [[Kuala Lumpur General Post Office|General Post Office]] at the then newly completed [[Dayabumi Complex]] (constructed 1982 to 1984).\n \nWhen [[KTM Komuter]] services were launched in 1995 to serve the [[Rawang-Seremban Route]] and the [[Sentul-Port Klang Route]], ticket counters and [[Turnstile|faregate]]s were added to the station, in common with other KTM Komuter stations. The location of Komuter facilities meant that only the newer island platform could be used by KTM Komuter trains (''see [[#Platforms|platform]]'').\n\nAfter [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral]] assumed the responsibility of receiving intercity operations, portions of station facilities designated for intercity services were decommissioned or removed. Limited intercity services were reintroduced to the station following the station's designation as an [[KTM ETS|ETS]] stop in 2009.\n\n==Platforms==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n\n | image1 = Kuala Lumpur railway station (Rawang-Seremban & Sentul-Port Klang Line) (original terminal), Kuala Lumpur.jpg\n | width1 = 225\n | caption1 = The original platforms of the station (pictured before 2009 platform renovations) retain older architectural elements, such as the large steel-framed pitched-roofed [[train shed]].\n\n | image2 = Kuala Lumpur railway station (Rawang-Seremban & Sentul-Port Klang Line) (extension terminal), Kuala Lumpur.JPG|thumb|\n | width2 = 225\n | caption2 = The station extension added during the 1986 renovation takes on modernist design cues with mild inspirations from both the old station and the neighbouring [[Dayabumi Complex]]. The mismatched pillar in the foreground is of a 2006 addition of canopy roofs.\n\n | footer = \n}}\nThe station contains three [[Railway platform|platforms]] serving four railway tracks, consisting of two [[side platform]]s (platforms 1 and 4) on both sides and one [[island platform]] (platforms 2 and 3) in between. The numbered designations originally applied to the lengths of both the original and extended platforms from the 1986 renovation until the introduction of [[KTM Komuter|Komuter]] in 1995, when extensions of the original platforms 2 and 3 were assigned additional \"a\" suffixes, i.e. platforms 2a and 3a, while designations for platforms 1 and 4 remain unchanged.\n\nWhen the station originally opened in 1910 all platforms were elevated relative to the tracks but were lower than the train floor; all platforms were connected by two tunnels, respectably accessible via stairways for passengers or ramps for trolleys. The 1986 renovation, which added extended platforms elevated to the level of the train floor, had also partially raised the old side platforms to match the height of the 1986 platforms (the tunnel entrances were unaffected by the remodelling as they were located well away from the platform edges), but left the height of the old island platform largely unchanged. As a result, platforms 2 and 3 were unprepared to deal with passengers entering and exiting Komuter trains. In anticipation of the introduction of longer [[KTM ETS|ETS]] and Komuter [[electric multiple unit|EMU]]s, renovation works were conducted in 2009 to raise platforms 2 and 3, removing century-old surface-level tunnel railings and sealing off the stairway exit from one of the tunnels to platforms 2 and 3. Larger capony shelters connecting the old and new train sheds were also added in 2006.\n\nThe platforms have been designated the following functions:\n\n* Until Intercity services moved to Kuala Lumpur Sentral in 2001, platforms 1 and 4 were typically assigned to service Intercity trains. As such, ticket counters for the train services were located within the old and new station buildings. When passenger traffic at the platforms ceased after 2001, the platforms continued to be used to transfer goods to and from trains. The side platforms, like the lobby of the old station building, were open to the public between 2001 and 2011, as Komuter [[Turnstile|faregate]]s were located at the old island platform rather than within the station building. Following renovations in 2009, the platforms were repurposed for use by the ETS in 2011 with tickets sold at counters located in the former railway fan clubhouse.\n* Like the side platforms, the island platforms (platforms 2 and 3, including the 1986 extension) originally served as platforms for Intercity trains services. When Komuter services were introduced in 1995, the 1986 stretch of the island platform was renumbered to platforms 2a and 3a, to be reassigned for trains serving the [[Rawang-Seremban Route|Rawang-Seremban]] and [[Sentul-Port Klang Route]]s. Due to the still low height of the old island platform, Komuter trains could not stop at the original stretch of platforms 2 and 3, and as such ticket faregates for Komuter services were installed towards the northern end of platforms 2 and 3 to the south as well as the modern exit for platforms 2a and 3a to the north. This also left the original platforms 2 and 3 disused following the discontinuation of intercity services in 2001. With the old island platform raised following the 2009 platform renovation, Komuter and ETS trains could stop along the entire stretch of platforms 2 and 3, moving the southern faregates away from the old platform and into the old station building.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:KlRailwayStAndHq.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The frontal design of the station is comparable with that of local buildings in the same architectural style, such as the [[Railway Administration Building]] directly across the road (left) and various administrative buildings around [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur|Merdeka Square]].]]\n\nWhen originally completed in 1910, the Kuala Lumpur railway station consisted of a main terminal building at the front and three [[Railway platform|platform]]s serving four railway tracks at the back.\n\nThe main structure, which contains a main hall, ticket counters, railway offices and the railway hotel, is primarily designed in a \"Raj\" styling, mixture of Western and [[Mughal Empire#Mughal influence on the Subcontinent|Mughal]] similar to [[Moorish Revival]] or [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic]] architecture. Dominated by [[Horseshoe arch|horseshoe]] and [[Ogee|ogee arch]]es, and large [[chhatri]]s (six originally, with two added later) at the corners of the building accompanying smaller variations at the front, the station is comparable to its contemporaries like the [[Sultan Abdul Samad Building]], surrounding structures constructed around the [[Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur|Merdeka Square]] and the [[Railway Administration Building]] directly across the street. In addition to the main station building, a three-storey addition at the north wing was added early in its operation, adopting more Westernised vernacular designs with surrounding venrendahs and [[segmental arch]]es of various widths. The fa\u00e7ade of the station is completely plastered, as opposed to buildings of similar styles that opt for exposed brickwork, and painted in light colours (usually white or [[Cream (colour)|cream]]) throughout its service.\n\nThe platforms are covered by large steel-framed shelters, which were initially shorter during the station's early operation. The roofs were originally glazed, and were partially opened to allow smoke from [[steam locomotive]]s to escape; corrugated roof sheets served as replacements later in the station's life. The sides of the platforms not adjoining the main building are surrounded by walls constructed in the same style as the main building. The platforms and main building are linked to each other via two underground passageways.\n\nThe design of the extended platform for the 1986 refurbishment of the station took a more modernist approach, consisting simply of large concrete pillars supporting a [[Latticework|latticed]] roof and a ticket office on concrete slabs at the north end, suspended two stories above ground. White walls and arches that serve as decorations to the extension mimic design cues from both the old station and the [[Dayabumi Complex|Dayabumi complex]]. The new extension is also connected to Dayabumi via an elevated walkway.\n\n==Around the station==\n* Directly across Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin:\n** [[Railway Administration Building]]\n** [[Hotel Majestic (Kuala Lumpur)|Hotel Majestic]]\n** [[National Mosque of Malaysia]]\n** [[Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia]]\n** [[Planetarium Negara|National Planetarium]]\n* To the south:\n** Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration\n* To the north:\n** [[Dayabumi Complex]]\n** [[Kuala Lumpur General Post Office]]\n* Across the [[Klang River]]:\n** Bridge to {{KLRT color code|KJ|14}}{{KLRT color code|SBK|16}} [[Pasar Seni station]]\n** [[Central Market, Kuala Lumpur|Central Market]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rail transport in Malaysia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://mrt.com.my/komuter/kuala_lumpur.htm Kuala Lumpur MRT & Komuter Integrations]\n{{commons category|position=left|Kuala Lumpur Railway Station}}\n\n{{Klang Valley LRT stations}}\n{{KTM ETS station}}\n{{ASEAN Railway stations}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations in Kuala Lumpur]]\n[[Category:Rapid transit stations in Kuala Lumpur]]\n[[Category:Rawang-Seremban Line]]\n[[Category:Port Klang Line]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1886]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1910]]\n[[Category:1886 establishments in British Malaya]]\n[[Category:1910 establishments in British Malaya]]\n[[Category:British colonial architecture in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]]\n", "name_user": "Katana213", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur_railway_station"}
