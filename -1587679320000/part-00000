The northern stretch is industrial and environmental and was [[common land|common meadow]].  In 1847 this largely uncultivated, wooded estate, almost undivided was given by operation of the will of last [[Baron Saye and Sele|Lord Saye and Sele]] to his cousin [[Culling Eardley Eardley|Sir Culling Eardley]], who built properties in Belvedere until his death in 1863. Eardley constructed a large wooden tower (see [[Belvedere (structure)]]) on the [[heath]] to gain views over his estate to the river Thames, giving the area its name from the Italian \"beautiful view\". The name can also be applied today, as the ridge of the area, and parts of its southern uplands, have commanding views towards [[Canary Wharf]] and [[Central London]].{{#tag:ref|For example in (and from certain homes in) the central and southern streets, Heron Hill and Ruskin Road.|group= n}}\n\nEardley was persuaded to allow the construction on his property, of a [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]' chapel, which was built so that the original wooden belvedere became its tower. In order that the public were able to attend this [[chapel]], he constructed paths to it across Lesness Heath.  Eardley had finished in 1861, after nearly 8 years of building, his chapel, now All Saints' Church, after the earlier chapel with belvedere burned down on the same site.<ref>All Saints' Church - Grade II {{National Heritage List for England|num=1064197|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref> At the same time Eardley constructed Villa Houses and reinforced the heath path to become Erith Road. Belvedere village soon grew up along the path which became Bexley Road (from March 1939 known as Nuxley road after the small heath located 1&nbsp;km south) as Eardley gradually sold off the land.\n\n'''Belvedere Explosion of 1864'''\n\nAt about 6.40 am on Saturday the first of October 1864 there was a massive explosion which totally destroyed two commercial gunpowder factories, situated in isolation on the Belvedere side of [[Erith Marshes]], along with their store magazines and a couple of barges that were being loaded with barrels of gunpowder at the time. The explosion was heard over a 50 miles radius, and the shock wave was so intense that people in central London were convinced that there had been an earthquake. One report at the time said that as rescuers hurried to the site they found a massive crater and absolutely no signs of any buildings were left \u201cit was if the place had been swept clean by a broom\u201d. Surprisingly there were only around twenty casualties, as though the explosion was huge, the remote location prevented greater loss of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arthurpewtysmaggotsandwich.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/erith-fun-day.html|title=Erith Fun Day.|website=arthurpewtysmaggotsandwich.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref>\n;1900 to date\nBelvedere was in [[Kent]] and formed part of the [[Municipal Borough of Erith]] before 1965 and development took place before the [[Second World War]], with significant reconstruction after [[the Blitz]]. Despite this, Upper Belvedere and The Village still retains much of its Victorian and Edwardian charm and character. Between 1898 and 1961 [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|Callender's Cable Works]], at the Erith Works, Belvedere, was patron to [[Callender's Cableworks Band]], an amateur brass band made up of employees of the company.

Council road signs call it Belvedere Village, maps and the post office list the area as Belvedere, but some locals call it Nuxley Village after the road. Many residents informally call the area \"The Village\". The origins of Nuxley Village is believed to come from estate agents upselling the area.\n\n==Subdistricts==\nWithin the ward are:\n*Erith Marshes/Crossness Nature Reserve\n*[[Abbey Wood]], [[Bostall Heath and Woods]], [[Lesnes Abbey]], [[Thamesmead]], and [[West Heath, London|West Heath]].\n\n==Landmarks==\n''Upper Belvedere'' features a fine church and some fine Victorian & Edwardian brick villas. It has a number of fine pubs, restaurants and retail outlets: ''The Eardley Arms'' and the ''Prince of Wales'' on Woolwich Road, ''The Victoria'' on Victoria Street, ''The Royal Standard'', ''The Village Inn'' (formerly the Queens Head) and ''The Fox'' all on Nuxley road.<ref>Erroneously called by some 'Nuxley Village' because the main road is 'Nuxley Road'. Nuxley was the name of a small heath that used to exist some 1Km south of the village, which was cleared in the 1815 land enclosure act, the road takes its name from this.</ref>  Upper Belvedere is also home to a large park and a library that was in danger of being shut down due to the government's cuts. Fortunately closure threats have been averted thanks to the efforts of the local community. \nA new 'Splash Park' (opened in 2005, closed in 2016) was a welcomed addition to the village, having been developed on the site of the old Victorian paddling pool. The splash park retained some of the original paddling pool structures. \nThe Splash Park was closed in 2016 and replaced with a new play area called Belvedere Beach, this opened to the public on the 27th of July 2017.\n\n''Lower Belvedere'' is smaller and more industrial and has a [[Methodist]] chapel, a [[Sikh]] Temple and borders to its north the high technology sludge, methane [[Crossness Pumping Station|incinerator]], a small industrial park, large [[Belvedere Incinerator|waste incinerator]] and [[Joseph Bazalgette]]'s [[Crossness|Crossness Sewage Treatment Works]] and is closer to the railway station than Upper Belvedere.

The northern stretch is industrial and environmental and was [[common land|common meadow]].  In 1847 this largely uncultivated, wooded estate, almost undivided was given by operation of the will of last [[Baron Saye and Sele|Lord Saye and Sele]] to his cousin [[Culling Eardley Eardley|Sir Culling Eardley]], who built properties in Belvedere until his death in 1863. Eardley constructed a large wooden tower (see [[Belvedere (structure)]]) on the [[heath]] to gain views over his estate to the river Thames, giving the area its name from the Italian \"beautiful view\". The name can also be applied today, as the ridge of the area, and parts of its southern uplands, have commanding views towards [[Canary Wharf]] and [[Central London]].{{#tag:ref|For example in (and from certain homes in) the central and southern streets, Heron Hill and Ruskin Road.|group= n}}\n\nEardley was persuaded to allow the construction on his property, of a [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]' chapel, which was built so that the original wooden belvedere became its tower. In order that the public were able to attend this [[chapel]], he constructed paths to it across Lesness Heath.  Eardley had finished in 1861, after nearly 8 years of building, his chapel, now All Saints' Church, after the earlier chapel with belvedere burned down on the same site.<ref>All Saints' Church - Grade II {{National Heritage List for England|num=1064197|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref> At the same time Eardley constructed Villa Houses and reinforced the heath path to become Erith Road. Belvedere village soon grew up along the path which became Bexley Road (from March 1939 known as Nuxley road after the small heath located 1&nbsp;km south) as Eardley gradually sold off the land.\n\n'''Belvedere Explosion of 1864'''\n\nAt about 6.40 am on Saturday the first of October 1864 there was a massive explosion which totally destroyed two commercial gunpowder factories, situated in isolation on the Belvedere side of [[Erith Marshes]], along with their store magazines and a couple of barges that were being loaded with barrels of gunpowder at the time. The explosion was heard over a 50 miles radius, and the shock wave was so intense that people in central London were convinced that there had been an earthquake. One report at the time said that as rescuers hurried to the site they found a massive crater and absolutely no signs of any buildings were left \u201cit was if the place had been swept clean by a broom\u201d. Surprisingly there were only around twenty casualties, as though the explosion was huge, the remote location prevented greater loss of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arthurpewtysmaggotsandwich.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/erith-fun-day.html|title=Erith Fun Day.|website=arthurpewtysmaggotsandwich.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref>\n;1900 to date\nBelvedere was in [[Kent]] and formed part of the [[Municipal Borough of Erith]] before 1965 and development took place before the [[Second World War]], with significant reconstruction after [[the Blitz]]. Despite this, Upper Belvedere and The Village still retains much of its Victorian and Edwardian charm and character. Between 1898 and 1961 [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|Callender's Cable Works]], at the Erith Works, Belvedere, was patron to [[Callender's Cableworks Band]], an amateur brass band made up of employees of the company. The band was a prolific broadcaster on [[BBC Radio]] in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=\"Callender's programme\" >[http://www.satiche.org.uk/vinbbp/phot6776.jpg Callender's Band performance programme or handout leaflet, 16 Dec 1932]</ref>\n\n'''Flood of 1953'''\n\nThe [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea Flood of 1953]] hit the area of Belvedere Marshes badly, leaving the 1700 gypsies who lived there with nothing. One person died in the flooding and hundreds had their homes damaged.

Council road signs call it Belvedere Village, maps and the post office list the area as Belvedere, but some locals call it Nuxley Village after the road. Many residents informally call the area \"The Village\". The origins of Nuxley Village is believed to come from estate agents upselling the area.\n\n==Subdistricts==\nWithin the ward are:\n*Erith Marshes/Crossness Nature Reserve\n*[[Abbey Wood]], [[Bostall Heath and Woods]], [[Lesnes Abbey]], [[Thamesmead]], and [[West Heath, London|West Heath]].\n\n==Landmarks==\n''Upper Belvedere'' features a fine church and some fine Victorian & Edwardian brick villas. It has a number of fine pubs, restaurants and retail outlets: ''The Eardley Arms'' and the ''Prince of Wales'' on Woolwich Road, ''The Victoria'' on Victoria Street, ''The Royal Standard'', ''The Village Inn'' (formerly the Queens Head) and ''The Fox'' all on Nuxley road.<ref>Erroneously called by some 'Nuxley Village' because the main road is 'Nuxley Road'. Nuxley was the name of a small heath that used to exist some 1Km south of the village, which was cleared in the 1815 land enclosure act, the road takes its name from this.</ref>  Upper Belvedere is also home to a large park and a library that was in danger of being shut down due to the government's cuts. Fortunately closure threats have been averted thanks to the efforts of the local community. \nA new 'Splash Park' (opened in 2005, closed in 2016) was a welcomed addition to the village, having been developed on the site of the old Victorian paddling pool. The splash park retained some of the original paddling pool structures. \nThe Splash Park was closed in 2016 and replaced with a new play area called Belvedere Beach, this opened to the public on the 27th of July 2017.\n\n''Lower Belvedere'' is smaller and more industrial and has a [[Methodist]] chapel, a [[Sikh]] Temple and borders to its north the high technology sludge, methane [[Crossness Pumping Station|incinerator]], a small industrial park, large [[Belvedere Incinerator|waste incinerator]] and [[Joseph Bazalgette]]'s [[Crossness|Crossness Sewage Treatment Works]] and is closer to the railway station than Upper Belvedere.
