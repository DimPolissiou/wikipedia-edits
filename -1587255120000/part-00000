Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every [[weekday]] except Wednesday (outside of special occasions). On 18 March 2020, BBC made the decision to suspend production of the programme until further notice, in addition to reducing the broadcast frequency to two 30-minute episodes per week. This was due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the reduced broadcast frequency being a temporary measure to preserve the ongoing broadcast of filmed episodes.\n\nWithin eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number one spot in [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]]'s TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top rated series in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 July 2013}}</ref> Today, ''EastEnders'' remains a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and [[taboo]] issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.<ref>Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013). \"Queer Love in Film and Television: Critical Essays\". p. 35.

However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit\u2014an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as \"Hurt one of us and you hurt us all\".<ref name=\"20years p11\" />\n\nWhen developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after ''EastEnders'' began, and featured the characters of [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], did ''Coronation Street'' start to feature black characters, for example.<ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/02/03/bfpa03.xml Hole at the heart of the BBC]\", ''The Telegraph''.

However this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach from ''EastEnders''. The British Film Institute described ''Market In Honey Lane'' thus: \"It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Market on Honey Lane / Honey Lane (1967\u201369)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1400806/index.html|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> ''EastEnders'', while also featuring an East End street market, would be very different in its approach and impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe target launch date was originally January 1985.<ref name=\"Insidestory p24\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=24}}</ref> Smith and Holland had eleven months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing. However, in February 1984, they did not even have a title or a place to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date.

Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring \"flash, trash, and melodrama\" to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.<ref name=\"20years\" />\n\nOnce they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC. Everyone agreed that ''EastEnders'' would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp\u2014set in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain\u2014and it would start with a bang (namely the death of [[Reg Cox]]). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, [[Nick Cotton]] was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray.<ref name=\"20years p20\">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=20}}</ref> When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.\n\n==== Final preparations ====\n[[File:Eastendersearly.jpg|thumb|right|''EastEnders'' original titles sequence, 1985\u20131993|alt=refer to caption]]\nThrough the next few months, the set was growing rapidly at Elstree, and a composer and designer had been commissioned to create the title sequence.

Smith was uneasy about the late start as ''EastEnders'' no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal following before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (who were launching their own market-based soap, ''[[Albion Market]]'') and about the private lives of the cast.<ref name=\"20years page 17\">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=17}}</ref> Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7{{nbsp}}p.m. on 19 February 1985.<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place where it all began, Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane.<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> The reviews were largely favourable,<ref name=\"20years page 17\" /> although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-''EastEnders'' figure of seven million, though ''EastEnders'' then climbed to highs of up to 23{{nbsp}}million later on in the year.<ref name=\"Rating 1986\">{{harvnb|Slide|1996|p=35}}</ref> Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes.

With public interest so high, the media began investigating the private lives of the show's popular stars. Within days, a scandalous headline appeared \u2013 \"EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER\". This referred to [[Leslie Grantham]], and his prison sentence for the murder of a taxi driver in an attempted robbery nearly 20 years earlier. This shocking tell-all style set the tone for relations between [[Albert Square]] and the press for the next 20 years.\n\nThe show's first episode attracted some 17{{nbsp}}million viewers, and it continued to attract high viewing figures from then on.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/08/eastenders-bbc-25-years | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dan | last=Sabbagh | title=Is EastEnders the lifeblood of the BBC? | date=8 February 2010}}</ref> By Christmas 1985, the tabloids could not get enough of the soap.

This theme encompasses the whole Square, making the entire community a family of sorts, prey to upsets and conflict, but pulling together in times of trouble. Co-creator [[Tony Holland]] was from a large East End family, and such families have typified ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"Insidestory p49\" /> The first central family was the combination of the [[Fowler family]], consisting of [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]), her husband [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] ([[Bill Treacher]]), and teenage children [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] ([[David Scarboro]]/[[Todd Carty]]) and [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] ([[Susan Tully]]). Pauline's family, the [[Beale family|Beales]], consisted of Pauline's twin brother [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]), his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and their teenage son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Pauline and Pete's domineering mother [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]) lived with Pauline and her family. Holland drew on the names of his own family for the characters.<ref name=\"Insidestory p51-56\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|pp=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Watts family|Watts]] and [[Mitchell family|Mitchell]] families have been central to many notable ''EastEnders'' storylines, the show having been dominated by the Watts in the 1980s, with the 1990s focusing on the Mitchells. The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell, Ahmed and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters. In 2014, the [[Fowler family|Fowlers]] were revived and merged with the Slaters, with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) marrying [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]). The Taylor family were introduced in 2017 and have been central to the show's main storylines. Key people involved in the production of ''EastEnders'' have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme.<ref name=\"Insidestory p49\" />\n\n''EastEnders'' has an emphasis on strong family [[matriarch]]s, with examples including [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]), helping to attract a female audience.

As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name=\"First10Years p142\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.<ref name=\"First10Years p143\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name=\"EastEnders Case Study\">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgets and costs ===\nAccording to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC \u00a340,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as \u00a3137.70 per minute of transmission time (\u00a34,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as \"bleeding\", \"bloody hell\", \"bastard\" and \"for Christ's sake\". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a \"very positive storyline\". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as \"STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS\" and \"CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children.

Notably, from 1985 to 1988, author and television writer Hugh Miller wrote 17 novels, detailing the lives of many of the show's original characters before 1985, when events on screen took place.\n\nKate Lock also wrote four novels centred on more recent characters; [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]). Lock also wrote a character guide entitled ''Who's Who in EastEnders'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-55178-2}}) in 2000, examining main characters from the first 15 years of the show.\n\nShow creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland also wrote a book about the show in 1987, entitled ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-20601-9}}), telling the story of how the show made it to screen. Two special anniversary books have been written about the show; ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-37057-4}}) by Colin Brake in 1995 and ''EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square'' ({{ISBN|978-0-563-52165-5}}) by Rupert Smith in 2005.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Television|United Kingdom}}\n* [[East End of London in popular culture]]\n* [[List of soap operas]]\n* [[List of British television programmes]]\n* [[List of most-watched television broadcasts]]\n* [[List of television programmes broadcast by the BBC]]\n* [[List of programmes broadcast by RT\u00c9]]\n* [[List of programmes broadcast by TV3 Ireland]]\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Showcase]]\n* [[List of LGBT characters in soap operas]]\n* [[List of television shows set in London]]\n* [[List of television programs by episode count]]\n* [[List of television programs by name]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em|group=lower-greek}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n<!-- only book sources used to reference the article here -->\n* {{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Robert C |last2=Hill |first2=Annette |title=The television studies reader |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415283236 |oclc=846446529 |language=English |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Barker|first=Chris|title=Global television|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-631-20150-2|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barraclough|first1=John|title=EastEnders Special (1987 Annual)|date=1986|publisher=Grandreams|location=London|isbn=978-0-86227-384-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Brake|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Brake|title=EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|ref=harv|title-link=EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Buckingham|first1=David|title=Public Secrets: EastEnders and Its Audience|date=1987|publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI books]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-85170-210-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Christine|title=Women and Soap Opera: A Study of Prime-Time Soaps|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity Press]]|year=1991|isbn=978-0-7456-0489-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Kingsley|first1=Hilary|title=EastEnders handbook|date=1991|publisher=BBC Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Monroe|first1=Josephine|title=The Eastenders programme guide|date=1994|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=978-0-86369-825-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Slide|first1=Anthony|title=Some Joe you don't know : an American biographical guide to 100 British television personalities|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=|isbn=978-0-313-29550-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Julia|authorlink=Julia Smith|last2=Holland|first2=Tony|author2link=Tony Holland|title=EastEnders&nbsp;\u2013 The Inside Story|year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=978-0-563-20601-9|ref=harv|title-link=EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Rupert|title=EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square|publisher=BBC Books|year=2005|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{BBC Online|programmes/b006m86d|''EastEnders''}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171022040614/https://www.bbcstudios.com/case-studies/eastenders/ ''EastEnders''] at [[BBC Studios]]\n* [https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/our-work/eastenders/ ''EastEnders''] at [[BBC Studioworks]]\n* {{tv.com show|eastenders|EastEnders}}\n* {{Bfidb series|id=7133|title=EastEnders}}\n* {{IMDb title|0088512}}\n* {{YouTube|user=eastenders|title=''EastEnders''|suffix='}}\n\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{EastEnders characters|state=collapsed}}\n{{Soap operas in the United Kingdom}}\n{{EastEnders: E20|state=collapsed}}\n{{BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Series 1998\u20132009}}\n\n[[Category:EastEnders| ]]\n[[Category:1985 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:1990s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2000s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2010s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:2020s British television soap operas]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (television series)]]\n[[Category:BBC television dramas]]\n[[Category:BBC television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Social realism]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in London]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{Short description|British soap opera}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = EastEnders\n| image = EastEnders Title.png\n| image_alt = A satellite image of a city with a winding river in blue in the bottom half of the image.

Set in [[Albert Square]] in the [[East End of London]] in the fictional borough of [[Walford]], the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Initially there were two 30-minute episodes per week, later increasing to three, but since 2001, episodes have been broadcast on every [[weekday]] except Wednesday (outside of special occasions). On 18 March 2020, BBC made the decision to suspend production of the programme until further notice, in addition to reducing the broadcast frequency to two 30-minute episodes per week. This was due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the reduced broadcast frequency being a temporary measure to preserve the ongoing broadcast of filmed episodes.\n\nWithin eight months of the show's launch, it reached the number one spot in [[Broadcaster's Audience Research Board|BARB]]'s TV ratings and has consistently remained among the top rated series in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a502337/coronation-street-79m-watch-paul-and-lloyds-showdown.html|title='Coronation Street': 7.9m watch Paul and Lloyd's showdown|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=30 July 2013}}</ref> Today, ''EastEnders'' remains a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and [[taboo]] issues in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.<ref>Pamela Demory, Christopher Pullen (2013). \"Queer Love in Film and Television: Critical Essays\". p. 35.

However, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit\u2014an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as \"Hurt one of us and you hurt us all\".<ref name=\"20years p11\" />\n\nWhen developing ''EastEnders'', both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like ''Coronation Street'', but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after ''EastEnders'' began, and featured the characters of [[Tony Carpenter]] and [[Kelvin Carpenter]], did ''Coronation Street'' start to feature black characters, for example.<ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/02/03/bfpa03.xml Hole at the heart of the BBC]\", ''The Telegraph''.

However this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach from ''EastEnders''. The British Film Institute described ''Market In Honey Lane'' thus: \"It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Market on Honey Lane / Honey Lane (1967\u201369)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1400806/index.html|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> ''EastEnders'', while also featuring an East End street market, would be very different in its approach and impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe target launch date was originally January 1985.<ref name=\"Insidestory p24\">{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=24}}</ref> Smith and Holland had eleven months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing.

Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date.

Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring \"flash, trash, and melodrama\" to the Square (they were later renamed [[Den Watts|Den]], [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Sharon Watts]]). The characters of [[Andy O'Brien (EastEnders)|Andy O'Brien]] and [[Debbie Wilkins]] were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and [[Lofty Holloway]] to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.<ref name=\"20years\" />\n\nOnce they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC. Everyone agreed that ''EastEnders'' would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp\u2014set in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain\u2014and it would start with a bang (namely the death of [[Reg Cox]]). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, [[Nick Cotton]] was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray.<ref name=\"20years p20\">{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|p=20}}</ref> When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.\n\n==== Final preparations ====\n[[File:Eastendersearly.jpg|thumb|right|''EastEnders'' original titles sequence, 1985\u20131993|alt=refer to caption]]\nThrough the next few months, the set was growing rapidly at Elstree, and a composer and designer had been commissioned to create the title sequence.

The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater clan]], before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. Since 2006, ''EastEnders'' has largely been dominated by the Mitchell, Ahmed and [[Branning family|Branning]] families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon family, and from 2013 onwards, on the Carters. In 2014, the [[Fowler family|Fowlers]] were revived and merged with the Slaters, with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) marrying [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]).

He classed 1989's changes as a brave experiment, and suggested that while some found this period of ''EastEnders'' entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility.<ref name=\"First10Years p70\" /> Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between \"light and heavy storylines\" gave the illusion that the show had lost a \"certain edge\".<ref name=\"First10Years p70\" />\n\nAs the show progressed into the 1990s, ''EastEnders'' still featured hard-hitting issues such as [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) revealing he was [[HIV]] positive<ref name=\"issues\" /> in 1991, the death of his wife [[Gill Fowler|Gill]] (Susanna Dawson) from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, [[adoption]], [[abortion]], [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) battle with [[breast cancer]],<ref name=\"issues\" /> and [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]) alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy.

As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years'', after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made.<ref name=\"First10Years p142\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=142}}</ref> The episode was then copied onto [[D-3 (video)|D3 video]]. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the [[BBC]]'s technical standard for broadcasting.<ref name=\"First10Years p143\">{{Harvnb|Brake|1995|p=143}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, ''EastEnders'' no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.<ref name=\"EastEnders Case Study\">{{cite web|title=EastEnders|url=https://www.bbcstudioworks.com/?case_study=eastenders|publisher=[[BBC Studios]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgets and costs ===\nAccording to the book ''How to Study Television'', in 1995 ''EastEnders'' cost the BBC \u00a340,000 per episode on average.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun, Sea, Sex, Sand and Conservatism in the Australian Television Soap Opera|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/62594/2/62594.pdf#page=3|publisher=[[Queensland University of Technology]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] and the Personal Managers' Association set out the pay rate for ''EastEnders'' scripts as \u00a3137.70 per minute of transmission time (\u00a34,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series.

She regarded ''EastEnders'' as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as \"bleeding\", \"bloody hell\", \"bastard\" and \"for Christ's sake\". However, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing [[Michelle Fowler]]'s decision not to have an abortion as a \"very positive storyline\". She also felt that ''EastEnders'' had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that ''EastEnders'' had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of ''Coronation Street'' in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as \"STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS\" and \"CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes 'Steamy' EastEnders\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckingham|1987|p=129}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a [[domestic violence]] storyline between [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). As ''EastEnders'' is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo's face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council. However, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. [[Erin Pizzey]], who became internationally famous for having started one of the first [[Women's shelter|women's refuges]], said that ''EastEnders'' had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EastEnders: Faith, Morality and Hope in the Community|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/yorke_stalbans.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=4 September 2002}}</ref> The character of [[Phil Mitchell]] (played by [[Steve McFadden]] since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children.

Greater values of <math>\\delta</math> lead to stronger reductions of the basis.\nInitially, A. Lenstra, H. Lenstra and L. Lov\u00e1sz demonstrated the LLL-reduction algorithm for <math>\\delta = \\frac{3}{4}</math>.\nNote that although LLL-reduction is well-defined for <math>\\delta = 1</math>, the polynomial-time complexity is guaranteed only\nfor <math>\\delta</math> in <math>(0.25,1)</math>.\n\nThe LLL algorithm computes LLL-reduced bases. There is no known efficient algorithm to compute a basis in which the basis vectors are as short as possible for lattices of dimensions greater than 4.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Phong Q.|last2=Stehl\u00e9|first2=Damien|date=1 October 2009|title=Low-dimensional lattice basis reduction revisited|journal=ACM Transactions on Algorithms|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=1\u201348|doi=10.1145/1597036.1597050}}</ref> However, an LLL-reduced basis is nearly as short as possible, in the sense that there are absolute bounds <math>c_i > 1</math> such that the first basis vector is no more than <math>c_1</math> times as long as a shortest vector in the lattice,\nthe second basis vector is likewise within <math>c_2</math> of the second successive minimum, and so on.\n\n==Applications==\nAn early successful application of the LLL algorithm was its use by [[Andrew Odlyzko]] and [[Herman te Riele]] in disproving [[Merten's conjecture]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Odlyzko |first1=Andrew |last2=te Reile |first2=Herman J.

For example, if it is believed that ''r''=1.618034 is a (slightly rounded) [[Root of a function|root]] to an unknown [[quadratic equation]] with integer coefficients, one may apply LLL reduction to the lattice in <math>\\mathbf{Z}^4</math> spanned by <math>[1,0,0,10000r^2], [0,1,0,10000r],</math> and <math>[0,0,1,10000]</math>. The first vector in the reduced basis will be an integer [[linear combination]] of these three, thus necessarily of the form <math>[a,b,c,10000(ar^2+br+c)]</math>; but such a vector is \"short\" only if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are small and <math>ar^2+br+c</math> is even smaller. Thus the first three entries of this short vector are likely to be the coefficients of the integral quadratic [[polynomial]] which has ''r'' as a root. In this example the LLL algorithm finds the shortest vector to be [1, -1, -1, 0.00025] and indeed <math>x^2-x-1</math> has a root equal to the [[golden ratio]], 1.6180339887....\n\n==Properties of LLL-reduced basis==\nLet <math>\\mathbf{B}=\\{ \\mathbf{b}_1,\\mathbf{b}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_n \\}</math> be a <math>\\delta</math>-LLL-reduced basis of a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] <math>\\mathcal L</math>.

For example, if it is believed that ''r''=1.618034 is a (slightly rounded) [[Root of a function|root]] to an unknown [[quadratic equation]] with integer coefficients, one may apply LLL reduction to the lattice in <math>\\mathbf{Z}^4</math> spanned by <math>[1,0,0,10000r^2], [0,1,0,10000r],</math> and <math>[0,0,1,10000]</math>. The first vector in the reduced basis will be an integer [[linear combination]] of these three, thus necessarily of the form <math>[a,b,c,10000(ar^2+br+c)]</math>; but such a vector is \"short\" only if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are small and <math>ar^2+br+c</math> is even smaller. Thus the first three entries of this short vector are likely to be the coefficients of the integral quadratic [[polynomial]] which has ''r'' as a root. In this example the LLL algorithm finds the shortest vector to be [1, -1, -1, 0.00025] and indeed <math>x^2-x-1</math> has a root equal to the [[golden ratio]], 1.6180339887....\n\n==Properties of LLL-reduced basis==\nLet <math>\\mathbf{B}=\\{ \\mathbf{b}_1,\\mathbf{b}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_n \\}</math> be a <math>\\delta</math>-LLL-reduced basis of a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] <math>\\mathcal L</math>.

His association with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] began in 1938 when, after being encouraged by his school teacher to respond to a newspaper advertisement inviting boys for trials,<ref name=\"sstarball\"/> he was taken on as a member of their ground staff. He was only 14 years old when he made his debut for Wolves in a B team game against Walsall Wood in the Walsall Minor League.\n\nHe had been accepted on an eight-month trial by [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]], who initially told Wright he was \"too small\" but changed his mind.<ref name=\"sstarball\" /> He made his first team debut for the club aged just 15 in a 2\u20131 win at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in 1939. This game was played shortly after the start of World War II, so it is not counted as the official debut. His official debut came in the 1945\u201346 FA Cup in a two legged tie against [[Lovells Athletic F.C.|Lovells Athletic]].\n\nHe signed as a professional at 17, but the deepening effects of World War II soon forced Wolves to suspend competitive football.

A bad ankle break put his sporting career in doubt but he recovered, joined the army in 1943 as a physical training instructor,<ref name=\"obit1\" /> and played for Wolves whenever possible, making over 100 appearances in wartime football.\n\nHe became club captain soon after the end of the conflict, with the playing retirement of [[Stan Cullis]]. With Wright leading the team, they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title three times ([[1953\u201354 in English football|1953\u201354]], [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] and [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]) as well as the [[FA Cup]] in [[1949 FA Cup Final|1949]]. He was a virtual ever-present, missing only 31 games for Wolves during the 1950s. He retired from playing in 1959, a year before Wolves won another FA Cup. He made a total of 541 appearances both at and away from Molineux for Wolves.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:(Billy Wright).jpg|thumb|left|Wright at Wolves]] -->\n==International career==\nHis performances for club saw him earn a call-up to the [[England national football team|England team]]. He made his international debut on 19 January 1946 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a (post-war) '[[Victory International]]'. His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7\u20132 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with [[Bobby Moore]]). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed [[Bob Crompton]]'s [[Progression of England association football caps record|appearance record]] for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made  70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first football player in the world to earn 100 caps, and it was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, [[Bobby Charlton]]. As of present, Wright remains the ninth most capped player ever to have played for England being in possession of more caps than players such as [[Bryan Robson]], [[Kenny Sansom]], [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], [[Martin Peters]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Alan Shearer]].<ref name=England>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamplyrs/appsmost.html|title=England: Most Appearances|website=England Football Online.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio /><ref name=WWFC />\n\nHe retired as a player in August 1959. During his total of 105 games for England, his disciplinary record was excellent as he was never cautioned or sent off.\nThe football he was given at the end of his 100th international match, between England and Scotland on 11 April 1959 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], was due to be auctioned in May 2015 after being held by an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player who after an injury was unable to play professionally. The player had been given the ball by Wright's widow after being trialled by the club.<ref name=sstarball />\n\n==Managerial career==\nHe became manager of England's youth team in 1960, before being appointed manager of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1962, replacing [[George Swindin]]. Initially Arsenal started strongly under Wright, finishing seventh in [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] and [[1963\u201364 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|qualifying for Europe]] for the first time in their history, but failed to build on this. Wright enjoyed mixed success with his signings, who included successes such as [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], [[Joe Baker]] and [[Frank McLintock]], but also less successful players such as [[Ian Ure]].\n\nArsenal were unable to improve on their seventh in Wright's first season in charge, and their form gradually declined. Wright won only 38.46% of his matches in charge, the lowest rate for any [[post-war]] Arsenal manager (caretaker managers excepted). After a poor [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]] season \u2013 where Arsenal finished 14th and were knocked out of the [[FA Cup]] by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (who finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]) \u2014 Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966.\n\nFootball writer [[Brian Glanville]], discussing Billy Wright's time at Arsenal, wrote: \"he had neither the guile nor the authority to make things work and he reacted almost childishly to criticism\".<ref name=\"glanville\">{{cite web | url= http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm | author=[[Brian Glanville]] | title= Billy Wright or wrong? | publisher = tssonnet.com | year = 2003 | accessdate =13 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514225436/http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm |archivedate=14 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Life after football==\n[[File:BillyWrightStatue.jpg|thumbnail|Statue of Billy Wright outside Wolves' [[Molineux Stadium]]]]\n\nWright was a minor media personality, and his marriage to Joy Beverley of the [[Beverley Sisters]] occurred at a time long before the era of footballers being known for having celebrity girlfriends.

His association with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] began in 1938 when, after being encouraged by his school teacher to respond to a newspaper advertisement inviting boys for trials,<ref name=\"sstarball\"/> he was taken on as a member of their ground staff. He was only 14 years old when he made his debut for Wolves in a B team game against Walsall Wood in the Walsall Minor League.\n\nHe had been accepted on an eight-month trial by [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]], who initially told Wright he was \"too small\" but changed his mind.<ref name=\"sstarball\" /> He made his first team debut for the club aged just 15 in a 2\u20131 win at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in 1939.

A bad ankle break put his sporting career in doubt but he recovered, joined the army in 1943 as a physical training instructor,<ref name=\"obit1\" /> and played for Wolves whenever possible, making over 100 appearances in wartime football.\n\nHe became club captain soon after the end of the conflict, with the playing retirement of [[Stan Cullis]]. With Wright leading the team, they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title three times ([[1953\u201354 in English football|1953\u201354]], [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] and [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]) as well as the [[FA Cup]] in [[1949 FA Cup Final|1949]]. He was a virtual ever-present, missing only 31 games for Wolves during the 1950s. He retired from playing in 1959, a year before Wolves won another FA Cup. He made a total of 541 appearances both at and away from Molineux for Wolves.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:(Billy Wright).jpg|thumb|left|Wright at Wolves]] -->\n==International career==\nHis performances for club saw him earn a call-up to the [[England national football team|England team]]. He made his international debut on 19 January 1946 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a (post-war) '[[Victory International]]'. His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7\u20132 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with [[Bobby Moore]]). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed [[Bob Crompton]]'s [[Progression of England association football caps record|appearance record]] for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made  70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first football player in the world to earn 100 caps, and it was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, [[Bobby Charlton]]. As of present, Wright remains the ninth most capped player ever to have played for England being in possession of more caps than players such as [[Bryan Robson]], [[Kenny Sansom]], [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], [[Martin Peters]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Alan Shearer]].<ref name=England>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamplyrs/appsmost.html|title=England: Most Appearances|website=England Football Online.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio /><ref name=WWFC />\n\nHe retired as a player in August 1959. During his total of 105 games for England, his disciplinary record was excellent as he was never cautioned or sent off.\nThe football he was given at the end of his 100th international match, between England and Scotland on 11 April 1959 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], was due to be auctioned in May 2015 after being held by an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player who after an injury was unable to play professionally. The player had been given the ball by Wright's widow after being trialled by the club.<ref name=sstarball />\n\n==Managerial career==\nHe became manager of England's youth team in 1960, before being appointed manager of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1962, replacing [[George Swindin]]. Initially Arsenal started strongly under Wright, finishing seventh in [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] and [[1963\u201364 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|qualifying for Europe]] for the first time in their history, but failed to build on this. Wright enjoyed mixed success with his signings, who included successes such as [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], [[Joe Baker]] and [[Frank McLintock]], but also less successful players such as [[Ian Ure]].\n\nArsenal were unable to improve on their seventh in Wright's first season in charge, and their form gradually declined. Wright won only 38.46% of his matches in charge, the lowest rate for any [[post-war]] Arsenal manager (caretaker managers excepted). After a poor [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]] season \u2013 where Arsenal finished 14th and were knocked out of the [[FA Cup]] by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (who finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]) \u2014 Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966.\n\nFootball writer [[Brian Glanville]], discussing Billy Wright's time at Arsenal, wrote: \"he had neither the guile nor the authority to make things work and he reacted almost childishly to criticism\".<ref name=\"glanville\">{{cite web | url= http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm | author=[[Brian Glanville]] | title= Billy Wright or wrong? | publisher = tssonnet.com | year = 2003 | accessdate =13 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514225436/http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm |archivedate=14 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Life after football==\n[[File:BillyWrightStatue.jpg|thumbnail|Statue of Billy Wright outside Wolves' [[Molineux Stadium]]]]\n\nWright was a minor media personality, and his marriage to Joy Beverley of the [[Beverley Sisters]] occurred at a time long before the era of footballers being known for having celebrity girlfriends.

{"title_page": "Ad serving", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}\n'''2Gud service 8637857493Ad serving''' describes the technology and service that places [[Advertising|advertisement]]s on [[Website|Web site]]s. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Web sites and advertisers to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money, and monitor progress of different [[advertising campaign]]s. Ad servers are divided into two types\u2014publisher ad servers and advertiser (or third party) ad servers.\n\n== Overview ==\nAn ad server is a Web server that stores advertising content used in online marketing and delivers that content onto various digital platforms such as Websites, social media outlets and mobile apps. An ad server is merely the technology in which the advertising material is stored and is the means of distributing that material into appropriate advertising slots online. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Websites and advertising companies to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money and monitor the progress of different online advertising campaigns. The purpose of ad serving is to deliver ads to users, to manage the advertising space of a Web site and, in the case of third party ad servers, to provide an independent counting and [[web tracking|tracking]] system for advertisers/marketers. Ad servers also act as a system in which advertisers can count clicks/impressions in order to generate reports, which helps to determine the return on investment for an advertisement on a particular Web page.\n\nThere are separate ad servers that publishers and third party (e.g. advertisers, marketers) use. Essentially, there is no difference in the technology that the ad servers provide, the key difference being the accessibility of data for optimized tracking and convenience. Advertisers and marketers use a centralized ad server that enables them to draw progress reports on demand and update their creative content in one place, rather than using individual publisher ad servers in which they will have to manage content across multiple servers with different publishers. Without this centralized hub which controls advertisers' rotation and distribution of content across the Web, there becomes issues around tracking and management of advertising material. If an advertiser had to make contact with each individual publisher whose ad server they are using, this would mean multiple sets of data to track and would also mean they need to update their creative content for each individual channel. This provides less-accurate, less-timely, and ultimately inconvenient results for advertisers. Publishers have separate ad servers to communicate advertising material across their domains only. This enables convenience for the publisher, as they will have access only to the advertising content they require for their publication rather than sort through an ad server containing all the advertising content in which Marketers/Advertisers are using.\n\n== History ==\nThe first central ad server was released by FocaLink Media Services and introduced on July 17, 1995,<ref>[http://www.zinman.com/images/FocalinkPressRelease.JPG Hyperlink Advertising Explodes on the World Wide Web], company press release</ref> for controlling the delivery of online advertising or banner ads.

All of these functions are an integral part of running an online advertising campaign in making sure that the advertising content is being displayed where and for whom it is intended. It also helps with analysis to see just how effective the campaign is and whether or not the content is generating the desired results.  Ad serving also offers more advanced functions for more sophisticated advertising campaigns. Advanced functions include frequency capping, [[Creative sequencing|sequencing ads]] (also referred to as surround sessions), [[search engine optimization]] and targeting (See Ad targeting and optimization, below). Frequency capping is limiting how many times a user will see the content. Advertisers are also able to limit ads by setting a cap on money-spending.\n\n== Ad targeting and optimization ==\nOne aspect of ad-serving technology is automated and semi-automated means of optimizing bid prices, placement, targeting, or other characteristics.  Significant methods include:\n* [[Behavioral targeting]]&nbsp;\u2014 using a profile of prior behavior on the part of the viewer to determine which ad to show during a given visit.

Ad serving technology companies provide software to Web sites and advertisers to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money, and monitor progress of different [[advertising campaign]]s. Ad servers are divided into two types\u2014publisher ad servers and advertiser (or third party) ad servers.\n\n== Overview ==\nAn ad server is a Web server that stores advertising content used in online marketing and delivers that content onto various digital platforms such as Websites, social media outlets and mobile apps. An ad server is merely the technology in which the advertising material is stored and is the means of distributing that material into appropriate advertising slots online. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Websites and advertising companies to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money and monitor the progress of different online advertising campaigns. The purpose of ad serving is to deliver ads to users, to manage the advertising space of a Web site and, in the case of third party ad servers, to provide an independent counting and [[web tracking|tracking]] system for advertisers/marketers. Ad servers also act as a system in which advertisers can count clicks/impressions in order to generate reports, which helps to determine the return on investment for an advertisement on a particular Web page.\n\nThere are separate ad servers that publishers and third party (e.g. advertisers, marketers) use. Essentially, there is no difference in the technology that the ad servers provide, the key difference being the accessibility of data for optimized tracking and convenience. Advertisers and marketers use a centralized ad server that enables them to draw progress reports on demand and update their creative content in one place, rather than using individual publisher ad servers in which they will have to manage content across multiple servers with different publishers. Without this centralized hub which controls advertisers' rotation and distribution of content across the Web, there becomes issues around tracking and management of advertising material. If an advertiser had to make contact with each individual publisher whose ad server they are using, this would mean multiple sets of data to track and would also mean they need to update their creative content for each individual channel. This provides less-accurate, less-timely, and ultimately inconvenient results for advertisers. Publishers have separate ad servers to communicate advertising material across their domains only. This enables convenience for the publisher, as they will have access only to the advertising content they require for their publication rather than sort through an ad server containing all the advertising content in which Marketers/Advertisers are using.\n\n== History ==\nThe first central ad server was released by FocaLink Media Services and introduced on July 17, 1995,<ref>[http://www.zinman.com/images/FocalinkPressRelease.JPG Hyperlink Advertising Explodes on the World Wide Web], company press release</ref> for controlling the delivery of online advertising or banner ads.
