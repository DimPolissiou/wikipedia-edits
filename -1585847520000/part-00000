Advanced composite [[thermoplastic]]s can also be compression molded with unidirectional tapes, woven fabrics, randomly oriented fiber mat or chopped strand. The advantage of compression molding is its ability to mold large, fairly intricate parts. Also, it is one of the lowest cost molding methods compared with other methods such as [[transfer molding]] and [[injection molding]]; moreover it wastes relatively little material, giving it an advantage when working with expensive compounds. \n\nHowever, compression molding often provides poor product consistency and difficulty in controlling [[molding flash|flashing]], and it is not suitable for some types of parts. Fewer [[knit line]]s are produced and a smaller amount of fiber-length degradation is noticeable when compared to injection molding.  Compression-molding is also suitable for ultra-large basic shape production in sizes beyond the capacity of extrusion techniques.  Materials that are typically manufactured through compression molding include: Polyester fiberglass resin systems (SMC/BMC), [[Torlon]], [[Vespel]], [[Poly(p-phenylene sulfide)]] (PPS), and many grades of [[PEEK]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to Compression Molding|url=http://www.efunda.com/processes/plastic_molding/molding_compression.cfm|publisher=eFunda|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref> \n\nCompression molding is commonly utilized by product development engineers seeking cost effective rubber and silicone parts. Manufacturers of low volume compression molded components include [[PrintForm]], 3D, STYS, and Aero MFG.\n\nCompression molding was first developed to manufacture composite parts for metal replacement applications, compression molding is typically used to make larger flat or moderately curved parts. This method of molding is greatly used in manufacturing automotive parts such as hoods, fenders, scoops, spoilers, as well as smaller more intricate parts.  \nThe material to be molded is positioned in the mold cavity and the heated platens are closed by a hydraulic ram.  Bulk molding compound (BMC) or sheet molding compound (SMC), are conformed to the mold form by the applied pressure and heated until the curing reaction occurs.

One significant example are automotive applications where the leading technologies are long fibre reinforced thermoplastics (LFT) and glass fiber mat reinforced thermoplastics (GMT).\n\nIn compression molding there are six important considerations that an engineer should bear in mind{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}:\n*Determining the proper amount of material.\n*Determining the minimum amount of energy required to heat the material. \n*Determining the minimum time required to heat the material. \n*Determining the appropriate heating technique.\n*Predicting the required force, to ensure that shot attains the proper shape.\n*Designing the mold for rapid cooling after the material has been compressed into the mold.\n\n==Process definition==\nCompression molding is a forming process in which a plastic material is placed directly into a heated metal mold then is softened by the heat and therefore forced to conform to the shape of the mold, as the mold closes. Once molding is completed excess Flash may be removed. Typically, compression molding machines open along a vertical axis.\n\n==Process characteristics==\nThe use of thermoset plastic compounds characterizes this molding process from many of the other molding processes.  These thermosets can be in either preform or granule shapes.  Unlike some of the other processes we find that the materials are usually preheated and measured before molding.  This helps to reduce excess flash.  Inserts, usually metallic, can also be molded with the plastic.  As a side note, remember not to allow any undercuts on the shape, it will make ejection especially difficult. Thermoplastic matrices with an inherent indefinite shelf-life and shorter cycle moulding times are widely used and examples are shown in Ref 3.\n\n==Process schematic==\nCompression molding is one of the oldest manufacturing technique for rubber molding. The process parameters includes molding time, temperature, and pressure. Usually,  a 300-400 ton clamp pressure is used. The typical mold is shaped like a clam shell. The molding press looked a lot like a ladle filled vertical press used for casting aluminum. The bottom of the mold was always the cavity. Compression molding used preforms made by an extruder/wink cutter or a roller die/die cutter. Wink meaning that 2 blades meet on center to cut the extrudate to length. For example; Molding water bottles used die cut sheets from a roller die. The sheet was 3 inch by 6 inch. The first sheet was placed- one below a core and one sheet of equal size above the core, and then the top of the mold lowered by hand or by hoist to near shut. The mold was then pushed into the press. The start button hydraulically closed the vertical press to full pressure. The mold temperature was about 350 degrees. The platens of the presses were steam heated.   When the cycle ended (about 3.5-4.0 Minutes) the press would open and the mold would be pulled out toward the operator. The operator would try to open the clam shell mold top, and then lean the top of the mold back against the press.  Exposed is the bottle with the core still inside.  While the bottle was still hot the operator would insert prongs like reverse pliers in between the bottle rubber and the steel core. The operator would then stretch the bottle at the neck over the core to free the bottle.  In preparation of compression molding baby nipples and golf ball centers the preforms were extruded. The baby nipple was a kidney shape about 2 inches tall and 1/2 inch wide in the middle.  The golf ball center preform had a 1 x 1 inch round slug.  Both slugs were designed to stand up in the mold cavity.  During the cycle the operator would load the jig with slugs.  When the mold is opened, the lower platen would lower and the mold would be hydraulically pushed ou to the operator. Therein, the heat sheet (all molded parts from that cycle were joined together by a parting line rind (flash)) were placed in a transfer cart. The next cycle began by the jig being put over the mold. The slide tray was pulled and the preforms were released into the cavity of the mold. The start button moved the lower platen back into the press and the cure cycle bagan again.  Therein the first cycle was complete.  Each operator ran an average of 4 presses. Loading an unload was done during the cycle.  The heat sheets removed from the mold were then transported to a die station. The die out station would remove the rind leaving the finished parts. With the evolution of compression molding, next was injection transfer. Basically the extruder was made part of the molding cycle.  The rubber was injected into an upper heated platen station, and then pressure was applied to transfer molten rubber to the clamped mold. The design of injection transfer and improved molds were more so plastic injection molding except the platens and molds of injection transfer are heated. In contrast plastic Injections molding shoots a hot plastic into a cold mold.\n\n==Workpiece geometry==\nit is a hard process to do\n\n==Setup and equipment==\n\n==Typical tools and geometry produced==\nThree types of molds used are the flash plunger-type, straight plunger-type, and the \"landed\" plunger-type molds.  The flash type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic and produces a horizontal flash (excess material protruding from the mold).  The straight plunger-type mold allows for some inaccuracy in the charge of plastic and produces a vertical flash.  The landed plunger type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic, and no flash is produced. Further details are explained in Ref 3.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Matrix molding]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Todd, Robert H., Dell K. Allen, and Leo Alting.

While the bottle was still hot the operator would insert prongs like reverse pliers in between the bottle rubber and the steel core. The operator would then stretch the bottle at the neck over the core to free the bottle.  In preparation of compression molding baby nipples and golf ball centers the preforms were extruded. The baby nipple was a kidney shape about 2 inches tall and 1/2 inch wide in the middle.  The golf ball center preform had a 1 x 1 inch round slug.  Both slugs were designed to stand up in the mold cavity.  During the cycle the operator would load the jig with slugs.  When the mold is opened, the lower platen would lower and the mold would be hydraulically pushed ou to the operator. Therein, the heat sheet (all molded parts from that cycle were joined together by a parting line rind (flash)) were placed in a transfer cart. The next cycle began by the jig being put over the mold. The slide tray was pulled and the preforms were released into the cavity of the mold. The start button moved the lower platen back into the press and the cure cycle bagan again.  Therein the first cycle was complete.  Each operator ran an average of 4 presses. Loading an unload was done during the cycle.  The heat sheets removed from the mold were then transported to a die station. The die out station would remove the rind leaving the finished parts. With the evolution of compression molding, next was injection transfer. Basically the extruder was made part of the molding cycle.  The rubber was injected into an upper heated platen station, and then pressure was applied to transfer molten rubber to the clamped mold. The design of injection transfer and improved molds were more so plastic injection molding except the platens and molds of injection transfer are heated. In contrast plastic Injections molding shoots a hot plastic into a cold mold.\n\n==Workpiece geometry==\n\n==Setup and equipment==\n\n==Typical tools and geometry produced==\nThree types of molds used are the flash plunger-type, straight plunger-type, and the \"landed\" plunger-type molds.  The flash type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic and produces a horizontal flash (excess material protruding from the mold).  The straight plunger-type mold allows for some inaccuracy in the charge of plastic and produces a vertical flash.  The landed plunger type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic, and no flash is produced. Further details are explained in Ref 3.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Matrix molding]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Todd, Robert H., Dell K. Allen, and Leo Alting.

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million (US$109.3 million) worldwide on a \u00a33 million budget (US$5 million). At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father is visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million (US$109.3 million) worldwide on a \u00a33 million budget (US$5 million). At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father is visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

Curtis Collection People 009.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Nunivak children, photograph by Edward S. Curtis, 1930]]\nNunivak has only one permanent settlement, [[Mekoryuk, Alaska|Mekoryuk]], on the north shore, with about 200 residents. In the 1880 [[United States Census]], [[Ivan Petrof (explorer)|Ivan Petrof]] recorded 702 residents in nine villages on the island. An epidemic in 1900 decimated the population of the island. [[Emigration]] keeps the population small.  Of the noted persons who have visited Nunivak are photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]], Anne Makepeace, anthropologist Margaret Lantis, and the artist Muriel Hannah. Noted conservationist and outdoorsman [[Steven Rinella]] aired an episode of his television show Meat Eater in 2015 where he experienced a muskox hunt and explored the history and culture of the island and its people. \n[[File:Nunivak maskette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Masks among Eskimo peoples|Maskette]]{{spaced ndash}}Nunivak]]\nNearly all the permanent residents of Nunivak are [[Nunivak Cup'ig people|Cup'it Eskimo]], whose traditional language is a dialect of [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]] known as Cup'ig or [[Nunivak Cup'ig language|Nunivak Cup'ig]].  Cup'ig is the first language for many older islanders and is enjoying a dedicated revival among younger islanders as well, although nearly all ''Nuniwarmiut'' (Nunivak people) speak English. The people of Nunivak Island still depend to a large degree on subsistence hunting, and also commercial fishing and industrial work on the mainland.\n\n==Geology and natural history==\n\n[[File:Nunivak 2000 USCGS.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Nunivak \u2013 detail from NOAA Bering Sea chart (2000)]]\n[[File:NunivakCliffsFWS726.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bering Sea cliffs, Nunivak]]\n[[File:DunesNunivakFWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Sand dunes and vegetation, Nunivak Island]]\n[[File:RoundupNunivak1964FWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Reindeer roundup, June 1964]]\n[[File:NashHarborNunivakCurtisLOC3c07326v.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Nash Harbor, Nunivak; 1927 showing bay, houses, and the mouth of the Ellikarrmiut River.]]\nNunivak Island is volcanic in origin; most of the island is dominated by [[volcanic plateau]] 500&nbsp;ft (160 m) or more above sea level. The island is dotted with about 60 [[Volcanic cone|cinder cones]] and four [[maar]]s. Much of its surface consists of widespread, thin flows of [[lava|pahoehoe lava]] from small [[shield volcano]]es, which spread over [[sedimentary rock]] of the [[Cretaceous]] period. Volcanic eruptions took place during 5 periods of activity beginning 6.1 million years ago. Most of the volcanic field was formed during the two most recent eruptive periods during the [[Pleistocene]] ending about 300,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=314020|title=Global Volcanism Program {{!}} Nunivak Island|website=volcano.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref><ref name=\"avo\">{{cite web|title=Nunivak Island description and statistics|work=Alaska Volcano Observatory|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2007-04-13|url=http://www.avo.alaska.edu/volcanoes/volcinfo.php?volcname=Nunivak+Island}}</ref> Because of the history of volcanic activity, it is considered part of the [[Bering Sea Volcanic Province]].<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18973779 The <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar chronology and eruption rates of Cenozoic volcanism in the eastern Bering Sea Volcanic Province, Alaska]</ref> The [[Ibkilwit Lava Bed]] is located on Nunivak Island.\n\n[[Tundra]] is the main landscape feature; the largest trees on Nunivak are dwarf [[willow]] trees, most less than 4&nbsp;ft (1.2 m) tall. More than 40 rivers drain the tundra upland.  Brackish lagoons ring the eastern and southern shores, and steep volcanic cliffs dominate the northwest shores.\n\nAt least 89 migratory seabird and waterfowl species have seasonal homes on Nunivak Island, including several endangered and threatened species. Dense summer breeding rookeries are found on all shores of the island and in inland tundra lakes.\n\nPrehistorically, Nunivak was home to a modest herd of [[reindeer|caribou]], but these were exterminated after the introduction of firearms in the late 19th or early 20th century. United States Fish and Wildlife introduced [[reindeer]] and [[musk ox]] onto the island in the 1930s and 1940s. Large herds of these animals are maintained by the local Native Corporation of [[Mekoryuk, Alaska|Mekoryuk]].\n\nMost of the island is part of the [[Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge]], administered by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]].\n\n==Culture==\n\nThe art of Nunivak Island has its roots in the ancient past.  The oldest known sculpture is thousands of years old.\n\nIn the ancient times masks were made to sell or trade for goods needed to survive. Later masks were intended for festivities, [[Yup'ik dancing|dances]], and traditional healing.\n\nThis type of mask (there are many types of masks carved today) represents the life surrounding Nunivak Island.  The walrus is what the loon depends on for survival.  And, in turn, man depends on the loon and the walrus for survival.  These are two of the traditional animals that were hunted by the men of the village in order to provide for their families.\n\nThe walrus is what the Nunivak peoples depended on to survive.  It held much of the necessities of living in the Bering Sea.  The skin of the walrus was used for waterproofing kayaks, the soles of mukluks ([[Cup'ig boots]]), and the intestine was used as waterproof rain gear that were of great necessity in earlier times.  The bones were used as tools, the ivory for spear heads, and harpoon heads and carvings were made for trade.  Also the loon pelts were transformed into beautiful winter coats that were also waterproof.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 400\n|1910= 127 \n|1920= 189\n|1930= 191\n|1940= 225\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nNunivak Island first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated island, with 400 Yupik residents.<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-17.pdf</ref> In 1890, the villages on the island reported separately.

Curtis, 1930]]\nNunivak has only one permanent settlement, [[Mekoryuk, Alaska|Mekoryuk]], on the north shore, with about 200 residents. In the 1880 [[United States Census]], [[Ivan Petrof (explorer)|Ivan Petrof]] recorded 702 residents in nine villages on the island. An epidemic in 1900 decimated the population of the island. [[Emigration]] keeps the population small.  Of the noted persons who have visited Nunivak are photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]], Anne Makepeace, anthropologist Margaret Lantis, and the artist Muriel Hannah. Noted conservationist and outdoorsman [[Steven Rinella]] aired an episode of his television show Meat Eater in 2015 where he experienced a muskox hunt and explored the history and culture of the island and its people. \n[[File:Nunivak maskette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Masks among Eskimo peoples|Maskette]]{{spaced ndash}}Nunivak]]\nNearly all the permanent residents of Nunivak are [[Nunivak Cup'ig people|Cup'it Eskimo]], whose traditional language is a dialect of [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]] known as Cup'ig or [[Nunivak Cup'ig language|Nunivak Cup'ig]].  Cup'ig is the first language for many older islanders and is enjoying a dedicated revival among younger islanders as well, although nearly all ''Nuniwarmiut'' (Nunivak people) speak English. The people of Nunivak Island still depend to a large degree on subsistence hunting, and also commercial fishing and industrial work on the mainland.\n\n==Geology and natural history==\n\n[[File:Nunivak 2000 USCGS.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Nunivak \u2013 detail from NOAA Bering Sea chart (2000)]]\n[[File:NunivakCliffsFWS726.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bering Sea cliffs, Nunivak]]\n[[File:DunesNunivakFWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Sand dunes and vegetation, Nunivak Island]]\n[[File:RoundupNunivak1964FWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Reindeer roundup, June 1964]]\n[[File:NashHarborNunivakCurtisLOC3c07326v.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Nash Harbor, Nunivak; 1927 showing bay, houses, and the mouth of the Ellikarrmiut River.]]\nNunivak Island is volcanic in origin; most of the island is dominated by [[volcanic plateau]] 500&nbsp;ft (160 m) or more above sea level. The island is dotted with about 60 [[Volcanic cone|cinder cones]] and four [[maar]]s. Much of its surface consists of widespread, thin flows of [[lava|pahoehoe lava]] from small [[shield volcano]]es, which spread over [[sedimentary rock]] of the [[Cretaceous]] period. Volcanic eruptions took place during 5 periods of activity beginning 6.1 million years ago. Most of the volcanic field was formed during the two most recent eruptive periods during the [[Pleistocene]] ending about 300,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=314020|title=Global Volcanism Program {{!}} Nunivak Island|website=volcano.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref><ref name=\"avo\">{{cite web|title=Nunivak Island description and statistics|work=Alaska Volcano Observatory|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2007-04-13|url=http://www.avo.alaska.edu/volcanoes/volcinfo.php?volcname=Nunivak+Island}}</ref> Because of the history of volcanic activity, it is considered part of the [[Bering Sea Volcanic Province]].<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18973779 The <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar chronology and eruption rates of Cenozoic volcanism in the eastern Bering Sea Volcanic Province, Alaska]</ref> The [[Ibkilwit Lava Bed]] is located on Nunivak Island.\n\n[[Tundra]] is the main landscape feature; the largest trees on Nunivak are dwarf [[willow]] trees, most less than 4&nbsp;ft (1.2 m) tall. More than 40 rivers drain the tundra upland.  Brackish lagoons ring the eastern and southern shores, and steep volcanic cliffs dominate the northwest shores.\n\nAt least 89 migratory seabird and waterfowl species have seasonal homes on Nunivak Island, including several endangered and threatened species. Dense summer breeding rookeries are found on all shores of the island and in inland tundra lakes.\n\nPrehistorically, Nunivak was home to a modest herd of [[reindeer|caribou]], but these were exterminated after the introduction of firearms in the late 19th or early 20th century. United States Fish and Wildlife introduced [[reindeer]] and [[musk ox]] onto the island in the 1930s and 1940s. Large herds of these animals are maintained by the local Native Corporation of [[Mekoryuk, Alaska|Mekoryuk]].\n\nMost of the island is part of the [[Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge]], administered by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]].\n\n==Culture==\n\nThe art of Nunivak Island has its roots in the ancient past.  The oldest known sculpture is thousands of years old.\n\nIn the ancient times masks were made to sell or trade for goods needed to survive. Later masks were intended for festivities, [[Yup'ik dancing|dances]], and traditional healing.\n\nThis type of mask (there are many types of masks carved today) represents the life surrounding Nunivak Island.  The walrus is what the loon depends on for survival.  And, in turn, man depends on the loon and the walrus for survival.  These are two of the traditional animals that were hunted by the men of the village in order to provide for their families.\n\nThe walrus is what the Nunivak peoples depended on to survive.  It held much of the necessities of living in the Bering Sea.  The skin of the walrus was used for waterproofing kayaks, the soles of mukluks ([[Cup'ig boots]]), and the intestine was used as waterproof rain gear that were of great necessity in earlier times.  The bones were used as tools, the ivory for spear heads, and harpoon heads and carvings were made for trade.  Also the loon pelts were transformed into beautiful winter coats that were also waterproof.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 400\n|1910= 127 \n|1920= 189\n|1930= 191\n|1940= 225\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nNunivak Island first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated island, with 400 Yupik residents.<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-17.pdf</ref> In 1890, the villages on the island reported separately.

One of his PE teachers saw potential in Amutairi and suggested that he join the Kuwaiti Sports Club for the Disabled.<ref name=\"Al-Naqeeb\"/> Initially he joined the basketball team, but after five months one of the trainers advised him to diversify into other sports to reach his full potential.<ref name=\"Al-Naqeeb\"/> Amutairi tried out [[wheelchair racing]] and found that he excelled at the sport.<ref name=\"Al-Naqeeb\"/> He became classified as a [[T33 (classification)|T33 classification]] athlete and in 2009 he entered his first track and field competition, held in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Amutairi's results at the meet saw him qualify for the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships]] in Christchurch. At the World Championship Amutairi entered four events, the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100m]], [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships \u2013 Men's 200 metres|200m]], [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metres|400m]] and the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships \u2013 Men's javelin throw|javelin throw]]. All three sprint events were for T34 athletes, with no T33 competitions available. Despite setting a championship record in all three races, Almutairi failed to finish on the podium, being beaten in each event by the less disadvantaged T34 competitors.<ref name=\"Al-Naqeeb\"/> This situation repeated itself throughout Almutairi's early career, and it was not until 2015 that he was able to compete on a level playing field at a major international event.<ref name=\"IPC Bio\"/>\n[[File:Kuwait Paralympic team at the London 2012 Opening Ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Almutairi, first wheelchair behind the flag bearer, at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics.]]\nIn 2012 Almutairi was selected for the Kuwait team at the [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Summer Paralympics in London]]. In the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres T34|100m (T34)]] he set a new T33 world record of 17.67, but this was not good enough to see him through the heats. This same situation occurred in the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 200 metres T34|200m]], where he set another world record (31.02), but failed to finish fast enough to reach the finals. He also competed in the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's javelin throw|T33/34 javelin]], but his only legal throw of 17.34 saw him drop out in the first round.\n\nThe next year Almutairi travelled to Lyon to compete in the [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships]]. He was again forced to compete in the T34 events and failed to get out of the heats in the 100m, 200m and 400m races.

This same situation occurred in the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics \u2013 Men's 200 metres T34|200m]], where he set another world record (31.02), but failed to finish fast enough to reach the finals.

''The Legend of the Sacred Sword''}}, is a [[high fantasy]] [[action role-playing game]] series created by [[Koichi Ishii]], with development formerly from [[Square (video game company)|Square]], and is currently owned by [[Square Enix]]. The series began as a handheld [[side story]] to Square's [[flagship]] franchise ''[[Final Fantasy]];'' however, the ''Final Fantasy'' elements were subsequently dropped starting with the second installment, ''Secret of Mana'', in order to become its own series. It has grown to include games of various genres within the [[fictional universe|fictional world]] of Mana, with recurring stories involving a [[world tree]], its associated holy sword, and the fight against forces that would steal their power. Several character designs, creatures, and musical themes reappear frequently.\n\nFour games were released in the series between 1991 and 1999: the original ''Seiken Densetsu'' (1991)\u2014''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' in North America and ''Mystic Quest'' in Europe\u2014for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' (1993) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Trials of Mana]]'' (1995) for the Super Famicom, and ''[[Legend of Mana]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. A remake of the original game, ''[[Sword of Mana]]'' (2003), was published for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. All of the original games were action role-playing games, though they included a wide variety of gameplay mechanics, and the stories of the games were connected only thematically.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, four more games were released as part of the ''World of Mana'' subseries, an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These were ''[[Children of Mana]]'' (2006), an action-oriented [[dungeon crawl]]er game for the [[Nintendo DS]]; ''[[Dawn of Mana]]'' (2006), a 3D [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]; ''Friends of Mana'' (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer [[role-playing game]] for mobile phones; and ''[[Heroes of Mana]]'' (2007), a [[real-time strategy]] game for the DS. ''Children'' was developed by [[Nex Entertainment]] and ''Heroes'' by [[Brownie Brown]], founded by several developers of ''Legends'', though Ishii oversaw development of all four games. Three more games have been released since the ''World of Mana'' subseries ended: ''Circle of Mana'' (2013), a Japan-only card battle game for the [[GREE]] mobile platform, ''[[Rise of Mana]]'' (2014), a Japan-only [[free-to-play]] action role-playing game for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[PlayStation Vita]], and ''[[Adventures of Mana]]'' (2016), a 3D remake of ''Final Fantasy Adventure'' for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In addition to the games, four manga series and one novelization have been released in the ''Mana'' franchise.\n\nThe ''Mana'' series reception has been very uneven, with early games rated higher by critics than more recent titles. ''Secret of Mana'' have been regarded as one of the best 2D action role-playing games ever made, and their music has inspired several orchestral concerts, while the games from the ''World of Mana'' series have been rated considerably lower. As of March 2011, ''Mana'' series titles have sold over 6 million units.\n\n==Development==\n\n=== History ===\n\nSquare trademarked ''Seiken Densetsu'' in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0 |title=\u7b2c\uff12\uff11\uff13\uff12\uff18\uff14\uff14\u53f7 |date=April 28, 1989 |work=\u5546\u6a19\u51fa\u9858\u30fb\u767b\u9332\u60c5\u5831 |publisher=Industrial Property Digital Library (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s11fWfU4?url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0&121328440000000000000000000000000000000000_TM_simple.html&128192419529851902764802 |archivedate=August 16, 2010 }}</ref> intending to use it for a game project subtitled ''The Emergence of Excalibur'', and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]].

In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded.

''Children'' is an action-oriented [[dungeon crawl]]er game for the DS, developed by [[Nex Entertainment]]; ''Dawn'' is a 3D [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]; ''Friends'' is a Japan-only multiplayer role-playing game for mobile phones; and ''Heroes'' is a [[real-time strategy]] game for the DS, developed by Brownie Brown.

Densetsu'''''|\u8056\u5263\u4f1d\u8aac||lit. ''The Legend of the Sacred Sword''}}, is a [[high fantasy]] [[action role-playing game]] series created by [[Koichi Ishii]], with development formerly from [[Square (video game company)|Square]], and is currently owned by [[Square Enix]]. The series began as a handheld [[side story]] to Square's [[flagship]] franchise ''[[Final Fantasy]];'' however, the ''Final Fantasy'' elements were subsequently dropped starting with the second installment, ''Secret of Mana'', in order to become its own series. It has grown to include games of various genres within the [[fictional universe|fictional world]] of Mana, with recurring stories involving a [[world tree]], its associated holy sword, and the fight against forces that would steal their power. Several character designs, creatures, and musical themes reappear frequently.\n\nFour games were released in the series between 1991 and 1999: the original ''Seiken Densetsu'' (1991)\u2014''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' in North America and ''Mystic Quest'' in Europe\u2014for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' (1993) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Trials of Mana]]'' (1995) for the Super Famicom, and ''[[Legend of Mana]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. A remake of the original game, ''[[Sword of Mana]]'' (2003), was published for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. All of the original games were action role-playing games, though they included a wide variety of gameplay mechanics, and the stories of the games were connected only thematically.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, four more games were released as part of the ''World of Mana'' subseries, an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These were ''[[Children of Mana]]'' (2006), an action-oriented [[dungeon crawl]]er game for the [[Nintendo DS]]; ''[[Dawn of Mana]]'' (2006), a 3D [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]; ''Friends of Mana'' (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer [[role-playing game]] for mobile phones; and ''[[Heroes of Mana]]'' (2007), a [[real-time strategy]] game for the DS. ''Children'' was developed by [[Nex Entertainment]] and ''Heroes'' by [[Brownie Brown]], founded by several developers of ''Legends'', though Ishii oversaw development of all four games. Three more games have been released since the ''World of Mana'' subseries ended: ''Circle of Mana'' (2013), a Japan-only card battle game for the [[GREE]] mobile platform, ''[[Rise of Mana]]'' (2014), a Japan-only [[free-to-play]] action role-playing game for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[PlayStation Vita]], and ''[[Adventures of Mana]]'' (2016), a 3D remake of ''Final Fantasy Adventure'' for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In addition to the games, four manga series and one novelization have been released in the ''Mana'' franchise.\n\nThe ''Mana'' series reception has been very uneven, with early games rated higher by critics than more recent titles. ''Secret of Mana'' have been regarded as one of the best 2D action role-playing games ever made, and their music has inspired several orchestral concerts, while the games from the ''World of Mana'' series have been rated considerably lower. As of March 2011, ''Mana'' series titles have sold over 6 million units.\n\n==Development==\n\n=== History ===\n\nSquare trademarked ''Seiken Densetsu'' in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0 |title=\u7b2c\uff12\uff11\uff13\uff12\uff18\uff14\uff14\u53f7 |date=April 28, 1989 |work=\u5546\u6a19\u51fa\u9858\u30fb\u767b\u9332\u60c5\u5831 |publisher=Industrial Property Digital Library (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s11fWfU4?url=http://www1.ipdl.inpit.go.jp/syutsugan/TM_DISPLAY_A.cgi?0&121328440000000000000000000000000000000000_TM_simple.html&128192419529851902764802 |archivedate=August 16, 2010 }}</ref> intending to use it for a game project subtitled ''The Emergence of Excalibur'', and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]].

Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"lostlevels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200311/200311-square.shtml |title=Elusions: Final Fantasy IV / Seiken Densetsu |accessdate=2007-06-09 |author=Collette, Chris |date=2003-11-15 |publisher=Lost Levels |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614115209/http://www.lostlevels.org/200311/200311-square.shtml |archivedate=June 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[1991 in video gaming|1991]], Square reused the ''Seiken Densetsu'' trademark for an unrelated [[Game Boy]] [[action role-playing game]] directed by [[Koichi Ishii]].

It became the title track for the [[Baby I'm-a Want You|album of the same name]], released in January 1972. \n\nIt was one of Bread's highest-charting singles in both the U.S. and [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In the U.S., it reached #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in November 1971, the third of Bread's four top-five hits (\"[[Make It with You]]\", #1 in 1970; \"[[If (Bread song)|If]]\", #4 earlier in 1971; and \"[[Everything I Own]]\", from the same album, #5 in 1972). \"Baby I'm-a Want You\" reached the top of the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|easy listening chart]] and rose to #14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 1972. \n\nIt was certified as a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. As with virtually all of the band's well-known recordings, the song was both written and produced by the band's lead vocalist, [[David Gates]].\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin|width=67%}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1971-72)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|U.S. [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1971)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|U.S. ([[Joel Whitburn]]'s ''Pop Annual'')<ref>{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |date=1999 |title=Pop Annual |url= |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |publisher=Record Research Inc. |page= |isbn=0-89820-142-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|37\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1972)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Australia <ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Kent |authorlink= David Kent (historian) |title= [[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970-1992]] |publisher= Australian Chart Book |location= [[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], N.S.W. |year= 1993 |isbn= 0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|57\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notable cover versions==\n*[[The Lettermen]] covered it on their 1972 album ''[[Spin Away]]''.\n*[[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] covered it on his 1972 album ''In Time''.\n*[[Wayne Newton ]] covered it on his 1972 album ''Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast''.\n*[[Aaron Neville]] released a cover as a single in 1972.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Aaron-Neville-Baby-Im-A-Want-You-/master/1147932</ref>\n*[[Isaac Hayes]] and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]] covered the song in 1972 as the B-side of their single \"Ain't That Loving You (for More Reasons Than One)\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Isaac Hayes & David Porter \u2013 Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One) / Baby I'm-A Want You|url=https://www.discogs.com/Isaac-Hayes-David-Porter-Aint-That-Loving-You-For-More-Reasons-Than-One-Baby-Im-A-Want-You/release/7005166|website=Discogs|accessdate=24 September 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Ray, Goodman & Brown|The Moments]] recorded a soul version for their 1973 album ''My Thing''.\n*[[Shirley Bassey]] covered it on her 1973 album ''[[Never Never Never]]''.\n*[[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]] covered it on his 1973 compilation album ''1000 Volts of Holt''.\n*[[Stephanie Winslow]] covered it on her 1981 album ''Dakota''.\n*[[Conway Twitty ]] covered it on his 1985 album ''Chasin Rainbows''.\n*[[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] included a version on her 1995 album ''[[Let's Go Bang]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1971 (U.S.)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996).

It is a locally run business which incorporates two pools at different temperatures and has a campground with over 80 sites. It is a historic site and a very popular destination for tourists and locals.\n[[File:Tahkini Hot Springs 4.JPG|thumb|left|Main pool area]][[File:Tahkini Hot Springs 2.jpg|thumb|left|Runoff from the pool area]][[File:Tahkini Hot Springs 3.JPG|thumb|left|Zipline across the lake]]\n\n== Water ==\n\nThe hot springs flows from the earth to the surface at a rate of 385 litres (86 gallons) per minute. The temperature from the source is 46.5\u00b0 Celsius (118\u00b0 Fahrenheit). The pool is divided into two sections: the hot side and the cool side. As the water flows from the source to the hot pool the water cools to 42\u00b0 Celsius (107.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit), the cool side is an average of 36\u00b0 Celsius (96.8\u00b0 Fahrenheit). Takhini Hot Springs is fortunate to contain no sulphurous odour as is common to most hot springs.\n\nBased on geothermal research, the hot springs water comes from intersecting faults in the earth. Rain water and snow from the mountains go deep into the earth, where the water is heated and the minerals dissolve. The water then returns to the surface and out of the ground in a small crater (the source). The source is currently{{when|date=September 2017}} located near the pool facilities.\n\nAccording to tests, it has taken a minimum of 60 years for the water in the pools to come from the ground into the source. During its underground journey to the surface, the water reaches a maximum temperature of 95\u00b0 Celsius (203\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and then cools down as it rises to the surface and into the source.\n\n== History ==\n\nTakhini Hot Springs has a long history in Yukon. Used by the First Nations People for centuries, the site was known for natural hot water flowing from the ground. In 1907 it was commercially promoted for its therapeutic value. The first pool was made of wood and canvas and was built in the 1940s for the use of the United States Army while they constructed the [[Alaska Highway]]. In 1950 a concrete pool was built and that was later replaced by the existing pool and building in the 1970s. In 2008, many renovations were undertaken to improve the pool's facilities. Renovations are still made to this day.{{when|date=September 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Takhini Hot Springs in 1907.jpg|Takhini Hot Springs in 1907\n\n</gallery>\n\nMineral Content of Water:<ref name=\"Takhini Hot Springs\">{{cite web|title=Takhini Hot Springs|url=http://www.takhinihotsprings.com/water.html|accessdate=10 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130203223629/http://www.takhinihotsprings.com/water.html|archivedate=3 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
