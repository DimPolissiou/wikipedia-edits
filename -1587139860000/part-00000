{"title_page": "Hollywood marriage", "text_new": "A '''Hollywood marriage''' originally meant a glamorous high society [[marriage]] between [[celebrity|celebrities]] involved in the [[Cinema of the United States|U.S. film industry]]; the word \"[[Hollywood]]\" is often used to represent the US film industry.

In 1972 Bob Thomas of the [[Associated Press]] remarked specifically about the tendency to ignore lasting celebrity marriages with the examples he gave including [[Bob Hope]]'s marriage to [[Dolores Hope]] and [[Rosalind Russell]]'s marriage to producer Frederick Brisson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pTkzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T7cFAAAAIBAJ&pg=931,4090555&dq=|title=AP via The Palm Beach Post \u2013 April 23, 1972}}</ref>\n\nNegative views of Hollywood marriages take the position that the divorce rates are indeed unusually high among celebrities and that this is caused by faults within Hollywood as a culture or by personal faults of the celebrities themselves. They point to the usage of weddings as [[publicity stunt]]s, the egotism or immaturity of celebrities or \"celebrity culture\", and high rates of infidelity or [[promiscuity]]. [[Bee Wilson]], in an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', critiqued \"Hollywood marriages\" for often being based on the unrealistic dreams of what she termed \"permanent children\", although she points to some [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood]] couples, like [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]] or [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]], as exceptions to these criticisms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Bee |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3663142/Movie-stars-plus-marriage-equals-disaster.html |title=\"Movie Stars plus marriage equals disaster\" Daily Telegraph: 11 February 2007 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2011-02-21 |location=London}}</ref> While the introduction to the ''Cultural Sociology of Divorce: An Encyclopedia'' edited by [[Robert E.

In 1961 [[Anne Baxter]] stated Hollywood was \"the most difficult place in America for marriage\" due, in part, to the \"terrible extremes of success and failure\" both spouses may face.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pEYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=POkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3658,2332812&dq=|title=The Miami News \u2013 June 5, 1961}}</ref> In a 1964 interview [[Mitzi Gaynor]], who would remain married to the husband mentioned in the interview until his death (in 2006), took the more \"defensive\" position that \"Hollywood\" couples look different mostly because \"everything we do is magnified.\" Although she conceded they might be slightly different because \"you have to be a little off-center to get into this business in the first place.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LUcqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BE8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7379,1030430&dq=|title=The Pittsburgh Press \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\nBeyond anecdote or opinion the actual evidence on the matter is complicated by differing definitions of who qualifies as a \"celebrity\" or \"Hollywood.\" That stated a study from [[Radford University]] placed \"dancers and choreographers\" as the occupations having the highest percent currently divorced<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/16/AR2010091607509.html|title=Study breaks down divorce rates by occupation|first=Ellen|last=McCarthy|date=September 19, 2010|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> with \"Entertainers and performers, sports and related workers, all other\" still being above average at tenth.

The following examples of that are primarily restricted to marriages involving a notable actor, entertainer or director linked to \"Hollywood\" in some way. Note that the vast majority of the examples are from the 1970s onward; this is in part because [[no-fault divorce]] became legalized in that era, which increased the number of divorces overall.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! width=\"250px\" | Names\n! width=\"80px\" | Length\n! width=\"210px\" | Marriage\n!

In 1972 Bob Thomas of the [[Associated Press]] remarked specifically about the tendency to ignore lasting celebrity marriages with the examples he gave including [[Bob Hope]]'s marriage to [[Dolores Hope]] and [[Rosalind Russell]]'s marriage to producer Frederick Brisson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pTkzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T7cFAAAAIBAJ&pg=931,4090555&dq=|title=AP via The Palm Beach Post \u2013 April 23, 1972}}</ref>\n\nNegative views of Hollywood marriages take the position that the divorce rates are indeed unusually high among celebrities and that this is caused by faults within Hollywood as a culture or by personal faults of the celebrities themselves. They point to the usage of weddings as [[publicity stunt]]s, the egotism or immaturity of celebrities or \"celebrity culture\", and high rates of infidelity or [[promiscuity]]. [[Bee Wilson]], in an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', critiqued \"Hollywood marriages\" for often being based on the unrealistic dreams of what she termed \"permanent children\", although she points to some [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood]] couples, like [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]] or [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]], as exceptions to these criticisms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Bee |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3663142/Movie-stars-plus-marriage-equals-disaster.html |title=\"Movie Stars plus marriage equals disaster\" Daily Telegraph: 11 February 2007 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2011-02-21 |location=London}}</ref> While the introduction to the ''Cultural Sociology of Divorce: An Encyclopedia'' edited by [[Robert E.

The following examples of that are primarily restricted to marriages involving a notable actor, entertainer or director linked to \"Hollywood\" in some way.

In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as \"pagodas.\"\n\nStupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\n====Development of the Pagoda====\nThe Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''t\u0101'' in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''th\u00e1p'' in Vietnamese, ''t\u014d'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''.<ref>Buddhist architecture, p.183</ref> In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).<ref name=\"Buddhist architecture, p.180\">Buddhist architecture, p.180</ref>\n\n==Notable stupas==\n[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life.

Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

There are eight different kinds of stupas in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], each referring to major events in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Lotus Blossom Stupa===\nAlso known as \"Stupa of Heaped Lotuses\" or \"Birth of the Sugata Stupa,\" this stupa refers to the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. \"At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions\"<ref name=\"Beer\">Beer, Robert: The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (2004) Serindia Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}</ref> (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Nirvana===\nThis stupa refers to the death of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n==Kalachakra stupa==\n{{Main|Kalachakra stupa}}\n\nA ninth kind of stupa exists, the [[Kalachakra stupa]].

Columbia University Press</ref> The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as \"pagodas.\"\n\nStupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\n====Development of the Pagoda====\nThe Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''t\u0101'' in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''th\u00e1p'' in Vietnamese, ''t\u014d'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''.<ref>Buddhist architecture, p.183</ref> In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).<ref name=\"Buddhist architecture, p.180\">Buddhist architecture, p.180</ref>\n\n==Notable stupas==\n[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE. In India, [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]], [[Amaravathi Mahachaitya|Amaravati]] and [[Bharhut]] are among the oldest known stupas.

In [[Sri Lanka]], the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]] includes some of the tallest, most ancient and best preserved stupas in the world, such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]].\n\nThe most elaborate stupa is the 8th century [[Borobudur]] monument in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The upper rounded terrace with rows of bell-shaped stupas contained Buddha images symbolizing [[Ar\u016bpajh\u0101na]], the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment. The main stupa is the crown part of the monument, while the base is a pyramidal structure elaborated with galleries adorned with bas relief scenes derived from Buddhist texts and depicting the life of [[Gautama Buddha]].

Sometimes the type is chosen directly connected with events that have taken place in the area.<ref name=\"KUC\">{{cite web | title=Miracle Stupa - Stupa | url=http://www.stupa.pl/en_stupa.html | publisher=stupa.pl | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EndAscetism.JPG|thumb|The sharing of the relics of the Buddha.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Benefits===\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

There are eight different kinds of stupas in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], each referring to major events in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Lotus Blossom Stupa===\nAlso known as \"Stupa of Heaped Lotuses\" or \"Birth of the Sugata Stupa,\" this stupa refers to the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. \"At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions\"<ref name=\"Beer\">Beer, Robert: The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (2004) Serindia Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}</ref> (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Nirvana===\nThis stupa refers to the death of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n==Kalachakra stupa==\n{{Main|Kalachakra stupa}}\n\nA ninth kind of stupa exists, the [[Kalachakra stupa]].

In the 2010 application for a secret warrant, the Obama administration named Rosen as \"an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator\" to the leaking of classified materials.

In the 2010 application for a secret warrant, the Obama administration named Rosen as \"an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator\" to the leaking of classified materials.

It opened in 1969, and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]]. The hall was used for concerts, dance and entertainment events, as well as conferences and congresses. After several years of reconstruction, including the installation of a new concert hall, it reopened in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=J\u00fcrgen Tietz|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/dresdens-neuer-konzertsaal-spaete-harmonien-ld.1289905|title=Sp\u00e4te Harmonien {{!}} NZZ|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2020-03-14|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe building is, however, not in the unadorned [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] unlike the other buildings on the \"Altmarkt\" square. Is it stand-alone building with a floor area of around 700 meters squared, and it forms the second part of the \"Altmarkt\" square as well as facing Wilsdruffer Strasse, which cuts between them. Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt,]] which has been undergoing a reconstruction project since 2005, it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the [[firebombing of Dresden]] on 13 February 1945. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the Kulturpalast was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were then to be implemented in the GDR. Important principles were: a central square, cityscape-forming high-rise buildings and wide main roads. The Kulturpalast was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was a planned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on [[Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe]] but they were never built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate the Kulturpalast's fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", colloquially known as ''Kulti'', it fulfils the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture. Afterward the house was closed and completely cleared out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnn.de|title=Letzte Vorstellung im Dresdner Kulturpalast \u2013 Proteste gegen Umbau halten an.|last=|first=|date=2012-07-23|website=|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Building ==\n[[File:Weg der Roten Fahne.jpg|thumb|Wall painting ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag)]]\n\n=== Until 2012 ===\nBefore 2012, the multi-functional ballroom with up to 2435 seats (formerly 2740) could be transformed into an auditorium completely furnished with fixed rows of seats and elevation or into a banquet hall with a flat floor in the area of the parquet in front of the stage thanks to the special \"tilting parquet\".\n\nThe banquet hall was optimized for multi-functionality in its room acoustics and had been adapted for use as a concert hall or for electronically amplified music or speech events through variable absorption or reflection surfaces.\n\nIn addition to the large hall, the Kulturpalast had a studio theatre with 192 seats, seminar, rehearsal and performance rooms, foyer levels, office wings and a restaurant with conference facilities.\n\nOutwardly, the ballroom is distinguished by the roof, which protrudes from the cuboid base structure and has the base area of a symmetrical trapezoid.\n\n=== Wall Painting ===\n[[File:Der Weg der roten Fahne-Inschriften.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the wall painting]]\nThe 30 meter by 10.5 meter mural ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|Roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag) on the west side of the building has been designated a cultural monument since 2001. In 1968 Gerhard Bondzin was commissioned to develop the designs. The mural was realized until 1969 by a working group of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. The working title was: \u201e1849 - 1969: 120 Jahre Kampf der revolution\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4fte der Stadt f\u00fcr Fortschritt und Sozialismus\u201c (1849 - 1969: 120 years of struggle of the revolutionary forces of the city for progress and socialism).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saechsische.de/der-weg-der-roten-fahne-haelt-fuer-die-ewigkeit-2658892.html|title=\"Der Weg der roten Fahne\" h\u00e4lt f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit|website=www.saechsische.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> In addition to Bondzin (artistic director), the artists' collective included Alfred Hesse (participation in transmission work), Gerhard Stengel (artistic technology), Gerhard Pr\u00e4kelt (architect), Emil Spiess (study organization), Martin H\u00e4nisch (type design), Wolfgang Richter (specialist instructor) and students in the 3rd and 4th year of the mural design course.

The bronze casting of the doors was carried out by the foundry Pirner & Franz in Dresden.\n\n=== Well ===\nIn front of the building, there are three [[water feature]]s which were created in 1969 on Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe. The fountains were later removed in the course of the construction work for the underground car park at Altmarkt. These were [[terrazzo]] pools measuring 7.90 by 8.55 metres. In each basin there was a jet fountain on an area of 3 by 3 meters, 24 small heap fountains were installed at the edge of the basin.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Kunst im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum|publisher=Kulturamt Dresden|year=1996|isbn=|location=Dresden, Germany|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\nDresden Altmarkt Sicht auf Kulturpalast 1 Panorama.jpg|Panorama of the Palace of Culture from the Altmarkt (February 2017)\nAltmarkt dresden kulturpalast2.JPG|View over the Altmarkt to the Kulturpalast, behind it the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], which was rebuilt until 2005 \nAltmarkt (Dresden)2009 06.jpg|Close-up with Frauenkirche and row building at Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe, 2009\n20121008160DR DD Blick v d Frauenkirche Richtung Altmarkt.jpg|View from the Frauenkirche over the reborn Neumarkt, Kulturpalast and Altmarkt, 2012\nDD-Kulturpalast-Foyer.jpg|Foyer of the Kulturpalast\nDD-Kulturpalast-Obergeschoss-1.jpg|First floor with the wall frieze 'Unser sozialistisches Leben' ''Our socialist life''\nDD-Kulturpalast-Bibo-1.jpg|Central Library of the Municipal Libraries\n</gallery>\n\n== Conversion ==\n[[File:DD-Kulturpalast-Saal-04.jpg|thumb|The new concert hall]]\n\n=== Conversion planning ===\n[[File:Dresdner Philharmonie im Kulturpalast 2.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Philharmonic and the organ in the renovated Kulturpalast]]\nIn October 2013 the reconstruction work on the Palace of Culture began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2013/10/pm_050.php|title=Baustart im Dresdner Kulturpalast|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The festival hall was to be converted into a pure concert hall with a reduced capacity as a venue for the Dresden Philharmonic. The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo achieve the conversion, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Kulturpalast was reopened on April 28, 2017, with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at a time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose. However, this mobility and the shortage of money set clear limits to the size of the organ, which at that time had a very modest capacity for a hall with well over 2000 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jehmlich-orgelbau.de/orgelprojekte/cottbus-propsteikirche/|title=Cottbus, Kath.

It opened in 1969, and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]]. The hall was used for concerts, dance and entertainment events, as well as conferences and congresses. After several years of reconstruction, including the installation of a new concert hall, it reopened in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=J\u00fcrgen Tietz|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/dresdens-neuer-konzertsaal-spaete-harmonien-ld.1289905|title=Sp\u00e4te Harmonien {{!}} NZZ|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2020-03-14|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe building is, however, not in the unadorned [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] unlike the other buildings on the \"Altmarkt\" square. Is it stand-alone building with a floor area of around 700 meters squared, and it forms the second part of the \"Altmarkt\" square as well as facing Wilsdruffer Strasse, which cuts between them. Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt,]] which has been undergoing a reconstruction project since 2005, it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the [[firebombing of Dresden]] on 13 February 1945. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the Kulturpalast was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were then to be implemented in the GDR. Important principles were: a central square, cityscape-forming high-rise buildings and wide main roads. The Kulturpalast was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was a planned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on [[Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe]] but they were never built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate the Kulturpalast's fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", colloquially known as ''Kulti'', it fulfils the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture. Afterward the house was closed and completely cleared out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnn.de|title=Letzte Vorstellung im Dresdner Kulturpalast \u2013 Proteste gegen Umbau halten an.|last=|first=|date=2012-07-23|website=|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Building ==\n[[File:Weg der Roten Fahne.jpg|thumb|Wall painting ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag)]]\n\n=== Until 2012 ===\nThe multi-functional ballroom with up to 2435 seats (formerly 2740) could have been transformed into an auditorium completely furnished with fixed rows of seats and elevation or into a banquet hall with a flat floor in the area of the parquet in front of the stage thanks to the special \"tilting parquet\".\n\nThe banquet hall was optimized for multi-functionality in its room acoustics and had been adapted for use as a concert hall or for electronically amplified music or speech events through variable absorption or reflection surfaces.\n\nIn addition to the large hall, the Kulturpalast had a studio theatre with 192 seats, seminar, rehearsal and performance rooms, foyer levels, office wings and a restaurant with conference facilities.\n\nOutwardly, the ballroom is distinguished by the roof, which protrudes from the cuboid base structure and has the base area of a symmetrical trapezoid.\n\n=== Wall Painting ===\n[[File:Der Weg der roten Fahne-Inschriften.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the wall painting]]\nThe 30 meter by 10.5 meter mural ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|Roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag) on the west side of the building has been designated a cultural monument since 2001. In 1968 Gerhard Bondzin was commissioned to develop the designs. The mural was realized until 1969 by a working group of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. The working title was: \u201e1849 - 1969: 120 Jahre Kampf der revolution\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4fte der Stadt f\u00fcr Fortschritt und Sozialismus\u201c (1849 - 1969: 120 years of struggle of the revolutionary forces of the city for progress and socialism).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saechsische.de/der-weg-der-roten-fahne-haelt-fuer-die-ewigkeit-2658892.html|title=\"Der Weg der roten Fahne\" h\u00e4lt f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit|website=www.saechsische.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> In addition to Bondzin (artistic director), the artists' collective included Alfred Hesse (participation in transmission work), Gerhard Stengel (artistic technology), Gerhard Pr\u00e4kelt (architect), Emil Spiess (study organization), Martin H\u00e4nisch (type design), Wolfgang Richter (specialist instructor) and students in the 3rd and 4th year of the mural design course.

The bronze casting of the doors was carried out by the foundry Pirner & Franz in Dresden.\n\n=== Well ===\nIn front of the building, there are three [[water feature]]s which were created in 1969 on Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe. The fountains were later removed in the course of the construction work for the underground car park at Altmarkt. These were [[terrazzo]] pools measuring 7.90 by 8.55 metres. In each basin there was a jet fountain on an area of 3 by 3 meters, 24 small heap fountains were installed at the edge of the basin.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Kunst im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum|publisher=Kulturamt Dresden|year=1996|isbn=|location=Dresden, Germany|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\nDresden Altmarkt Sicht auf Kulturpalast 1 Panorama.jpg|Panorama of the Palace of Culture from the Altmarkt (February 2017)\nAltmarkt dresden kulturpalast2.JPG|View over the Altmarkt to the Kulturpalast, behind it the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], which was rebuilt until 2005 \nAltmarkt (Dresden)2009 06.jpg|Close-up with Frauenkirche and row building at Wilsdruffer Stra\u00dfe, 2009\n20121008160DR DD Blick v d Frauenkirche Richtung Altmarkt.jpg|View from the Frauenkirche over the reborn Neumarkt, Kulturpalast and Altmarkt, 2012\nDD-Kulturpalast-Foyer.jpg|Foyer of the Kulturpalast\nDD-Kulturpalast-Obergeschoss-1.jpg|First floor with the wall frieze 'Unser sozialistisches Leben' ''Our socialist life''\nDD-Kulturpalast-Bibo-1.jpg|Central Library of the Municipal Libraries\n</gallery>\n\n== Conversion ==\n[[File:DD-Kulturpalast-Saal-04.jpg|thumb|The new concert hall]]\n\n=== Conversion planning ===\n[[File:Dresdner Philharmonie im Kulturpalast 2.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Philharmonic and the organ in the renovated Kulturpalast]]\nIn October 2013 the reconstruction work on the Palace of Culture began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2013/10/pm_050.php|title=Baustart im Dresdner Kulturpalast|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The festival hall was to be converted into a pure concert hall with a reduced capacity as a venue for the Dresden Philharmonic. The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo achieve the conversion, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Kulturpalast was reopened on April 28, 2017, with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at a time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose.

Large parts of the continent were essentially uninhabitable for Europeans because of the high mortality rates from diseases such as malaria.<ref>Thomas Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (1991) ch 1</ref> In the middle decades of the 19th century, European explorers had mapped  areas of [[East Africa]] and [[Central Africa]].\n\nEven as late as the 1870s, Western European states controlled only ten percent of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coast. The most important holdings were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], held by Portugal; the [[Cape Colony]], held by the United Kingdom; and [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], held by [[France in the nineteenth century|France]].

Industrialisation brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for [[tropical disease]]s. The development of [[quinine]], an effective treatment for [[malaria]], made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/quinine|title=Quinine|website=broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\n===Africa and global markets===\n\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\n\n[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by \"informal imperialism\", was also attractive to Europe's ruling elites for economic, political and social reasons. During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble? The Commercial Transition and the Commodity Price Boom of 1835\u20131885,\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 78#1 (2018) , pp. 231\u201367.</ref>\n\nSurplus capital was often more profitably invested overseas, where cheap materials, limited competition, and abundant raw materials made a greater premium possible. Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A. Hobson]] argued in ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'' that this shrinking of continental markets was a key factor of the global \"New Imperialism\" period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Imperialism|last=Hobson|first=John Atkinson|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-79207-6|location=Cambridge|pages=77|oclc=889962491}}</ref> [[William Easterly]], however, disagrees with the link made between [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]], arguing that [[colonialism]] is used mostly to promote state-led development rather than \"corporate\" development.

The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance.

The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' (CRC Press, 2005), p. 1406.</ref> Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognised as an ally by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires. The [[Turkish people|Turks]] also named Hassan [[Emir]] of the Somali nation,<ref>I.M. Lewis, ''The Modern History of Somaliland: from nation to state'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson: 1965), p. 78.</ref> and the Germans promised to officially recognise any territories the Dervishes were to acquire.<ref>Thomas P.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390]]. During the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble?

Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A.

Following the 1904 ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' between France and the British Empire, Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the [[First Moroccan Crisis]].

The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' (CRC Press, 2005), p. 1406.</ref> Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognised as an ally by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390]]. During the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

They must play at least one level below their main side, and thus Barcelona B are ineligible for promotion to [[La Liga]]. They also cannot play in the [[Copa del Rey]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Espanya Industrial===\n{{Main|CD Condal}}\nFounded on 1 August 1934 as ''Societat Esportiva Industrial Espanya'', the club was originally the sports team of the factory with the same name, and its shirt featured blue and white vertical stripes. The company was owned by the family of Josep Antoni de Albert, who was briefly president of [[FC Barcelona]] in 1943; during Albert's presidency the club, now known as ''Club Deportivo Espanya Industrial'', became Barcelona's [[reserve team]] and began to play home games at [[Camp de Les Corts]].\n\nInitially, Industrial played in the local regional leagues but, in 1950, it was promoted to [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n]], reaching [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]] two years later. In [[1952\u201353 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|1953]] the club finished as runners-up in both the league and the promotion play-off but, being a nursery club of Barcelona, it was unable to move up a division.\n\n===CD Condal===\n{{Main|CD Condal}}\nAfter winning another promotion play-off in 1956, Espanya Industrial became independent of FC Barcelona and was renamed Club Deportivo Condal. The club wore blue shirts with two white diagonals stripes.\n\nCondal competed once in [[La Liga]], in the [[1956\u201357 La Liga|1956\u201357 season]], being relegated as 16th and last. In 1968 the club rejoined the Barcelona family as its reserve team, and adopted the ''blaugrana'' colours.\n\n===Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic/Barcelona B===\n[[Image:Barcelona Atl\u00e9tico.png|thumb|150px|Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic crest]]\nIn 1970, Barcelona president Agust\u00ed Montal decided to [[Mergers and acquisitions|merge]] Condal with another junior club, Atl\u00e8tic Catalunya, and formed Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic. Atl\u00e8tic was founded in 1965 as a result of the merger of two other teams: UE Catalunya de Les Corts (founded in 1918 as Catalunya Sporting Club) and CD Fabra Coats (1926).\n\nUnder the new denomination the B-team played a total of ten seasons in the second level. At the end of [[1988\u201389 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|1988\u201389]] the side returned to [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B]] \u2013 the new third level created in 1977 \u2013 after ranking 17th.\n\nIn 1990 the team was renamed Barcelona B, but club president [[Joan Laporta]] changed the name back to Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic in 2008. Two years later, his successor [[Sandro Rosell]] returned to the previous denomination.<ref>[http://www.elmundodeportivo.es/gen/20100703/53957128068/noticia/el-barsa-atletic-volvera-a-llamarse-barsa-b.html El Bar\u00e7a Atl\u00e8tic volver\u00e1 a llamarse Bar\u00e7a B

They must play at least one level below their main side, and thus Barcelona B are ineligible for promotion to [[La Liga]]. They also cannot play in the [[Copa del Rey]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Espanya Industrial===\n{{Main|CD Condal}}\nFounded on 1 August 1934 as ''Societat Esportiva Industrial Espanya'', the club was originally the sports team of the factory with the same name, and its shirt featured blue and white vertical stripes. The company was owned by the family of Josep Antoni de Albert, who was briefly president of [[FC Barcelona]] in 1943; during Albert's presidency the club, now known as ''Club Deportivo Espanya Industrial'', became Barcelona's [[reserve team]] and began to play home games at [[Camp de Les Corts]].\n\nInitially, Industrial played in the local regional leagues but, in 1950, it was promoted to [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n]], reaching [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]] two years later. In [[1952\u201353 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|1953]] the club finished as runners-up in both the league and the promotion play-off but, being a nursery club of Barcelona, it was unable to move up a division.\n\n===CD Condal===\n{{Main|CD Condal}}\nAfter winning another promotion play-off in 1956, Espanya Industrial became independent of FC Barcelona and was renamed Club Deportivo Condal. The club wore blue shirts with two white diagonals stripes.\n\nCondal competed once in [[La Liga]], in the [[1956\u201357 La Liga|1956\u201357 season]], being relegated as 16th and last. In 1968 the club rejoined the Barcelona family as its reserve team, and adopted the ''blaugrana'' colours.\n\n===Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic/Barcelona B===\n[[Image:Barcelona Atl\u00e9tico.png|thumb|150px|Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic crest]]\nIn 1970, Barcelona president Agust\u00ed Montal decided to [[Mergers and acquisitions|merge]] Condal with another junior club, Atl\u00e8tic Catalunya, and formed Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic. Atl\u00e8tic was founded in 1965 as a result of the merger of two other teams: UE Catalunya de Les Corts (founded in 1918 as Catalunya Sporting Club) and CD Fabra Coats (1926).\n\nUnder the new denomination the B-team played a total of ten seasons in the second level. At the end of [[1988\u201389 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|1988\u201389]] the side returned to [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B]] \u2013 the new third level created in 1977 \u2013 after ranking 17th.\n\nIn 1990 the team was renamed Barcelona B, but club president [[Joan Laporta]] changed the name back to Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic in 2008. Two years later, his successor [[Sandro Rosell]] returned to the previous denomination.<ref>[http://www.elmundodeportivo.es/gen/20100703/53957128068/noticia/el-barsa-atletic-volvera-a-llamarse-barsa-b.html El Bar\u00e7a Atl\u00e8tic volver\u00e1 a llamarse Bar\u00e7a B

Estadi.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Mini Estadi, home stadium until 2019]]\nOn 23 September 1982 the [[Mini Estadi]] was inaugurated by Barcelona president [[Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez]]. Next to the ground there are two training pitches, pitch 3 and 4, which have artificial turf \u2013 the latter has a regulation size of 100 x 70 metres and has seating for 1,000 spectators.\n\nMini Estadi has also hosted games for the [[Andorra national football team]], and the [[Barcelona Dragons]] of [[American football]].\n\nAs a part of the Espai Bar\u00e7a project, the Mini Estadi was demolished and the [[Estadi Johan Cruyff]] was opened to take its place starting in the 2019\u201320 season.

In northern [[Eurasia]], [[peat bog]]s can also preserve textiles very well. The first known textile of South America was discovered in [[Guitarrero Cave]] in Peru. It was woven out of vegetable fibers and dates back to 8,000 B.C.E.\n\nFrom pre-history through the early Middle Ages, for most of Europe, the Near East and North Africa, two main types of loom dominate textile production. These are the [[warp-weighted loom]] and the two-beam loom. The length of the cloth beam determined the width of the cloth woven upon it, and could be as wide as 2\u20133 meters.

The Steppe Route has always connected regions of the Asian continent with trade and transmission of culture, including clothing.\n\nAround 114 BC, the [[Han Dynasty]],<ref>Elisseeff, Vadime, ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce'', UNESCO Publishing / Berghahn Books, 2001, {{ISBN|978-92-3-103652-1}}</ref> initiated the [[Silk Road]] Trade Route. Geographically, the Silk Road or Silk Route is an interconnected series of ancient trade routes between [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) in China, with [[Asia Minor]] and the Mediterranean extending over {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on}} on land and sea. Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great [[civilization]]s of China, Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], the Indian subcontinent, and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world. The exchange of luxury textiles was predominant on the [[Silk Road]], which linked traders, merchants, [[pilgrim]]s, [[monk]]s, soldiers, [[nomad]]s and urban dwellers from China to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during various periods of time.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\nThe earliest known woven textiles of the [[Near East]] may be fabrics used to wrap the dead, excavated at a [[Neolithic]] site at [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] in [[Anatolia]], carbonized in a fire and [[radiocarbon]] dated to c. 6000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\">Jenkins, pp. 39\u201347</ref> Evidence exists of [[flax]] cultivation from c. 8000 BC in the Near East, but the breeding of sheep with a wooly [[Wool|fleece]] rather than hair occurs much later, c. 3000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\" />\n\nIn [[Mesopotamia]], the clothing of a regular [[Sumer|Sumerian]] was very simple, especially in summer, in the winter wearing clothes made of sheep fur. Even wealthy men were depicted with naked torsos, wearing just some kind of short skirt, known as ''[[kaunakes]]'', while women wore long dress to their ankles. The king wore a tunic, a coat that reached to his knees, with a belt in the middle. Over time, the development of the craft of wool weaving has led to a great variety in clothing. Thus, towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC  and later the men wore a tunic with short sleeves and even over the knees, with a belt (over which the rich wore a wool cloak).

Any cloth that might have been worn has long since disintegrated and we have not yet been able to decipher the Indus script. However, historians and archaeologists have managed to piece together some bits of information from clues found in sculptures and figurines.\n\nTerracotta figurines uncovered at Mehrgarh show a male figure wearing what is commonly interpreted to be a turban; female figurines depict women with elaborate headdress and intricate hairstyles.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=24966394|title=The Antecedents of Civilization in the Indus Valley|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last1=Jarrige|first2=Richard H.|last2=Meadow|date=8 May 1980|journal=Scientific American|volume=243|issue=2|pages=122\u2013137|bibcode=1980SciAm.243b.122J|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0880-122}}</ref> In certain cases, these headdresses have led historians to attach a religious connotation to the figurines and to the interpret the headdresses as symbols of a mother goddess.\n\nOne of the most important recovered figurines is that of the \"Priest King\" from the site of [[Mohenjo-daro]]. It is not only important because scholars have called it a representation of an assumed authority or head of state but also because of what it is wearing, however, it was recently discovered to be an interpretation of a wealthy trader. The calmly seated Priest-King is depicted wearing a shawl with floral patterns. So far, this is the only sculpture from the Indus Valley to show clothing in such explicit detail. However, it does not provide any concrete proof to legitimize the history of clothing in the Harappan times. Harappans may even have used natural colours to dye their fabric. Research shows that the cultivation of indigo plants (genus: '''''[[Indigofera]]''''') was prevalent.\n\nAnother important sculpture is of a dancing girl, also excavated from Mohenjo-daro. She is depicted with no clothing other than a number of bangles upon her arm. B. B. Lal <ref>{{cite book|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8301806|title=How deep are the roots of Indian civilization? : archaeology answers in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508123647/https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8301806|archivedate=8 May 2018|df=dmy-all|isbn=9788173053764|last1=Lal|first1=Braj Basi|year=2009}}</ref> has managed draw parallels between the dancing girl and women today in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. He notices how contemporary women continue wearing those bangles even today. Harappans may not have left any evidence of what clothing or textiles they had at that time but they did leave remains of jewellery and beads in large amounts. For instance, the graves of Harappans have yielded various forms of jewellery such as neckpieces, bracelets, rings, and head ornaments. Multiple beads of varying shapes and sizes have also been recovered. This jewellery incorporates various materials such as gold, bronze, terracotta, faience, and shells; imported materials including turquoise and lapis lazuli were used too. This suggests that the Harappans might have engaged in long-distance trade. Long, slender [[carnelian]] beads were highly prized by the Harappans. Harappans were also experts in manufacturing microbeads, which have been found in various locations from hearths and graves. These beads were extremely hard to work with and needed extra precision to produce. A special drill has been found both at Lothal and Chanhudaro. Chanhudaro was a centre exclusively devoted to craft production.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMohenjo-daro Priesterk\u00f6nig.jpeg|Statue of \"Priest King\" wearing a robe; 2400\u20131900 BCE; low fired [[steatite]]; [[National Museum of Pakistan]] ([[Karachi]])\nDidarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg|The [[Didarganj Yakshi]] depicting the ''dhoti wrap''; circa 300 BC; [[Bihar Museum]] (India)\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes; circa 200 BC; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Japan)\nGuptaDanceMusic02.jpg|Ancient form of ''[[Churidar]]'' worn during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]]; circa 300 AD; [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] ([[New Delhi]])\nRaja Ravi Varma - Mahabharata - Shakuntala.jpg|[[Shakuntala]], wife of [[Dushyanta]] and the mother of [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Emperor Bharata]], from [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa|Kalidasa]]'s play ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', wearing a [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]\nBritish Museum silk princess painting.jpg|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid silk worm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan; 7th to 8th century; [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{Main|Clothing in ancient Egypt}}\nEvidence exists for production of linen cloth in [[Ancient Egypt]] in the Neolithic period, c. 5500 BC.

Tha Kae was inhabited during the end of the first millennium BC to the late first millennium AD.  Here, archaeologists discovered 90 fragments of spindle whorl dated from 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD. And the shape of these finds indicate the connections with south China and India.<ref>Cameron, J. (2011). Iron and cloth across the Bay of Bengal: new data from Tha Kae, central Thailand. Antiquity, 85(328).</ref> A spindle whorl is a disc or spherical object that fits onto the spindle to increase as well as maintain the speed of spinning.\n\n===Ancient Japan===\nThe earliest evidence of weaving in Japan is associated with the [[J\u014dmon period]]. This culture is defined by pottery decorated with cord patterns. In a shell mound in the Miyagi Prefecture, dating back about 5,500, some cloth fragments were discovered made from bark fibers.<ref>Liddell, Jill, ''The story of the Kimono'', E. P. Dutton New Zork, 1989, {{ISBN|0-525-24574-X}}</ref> Hemp fibers were also discovered in the [[Torihama shell mound]], Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the J\u014dmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the J\u014dmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers,  funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. The pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.<ref>Zamanaka, Norio, ''The Book of Kimono'', Kodansha International, 1986, {{ISBN|0-87011-785-8}}</ref>\n\nNext was the Yayoi period, during which rice cultivation was developed. This led to a shift from hunter-gatherer communities to agrarian societies which had a large impact on clothing. According to Chinese literature from that time period, clothing more appropriate to agriculture began to be worn. For example, an unsewn length of fabric wrapped around the body, or a poncho-type garment with a head-hole cut into it. This same literature also indicates that pink or scarlet makeup was worn but also that mannerisms between people of all ages and genders were not very different. However, this is debatable as there were probably cultural prejudices in the Chinese document. There is a common Japanese belief that the Yayoi time period was quite utopian before Chinese influence began to promote the use of clothing to indicate age and gender.\n\nFrom 300 to 550 AD was the Yamato period, and here much of the clothing style can be derived from the artifacts of the time. The tomb statues (haniwa) especially tell us that the clothing style changed from the ones according to the Chinese accounts from the previous age. The statues are usually wearing a two piece outfit that has an upper piece with a front opening and close-cut sleeves with loose trousers for men and a pleated skirt for women. Silk farming had been introduced by the Chinese by this time period but due to silk's cost it would only be used by people of certain classes or ranks.\n\nThe following periods were the Asuka (550 to 646 AD) and Nara (646 to 794 AD) when Japan developed a more unified government and began to use Chinese laws and social rankings. These new laws required people to wear different styles and colors to indicate social status. Clothing became longer and wider in general and sewing methods were more advanced.<ref>Slade, T. (2009). Japanese fashion a cultural history (English ed.). Oxford: Berg.</ref>\n\n===Classical Period of the Philippines===\n[[File:Naturales 5.png|thumb|100px|The [[Boxer Codex]], showing the attire of a Classical period Filipino, made of [[silk]] and [[cotton]].]]\nThe classical Filipino clothing varied according to cost and current fashions and so indicated social standing. The basic garments were the Bahag  and the tube skirt\u2014what the Maranao call malong\u2014or a light blanket wrapped around instead. But more prestigious clothes, lihin-lihin, were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions\u2014[[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with [[sleeves]], capes, or ankle-length robes. The textiles of which they were made were similarly varied. In ascending order of value, they were [[abaca]], abaca decorated with colored [[cotton]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[cotton]], cotton decorated with silk thread, silk, imported printstuff, and an elegant abaca woven of selected fibers almost as thin as [[silk]]. In addition, Pigafetta mentioned both G-strings and skirts of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cloth.\n\nUntailored clothes, however had no particular names. ''Pandong'', a lady's [[cloak]], simply meant any natural covering, like the growth on banana trunk's or a natal caul. In [[Panay]], the word ''kurong'', meaning curly hair, was applied to any short skirt or blouse; and some better ones made of imported chintz or calico were simply called by the name of the cloth itself, tabas. So, too, the wraparound skirt the Tagalogs called tapis was hardly considered a skirt at all: Visayans just called it habul (woven stuff) or halong ([[abaca]]) or even hulun ([[sash]]).\n\nThe usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban, though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong\u2014as'' the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy. The most prestigious kind of ''pudong'', limited to the most valiant, was, like their G-strings, made of pinayusan, a gauze-thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness, tie-dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery, and burnished to a silky sheen. Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor: real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness.\nWomen generally wore a kerchief, called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head; but they also had a broad-brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak, woven of sago-palm leaves. Some were evidently signs of rank: when Humabon's queen went to hear mass during Magellan's visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural & History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106060654/http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{Main|Clothing in the ancient world|Clothing in ancient Greece|Clothing in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:ChitonAndHimation.png|thumb|200px|Greek chiton (left) and chiton worn under himation]]\nFabric in Ancient Greece was woven on a warp-weighted loom.

Typical garments were the [[peplos]], a loose robe worn by women; the [[chlamys]], a [[cloak]] worn by men; and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], a tunic worn by both men and women. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. A long cloak called a [[himation]] was worn over the peplos or chlamys.\n\nThe [[toga]] of ancient Rome was also an unsewn length of wool cloth, worn by male citizens draped around the body in various fashions, over a simple [[tunic]]. Early tunics were two simple rectangles joined at the shoulders and sides; later tunics had sewn [[sleeve]]s. Women wore the draped [[stola]] or an ankle-length tunic, with a [[shawl]]-like [[palla (garment)|palla]] as an outer garment. Wool was the preferred fabric, although linen, [[hemp]], and small amounts of expensive imported silk and cotton were also worn.\n\n===Iron Age Europe===\nThe [[Iron Age]] is broadly identified as stretching from the end of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the [[Medieval]] period.

Linen was increasingly used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin. Unlike wool, linen could be laundered and bleached in the sun. Cotton, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as [[buckram]] and [[fustian]].\n\n[[Crusades|Crusaders]] returning from the [[Levant]] brought knowledge of its fine textiles, including light silks, to Western Europe.

Even though the purdah was made compulsory for the Mughal women, we see that this did not stop themselves from experimenting in style and attire. Abul Fazal mentions that there were sixteen components that adorned a woman. These not only included clothing but also other aspects like that of oiling the body and iqtar. Mughal women wore long loose jamas with full sleeves and in winters it was accompanied by a Qaba or a Kashmir shawl used as a coat. Women were very fond of their perfumes and scents. Jewellery in the Mughal tradition signified not only religious values but also style statements.\n\n===Pre-Colonial North America===\n{{main|Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nAcross North America, native people constructed clothing using natural fibers such as cotton and agave as well as leather skins from animals such as deer or beavers. When traders and colonists came from Europe, they brought with them sheep and travelers highly valued the beaver pelts in particular for their warmth. Beaver pelt trade was one of the first commercial endeavors of colonial North America and a cause of the [[Beaver Wars]].\n\n==Enlightenment and the Colonial period==\n{{main|1700\u20131750 in fashion|1750\u20131795 in fashion}}\nDuring the 18th century, distinction was made between ''full dress'' worn at Court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress which had all but disappeared by the end of the century. Full dress followed the styles of the French court, where rich silks and elaborate embroidery reigned. Men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] for both full dress and undress; these were now sometimes made of the same fabric and trim, signalling the birth of the three-piece [[suit (clothes)|suit]].\n\nWomen's silhouettes featured small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]] in the 1730s and early 1740s, which were displaced for formal court wear by side hoops or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]] which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the court of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Fashion reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], before new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits and a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of British woollen tailoring following the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFor women's dresses, Indian cottons, especially printed [[chintz]]es, were imported to Europe in large numbers, and towards the end of the period simple white [[muslin]] dresses were in fashion.\n\n==Industrial revolution==\n[[File:Textile machinery at Cambrian Factory, Llanwrtyd (1293828).jpg|thumb|Textile machinery at the Cambrian Factory, [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Wales]] in the 1940s.]]\n[[File:T\u00dc RKA Gaudeamusel L\u00e4tis.JPG|thumb|[[Estonia]]n national clothes are a fine example of change in clothing after the industrial revolution.

By the end of the 19th century they went out of use in most of the country (except more remote places as in [[Kihnu]] island) and it was only in mid 20th century when they once again gained popularity and now as a formal clothing.

Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organisation. Clothing production, on the other hand, continued to be made by hand.\n\n[[Sewing machine]]s emerged in the 19th century<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/loom_4.htm Spindel, Loom, and Needle] \u2013 History of the Textile Industry</ref> streamlining clothing production.\n\nTextiles were not only made in factories. Before this, they were made in local and national markets. Dramatic change in transportation throughout the nation is one source that encouraged the use of factories. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. Between 1810 and 1840, the development of a national market prompted manufacturing which tripled the output's worth. This increase in production created a change in industrial methods, such as the use of factories instead of hand made woven materials that families usually made.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. J.

Women went to work in textile factories for a number of reasons. Some women left home to live on their own because of crowding at home; or to save for future marriage portions.

These properties may be implemented through mechanical solutions, such as different weaving and knitting patterns, by modifications to the fibers, or by finishing (textiles) of the textiles. Since the 1960s, it has been possible to finish textiles to resist stains, flames, wrinkles, and microbial life. Advancement in dye technology allowed for coloring of previously difficult-to-dye natural fibers and synthetic fibers.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\">{{cite book | title = Textiles, 12th edition | author1 = Sara J.

Advancements in fiber spinning actuators and control systems allow control over fiber diameter and shape, so Synthetic fibers, may be engineered with more precision than natural fibers. Fibers invented between 1930 and 1970 include nylon, PTFE, polyester, Spandex, and Kevlar. Clothing producers soon adopted synthetic fibers, often using blends of different fibers for optimized properties.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\"/> Synthetic fibers can be knit and woven similarly to natural fibers.\n\n===Automation and numeric control===\n\nThe early 20th century continued the advances of the Industrial Revolution. In The procedural loops required for mechanized textile knitting and weaving already used logic were encoded in punch-cards and tapes. Since the machines were already computers, the invention of small-scale electronics and microcontrollers did not immediately change the possible functions of these machines. In the 1960s, existing machines became outfitted with computerized numeric control (CNC) systems, enabling more accurate and efficient actuation. In 1983, Bonas Machine Company Ltd. presented the first computer-controlled, [[Jacquard loom#Electronic Jacquard looms|electronic, Jacquard loom]].<ref>[https://www.bonas.be/en/about-us Bonas.co.uk]</ref> In 1988, the first US patent was awarded for a \"pick and place\" robot.<ref>{{cite patent | country=US | number=4872258A| pubdate=1988-09-22 | inventor=Philip A Ragard | url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4872258A/en}}</ref> Advancements such as these changed the nature of work for machine operators, introducing computer literacy as a skill alongside machine literacy.

It is not only important because scholars have called it a representation of an assumed authority or head of state but also because of what it is wearing, however, it was recently discovered to be an interpretation of a wealthy trader. The calmly seated Priest-King is depicted wearing a shawl with floral patterns. So far, this is the only sculpture from the Indus Valley to show clothing in such explicit detail. However, it does not provide any concrete proof to legitimize the history of clothing in the Harappan times. Harappans may even have used natural colours to dye their fabric. Research shows that the cultivation of indigo plants (genus: '''''[[Indigofera]]''''') was prevalent.\n\nAnother important sculpture is of a dancing girl, also excavated from Mohenjo-daro. She is depicted with no clothing other than a number of bangles upon her arm. B. B.

He notices how contemporary women continue wearing those bangles even today. Harappans may not have left any evidence of what clothing or textiles they had at that time but they did leave remains of jewellery and beads in large amounts. For instance, the graves of Harappans have yielded various forms of jewellery such as neckpieces, bracelets, rings, and head ornaments. Multiple beads of varying shapes and sizes have also been recovered. This jewellery incorporates various materials such as gold, bronze, terracotta, faience, and shells; imported materials including turquoise and lapis lazuli were used too. This suggests that the Harappans might have engaged in long-distance trade. Long, slender [[carnelian]] beads were highly prized by the Harappans. Harappans were also experts in manufacturing microbeads, which have been found in various locations from hearths and graves. These beads were extremely hard to work with and needed extra precision to produce. A special drill has been found both at Lothal and Chanhudaro. Chanhudaro was a centre exclusively devoted to craft production.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMohenjo-daro Priesterk\u00f6nig.jpeg|Statue of \"Priest King\" wearing a robe; 2400\u20131900 BCE; low fired [[steatite]]; [[National Museum of Pakistan]] ([[Karachi]])\nDidarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg|The [[Didarganj Yakshi]] depicting the ''dhoti wrap''; circa 300 BC; [[Bihar Museum]] (India)\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes; circa 200 BC; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Japan)\nGuptaDanceMusic02.jpg|Ancient form of ''[[Churidar]]'' worn during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]]; circa 300 AD; [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] ([[New Delhi]])\nRaja Ravi Varma - Mahabharata - Shakuntala.jpg|[[Shakuntala]], wife of [[Dushyanta]] and the mother of [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Emperor Bharata]], from [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa|Kalidasa]]'s play ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', wearing a [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]\nBritish Museum silk princess painting.jpg|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid silk worm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan; 7th to 8th century; [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{Main|Clothing in ancient Egypt}}\nEvidence exists for production of linen cloth in [[Ancient Egypt]] in the Neolithic period, c. 5500 BC.

Tha Kae was inhabited during the end of the first millennium BC to the late first millennium AD.  Here, archaeologists discovered 90 fragments of spindle whorl dated from 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD. And the shape of these finds indicate the connections with south China and India.<ref>Cameron, J. (2011). Iron and cloth across the Bay of Bengal: new data from Tha Kae, central Thailand. Antiquity, 85(328).</ref> A spindle whorl is a disc or spherical object that fits onto the spindle to increase as well as maintain the speed of spinning.\n\n===Ancient Japan===\nThe earliest evidence of weaving in Japan is associated with the [[J\u014dmon period]]. This culture is defined by pottery decorated with cord patterns. In a shell mound in the Miyagi Prefecture, dating back about 5,500, some cloth fragments were discovered made from bark fibers.<ref>Liddell, Jill, ''The story of the Kimono'', E. P. Dutton New Zork, 1989, {{ISBN|0-525-24574-X}}</ref> Hemp fibers were also discovered in the [[Torihama shell mound]], Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the J\u014dmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the J\u014dmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers,  funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. The pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.<ref>Zamanaka, Norio, ''The Book of Kimono'', Kodansha International, 1986, {{ISBN|0-87011-785-8}}</ref>\n\nNext was the Yayoi period, during which rice cultivation was developed. This led to a shift from hunter-gatherer communities to agrarian societies which had a large impact on clothing. According to Chinese literature from that time period, clothing more appropriate to agriculture began to be worn. For example, an unsewn length of fabric wrapped around the body, or a poncho-type garment with a head-hole cut into it. This same literature also indicates that pink or scarlet makeup was worn but also that mannerisms between people of all ages and genders were not very different. However, this is debatable as there were probably cultural prejudices in the Chinese document. There is a common Japanese belief that the Yayoi time period was quite utopian before Chinese influence began to promote the use of clothing to indicate age and gender.\n\nFrom 300 to 550 AD was the Yamato period, and here much of the clothing style can be derived from the artifacts of the time. The tomb statues (haniwa) especially tell us that the clothing style changed from the ones according to the Chinese accounts from the previous age. The statues are usually wearing a two piece outfit that has an upper piece with a front opening and close-cut sleeves with loose trousers for men and a pleated skirt for women. Silk farming had been introduced by the Chinese by this time period but due to silk's cost it would only be used by people of certain classes or ranks.\n\nThe following periods were the Asuka (550 to 646 AD) and Nara (646 to 794 AD) when Japan developed a more unified government and began to use Chinese laws and social rankings. These new laws required people to wear different styles and colors to indicate social status. Clothing became longer and wider in general and sewing methods were more advanced.<ref>Slade, T. (2009). Japanese fashion a cultural history (English ed.). Oxford: Berg.</ref>\n\n===Classical Period of the Philippines===\n[[File:Naturales 5.png|thumb|100px|The [[Boxer Codex]], showing the attire of a Classical period Filipino, made of [[silk]] and [[cotton]].]]\nThe classical Filipino clothing varied according to cost and current fashions and so indicated social standing. The basic garments were the Bahag  and the tube skirt\u2014what the Maranao call malong\u2014or a light blanket wrapped around instead. But more prestigious clothes, lihin-lihin, were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions\u2014[[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with [[sleeves]], capes, or ankle-length robes. The textiles of which they were made were similarly varied. In ascending order of value, they were [[abaca]], abaca decorated with colored [[cotton]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[cotton]], cotton decorated with silk thread, silk, imported printstuff, and an elegant abaca woven of selected fibers almost as thin as [[silk]]. In addition, Pigafetta mentioned both G-strings and skirts of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cloth.\n\nUntailored clothes, however had no particular names. ''Pandong'', a lady's [[cloak]], simply meant any natural covering, like the growth on banana trunk's or a natal caul. In [[Panay]], the word ''kurong'', meaning curly hair, was applied to any short skirt or blouse; and some better ones made of imported chintz or calico were simply called by the name of the cloth itself, tabas. So, too, the wraparound skirt the Tagalogs called tapis was hardly considered a skirt at all: Visayans just called it habul (woven stuff) or halong ([[abaca]]) or even hulun ([[sash]]).\n\nThe usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban, though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong\u2014as'' the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy. The most prestigious kind of ''pudong'', limited to the most valiant, was, like their G-strings, made of pinayusan, a gauze-thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness, tie-dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery, and burnished to a silky sheen. Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor: real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness.\nWomen generally wore a kerchief, called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head; but they also had a broad-brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak, woven of sago-palm leaves. Some were evidently signs of rank: when Humabon's queen went to hear mass during Magellan's visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural & History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106060654/http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{Main|Clothing in the ancient world|Clothing in ancient Greece|Clothing in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:ChitonAndHimation.png|thumb|200px|Greek chiton (left) and chiton worn under himation]]\nFabric in Ancient Greece was woven on a warp-weighted loom.

The warp threads, which run vertically to a bar at the top, are tied together with weights at the bottom, which hold them taut.

Typical garments were the [[peplos]], a loose robe worn by women; the [[chlamys]], a [[cloak]] worn by men; and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], a tunic worn by both men and women. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. A long cloak called a [[himation]] was worn over the peplos or chlamys.\n\nThe [[toga]] of ancient Rome was also an unsewn length of wool cloth, worn by male citizens draped around the body in various fashions, over a simple [[tunic]]. Early tunics were two simple rectangles joined at the shoulders and sides; later tunics had sewn [[sleeve]]s. Women wore the draped [[stola]] or an ankle-length tunic, with a [[shawl]]-like [[palla (garment)|palla]] as an outer garment. Wool was the preferred fabric, although linen, [[hemp]], and small amounts of expensive imported silk and cotton were also worn.\n\n===Iron Age Europe===\nThe [[Iron Age]] is broadly identified as stretching from the end of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the [[Medieval]] period. Bodies and clothing have been found from this period, preserved by the anaerobic and acidic conditions of [[peat bogs]] in northwestern Europe. A Danish recreation of clothing found with such bodies indicates woven wool dresses, tunics and skirts.<ref>[http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp The Tollund Man \u2013 Clothes and Fashion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118112211/http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp |date=18 January 2012 }}.

People in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new [[migration period|invading populations]] such as [[Franks]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Visigoths]]. Men of the invading peoples generally wore short [[tunic]]s, with belts, and visible trousers, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] or leggings.

They also could afford bleached linen and dyed and simply patterned wool woven in Europe itself. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art.

Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe 13th century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear. Linen was increasingly used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin. Unlike wool, linen could be laundered and bleached in the sun. Cotton, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as [[buckram]] and [[fustian]].\n\n[[Crusades|Crusaders]] returning from the [[Levant]] brought knowledge of its fine textiles, including light silks, to Western Europe.

Even though the purdah was made compulsory for the Mughal women, we see that this did not stop themselves from experimenting in style and attire. Abul Fazal mentions that there were sixteen components that adorned a woman. These not only included clothing but also other aspects like that of oiling the body and iqtar. Mughal women wore long loose jamas with full sleeves and in winters it was accompanied by a Qaba or a Kashmir shawl used as a coat. Women were very fond of their perfumes and scents. Jewellery in the Mughal tradition signified not only religious values but also style statements.\n\n===Pre-Colonial North America===\n{{main|Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nAcross North America, native people constructed clothing using natural fibers such as cotton and agave as well as leather skins from animals such as deer or beavers. When traders and colonists came from Europe, they brought with them sheep and travelers highly valued the beaver pelts in particular for their warmth. Beaver pelt trade was one of the first commercial endeavors of colonial North America and a cause of the [[Beaver Wars]].\n\n==Enlightenment and the Colonial period==\n{{main|1700\u20131750 in fashion|1750\u20131795 in fashion}}\nDuring the 18th century, distinction was made between ''full dress'' worn at Court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress which had all but disappeared by the end of the century. Full dress followed the styles of the French court, where rich silks and elaborate embroidery reigned. Men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] for both full dress and undress; these were now sometimes made of the same fabric and trim, signalling the birth of the three-piece [[suit (clothes)|suit]].\n\nWomen's silhouettes featured small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]] in the 1730s and early 1740s, which were displaced for formal court wear by side hoops or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]] which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the court of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Fashion reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], before new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits and a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of British woollen tailoring following the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFor women's dresses, Indian cottons, especially printed [[chintz]]es, were imported to Europe in large numbers, and towards the end of the period simple white [[muslin]] dresses were in fashion.\n\n==Industrial revolution==\n[[File:Textile machinery at Cambrian Factory, Llanwrtyd (1293828).jpg|thumb|Textile machinery at the Cambrian Factory, [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Wales]] in the 1940s.]]\n[[File:T\u00dc RKA Gaudeamusel L\u00e4tis.JPG|thumb|[[Estonia]]n national clothes are a fine example of change in clothing after the industrial revolution. They changed a lot during 18th and 19th of century with the addition of new types of colors (like [[aniline]] dyes), placement of colors (like lengthwise stripes) and with the addition of new elements (like waistcoats). By the end of the 19th century they went out of use in most of the country (except more remote places as in [[Kihnu]] island) and it was only in mid 20th century when they once again gained popularity and now as a formal clothing. Members of [[University of Tartu Folk Art Ensemble]] wearing clothes specific to Kihnu island, [[Tori Parish]] (women in red skirts) and [[T\u00f5stamaa]] area (men in brown clothing).]]\n{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}\nDuring the [[industrial revolution]], fabric production was [[mechanised]] with machines powered by [[waterwheel]]s and [[steam-engine]]s. Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organisation. Clothing production, on the other hand, continued to be made by hand.\n\n[[Sewing machine]]s emerged in the 19th century<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/loom_4.htm Spindel, Loom, and Needle] \u2013 History of the Textile Industry</ref> streamlining clothing production.\n\nTextiles were not only made in factories. Before this, they were made in local and national markets. Dramatic change in transportation throughout the nation is one source that encouraged the use of factories. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. Between 1810 and 1840, the development of a national market prompted manufacturing which tripled the output's worth. This increase in production created a change in industrial methods, such as the use of factories instead of hand made woven materials that families usually made.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. J. Rorabaugh|title=The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AUH0vchHRIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=17 September 1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-502990-1|pages=129\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of the people who worked in the factories were women. Women went to work in textile factories for a number of reasons. Some women left home to live on their own because of crowding at home; or to save for future marriage portions. The work enabled them to see more of the world, to earn something in anticipation of marriage, and to ease the crowding within the home. They also did it to make money for family back home. The money they sent home was to help out with the trouble some of the farmers were having. They also worked in the millhouses because they could gain a sense of independence and growth as a personal goal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Dublin|title=Transforming women's work: New England lives in the industrial revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTfTKyrIGfgC&pg=PA82|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=August 1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8090-4|pages=82\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==20th-century developments==\n\nThe 20th century is marked by new applications for textiles as well as inventions in synthetic fibers and computerized manufacturing control systems.\n\n===Unions and education===\n\nIn the early 20th century, workers in the clothing and textile industries became [[Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union|unionized]] in the United States.

These properties may be implemented through mechanical solutions, such as different weaving and knitting patterns, by modifications to the fibers, or by finishing (textiles) of the textiles. Since the 1960s, it has been possible to finish textiles to resist stains, flames, wrinkles, and microbial life. Advancement in dye technology allowed for coloring of previously difficult-to-dye natural fibers and synthetic fibers.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\">{{cite book | title = Textiles, 12th edition | author1 = Sara J. Kadolph | author2 = Sara B. Marcketti | publisher = Pearson |date = 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Synthetic fibers===\n\nFollowing the invention of plastics by petroleum and chemical corporations, fibers could now be made synthetically. Advancements in fiber spinning actuators and control systems allow control over fiber diameter and shape, so Synthetic fibers, may be engineered with more precision than natural fibers. Fibers invented between 1930 and 1970 include nylon, PTFE, polyester, Spandex, and Kevlar. Clothing producers soon adopted synthetic fibers, often using blends of different fibers for optimized properties.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\"/> Synthetic fibers can be knit and woven similarly to natural fibers.\n\n===Automation and numeric control===\n\nThe early 20th century continued the advances of the Industrial Revolution. In The procedural loops required for mechanized textile knitting and weaving already used logic were encoded in punch-cards and tapes. Since the machines were already computers, the invention of small-scale electronics and microcontrollers did not immediately change the possible functions of these machines. In the 1960s, existing machines became outfitted with computerized numeric control (CNC) systems, enabling more accurate and efficient actuation. In 1983, Bonas Machine Company Ltd. presented the first computer-controlled, [[Jacquard loom#Electronic Jacquard looms|electronic, Jacquard loom]].<ref>[https://www.bonas.be/en/about-us Bonas.co.uk]</ref> In 1988, the first US patent was awarded for a \"pick and place\" robot.<ref>{{cite patent | country=US | number=4872258A| pubdate=1988-09-22 | inventor=Philip A Ragard | url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4872258A/en}}</ref> Advancements such as these changed the nature of work for machine operators, introducing computer literacy as a skill alongside machine literacy.

Wight | url=http://www.bowling-tips.org/bowling-terms.php | accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref> In bowling games that use 10 pins, such as [[ten-pin bowling]], [[candlepin bowling]], and [[duckpin bowling]], the highest possible score is 300, achieved by bowling 12 strikes in a row in a traditional single game: one strike in each of the first nine frames, and three more in the tenth frame. Because a strike counts as ten pins plus any pinfall in the next two balls, 30 points are possible in a given frame.\n\nIn [[five-pin bowling]], the highest possible score is 450, as a strike is worth 15 pins. It is rare to bowl or witness one. The Canadian Five Pin Bowlers Association approves from 10 to 40 perfect games per year.\n\n==300 game==\n{{globalize|section|USA|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Certification process===\nBefore a {{Not a typo|300 game}} is recognized by the certifying body of the [[Bowling league|league]] or tournament, a series of tests are conducted by the local or regional bowling association. First, the bowler and league (or tournament) must be in good standing with the organization. In earlier years, the [[Bowling ball|bowling ball(s)]] used in the scoring was taken for testing (hardness, weighting, and other aspects that would otherwise break the organization's regulations). Also, the lanes used in the scoring were shut down after the last game of the day was completed. The official then used a tape reader to test the oil condition, to make sure it met the organization's regulations. The data was then sent to the certifying body, and the score received a certification decision a few days to a few weeks later.\n\nThere are cases where the tests do not meet regulation, and therefore the score is not recognized by the organization. However, the score still counts towards the league or tournament statistics. Modern recognition is much easier; lanes are no longer shut down, balls are no longer taken and inspected. The lanes are inspected once a year, and the ball's make and serial number (USBC only requires that the ball have an engraved serial number, they do not need the actual number) are taken by a league/tournament official and reported to the certifying organization.\n\n===Recognition===\nIn league or tournament play, a certified 300 game is usually commemorated with a ring. Subsequent league 300s are denoted by setting \"chips\" or precious stones into the ring, so that skilled bowlers do not have to wear several rings. The [[United States Bowling Congress]] (USBC) offers a \"multiple\" 300 ring for an additional fee that features the number of approved 300 games for that bowler surrounded by stones. The ring can be returned to have the number changed as the bowler rolls additional perfect games.\n\nIn casual or \"open\" play, a 300 game is not recognized officially by any certifying, professional, or other organization, but may be honored by other means within the bowling center, such as a plaque, trophy, \"wall of fame\" photo, or other prize.\n\n===Televised 300 games===\nA handful of 300 games have been broadcast on [[Live television|live TV]]. Grazio Castellano of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] was the first to roll a {{Not a typo|300 game}} on live television.

A more recent example came in October 2006, when England's [[Paul Moor]] became the first man to register a score of 300 in the [[Weber Cup]] (the first 300 on live British television), the annual Europe versus America team challenge event. Australian [[Jason Belmonte]] became the first bowler to ever roll a 300 game in the televised finals of the [[World Tenpin Masters]], defeating Moor in the 2007 event. [[Tommy Jones (bowler)|Tommy Jones]] had shot a perfect game in each Weber Cup from 2007 to 2009.

Although the computer claims that Hal bowled a perfect game (since Malcolm did knock all the pins over), the game is dismissed by the gathered crowd.\n* In an episode of ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', the roll call sergeant had bowled a 300 game. After the bowling alley burned down, the sergeant was an arson suspect because his 300 was not league certified.\n* In the 1998 movie ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', the character of Jesus Quintana ([[John Turturro]]) is seen wearing three perfect game rings.\n* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]\", Homer bowls a perfect game in a parody of ''[[The Natural]]''. Later, the baby [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] also apparently bowls one.\n* An episode of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' titled \"Howard the Bowler\" features a bowling match between Mayberry and neighboring Mt. Pilot. Howard is one strike away from a perfect game, only to have the lights go out due to a power overload. He has a day to think about it before he tries for the final strike. They make bets on him bowling a perfect game, and when he returns he gets two practice frames before making his final attempt. Both are gutter balls, so Andy gets the guys to relinquish the bets. With the pressure relieved, Howard makes the final strike for a perfect game.\n* In a similar 2001 episode of the series ''[[According to Jim]]'', Jim ([[James Belushi]]) bowls the first 11 strikes of a game when the power goes out at the bowling center. It is the day before Thanksgiving, and the proprietor tells Jim he cannot get credit for a {{Not a typo|300 game}} (nor a photo on the center's \"wall of fame\") if he leaves and returns. Jim spends the night, and his wife, Cheryl ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]), surprises him by bringing Thanksgiving dinner to the bowling center while he waits for the power to return. Cheryl and Jim's family light the lane by placing candles in the gutters, and Jim rolls the final strike to complete the 300 game.\n* In the episode \"[[Bowling for Votes]]\" of the series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', [[Ron Swanson]] bowls a perfect game by rolling the ball with two hands from between his legs.\n* In the episode \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\" of the series ''[[Family Guy]]'', where Peter becomes jealous of his friends' achievements, Mort Goldman bowls a perfect game despite rolling the ball so slowly it takes several seconds to reach the pins.\n* In an episode \"[[Lethal Weapon (TV series)#Episodes|Lawmen]]\" of the series ''[[Lethal Weapon (TV series)|Lethal Weapon]]'', Roger ([[Damon Wayans]]) has his photo on the \"wall of fame\" in a local bowling center for a 300 game (which he admits was only a 290), but was pushed to roll a perfect game to prove it.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Golden Set]] in [[tennis]]\n* [[Maximum break]] and [[century break]] in [[snooker]]\n* [[Nine dart finish]] in [[darts]]\n* [[Perfect game (baseball)|Perfect game]] in [[baseball]]\n* [[Nine-ball|Golden break]] in [[nine-ball|nine-ball pool]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ten pin bowling}}\n\n[[Category:Ten-pin bowling]]\n[[Category:Perfect scores in sports]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Perfect game (disambiguation)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2013}}\n:\n[[File:Howenstein115's \"300\" ring.jpg|thumb|right|A typical 300 ring.

Although the computer claims that Hal bowled a perfect game (since Malcolm did knock all the pins over), the game is dismissed by the gathered crowd.\n* In an episode of ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', the roll call sergeant had bowled a 300 game. After the bowling alley burned down, the sergeant was an arson suspect because his 300 was not league certified.\n* In the 1998 movie ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', the character of Jesus Quintana ([[John Turturro]]) is seen wearing three perfect game rings.\n* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]\", Homer bowls a perfect game in a parody of ''[[The Natural]]''. Later, the baby [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] also apparently bowls one.\n* An episode of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' titled \"Howard the Bowler\" features a bowling match between Mayberry and neighboring Mt. Pilot. Howard is one strike away from a perfect game, only to have the lights go out due to a power overload. He has a day to think about it before he tries for the final strike. They make bets on him bowling a perfect game, and when he returns he gets two practice frames before making his final attempt. Both are gutter balls, so Andy gets the guys to relinquish the bets. With the pressure relieved, Howard makes the final strike for a perfect game.\n* In a similar 2001 episode of the series ''[[According to Jim]]'', Jim ([[James Belushi]]) bowls the first 11 strikes of a game when the power goes out at the bowling center. It is the day before Thanksgiving, and the proprietor tells Jim he cannot get credit for a {{Not a typo|300 game}} (nor a photo on the center's \"wall of fame\") if he leaves and returns. Jim spends the night, and his wife, Cheryl ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]), surprises him by bringing Thanksgiving dinner to the bowling center while he waits for the power to return. Cheryl and Jim's family light the lane by placing candles in the gutters, and Jim rolls the final strike to complete the 300 game.\n* In the episode \"[[Bowling for Votes]]\" of the series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', [[Ron Swanson]] bowls a perfect game by rolling the ball with two hands from between his legs.\n* In the episode \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\" of the series ''[[Family Guy]]'', where Peter becomes jealous of his friends' achievements, Mort Goldman bowls a perfect game despite rolling the ball so slowly it takes several seconds to reach the pins.\n* In an episode \"[[Lethal Weapon (TV series)#Episodes|Lawmen]]\" of the series ''[[Lethal Weapon (TV series)|Lethal Weapon]]'', Roger ([[Damon Wayans]]) has his photo on the \"wall of fame\" in a local bowling center for a 300 game (which he admits was only a 290), but was pushed to roll a perfect game to prove it.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Golden Set]] in [[tennis]]\n* [[Maximum break]] and [[century break]] in [[snooker]]\n* [[Nine dart finish]] in [[darts]]\n* [[Perfect game (baseball)|Perfect game]] in [[baseball]]\n* [[Nine-ball|Golden break]] in [[nine-ball|nine-ball pool]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ten pin bowling}}\n\n[[Category:Ten-pin bowling]]\n[[Category:Perfect scores in sports]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: televison \u2192 television", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_game_(bowling)"}
