The 1980 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, produced by [[David Merrick]], directed by an ailing [[Gower Champion]] and orchestrated by [[Philip J. Lang]], won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical and became a long-running hit. The show was produced in London in 1984 (winning the [[Olivier Award]] for Best Musical) and its 2001 Broadway revival won the Tony for Best Revival.\n\nBased on the novel by [[Bradford Ropes]] and the subsequent [[42nd Street (film)|1933 Hollywood film adaptation]], the [[backstage musical]] show focuses on the efforts of famed [[dictator]]ial [[Great White Way]] director Julian Marsh to mount a successful stage production of a musical extravaganza at the height of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nThe show is a [[jukebox musical]] of sorts, in that, in addition to songs from the 1933 film ''42nd Street'', it includes songs that Dubin and Warren wrote for many other films at around the same time, including ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', ''[[Roman Scandals]]'', ''[[Dames]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', ''[[Go into Your Dance]]'', ''[[Gold Diggers of 1937]]'' and ''[[The Singing Marine]]''.

Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (\"Young and Healthy\"). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy's latest conquest and tells her, \"Amscray, toots.\" Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh.\n\nOne-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by Bert that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (\"Shadow Waltz\"). Despite his feeling she is a [[prima donna]] past her prime, he agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, writer Maggie and chorus girls Anytime Annie, Phyllis, and Lorraine take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (\"Go Into Your Dance\").\n\nDorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from \"Pretty Lady\" (\"You're Getting to be a Habit With Me\").\n\nPeggy faints and is taken to Dorothy's dressing room. Pat is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and assumes they are having an affair. She blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and fears that Abner will take away funding for the show. He decides to put an end to the affair. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of [[criminal|thugs]] who convince him to break it off with her. The show's cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], for the out-of-town tryout (\"Getting Out of Town\").\n\nThe scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (\"Dames\").\n\nA party is planned. Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending. He decides to go because he is attracted to Peggy (\"I Only Have Eyes For You\").\n\nDorothy is at the party and is drunk. She misses Pat, and she tells Abner she was only with him because of his money. She breaks it off with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, which makes her upset (\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\").\n\n\"Pretty Lady\" finally opens (\"We're in the Money\"), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. Dorothy cannot get up. This makes Julian angry. He fires Peggy immediately, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.\n\n; Act II\nDorothy's ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (\"Sunny Side to Every Situation\"). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she's a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs.\n\nAt [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia's ''Broad Street Station,'']] Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words \"Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway...\" After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (\"Lullaby of Broadway\").\n\nForced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when she has an unexpected visit from Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, \"maybe even better than I would have been.\" She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, \"[[About a Quarter to Nine]].\"\n\nIt's time for the curtain to rise again (\"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\"). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, who is completely in love with Peggy at this point, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, \"You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\" The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (\"42nd Street\"). In addition, even though she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, \"Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I'm taking you to...42nd Street\" (\"42nd Street (Reprise)\").\n\n==Characters==\nSource: Tams-Witmark Synopsis<ref>[http://www.tamswitmark.com/musicals/fortysecond.html \"'Forty-Second Street' Quick Review, Awards, Brief History, Synopsis\"] tamswitmark.com, accessed April 9, 2011</ref>\n\n*'''Peggy Sawyer (Lead)''' \u2013 Nervous but enthusiastic new chorus girl from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n*'''Billy Lawlor (Lead)''' \u2013 Leading [[tenor]] in ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Dorothy Brock (Lead)''' \u2013 Past her prime Prima Donna, renowned for inability to dance\n*'''Julian Marsh (Lead)''' \u2013 Famous, but notorious, director\n*'''Maggie Jones (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Bert Barry (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Andy Lee (Support)''' \u2013 Choreographer/Dance Director\n*'''Pat Denning (Support)''' \u2013 Dorothy's former vaudeville partner and romantic interest\n*'''Abner Dillon (Support)''' \u2013 Producer of \"Pretty Lady\"; Dorothy's \"Sugar Daddy\" and Texan admirer\n*'''Mac (Support)''' \u2013 Stage Manager\n*'''Ann \u201cAnytime Annie\u201d Reilly, Lorraine Flemming, Phyllis Dale, and Gladys (Support)''' \u2013 Experienced chorus girls who help Peggy\n*'''Oscar''' \u2013 Onstage rehearsal pianist for the show \"Pretty Lady\"\n*'''Doctor'''\n*'''Other small speaking roles''' (Thugs, waiter, etc.)\n*'''Large Tap/Chorus Ensemble'''\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

The 1980 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, produced by [[David Merrick]], directed by an ailing [[Gower Champion]] and orchestrated by [[Philip J.

It also includes \"There's a Sunny Side to Every Situation\", written by Warren and Johnny Mercer for ''[[Hard to Get (1938 film)|Hard to Get]]''. A 2017 revival added the song \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Al Dubin song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", written by Warren and Dubin for ''[[Moulin Rouge (1934 film)|Moulin Rouge]]''.\n\n==Background==\n[[theatre producer|Producer]] [[David Merrick]] \"took a huge gamble with his $3 million production based on the 1933 Warner Brothers film musical\", as \"only one other show had made the transfer from original movie musical to the stage \u2014 ''Gigi'', a flop in 1974.\"<ref name=pbs>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/musicals/42nd.html |title=42nd Street History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923125830/https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/musicals/42nd.html |archive-date=September 23, 2011|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sptimes\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/28/Floridian/Renovating__42nd_Stre.shtml |title=Floridian Renovating 42nd Street |last=Fleming |first=John |date=April 28, 2003 |website=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029215029/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/28/Floridian/Renovating__42nd_Stre.shtml |archive-date=October 29, 2005}}</ref> He felt audiences once again were ready to embrace the [[nostalgia]] craze started by the successful revivals of ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'', and his own ''[[Very Good Eddie]]'' several years earlier, and augmented the familiar songs from the film's soundtrack with a liberal dose of popular tunes from the Dubin-Warren catalog.<ref name=pbs/> According to theater historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]], \"When the curtain slowly rose to reveal forty pairs of tap-dancing feet, the star-studded opening night audience at the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] cheered...Champion followed this number with a series of tap-infused extravaganzas larger and more polished than anything Broadway really had in the 1930s.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicals101.com/1980bway.htm |title=History of the Musical Stage: The 1980s |last=Kenrick |first=John |authorlink=John Kenrick (theatre writer) |date=1996\u20132004 |website=musicals101.com |archive-url=http://musicals101.com/1980bway.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2010 |access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Productions==\n===Original Broadway===\nIn June 1980, the musical premiered in out-of-town tryouts at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Lardner, James. \"Familiar 'Street'; Hokey Tune of the '30s\", ''The Washington Post'', June 25, 1980, p.

Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (\"Young and Healthy\"). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy's latest conquest and tells her, \"Amscray, toots.\" Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh.\n\nOne-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by Bert that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (\"Shadow Waltz\"). Despite his feeling she is a [[prima donna]] past her prime, he agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, writer Maggie and chorus girls Anytime Annie, Phyllis, and Lorraine take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (\"Go Into Your Dance\").\n\nDorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from \"Pretty Lady\" (\"You're Getting to be a Habit With Me\").\n\nPeggy faints and is taken to Dorothy's dressing room. Pat is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and assumes they are having an affair. She blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and fears that Abner will take away funding for the show. He decides to put an end to the affair. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of [[criminal|thugs]] who convince him to break it off with her. The show's cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], for the out-of-town tryout (\"Getting Out of Town\").\n\nThe scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (\"Dames\").\n\nA party is planned. Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending. He decides to go because he is attracted to Peggy (\"I Only Have Eyes For You\").\n\nDorothy is at the party and is drunk. She misses Pat, and she tells Abner she was only with him because of his money. She breaks it off with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, which makes her upset (\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\").\n\n\"Pretty Lady\" finally opens (\"We're in the Money\"), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. Dorothy cannot get up. This makes Julian angry. He fires Peggy immediately, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.\n\n; Act II\nDorothy's ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (\"Sunny Side to Every Situation\"). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she's a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs.\n\nAt [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia's ''Broad Street Station,'']] Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words \"Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway...\" After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (\"Lullaby of Broadway\").\n\nForced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when she has an unexpected visit from Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, \"maybe even better than I would have been.\" She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, \"[[About a Quarter to Nine]].\"\n\nIt's time for the curtain to rise again (\"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\"). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, who is completely in love with Peggy at this point, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, \"You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!\" The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (\"42nd Street\"). In addition, even though she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, \"Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I'm taking you to...42nd Street\" (\"42nd Street (Reprise)\").\n\n==Characters==\nSource: Tams-Witmark Synopsis<ref>[http://www.tamswitmark.com/musicals/fortysecond.html \"'Forty-Second Street' Quick Review, Awards, Brief History, Synopsis\"] tamswitmark.com, accessed April 9, 2011</ref>\n\n*'''Peggy Sawyer (Lead)''' \u2013 Nervous but enthusiastic new chorus girl from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n*'''Billy Lawlor (Lead)''' \u2013 Leading [[tenor]] in ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Dorothy Brock (Lead)''' \u2013 Past her prime Prima Donna, renowned for inability to dance\n*'''Julian Marsh (Lead)''' \u2013 Famous, but notorious, director\n*'''Maggie Jones (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Bert Barry (Support)''' \u2013 Co-writer and producer of ''Pretty Lady''\n*'''Andy Lee (Support)''' \u2013 Choreographer/Dance Director\n*'''Pat Denning (Support)''' \u2013 Dorothy's former vaudeville partner and romantic interest\n*'''Abner Dillon (Support)''' \u2013 Producer of \"Pretty Lady\"; Dorothy's \"Sugar Daddy\" and Texan admirer\n*'''Mac (Support)''' \u2013 Stage Manager\n*'''Ann \u201cAnytime Annie\u201d Reilly, Lorraine Flemming, Phyllis Dale, and Gladys (Support)''' \u2013 Experienced chorus girls who help Peggy\n*'''Oscar''' \u2013 Onstage rehearsal pianist for the show \"Pretty Lady\"\n*'''Doctor'''\n*'''Other small speaking roles''' (Thugs, waiter, etc.)\n*'''Large Tap/Chorus Ensemble'''\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

They stated that it is not possible for the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Japan on a person-to-person basis, but that there is a possibility that it can regulate the overall speed of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/newpage_00006.html|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u91dd\u306e\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u898b\u89e3 (Opinion on the Realization of Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control)|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70 (Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting)|date=February 24, 2020|website=Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>&nbsp; They cited the next week or two as a \"critical moment\" on whether the country would experience a large cluster that could result in the collapse of the medical system and socio-economic chaos. After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.&nbsp; Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to \"chaos,\" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the ''Diamond Princess''. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into \"breeding grounds\" of COVID-19.<ref name=\"nippon1\">[https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00269/coronavirus-basic-policy-impacts-japan%e2%80%99s-health-education-systems.html?cx_recs_click=true \"Coronavirus Basic Policy Impacts Japan\u2019s Health, Education Systems\"]. Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights.  After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].

They stated that it is not possible for the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Japan on a person-to-person basis, but that there is a possibility that it can regulate the overall speed of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/newpage_00006.html|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u91dd\u306e\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u898b\u89e3 (Opinion on the Realization of Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control)|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70 (Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting)|date=February 24, 2020|website=Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>&nbsp; They cited the next week or two as a \"critical moment\" on whether the country would experience a large cluster that could result in the collapse of the medical system and socio-economic chaos. After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.&nbsp; Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to \"chaos,\" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the ''Diamond Princess''. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into \"breeding grounds\" of COVID-19.<ref name=\"nippon1\">[https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00269/coronavirus-basic-policy-impacts-japan%e2%80%99s-health-education-systems.html?cx_recs_click=true \"Coronavirus Basic Policy Impacts Japan\u2019s Health, Education Systems\"]. Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights.  After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].
