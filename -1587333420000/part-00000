The countries that are summarized in this section include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean region, Costa Rica, and Colombia. For the moment, not included are discussions of anthropology (or ethnology) in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, or Haiti. Latin America anthropologists established their discipline in conjunction with American and European anthropologists, and revised their disciplines to study cultural phenomena through their own perspectives, independent of American and European thought. [[File:Map-Latin America and Caribbean.png|thumb|Latin America and the Caribbean]]\n\n=== Andes ===\nAndean anthropology's roots began during the turn of the 20th century, containing social movements between two groups in Peru, and from academia within the United States. The mestizo (non-native) and indigenous intellectuals known as indigenistas competed for political and intellectual space and recognition in Peru. Indigenous intellectuals advocated for interculturalidad, where indigenous thought could occupy Peruvian society as its own entity and not become blended as a singular national identity that the mestizaje proposed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribiero|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Marisol de la Cadena|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=201\u2013224|chapter=The Production of Other Knowledges and Its Tensions: From Andeanist Anthropology to Interculturalidad?}}</ref>\n\nThe mestizaje perspective sought to modernize Peru and model their society similar to the United States. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas]] was a writer and ethnographer in Peru, who classified himself as an indigenous intellectual that challenged Western thought and ideology. [[John Victor Murra]], an anthropologist teaching in the United States collaborated with Arguedas. Their collaboration stemmed from Murra's travels in 1952 to the Latin American region when he was working under the anthropologist [[Sidney Mintz]] as a PhD student. Indigenistas were active in social and political movements in Latin America and collaborated with people inside of the United States, but still sought to be independent from Western thought.<ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Logo of the American Anthropological Association.png|thumb|AAA]]\nIn 1936, the [[American Anthropological Association]] initiated studies in Latin America on how to incorporate indigenous people in Latin American society, termed acculturation studies, and in 1935, the [[Social Science Research Council]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the Committee on Latin American studies worked to benefit the interests of the United States. The Peruvian government funded anthropological institutions beginning in the 1940s, and the establishment of the Instiuto de Etnologia y Arqueologia and a Peruvian sector in the Instituto Indigneista Interamericano followed. By the 1960s Peruvian governmental funding decreased, and became reliant upon the United States for funding. The indigenous incorporation into the goal of a singular society was termed cholification by the Peruvian sociologist [[An\u00edbal Quijano|Anibal Quijano]]. In the 1990s during the Neo-liberal era, indigenous thought became more recognized with political conflicts in the Andean region, and interculturalidad was pursued again for Andean states to recognize the diversity of the people that occupied them.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Argentina ===\nSocial Anthropology was established in Argentina in 1957. It was first institutionalized at the University of [[Buenos Aires]]. Before the institutionalization of social anthropology, the discipline largely focused on historical studies. Rosana Guber attributes the introduction of social anthropology to [[Esther Hermitte]] who was a history professor at the Ethnographic Museum in Argentina. It was during her trips to the University of Chicago that she was introduced to social anthropology, and so it was the west who influenced the institutionalization of social anthropology in Argentina. In 1965, students began to ask for a discipline separate from sociology, and that was not focused primarily on indigenous people. There was a movement around this time that called for a greater understanding of the changes modern society was going through, especially during and after the 1966 [[Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina]]. Later, in 1974, students and faculty within departments that were studying social movements and change suffered kidnappings and murders by the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Argentine AntiCommunist Alliance]]. The current status of Argentinian anthropology is still deeply rooted in western influence.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Committed or Scientific?

Later during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was experiencing political authoritarianism. As a result, anthropology began to address inter-ethnic friction. In the 1970s anthropologists began to consider nearby urban studies as a topic of research. The 1980s kicked off a more modern type of anthropology where anthropologists began to look at themselves as \u201cthe other\u201d. Brazil did not have an issue of [[alterity]] or exoticism, because it existed within its own borders. Brazil began to value exoticism and viewed it as the acknowledgement of cultural diversity according to [[:pt:Mariza Peirano|Mariza Peirano]]. In general, the overall current goal for Brazilian anthropology was to better the future for modernization by enlightening modern political elite and identifying relevant topics for investigation. Some of Brazil's main anthropological institutions are the University of Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian Association of Anthropology.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins|last=Boskovic|first=Alexander|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Mariza G.S. Peirano|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=186\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n=== Colombia ===\nAnthropology in Colombia was institutionalized during the mid-1940s. Between the 1950s-70's, Colombian anthropologists sought to integrate into national society and began to deal with terms like culture, integration, and assimilation. However, during the 1970s, this early understanding of anthropology was opposed and anthropologists began to confront terms such as national integration because they felt it was loaded with other issues like racial supremacy. Emerging social movements encouraged this new way of thinking because it recognized the rights of peasant and ethnic populations as well as the influence of Marxism. Anthropologists continued this way of thinking through the 1980s although a larger influence from militant anthropology became apparent. By militant anthropology, Myriam Jimeno refers to anthropologists who often debate and participate, but write very little. The goal of this type of anthropology was to alter the symbols of national identity and to accompany new ethnic movements in finding representation. Anthropologists and ethnic groups aimed to challenge the way indigenous groups were being ostracized by cultural hegemony. Later on in 1991, Colombia underwent a process of constitutional reform and development in attempt to recognize more cultural and ethnic rights. Some of its current most influential institutions are the [[Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History]], the Colombian National University, and the National Institute of Ethnology.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=A companion to Latin American anthropology|last=Poole|first=Deborah|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Jimeno, Myriam|isbn=978-0631234685|location=Malden, MA|pages=72\u201389|oclc=165081955}}</ref>\n\n=== Costa Rica ===\n[[File:Margarita Bola\u00f1os.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Presidenta del Partido Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana '''[[Margarita Bola\u00f1os Arqu\u00edn]]''']]\nCosta Rican anthropology was institutionalized in 1967 under political influence. According to [[Margarita Bola\u00f1os Arqu\u00edn]], increasing notions of nationalism and anti imperialism led to the institutionalization of social sciences in Costa Rica. During the 1960s, around the time of institutionalization, social scientists' primary focus was on the birth and implications of social movements, as well as the consequences of modernization in rural areas. Later, French [[Structural Marxism]] influenced the social sciences to take an interest in the study of class structures. Over time, anthropology in Costa Rica was highly criticized in its struggle to find its identity. Caught in a sort of balancing act between western and Latin American practice, anthropology in Costa Rica eventually learned to take the criticisms of other anthropologies and made a name for itself with a focus on gender studies, identity studies, and developmental problems. To legitimize their discipline, anthropology contributed to other sciences such as linguistics, agriculture, and psychology. However, during the 1980s Costa Rica endured a recession, and anthropological institutions were under threat. During this time, [[globalization]] was becoming increasingly popular and while during the recession of the 1980s Costa Rica was not seen as a power player, at the start of the 1990s, the country could now participate in ways that were productive. It was not until around the 1990s that anthropologists regained the opportunity to research and, after such political and economic turmoil, there was much to question. Throughout the 1990s the focus of anthropology and other disciplines such as sociology continued to research in rural areas but shifted their research to the survival of the poor during tough economic times.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bolanos|first=Margarita|date=Fall 2002|title=Costa Rican Social Anthropology in the Central American Context at the End of the Twentieth Century|url=|journal=Practicing Anthropology|volume=24|issue=4|pages=17\u201321|doi=10.17730/praa.24.4.yu20r31583757427}}</ref>\n\n=== Mexico ===\n[[Manuel Gamio]], the first Mexican anthropologist, earned his PhD in 1921, having studied under [[Franz Boas]]. The first anthropology department was established in 1938. Indigenous population studies known as indigenism, are an integral part of Mexican anthropology, and became popular during the presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas|L\u00e1zaro Cardenas]], serving from 1934\u20131940. The [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] was established by President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] in 1939, and remains a prominent place of anthropological study in Latin America. The nation-building interests of incorporating the indigenous population into the Mexican state also led to the establishment of the Inter-American Indian Institute in 1942, in Mexico City, along with the establishment of the academic journal, America Ind\u00edgena. Marxist theory was predominantly used to analyze social phenomena, and was combined with social evolution theory that viewed Mexico in three historical time phases: pre-Hispanic, Colonial, and Modern.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Lazaro cardenas2.jpg|thumb|President Lazaro Cardenas \nIn office 1934-1940\n]]\nIn the 1970s, [[Gonzalo Aguirre Beltr\u00e1n]], an anthropologist who was formerly a medical doctor worked for the federal government and promoted critical anthropology in Mexico that used Marxist theory and rejected imperialistic practices from the United States. Mexico's urban populations began to increase in the 1970s, which became another topic of study for anthropologists. In the 1980s, Gramscian Marxism became the theoretical center, and studies included rural and urban populations, and labor. Institutions of anthropology have continued to increase since the 1980s, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees. Neo-liberal market transformations in the 1990s have affected anthropological training presently, as students may find careers not only in the universities, but non-governmental organizations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribeiro|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Esteban Krotz|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=87\u2013109|chapter=Mexican Anthropology's Ongoing Search for Identity}}</ref>\n\n== Asia ==\nAsia includes the countries China, Japan, Philippines, and Siberia. Anthropology in Asia has been influenced by Western anthropological ideologies through colonial contact, historically. While the discipline of anthropology is historically built from nation-building and colonization from core countries, language and publishing barriers, funding opportunities and political status all influence the structure of anthropological research in each Asian country. Anthropology in the social and cultural perspective have not always had a strong tradition in Asian anthropology, but ethnography, ethnology, and folklore often have dominant roots within the discipline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== China ===\n[[File:Cai_Yuanpei_1.jpg|thumb|Cai Yuanpei, the father of anthropology in China]]\n[[China|Chinese]] anthropology was founded by scholar [[Cai Yuanpei]]. Cai Yuanpei was a scholar educated at the [[University of Leipzig]], and he brought both Western influence and standardization into the discipline of anthropology in China. The first department of anthropology was founded in 1928 with Cai Yuanpei's creation of [[Academia Sinica]] in [[Beijing]]. At Academia Sinica, physical anthropology and archaeology held focus.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite book|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|last=Smart|first=Josephine|publisher=|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|pages=69\u201385|oclc=62324831|date = February 2006}}</ref>\n\nFranz Boas also brought Western influence to China, and British functionalism would make a lasting impact on Chinese anthropology. In addition to Cai Yuanpei, [[Wu Wenzao]] was one of the most influential proponents of Western-influenced anthropology, and he took classes under [[Ruth Benedict]] (one of Boas\u2019 students that would be influential in the field of anthropology on her own overall).<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite book|title=The making of anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Liu|first=Xin|date=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Yamashita, Shinji., Bosco, Joseph, 1957-, Eades, J.

With this revitalization, Chinese anthropologists began to look inwards at themselves for subjects of study. This inward focus led anthropologists of the time to attempt to use anthropology to better Chinese society.<ref name=\":32\" /> 1940-late 1950s was a time of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in China, followed by 1957-1977 and [[Mao Zedong]]\u2019s era of the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref name=\":22\" /> During this time, Maoist aims supplemented ethnology and Chinese national identity creation.<ref name=\":22\" />\n[[File:Chinese_Academy_of_Social_Sciences_building_photo_from_VOA.jpg|thumb|243x243px|Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) building]]\nPost-1978 was a time of reform in China following the end of Mao Zedong's leadership. Academia was reconstructed, and anthropology subsequently saw a revival during this time. Exchanges between foreign faculty and students helped to globalize Chinese anthropology and bring in other perspectives.<ref name=\":22\" /> Liang Zhaotong was an advocate for the revival of social and cultural anthropology, but for this to happen, anthropology had to be seen as a useful tool for improvements in the field of the social sciences and society.<ref name=\":32\" /> Anthropology was held in lower regard than ethnology in China due to the ideology of Mao Zedong, and anthropologists left anthropology for other disciplines in social science, such as sociology, which subsequently saw a large period of development in the 1980s. This lower regard for anthropology also caused the field to receive less attention and less funding from the public and Chinese institutions.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\nThe [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) and the [[State Education Committee]] founded the Chinese Anthropological Association in 1981 (now part of the East Asian Anthropological Association). Today, anthropology in China is still influenced by its history of being less practical and less important in the field of social sciences. This causes a lack of public interest and awareness in Chinese anthropology in favor of more \u201cprofessional\u201d disciplines, such as medicine, business, law, etc.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Japan ===\n[[File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|thumb|Torii Ryuzo 1952]]\nThe creation of anthropology in [[Japan]] was a response to the research of [[Edward S. Morse|Edward Morse]], the first professor of Zoology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he discovered signs of cannibalism in Japan. Japanese nationalism motivated Japanese peoples to study themselves rather than being subjects of study by outsiders. This motivation led to the formation of Anthropological Society of [[Tokyo]] in 1886. Tsuboi Sh\u00f4gor\u00f4 was a leading member of this group, and he is named one of the founding fathers of Japanese anthropology. In 1892, he became the first professor of anthropology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Bosco|first=Joseph|last2=Eades|first2=J.S.|last3=Yamashita|first3=Shinji|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-57181-259-9|location=United States|pages=2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, the Japanese colonial empire was marked by the annexation of [[Taiwan]] and led to an increase in domestic ethnographers in this region. [[Torii Ry\u016bz\u014d]] was Tsuboi's successor and greatly attributed data and photographs of Taiwan during this time period. His own research abroad redirected peoples' focus from themselves, Japanese folklore-studies, to the colonial Others.<ref name=\":5\" /> The expansion [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|Japanese imperialism]] drove [[Torii Ry\u016bz\u014d|Ry\u016bz\u014d]]'s research of others. This shift in research subjects created a separate discipline, ethnology or 'race studies.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania|last=Shimizu|first=Akitoshi|last2=van Breman|first2=Jan|publisher=Curzon Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7007-0604-4|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Japanese Society of Ethnology (''Nihon Minzokugakkai'') was formed, which separated Japanese folklore and ethnological studies from comparative ethnology.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1968, the Eighth Congress of the [[International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences]] (IUAES) was held in Japan.\n\nIn 2004, in response to the IUAES, the Japanese Society of Ethnology changed its name to the Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology; this is one of the largest organizations at 2,000 members.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nConsidered to be a semi-peripheral country in comparison to the West, Japan is home to the largest number of anthropologists in Asia as well as the largest center for anthropological research in Asia.<ref name=\":5\" /> Japan's history resembles a colonial power in East Asia. Currently, language and audience discrepancies hinder open conversations between Japanese and American anthropologies. Since Western academic anthropologists publish in English, their local and global audience is essentially one. In Japan, writing for a global audience requires publishing in English. While Japanese scholars are knowledgeable about Western anthropological theories and trends, institutional factors deter Japanese anthropologists to publish in English; a more extensive peer review process can delay publication approval for years resulting in outdated empirical data. Japanese academics prefer to publish in university in-house journals where there is a much shorter delay in publication approval. A local audience means publishing in Japanese and increasing the gap between world anthropologies.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nThe movement of [[indigenization]] of anthropology in the [[Philippines]] challenges foreign-adopted Western concepts, theories and methods. To understand the viewpoints of this process, indigenization can be examined as a historical process, a perspective of native concepts, and as both a problem and solution created by colonial or neocolonial educational curriculum.<ref name=\":6\">Yamashita, Shinji, et al. \u201cTowards Indigenization: Responses, Challenges, and Experiences in the Philippines.\u201d ''The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia'', Berghahn Books, 2004, pp. 335\u2013353.</ref>\n\nFrom 1560\u20131898, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial regime. During this time, Spanish colonizers established society through theologoical orthodoxy. They valued their own written history over the Philippines' native traditions, and oral tradition was undermined by colonization.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nFrom 1898\u20131941, the second period of colonization by the United States took place. Ethnographic knowledge was established as the basis of integration of indigenous elements into mainstream Philippine society. In 1914, anthropology curriculum was established at the [[University of the Philippines]], and three years later, an anthropology department was created. In 1921, the anthropology department at the University of Philippines merged with the sociology department.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDuring the post-war era (1946-1968), student activism, national pride and identity reinforced the process of decolonization; the University of the Philippines was at the forefront of this movement. Filipino scholars increasingly pursued graduate programs in the United States anthropology departments. This created an issue that will be discussed further.\n\nFrom 1970\u20131986, social and political consciousness in the Philippines marked a revolutionary period. The country adopted conflict models; Marxist ideology was more suitable for the Philippines that was in a crisis state. In the late 1970s, the Philippine Folklore Society was formed. This growth of folklore studies was due to the further development of indigenization in the Philippines. In 1977, The Philippine Anthropological Society (Ugnayan ng Agham Tao or UGAT) was founded.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAfter 1986, this period was marked by a heightened cultural consciousness. President Corazon Aquino promoted culture through creation of the National Commission for Culture and Arts (NCCA).\n\nThe distance between native and foreign anthropologists is a conflict in the Philippines. While most scholars receive formal education in Western societies, they often return \"home\" and view their native society through a foreign, Westernized lens they were conditioned and educated by. Native anthropologists are hindered by a perspective based on bias. Interests, training, values, and field exposure can result in differences between foreign and native anthropologists. It is important to recognize these different angles, politics of representation, and ethnographic authority in order to successful observe others as well as our own societies.<ref name=\":6\" /> Another challenge in anthropology in the Philippines is discussed by Filipino anthropologist, Carlos Jr. P Tatel, about funding for research on governmental and regional levels.

The first departments to include something like anthropology were departments of ethnology, which were concerned with ethnography and folklore, and were worked in to the departments of [[philology]] or history. Anthropology itself was introduced at [[New Bulgarian University]] (NBU) as a priority, but they had to combine with a discipline recognized by the state, which like in many other cases, was the department of sociology with the degree being a sociology one. It wasn't until around 2004 that anthropology got its own department with its own degree in Bulgaria.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOne of Bulgarian anthropology's main focuses at first was to carve out their own niche as a discipline, especially considering that Bulgarian anthropologists come from a variety of backgrounds. They were also left with ideas from the socialist period and the fall of communism. There was also focus on the changing social conditions from the period of transition after the fall of communism. There was push for democratization in Bulgaria, and anthropology became something of a symbol for that change.<ref name=\":13\" /> Despite this, there was still polarization on methods and ideology within the new discipline based on debates about Soviet versus Western styles of education, which were understood to be ideological opposites. The shift was eventually toward Western ideas. Bulgarian anthropologists tend to focus on research within their own borders, but also research in [[Balkans]]. Despite the branching out of Bulgaria, there are a limited number of field-research sites, a limited number of subjects, and a limited number of methods taken advantage of by Bulgarian anthropologists. Much attention is paid to community formation, complex societies, power, polity, statehood, nationalism, myth, ritual, religion, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, nation-hood, magic, medicine, and multiculturality.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n[[File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|thumb|250x250px|'''Location of Czech Republic on the map''']]\nThe [[Czech Republic]] takes a constructivist approach to anthropology (closely connected to ethnology), which they take a positivist approach to.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Jakoubek|first=Marek|date=2016|title=Anthropology in Eastern Europe Between Positivism and Constructivism: A Case from the Czech Republic|url=|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|volume=22|issue=3|pages=25\u201345|via=}}</ref> Ethnology is taken to be trying to get at objective truth, where anthropology is getting at social constructs and beliefs. Despite this split between ideas of ethnology and anthropology in the Czech Republic, anthropology is not yet a fully established discipline. After the split from communism in 1989, there was a turn to socio-cultural anthropology in the way of ideology, but it was inconsistent. Some academics saw it as the same thing as ethnology, while others thought of it as a different research field with different methods and traditions, which resulted in the difficulty of establishing anthropology as a discipline.

Ethnology was the study of different ethnic groups within the state, which supported the push for homogenization and national unification of the Russian state. [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] replaced Western anthropological theory, and various university departments were closed as Russia experienced an ideological reconstruction.<ref name=\":02\" /> In the mid-20th century, with undercurrents of the [[Cold War]], social and cultural anthropology were rejected from ethnographic study, but ethnography was re-institutionalized and strengthened in universities and institutions across Russia.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, Russian ethnography to other parts of the world in which Soviet influence was strong, such as [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Perestroika]] in 1985 led to another bout of reconstruction for anthropology, and Russian science in general. Institutes were renamed and reconfigured to match this new trend. Social anthropology also began to make a comeback, leading to identity problems for social anthropology as a discipline in a country with such a strong ethnographic tradition that had excluded it for years.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe 1990s, a time of great social and political change for Russia with the end of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], were a time for critical introspective views on the recent past.<ref name=\":02\" /> With this, Russian anthropology turned towards more contemporary interests, where it still is today. Even with these contemporary interests, Russian anthropology still finds itself heavily influenced by the ethnology of its past and attempting to reconcile what it means to be a \u201csocial\u201d anthropologist in this environment.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== Anthropology of the Arab World ==\nThe discipline of anthropology is not new to the [[Arab world]]. While there were no established anthropological institutions until the 20th century, scholars such as [[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]], are recognized for their contribution to the discipline as early as the 10th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ata.org.tn/fichier_PDF/tsr5-2012-chaabani.pdf|title=Insights on the history of Anthropology|last1=Chaabani|first1=Hassen|website=ata.org|publisher=International Journal of Modern Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref> [[Egypt]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and the [[Persian Gulf]] region have received most of the scholarly attention, with a particular focus on [[nationalism]] and the state. The Arab youth are a growing area of interest for anthropologists in the [[Arab world]]. Comparatively little research is done in [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], the [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]]. This is in part a result of accessibility and the conditions of the states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref> That status of anthropology in the Arab world would be labeled as peripheral in relation to anthropology in other regions of the world.\n\n== Middle East ==\n=== Iran ===\nThe man known as the father of Iranian Anthropology was named [[Sadegh Hedayat]] (1903-1951). His focus was on folklore. In 1937, an institute of ethnology was founded in Iran, which then closed in 1941. It then reopened with the rise to power of [[Mohammed Reza Shah]]. From 1956 to 1959, it published a journal titled \"Majalle-ye Mardomshenasi\" (Journal of Anthropology). In 1957, the first anthropological elective course offered at a college level in Iran began at the [[University of Tehran]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shahshahani|first1=Soheila|date=1986|title=History of Anthropology in Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=65\u201386|doi=10.1080/00210868608701669}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, there was not as much of an emphasis placed on receiving degrees from foreign universities. Similarly, international research was also not highly valued. International study and research, however, has begun gaining more and more importance within the departments of anthropology in Iran. Anthropology in Iran suffers from a poor reputation in the public sphere. It is considered to be a weak discipline, according to Iranian anthropologist, [[Soheila Shahshahani]]. Perhaps because of this, most students of the social sciences tend to choose other disciplines, such as law, management, and psychology. As society changes, more attention is being paid to the field. Today, ethnographic research in the area focused on internal subjects, such as the pastoralists living in the arid areas around Iran. These studies continue today, but other fields of interest have started to emerge. A new focus on small town life and rural areas has recently developed. Professor Shahshanani states that the weakness of current anthology in Iran is the lack of theoretical work done by its practitioners. She also goes on to say that these issues could be solved by getting Iranian anthropologists who have trained elsewhere to come back and practice in Iran.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dominguez|first1=Virginia|last2=Metzner|first2=Emily|title=An Interview With Iranian Anthropologist Soheila Shahshahani|journal=American Anthropologist}}</ref>\n\n== Levant ==\n=== Lebanon ===\nThe department of sociology at the [[American University of Beirut]] was the first to offer an anthropology course, which is listed in its 1950-51 catalogue. The department of anthropology was officially founded in the 1970s, and saw 33 students graduate with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology throughout that decade. The [[Lebanese Civil War]], which lasted from 1975\u20131990, interfered with the development of the department and anthropology at the university saw a decline as a direct result. During this time, the new department of social and behavioral sciences (SBS) which already encompassed sociology, psychology, and communication, absorbed the anthropology department.<ref name=\"Anthropology in Beirut\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/873907|title=Anthropology in Beirut|last1=King|first1=Diane E|last2=Scheid|first2=Kirsten|website=academia|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, records show just one student having graduated with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology, while there were none in the 1990s. There were three anthropologists on the faculty throughout this time. Among them were [[Fuad Khuri]], Martha Mundy, and Gerald Obermeyer.\n\nA survey conducted in 1989 by Seteney Shami, a 1976 graduate of the BA program in anthropology at the American University in Beirut, sought to learn more about the teachings of anthropology at universities in the Arab world. Her findings suggested that the role of the discipline in the Arab world were minimal. In an academic report that came out in 2006, anthropologists at the same university claim to have found little evidence in the local community of any significant changes since.\n\nToday's anthropology graduates in Lebanon have opportunities to work with local NGOs. However, for those interested in pursuing anthropology as a discipline, the West still stands as the one destination for that. Anthropology departments at the American University in Beirut, and in Lebanon, are stifled by war.<ref name=\"Anthropology in Beirut\"/>\n\nAs a destination for anthropologists to do research, Lebanon is among the top spots for emerging scholars in the Arab world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Palestine ===\nPalestine has seen an increase in research conducted in the territory and among the Palestinian communities in Israel, as well as refugee camps in neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe history of Palestinian anthropology can be marked by four modes of ethnographic engagement: Biblical Palestine, Oriental Palestine, Absent Palestine, and Post-Structural Palestine.\n\n'''Biblical Palestine''' refers to the main method of ethnographic engagement of Palestine which took place in the first decades of the 20th century. Led predominately by Europeans, their interest was motivated by the use of the Bible as a legitimizing text to influence the region. Early work consisted of European writers fetishizing and romanticizing the land and the people based on the Biblical figures.\n\n'''Oriental Palestine''', a term coined by a Palestinian scholar (find scholar, cite) was the leading mode of engagement throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. It was marked by a sense of urgency to document Palestine as a source of Europe's beginnings. Through this lens, a narrative was offered that challenged the colonial British vision of Palestinian history which saw the Arabs there as \"transient and ephemeral\". It was also marked by a sense of duty among others to capture the traditional fabric of Palestine before its dissolution, which appeared evident at the time due to the events surrounding the rise of Zionism.\n\n'''Absent Palestine''' follows immediately after the demise of Palestine in 1948, and can only be fully understood in terms of the success of Zionism. In this sense, the state of Palestine was eclipsed by the narrative of Israel as a place offering a safe haven to endangered refugees from Europe. This ethnographic silence of Palestinians is seen as the turning point in Israel's image of modernity.\n\n'''Post-Structural Palestine''' is the current main method of ethnographic engagement. It is known primarily for its stance that challenges and brings to question Israel's efforts to repress Palestinian nationalism. The movement has seen a rising trend in which the Palestinian subject is explored for their national identity, rather than silenced.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Ethnographic Arriving of Palestine|journal = Annual Review of Anthropology|volume = 40|pages = 475\u2013491|last1=Furani|first1=Khaled|last2=Rabinowitz|first2=Dan|doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145910|year = 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nAnthropology as a discipline in Turkey can trace its roots back to 1925. Developing in an nationalistic atmosphere, The Anthropology Institute, otherwise known as The Center for Anthropological Research in Turkey, was established on that year within the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Istanbul]]. From 1925 to the 1960s, the main topics of research centered around studies of rural and village life, with a focus on nation building. In the 1960s, a series of military coups occurred, causing considerable changes to the field and to academia itself. It was not until the year 1997 that the first official department of anthropology was established in Turkey, at the private [[Yeditepe University]] in Istanbul. As of 2010, 6 of the 53 state universities in Turkey offered training in anthropology. In contrast to this, only one of the 24 private universities offer similar training. The first anthropological association in Turkey was founded in 1992.<ref>{{cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice On The Margins|last1=Bo\u0161kovi\u0107|first1=Aleksandar|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|pages=110\u2013123}}</ref>\n\n== Persian Gulf ==\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\nMany Anthropologists investigate the tribal system in Saudi Arabia. Anthropology was not popular in many countries; however, the Universities in Saudi Arabia are adopting Anthropology. \n* What is the opposite of the impression of tribes is the ideology of regression. The idea that the tribe gets its meaning from the patriarchal descent. Which is now called Saudi genealogy. One of the famous genealogy is Hamad Aljassar who dead in 2000(Alshamlan). \n* Golf scholars are interested in how migrants and other racial groups are racialized by the legal system. They are also interested in examining the built environment, the history of the transnational connection and the rapid social change (Deep & Winger).\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nAnthropological studies, which are concerned with the privacy of the UAE community with a tribal background are rare and limited.\n* Most of the studies are written with other international anthropologists such as the ethnographic observations of a British Anthropologists Bertram Thomas.\nTribes are the most form of UAE. Many anthropologists are interested in investigating the form of tribes. Many of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] are also based on the tribal system.\n* Moreover, there are many migrants in UAE from two sides: The first side is the center and the south of the Arabian Peninsula. The second side of the eastern coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], contains many foreign migrations from the neighboring countries of Asia. There are also migrants from Iran. The main intention of those migrants is settling in UAE.\n* The UAE community is a multi-tribal community. A multi-cultural community that divides communities into socially and economically linked in different sectors of the workforce(Alsnagry).\n\n=== Qatar and Bahrain ===\nIn Qatar and Bahrain, anthropology was not as popular as other fields, like many other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Anthropology is expanding in educational aspect. Many anthropologists are also concerned on the structure of the tribes in the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region (Gardner).\n\n== North Africa ==\n=== Egypt ===\nWithin the Arab-majority countries, [[Egypt]], has established itself among the other Arab-majority countries as the main hub for anthropologists in the region, with [[Cairo]] being the center for most of this attention. The rest of the country remains relatively understudied. Increased attention to [[Cairo]] can be attributed to the rise of anthropological interest in cities, particularly to the diverse interdisciplinary scholarship.\n\nThe centrality of Middle East area studies is largely responsible for the increase in anthropological attention towards Egypt. In addition to this is the accessibility of institutional support for US scholars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of the early 21st century, the relationship of Egypt with anthropology remains under question. Egyptian anthropologist, [[Hania Sholkamy]], remarks that there are four main points that shape this ongoing relationship: the relationship of methods to theory, the relationship between methods and their analysis, the relationship of culture to its determinants, and the relationship between having data and being able to evaluate it.\n\nThe discipline of anthropology is in a constant state of judgment within Egypt, particularly when compared with the discipline of demography. The qualitative data more common in demography is given more attention than the theoretical and analytical methods associated with anthropology.\n\n=== Morocco ===\nIn Morocco, topics of anthropological research include the ethnicization of Jews, the construction of ethnicity among Berber, Arab, and Haratine groups through agricultural practices, and how Berber ethnicities are politicized in ways that create raced and gendered notions of homeland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Africa ==\nThe region of Africa has had a long history of being colonized by others in economic and cultural ways, which is why the study of anthropology in Africa is a relatively new discipline that is usually grouped with historical work.

The countries that are summarized in this section include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean region, Costa Rica, and Colombia. For the moment, not included are discussions of anthropology (or ethnology) in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, or Haiti. Latin America anthropologists established their discipline in conjunction with American and European anthropologists, and revised their disciplines to study cultural phenomena through their own perspectives, independent of American and European thought. [[File:Map-Latin America and Caribbean.png|thumb|Latin America and the Caribbean]]\n\n=== Andes ===\nAndean anthropology's roots began during the turn of the 20th century, containing social movements between two groups in Peru, and from academia within the United States. The mestizo (non-native) and indigenous intellectuals known as indigenistas competed for political and intellectual space and recognition in Peru. Indigenous intellectuals advocated for interculturalidad, where indigenous thought could occupy Peruvian society as its own entity and not become blended as a singular national identity that the mestizaje proposed.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribiero|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Marisol de la Cadena|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=201\u2013224|chapter=The Production of Other Knowledges and Its Tensions: From Andeanist Anthropology to Interculturalidad?}}</ref>\n\nThe mestizaje perspective sought to modernize Peru and model their society similar to the United States. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas]] was a writer and ethnographer in Peru, who classified himself as an indigenous intellectual that challenged Western thought and ideology. [[John Victor Murra]], an anthropologist teaching in the United States collaborated with Arguedas. Their collaboration stemmed from Murra's travels in 1952 to the Latin American region when he was working under the anthropologist [[Sidney Mintz]] as a PhD student. Indigenistas were active in social and political movements in Latin America and collaborated with people inside of the United States, but still sought to be independent from Western thought.<ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Logo of the American Anthropological Association.png|thumb|AAA]]\nIn 1936, the [[American Anthropological Association]] initiated studies in Latin America on how to incorporate indigenous people in Latin American society, termed acculturation studies, and in 1935, the [[Social Science Research Council]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the Committee on Latin American studies worked to benefit the interests of the United States. The Peruvian government funded anthropological institutions beginning in the 1940s, and the establishment of the Instiuto de Etnologia y Arqueologia and a Peruvian sector in the Instituto Indigneista Interamericano followed. By the 1960s Peruvian governmental funding decreased, and became reliant upon the United States for funding. The indigenous incorporation into the goal of a singular society was termed cholification by the Peruvian sociologist [[An\u00edbal Quijano|Anibal Quijano]]. In the 1990s during the Neo-liberal era, indigenous thought became more recognized with political conflicts in the Andean region, and interculturalidad was pursued again for Andean states to recognize the diversity of the people that occupied them.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Argentina ===\nSocial Anthropology was established in Argentina in 1957. It was first institutionalized at the University of [[Buenos Aires]]. Before the institutionalization of social anthropology, the discipline largely focused on historical studies. Rosana Guber attributes the introduction of social anthropology to [[Esther Hermitte]] who was a history professor at the Ethnographic Museum in Argentina. It was during her trips to the University of Chicago that she was introduced to social anthropology, and so it was the west who influenced the institutionalization of social anthropology in Argentina. In 1965, students began to ask for a discipline separate from sociology, and that was not focused primarily on indigenous people. There was a movement around this time that called for a greater understanding of the changes modern society was going through, especially during and after the 1966 [[Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina]]. Later, in 1974, students and faculty within departments that were studying social movements and change suffered kidnappings and murders by the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Argentine AntiCommunist Alliance]]. The current status of Argentinian anthropology is still deeply rooted in western influence.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Committed or Scientific?

Later during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was experiencing political authoritarianism. As a result, anthropology began to address inter-ethnic friction. In the 1970s anthropologists began to consider nearby urban studies as a topic of research. The 1980s kicked off a more modern type of anthropology where anthropologists began to look at themselves as \u201cthe other\u201d. Brazil did not have an issue of [[alterity]] or exoticism, because it existed within its own borders. Brazil began to value exoticism and viewed it as the acknowledgement of cultural diversity according to [[:pt:Mariza Peirano|Mariza Peirano]]. In general, the overall current goal for Brazilian anthropology was to better the future for modernization by enlightening modern political elite and identifying relevant topics for investigation. Some of Brazil's main anthropological institutions are the University of Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian Association of Anthropology.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins|last=Boskovic|first=Alexander|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Mariza G.S.

Between the 1950s-70's, Colombian anthropologists sought to integrate into national society and began to deal with terms like culture, integration, and assimilation. However, during the 1970s, this early understanding of anthropology was opposed and anthropologists began to confront terms such as national integration because they felt it was loaded with other issues like racial supremacy. Emerging social movements encouraged this new way of thinking because it recognized the rights of peasant and ethnic populations as well as the influence of Marxism. Anthropologists continued this way of thinking through the 1980s although a larger influence from militant anthropology became apparent. By militant anthropology, Myriam Jimeno refers to anthropologists who often debate and participate, but write very little. The goal of this type of anthropology was to alter the symbols of national identity and to accompany new ethnic movements in finding representation. Anthropologists and ethnic groups aimed to challenge the way indigenous groups were being ostracized by cultural hegemony. Later on in 1991, Colombia underwent a process of constitutional reform and development in attempt to recognize more cultural and ethnic rights. Some of its current most influential institutions are the [[Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History]], the Colombian National University, and the National Institute of Ethnology.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=A companion to Latin American anthropology|last=Poole|first=Deborah|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Jimeno, Myriam|isbn=978-0631234685|location=Malden, MA|pages=72\u201389|oclc=165081955}}</ref>\n\n=== Costa Rica ===\n[[File:Margarita Bola\u00f1os.jpg|thumb|305x305px|Presidenta del Partido Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana '''[[Margarita Bola\u00f1os Arqu\u00edn]]''']]\nCosta Rican anthropology was institutionalized in 1967 under political influence. According to [[Margarita Bola\u00f1os Arqu\u00edn]], increasing notions of nationalism and anti imperialism led to the institutionalization of social sciences in Costa Rica. During the 1960s, around the time of institutionalization, social scientists' primary focus was on the birth and implications of social movements, as well as the consequences of modernization in rural areas. Later, French [[Structural Marxism]] influenced the social sciences to take an interest in the study of class structures. Over time, anthropology in Costa Rica was highly criticized in its struggle to find its identity. Caught in a sort of balancing act between western and Latin American practice, anthropology in Costa Rica eventually learned to take the criticisms of other anthropologies and made a name for itself with a focus on gender studies, identity studies, and developmental problems. To legitimize their discipline, anthropology contributed to other sciences such as linguistics, agriculture, and psychology. However, during the 1980s Costa Rica endured a recession, and anthropological institutions were under threat. During this time, [[globalization]] was becoming increasingly popular and while during the recession of the 1980s Costa Rica was not seen as a power player, at the start of the 1990s, the country could now participate in ways that were productive. It was not until around the 1990s that anthropologists regained the opportunity to research and, after such political and economic turmoil, there was much to question. Throughout the 1990s the focus of anthropology and other disciplines such as sociology continued to research in rural areas but shifted their research to the survival of the poor during tough economic times.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bolanos|first=Margarita|date=Fall 2002|title=Costa Rican Social Anthropology in the Central American Context at the End of the Twentieth Century|url=|journal=Practicing Anthropology|volume=24|issue=4|pages=17\u201321|doi=10.17730/praa.24.4.yu20r31583757427}}</ref>\n\n=== Mexico ===\n[[Manuel Gamio]], the first Mexican anthropologist, earned his PhD in 1921, having studied under [[Franz Boas]].

The [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] was established by President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] in 1939, and remains a prominent place of anthropological study in Latin America. The nation-building interests of incorporating the indigenous population into the Mexican state also led to the establishment of the Inter-American Indian Institute in 1942, in Mexico City, along with the establishment of the academic journal, America Ind\u00edgena. Marxist theory was predominantly used to analyze social phenomena, and was combined with social evolution theory that viewed Mexico in three historical time phases: pre-Hispanic, Colonial, and Modern.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Lazaro cardenas2.jpg|thumb|President Lazaro Cardenas \nIn office 1934-1940\n]]\nIn the 1970s, [[Gonzalo Aguirre Beltr\u00e1n]], an anthropologist who was formerly a medical doctor worked for the federal government and promoted critical anthropology in Mexico that used Marxist theory and rejected imperialistic practices from the United States. Mexico's urban populations began to increase in the 1970s, which became another topic of study for anthropologists. In the 1980s, Gramscian Marxism became the theoretical center, and studies included rural and urban populations, and labor. Institutions of anthropology have continued to increase since the 1980s, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees. Neo-liberal market transformations in the 1990s have affected anthropological training presently, as students may find careers not only in the universities, but non-governmental organizations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribeiro|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Esteban Krotz|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=87\u2013109|chapter=Mexican Anthropology's Ongoing Search for Identity}}</ref>\n\n== Asia ==\nAsia includes the countries China, Japan, Philippines, and Siberia.

This lower regard for anthropology also caused the field to receive less attention and less funding from the public and Chinese institutions.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\nThe [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) and the [[State Education Committee]] founded the Chinese Anthropological Association in 1981 (now part of the East Asian Anthropological Association). Today, anthropology in China is still influenced by its history of being less practical and less important in the field of social sciences. This causes a lack of public interest and awareness in Chinese anthropology in favor of more \u201cprofessional\u201d disciplines, such as medicine, business, law, etc.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Japan ===\n[[File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|thumb|Torii Ryuzo 1952]]\nThe creation of anthropology in [[Japan]] was a response to the research of [[Edward S. Morse|Edward Morse]], the first professor of Zoology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he discovered signs of cannibalism in Japan. Japanese nationalism motivated Japanese peoples to study themselves rather than being subjects of study by outsiders. This motivation led to the formation of Anthropological Society of [[Tokyo]] in 1886. Tsuboi Sh\u00f4gor\u00f4 was a leading member of this group, and he is named one of the founding fathers of Japanese anthropology. In 1892, he became the first professor of anthropology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Bosco|first=Joseph|last2=Eades|first2=J.S.|last3=Yamashita|first3=Shinji|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-57181-259-9|location=United States|pages=2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, the Japanese colonial empire was marked by the annexation of [[Taiwan]] and led to an increase in domestic ethnographers in this region. [[Torii Ry\u016bz\u014d]] was Tsuboi's successor and greatly attributed data and photographs of Taiwan during this time period. His own research abroad redirected peoples' focus from themselves, Japanese folklore-studies, to the colonial Others.<ref name=\":5\" /> The expansion [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|Japanese imperialism]] drove [[Torii Ry\u016bz\u014d|Ry\u016bz\u014d]]'s research of others. This shift in research subjects created a separate discipline, ethnology or 'race studies.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania|last=Shimizu|first=Akitoshi|last2=van Breman|first2=Jan|publisher=Curzon Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7007-0604-4|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Japanese Society of Ethnology (''Nihon Minzokugakkai'') was formed, which separated Japanese folklore and ethnological studies from comparative ethnology.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1968, the Eighth Congress of the [[International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences]] (IUAES) was held in Japan.\n\nIn 2004, in response to the IUAES, the Japanese Society of Ethnology changed its name to the Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology; this is one of the largest organizations at 2,000 members.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nConsidered to be a semi-peripheral country in comparison to the West, Japan is home to the largest number of anthropologists in Asia as well as the largest center for anthropological research in Asia.<ref name=\":5\" /> Japan's history resembles a colonial power in East Asia. Currently, language and audience discrepancies hinder open conversations between Japanese and American anthropologies. Since Western academic anthropologists publish in English, their local and global audience is essentially one. In Japan, writing for a global audience requires publishing in English. While Japanese scholars are knowledgeable about Western anthropological theories and trends, institutional factors deter Japanese anthropologists to publish in English; a more extensive peer review process can delay publication approval for years resulting in outdated empirical data. Japanese academics prefer to publish in university in-house journals where there is a much shorter delay in publication approval. A local audience means publishing in Japanese and increasing the gap between world anthropologies.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nThe movement of [[indigenization]] of anthropology in the [[Philippines]] challenges foreign-adopted Western concepts, theories and methods. To understand the viewpoints of this process, indigenization can be examined as a historical process, a perspective of native concepts, and as both a problem and solution created by colonial or neocolonial educational curriculum.<ref name=\":6\">Yamashita, Shinji, et al. \u201cTowards Indigenization: Responses, Challenges, and Experiences in the Philippines.\u201d ''The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia'', Berghahn Books, 2004, pp. 335\u2013353.</ref>\n\nFrom 1560\u20131898, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial regime. During this time, Spanish colonizers established society through theologoical orthodoxy. They valued their own written history over the Philippines' native traditions, and oral tradition was undermined by colonization.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nFrom 1898\u20131941, the second period of colonization by the United States took place. Ethnographic knowledge was established as the basis of integration of indigenous elements into mainstream Philippine society. In 1914, anthropology curriculum was established at the [[University of the Philippines]], and three years later, an anthropology department was created. In 1921, the anthropology department at the University of Philippines merged with the sociology department.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDuring the post-war era (1946-1968), student activism, national pride and identity reinforced the process of decolonization; the University of the Philippines was at the forefront of this movement. Filipino scholars increasingly pursued graduate programs in the United States anthropology departments. This created an issue that will be discussed further.\n\nFrom 1970\u20131986, social and political consciousness in the Philippines marked a revolutionary period. The country adopted conflict models; Marxist ideology was more suitable for the Philippines that was in a crisis state. In the late 1970s, the Philippine Folklore Society was formed. This growth of folklore studies was due to the further development of indigenization in the Philippines. In 1977, The Philippine Anthropological Society (Ugnayan ng Agham Tao or UGAT) was founded.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAfter 1986, this period was marked by a heightened cultural consciousness. President Corazon Aquino promoted culture through creation of the National Commission for Culture and Arts (NCCA).\n\nThe distance between native and foreign anthropologists is a conflict in the Philippines. While most scholars receive formal education in Western societies, they often return \"home\" and view their native society through a foreign, Westernized lens they were conditioned and educated by. Native anthropologists are hindered by a perspective based on bias. Interests, training, values, and field exposure can result in differences between foreign and native anthropologists. It is important to recognize these different angles, politics of representation, and ethnographic authority in order to successful observe others as well as our own societies.<ref name=\":6\" /> Another challenge in anthropology in the Philippines is discussed by Filipino anthropologist, Carlos Jr. P Tatel, about funding for research on governmental and regional levels. He explains that anthropology proposals for funding often deviate from original plan in order to fit the agendas of agencies who grant travel and research funding.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tatel|first=Carlos Jr. P.|date=2017|work=Video Interview}}</ref>\n\n=== Siberia ===\n[[Siberia]] as a territory was important in the development of Russian anthropology due to its position of alterity within Russia.

The impetus to study Siberians was rooted in the idea that one day the people in the area would all assimilate to Russian culture, and due to this, the current culture of the people should be documented and recorded.<ref name=\":12\" /> Russian ideologies heavily influenced the research field in Siberia, and studying Russian and Siberian history was an easier route for research due to the uncertainty of what would be acceptable to study under the Russian government in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=\":12\" /> Under Soviet Russia in the early 20th century, ethnology moved toward a more l[[Structuralist anthropology|structural]] and [[Functionalism (anthropology)|functionalist]] view, with the goal of generally understanding human culture.<ref name=\":12\" /> When [[Joseph Stalin]] came into power, this view shifted as Stalin aimed to homogenize Russian culture and identity.<ref name=\":12\" /> Ethnologists were employed by the state with a focus on understanding, regulating, and standardizing the different ethnic groups of Russia.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n== Central and Eastern Europe ==\n[[File:Central_and_Eastern_Europe_Map.png|left|thumb|468x468px|Map of Central and Eastern Europe]]\nCentral and Eastern Europe includes the countries of Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Hungary among many others. Anthropological study is active in many places Europe through research centers, academic societies, and universities on a range of topics.

The first departments to include something like anthropology were departments of ethnology, which were concerned with ethnography and folklore, and were worked in to the departments of [[philology]] or history. Anthropology itself was introduced at [[New Bulgarian University]] (NBU) as a priority, but they had to combine with a discipline recognized by the state, which like in many other cases, was the department of sociology with the degree being a sociology one. It wasn't until around 2004 that anthropology got its own department with its own degree in Bulgaria.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOne of Bulgarian anthropology's main focuses at first was to carve out their own niche as a discipline, especially considering that Bulgarian anthropologists come from a variety of backgrounds. They were also left with ideas from the socialist period and the fall of communism. There was also focus on the changing social conditions from the period of transition after the fall of communism. There was push for democratization in Bulgaria, and anthropology became something of a symbol for that change.<ref name=\":13\" /> Despite this, there was still polarization on methods and ideology within the new discipline based on debates about Soviet versus Western styles of education, which were understood to be ideological opposites. The shift was eventually toward Western ideas. Bulgarian anthropologists tend to focus on research within their own borders, but also research in [[Balkans]]. Despite the branching out of Bulgaria, there are a limited number of field-research sites, a limited number of subjects, and a limited number of methods taken advantage of by Bulgarian anthropologists. Much attention is paid to community formation, complex societies, power, polity, statehood, nationalism, myth, ritual, religion, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, nation-hood, magic, medicine, and multiculturality.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n[[File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|thumb|250x250px|'''Location of Czech Republic on the map''']]\nThe [[Czech Republic]] takes a constructivist approach to anthropology (closely connected to ethnology), which they take a positivist approach to.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Jakoubek|first=Marek|date=2016|title=Anthropology in Eastern Europe Between Positivism and Constructivism: A Case from the Czech Republic|url=|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|volume=22|issue=3|pages=25\u201345|via=}}</ref> Ethnology is taken to be trying to get at objective truth, where anthropology is getting at social constructs and beliefs. Despite this split between ideas of ethnology and anthropology in the Czech Republic, anthropology is not yet a fully established discipline. After the split from communism in 1989, there was a turn to socio-cultural anthropology in the way of ideology, but it was inconsistent. Some academics saw it as the same thing as ethnology, while others thought of it as a different research field with different methods and traditions, which resulted in the difficulty of establishing anthropology as a discipline. Many argue for there being a real epistemological difference between the two approaches.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n=== Hungary ===\n[[Hungary|Hungarian]] anthropology is a defined discipline with its own departments and methods, though there is still overlap between anthropology and other related departments, like history and sociology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keen|first=Mike|last2=Mucha|first2=Janusz|title=Sociology in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s: A Decade of Reconstruction|url=|journal=European Societies|volume=6|issue=2|pages=123\u2013147|doi=10.1080/14616690410001690736|year=2004}}</ref> Hungarian anthropology places a premium on verifying sociological and anthropological results with scientific data.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Bokonyi|first=Sandor|last2=Hofer|first2=Tamas|last3=Kiszely|first3=Istvan|last4=Szepe|first4=Gyorgy|last5=Maday|first5=Bela|date=February 1970|title=On Hungarian Anthropology|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=61\u201365|doi=10.1086/201095}}</ref>\n[[File:Ortutay_Gyula_(1910-1978)_etnogr\u00e1fus.jpg|thumb|'''Gyula Ortutay''' 14 March 1947 \u2013 25 February 1950]]\nIn 1963, the ''Ethnographic Research Group'', which was attached to the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] was founded.

The majority of the work is published in languages other than Hungarian and appear mostly in European periodicals. Many of the works do not appear in American anthropological journals due to a gap in how things are understood between the two anthropological fields. Many Hungarian anthropologists believe that the methods and problems that they need to consider are within their own borders or within their own region. They tend to stay out of international problems and direct their funding toward internal concerns.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nBela C. Maday points out that communication is not a strong suit for Hungarian anthropologists, which makes communicating ideas with core anthropologists, like those from the U.S. or Western Europe, difficult, but there has been much dispute on this point.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Russia ===\n[[File:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_SPB.jpg|thumb|'''[[Russian Academy of Sciences]]''' in Saint Petersburg]]\nThe beginnings of anthropology in [[Russia]] can be traced back to the establishment of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] under [[Peter the Great]] in 1725.<ref name=\":02\" /> Following the Academy of Sciences, many museums were also created with the impetus for studying culture, including the Ethnographic Bureau of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] in the mid-19th century.<ref name=\":02\" /> The 1840s also saw the creation of [[physical anthropology]] and [[archaeology]] as sub-disciplines of anthropology.<ref name=\":02\" /> In 1864 the first university department for anthropology in Russia was created at [[Moscow University]].<ref name=\":02\" /> The first specialized journal for Russian anthropology, (trans.)

Ethnology was the study of different ethnic groups within the state, which supported the push for homogenization and national unification of the Russian state. [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] replaced Western anthropological theory, and various university departments were closed as Russia experienced an ideological reconstruction.<ref name=\":02\" /> In the mid-20th century, with undercurrents of the [[Cold War]], social and cultural anthropology were rejected from ethnographic study, but ethnography was re-institutionalized and strengthened in universities and institutions across Russia.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, Russian ethnography to other parts of the world in which Soviet influence was strong, such as [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Perestroika]] in 1985 led to another bout of reconstruction for anthropology, and Russian science in general. Institutes were renamed and reconfigured to match this new trend. Social anthropology also began to make a comeback, leading to identity problems for social anthropology as a discipline in a country with such a strong ethnographic tradition that had excluded it for years.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe 1990s, a time of great social and political change for Russia with the end of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], were a time for critical introspective views on the recent past.<ref name=\":02\" /> With this, Russian anthropology turned towards more contemporary interests, where it still is today.

While there were no established anthropological institutions until the 20th century, scholars such as [[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]], are recognized for their contribution to the discipline as early as the 10th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ata.org.tn/fichier_PDF/tsr5-2012-chaabani.pdf|title=Insights on the history of Anthropology|last1=Chaabani|first1=Hassen|website=ata.org|publisher=International Journal of Modern Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref> [[Egypt]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and the [[Persian Gulf]] region have received most of the scholarly attention, with a particular focus on [[nationalism]] and the state. The Arab youth are a growing area of interest for anthropologists in the [[Arab world]]. Comparatively little research is done in [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], the [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]]. This is in part a result of accessibility and the conditions of the states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref> That status of anthropology in the Arab world would be labeled as peripheral in relation to anthropology in other regions of the world.\n\n== Middle East ==\n=== Iran ===\nThe man known as the father of Iranian Anthropology was named [[Sadegh Hedayat]] (1903-1951). His focus was on folklore. In 1937, an institute of ethnology was founded in Iran, which then closed in 1941. It then reopened with the rise to power of [[Mohammed Reza Shah]]. From 1956 to 1959, it published a journal titled \"Majalle-ye Mardomshenasi\" (Journal of Anthropology). In 1957, the first anthropological elective course offered at a college level in Iran began at the [[University of Tehran]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shahshahani|first1=Soheila|date=1986|title=History of Anthropology in Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=65\u201386|doi=10.1080/00210868608701669}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, there was not as much of an emphasis placed on receiving degrees from foreign universities. Similarly, international research was also not highly valued. International study and research, however, has begun gaining more and more importance within the departments of anthropology in Iran. Anthropology in Iran suffers from a poor reputation in the public sphere. It is considered to be a weak discipline, according to Iranian anthropologist, [[Soheila Shahshahani]]. Perhaps because of this, most students of the social sciences tend to choose other disciplines, such as law, management, and psychology. As society changes, more attention is being paid to the field. Today, ethnographic research in the area focused on internal subjects, such as the pastoralists living in the arid areas around Iran. These studies continue today, but other fields of interest have started to emerge. A new focus on small town life and rural areas has recently developed. Professor Shahshanani states that the weakness of current anthology in Iran is the lack of theoretical work done by its practitioners. She also goes on to say that these issues could be solved by getting Iranian anthropologists who have trained elsewhere to come back and practice in Iran.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dominguez|first1=Virginia|last2=Metzner|first2=Emily|title=An Interview With Iranian Anthropologist Soheila Shahshahani|journal=American Anthropologist}}</ref>\n\n== Levant ==\n=== Lebanon ===\nThe department of sociology at the [[American University of Beirut]] was the first to offer an anthropology course, which is listed in its 1950-51 catalogue. The department of anthropology was officially founded in the 1970s, and saw 33 students graduate with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology throughout that decade. The [[Lebanese Civil War]], which lasted from 1975\u20131990, interfered with the development of the department and anthropology at the university saw a decline as a direct result. During this time, the new department of social and behavioral sciences (SBS) which already encompassed sociology, psychology, and communication, absorbed the anthropology department.<ref name=\"Anthropology in Beirut\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/873907|title=Anthropology in Beirut|last1=King|first1=Diane E|last2=Scheid|first2=Kirsten|website=academia|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, records show just one student having graduated with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology, while there were none in the 1990s. There were three anthropologists on the faculty throughout this time. Among them were [[Fuad Khuri]], Martha Mundy, and Gerald Obermeyer.\n\nA survey conducted in 1989 by Seteney Shami, a 1976 graduate of the BA program in anthropology at the American University in Beirut, sought to learn more about the teachings of anthropology at universities in the Arab world. Her findings suggested that the role of the discipline in the Arab world were minimal. In an academic report that came out in 2006, anthropologists at the same university claim to have found little evidence in the local community of any significant changes since.\n\nToday's anthropology graduates in Lebanon have opportunities to work with local NGOs. However, for those interested in pursuing anthropology as a discipline, the West still stands as the one destination for that. Anthropology departments at the American University in Beirut, and in Lebanon, are stifled by war.<ref name=\"Anthropology in Beirut\"/>\n\nAs a destination for anthropologists to do research, Lebanon is among the top spots for emerging scholars in the Arab world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Palestine ===\nPalestine has seen an increase in research conducted in the territory and among the Palestinian communities in Isarel, as well as refugee camps in neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe history of Palestinian anthropology can be marked by four modes of ethnographic engagement: Biblical Palestine, Oriental Palestine, Absent Palestine, and Post-Structural Palestine.\n\n'''Biblical Palestine''' refers to the main method of ethnographic engagement of Palestine which took place in the first decades of the 20th century. Led predominately by Europeans, their interest was motivated by the use of the Bible as a legitimizing text to influence the region. Early work consisted of European writers fetishizing and romanticizing the land and the people based on the Biblical figures.\n\n'''Oriental Palestine''', a term coined by a Palestinian scholar (find scholar, cite) was the leading mode of engagement throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. It was marked by a sense of urgency to document Palestine as a source of Europe's beginnings. Through this lens, a narrative was offered that challenged the colonial British vision of Palestinian history which saw the Arabs there as \"transient and ephemeral\". It was also marked by a sense of duty among others to capture the traditional fabric of Palestine before its dissolution, which appeared evident at the time due to the events surrounding the rise of Zionism.\n\n'''Absent Palestine''' follows immediately after the demise of Palestine in 1948, and can only be fully understood in terms of the success of Zionism. In this sense, the state of Palestine was eclipsed by the narrative of Israel as a place offering a safe haven to endangered refugees from Europe. This ethnographic silence of Palestinians is seen as the turning point in Israel's image of modernity.\n\n'''Post-Structural Palestine''' is the current main method of ethnographic engagement. It is known primarily for its stance that challenges and brings to question Israel's efforts to repress Palestinian nationalism. The movement has seen a rising trend in which the Palestinian subject is explored for their national identity, rather than silenced.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Ethnographic Arriving of Palestine|journal = Annual Review of Anthropology|volume = 40|pages = 475\u2013491|last1=Furani|first1=Khaled|last2=Rabinowitz|first2=Dan|doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145910|year = 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nAnthropology as a discipline in Turkey can trace its roots back to 1925. Developing in an nationalistic atmosphere, The Anthropology Institute, otherwise known as The Center for Anthropological Research in Turkey, was established on that year within the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Istanbul]]. From 1925 to the 1960s, the main topics of research centered around studies of rural and village life, with a focus on nation building. In the 1960s, a series of military coups occurred, causing considerable changes to the field and to academia itself. It was not until the year 1997 that the first official department of anthropology was established in Turkey, at the private [[Yeditepe University]] in Istanbul. As of 2010, 6 of the 53 state universities in Turkey offered training in anthropology. In contrast to this, only one of the 24 private universities offer similar training. The first anthropological association in Turkey was founded in 1992.<ref>{{cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice On The Margins|last1=Bo\u0161kovi\u0107|first1=Aleksandar|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|pages=110\u2013123}}</ref>\n\n== Persian Gulf ==\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\nMany Anthropologists investigate the tribal system in Saudi Arabia. Anthropology was not popular in many countries; however, the Universities in Saudi Arabia are adopting Anthropology. \n* What is the opposite of the impression of tribes is the ideology of regression. The idea that the tribe gets its meaning from the patriarchal descent. Which is now called Saudi genealogy. One of the famous genealogy is Hamad Aljassar who dead in 2000(Alshamlan). \n* Golf scholars are interested in how migrants and other racial groups are racialized by the legal system. They are also interested in examining the built environment, the history of the transnational connection and the rapid social change (Deep & Winger).\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nAnthropological studies, which are concerned with the privacy of the UAE community with a tribal background are rare and limited.\n* Most of the studies are written with other international anthropologists such as the ethnographic observations of a British Anthropologists Bertram Thomas.\nTribes are the most form of UAE. Many anthropologists are interested in investigating the form of tribes. Many of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] are also based on the tribal system.\n* Moreover, there are many migrants in UAE from two sides: The first side is the center and the south of the Arabian Peninsula. The second side of the eastern coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], contains many foreign migrations from the neighboring countries of Asia. There are also migrants from Iran. The main intention of those migrants is settling in UAE.\n* The UAE community is a multi-tribal community. A multi-cultural community that divides communities into socially and economically linked in different sectors of the workforce(Alsnagry).\n\n=== Qatar and Bahrain ===\nIn Qatar and Bahrain, anthropology was not as popular as other fields, like many other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Anthropology is expanding in educational aspect. Many anthropologists are also concerned on the structure of the tribes in the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region (Gardner).\n\n== North Africa ==\n=== Egypt ===\nWithin the Arab-majority countries, [[Egypt]], has established itself among the other Arab-majority countries as the main hub for anthropologists in the region, with [[Cairo]] being the center for most of this attention. The rest of the country remains relatively understudied. Increased attention to [[Cairo]] can be attributed to the rise of anthropological interest in cities, particularly to the diverse interdisciplinary scholarship.\n\nThe centrality of Middle East area studies is largely responsible for the increase in anthropological attention towards Egypt. In addition to this is the accessibility of institutional support for US scholars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of the early 21st century, the relationship of Egypt with anthropology remains under question. Egyptian anthropologist, [[Hania Sholkamy]], remarks that there are four main points that shape this ongoing relationship: the relationship of methods to theory, the relationship between methods and their analysis, the relationship of culture to its determinants, and the relationship between having data and being able to evaluate it.\n\nThe discipline of anthropology is in a constant state of judgment within Egypt, particularly when compared with the discipline of demography. The qualitative data more common in demography is given more attention than the theoretical and analytical methods associated with anthropology.\n\n=== Morocco ===\nIn Morocco, topics of anthropological research include the ethnicization of Jews, the construction of ethnicity among Berber, Arab, and Haratine groups through agricultural practices, and how Berber ethnicities are politicized in ways that create raced and gendered notions of homeland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Africa ==\nThe region of Africa has had a long history of being colonized by others in economic and cultural ways, which is why the study of anthropology in Africa is a relatively new discipline that is usually grouped with historical work.

South African anthropologists, such as [[Jean Comaroff]] and [[John Comaroff]] and Namibian-born Rob Gordon, who began their studies in their home region of South Africa, and more specifically at the Afrikaans-medium University of Stellenbosch, also had influence with the U.S. in their research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=2014-04-03|title=Inside African anthropology: Monica Wilson and her interpreters|journal=Anthropology Southern Africa|volume=37|issue=1\u20132|pages=135\u2013138|doi=10.1080/23323256.2014.940183|issn=2332-3256}}</ref>\n\n==== Self-Exile and Volkekunde Conference ====\n[[File:The_University_of_South_Africa.jpg|thumb|290x290px|The University of South Africa]]\nIn the 1960s, South African anthropologists made the decision to start leaving their country for careers and research studies because of the apartheid methods, the inequality within their societies, and there was an increase in the violence that was surrounding the region. In 1967, a committee was formed in order to begin negotiating anthropological conferences that were held at the [[University of South Africa]], which added to the separation and tension of the social anthropologists and those who studied volkekunde.<ref name=\":03\" /> Ten years later, black anthropologists started to attend these conferences, and this made the volkekunde group to initiate another new conference that was only to host research projects to those studying ethnology; this new conference was known in the [[Afrikaans]] language as ''Vereniging van Afrikaanse Volkekundiges'', which is translated to mean [[Association of Afrikaans Ethnologists]].<ref name=\":03\" /> This conference excluded entry to those who did not speak the original Afrikaans language of South Africa, or the regional state area, and it continued to have majority and favor until the 1980s when the social anthropologists decided to have their own conference as well.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==== Social Anthropology Conference ====\n[[The Association for Anthropology in Southern Africa]] (AASA) was established in 1987 excluded membership into the group for those who believed in the apartheid concepts. Before anyone could become members of the conference, they were to sign a document, or a contract, saying that they reject any and all apartheid theories and concepts.<ref name=\":03\" /> Regardless of this new conference, the methods of volkekunde remained to be prominent in the discipline of anthropology, though during the 1980s, the anthropology department of then known [[Rand Afrikaans University]], which was one of the newer White Afrikaans-medium universities in the area, officially denounced volkekunde as their way of research, in fact, the entire teaching department of this discipline turned their backs to apartheid concepts entirely.<ref name=\":03\" /> Later on, [[Stellenbosch University]], which was where the first volkekunde department to be established, was closed down in the mid-1990s. A few years afterward, the discipline of social anthropology was introduced within the Department of Sociology.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe new association of [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology South Africa] was a cause to link the two distinguished branches of volkekunde and social anthropology.

This is due to postgraduates, who are members only having a membership for a year or two in order to obtain their dissertations.<ref name=\":03\" /> There is also a close link between membership and conference attendance, meaning that since the conferences are held in venues that are less accessible or less desirable, this doesn't attract many anthropologists to participate and fewer people sign up for memberships.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==== Topics of Research and Publication ====\nSome of the topics of research for sociocultural anthropologists in South Africa consist of [[medical anthropology]], mostly concerning the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] in the region, [[development anthropology]], [[urbanism]], science and natural resources, conflict, violence and policing, [[human rights]], [[identity politics]] and belonging, and [[Popular culture studies|popular culture]].<ref name=\":03\" /> There isn't much attention paid to subjects, such as [[economic anthropology]], [[state formation]], and [[religion]] and [[religious movements]].<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nAnthropologists at South African universities mostly publish to edited volumes and special theme collections in interdisciplinary and disciplinary journals in their own country, as well as internationally.<ref name=\":03\" /> One significant publication venue for South African anthropologists is the journal formerly known as the volkekunde's Tydskrif van Suid Afrikaanse Volkekunde, which translates to [[Journal of South African Ethnology]].<ref name=\":03\" /> The journal changed its name to [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology Southern Africa] in 2002.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n== Postcolonial African Anthropology ==\n=== The Future of the Discipline ===\nAnthropologists, who studied in Africa and began their research from basic curiosities, cannot be of aid to how the discipline stays in existence.<ref name=\":19\" /> Anthropology thrived from outside and inside perspectives of the same region or aspect of culture; having a [[Civilizing mission|missions civilisatrice]] perspective divided observer and participant, instead of taking into consideration the culture within the region from the perspectives of those who have lived there.<ref name=\":19\" /> The aspect of not being able, or not wanting to, collaborate with natives from the country was due to the [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski|Malinowskian]] model.<ref name=\":19\" /> Researchers developed their own personal objectives and reasoning to what and who they were observing in the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Faris|first=Wendy B.|last2=Clifford|first2=James|title=The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art|jstor=1770355|journal=Comparative Literature|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|pages=221\u2013222|doi=10.2307/1770355|year=1992}}</ref> This caused an explicit division of Africa into several regions based on finding and observing the exotic \u201cOther\u201d from various basis of culture, race, and location.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond \"Culture\"|last=Gupta|first=Akhil|last2=Ferguson|first2=James|pages=33\u201351|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822382089-001|year=1997|isbn=9780822382089}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Imagining insiders: Africa and the question of belonging|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=37|issue=10|pages=37\u20135492\u201337\u20135492|doi=10.5860/choice.37-5492|year=2000}}</ref> The concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] helped anthropologists to realize that their personal needs and reasoning for research correlated with the aspect of seeing people differently instead of similarly.<ref name=\":19\" /> There was no insight from those who had inhabited the continent for centuries, and the country is not well represented.<ref name=\":19\" /> There was not a lot of support for methods that contradicted what had already been practiced and known within the discipline.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nUniversally, there were various debates about the methodology of the discipline in relation to folklore, co-production with aid of natives, and boundaries within the field.<ref name=\":19\" /> These aspects had not been taken into consideration when observing the region.

Shaun has also produced [[drum and bass]] under the aliases '''Sounds Destructive''' (with Zachary Kemp, currently known as Trolley Snatcha), '''Slum Dogz''' (with DJ Swan-E and Krafty MC) and '''DJ Picto''' (or simply '''Picto'''). Some of his songs, including \"Sweet Shop\", \"Tetris\", \"Big Boss\", \"Watch Out\" and the remixes of Example's \"[[Last Ones Standing]]\" and Plan B's \"[[Love Goes Down]]\" have all received more than 5 million views on [[YouTube]].<ref name=K>{{cite journal |url=http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/features/doctor-p-interview.html |title=Features: Doctor P Interview |author=DJ Pdex |journal=Kmag |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yr6V2qsx?url=http://www.kmag.co.uk/editorial/features/doctor-p-interview.html |archivedate=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> He is the co-founder of [[Circus Records]], along with [[Flux Pavilion]], DJ Swan-E and [[Earl Falconer]].<ref name=K/>\n\nHis collaboration with [[Adam F]] and [[Method Man]], \"The Pit\", was used in a trailer for the 2014 American comedy film ''[[Let's Be Cops]]''.\n\nIn a February 2013 interview, Brockhurst said he was working on a second track with [[Eva Simons]]<ref>[http://www.electrojams.com/2013/02/05/electrojams-interviews-doctor-p-at-wonderland-ballroom/ \"Interview with ElectroJams\"]</ref> (the first being \"Bulletproof\").\n\n==Origin of name==\nSince the letter \"P\" does not appear in Brockhurst's name, it can be puzzling as to where his alias comes from. In an interview, Doctor P stated that the \"P\" in his name stands for Picto, which was a nickname of his. It came from a predictive text suggestion that popped up when his name was typed (furthermore, one of his friends, following that, called him \"Doctor Picto\").<ref>ElectroJams, August 2012.

He was incarcerated on an accusation of \"incitement to trouble the public order\"]]\n\nA '''political prisoner''' is someone [[imprisoned]] because they have opposed or criticized the government responsible for their imprisonment.\n\nThe term is used by persons or groups challenging the legitimacy of the [[internment|detention]] of a prisoner. Supporters of the term define a political prisoner as someone who is imprisoned for his or her participation in [[politics|political activity]]. If a [[political offense]] was not the official reason for the prisoner's detention, the term would imply that the detention was motivated by the prisoner's politics.\n\n==Various definitions==\nSome understand the term political prisoner narrowly, equating it with the term [[prisoner of conscience]] (POC).\n\n===Amnesty International===\n[[Amnesty International]] campaigns for the release of prisoners of conscience, which include both political prisoners as well as those imprisoned for their religious or philosophical beliefs.  To reduce controversy, and as a matter of principle, the organization's policy applies only to prisoners who have not committed or advocated violence. Thus, there are political prisoners who do not fit the narrower criteria for POCs. The organisation defines the differences as follows:<ref>[http://www.amnesty-volunteer.org/aihandbook/ch3.html#Politicalprisoners \"AI's FOCUS\"]. Amnesty International. Retrieved April 5, 2012.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nAI uses the term \"political prisoner\" broadly. It does not use it, as some others do, to imply that all such prisoners have a special status or should be released. It uses the term only to define a category of prisoners for whom AI demands a fair and prompt trial.\n\nIn AI's usage, the term includes any prisoner whose case has a significant political element: whether the motivation of the prisoner's acts, the acts in themselves, or the motivation of the authorities.\n\n\"Political\" is used by AI to refer to aspects of human relations related to \"politics\": the mechanisms of society and civil order, the principles, organization, or conduct of government or public affairs, and the relation of all these to questions of language, ethnic origin, sex or religion, status or influence (among other factors).\n\nThe category of political prisoners embraces the category of [[prisoners of conscience]], the only prisoners who AI demands should be immediately and unconditionally released, as well as people who resort to criminal violence for a political motive.\n\nIn AI's use of the term, here are some examples of political prisoners:\n* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime carried out for political motives, such as murder or robbery carried out to support the objectives of an opposition group;\n* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime committed in a political context, such as at a demonstration by a trade union or a peasants' organization;\n* a member or suspected member of an armed opposition group who has been charged with treason or \"subversion\".\n\nGovernments often say they have no political prisoners, only prisoners held under the normal criminal law. AI however describes cases like the examples given above as \"political\" and uses the terms \"political trial\" and \"political imprisonment\" when referring to them. But by doing so AI does not oppose the imprisonment, except where it further maintains that the prisoner is a prisoner of conscience, or condemn the trial, except where it concludes that it was unfair.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe===\nThe [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has a much tighter definition:\n<blockquote>\nA person deprived of his or her personal liberty is to be regarded as a 'political prisoner':\n{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha\n|if the detention has been imposed in violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and its Protocols, in particular [[freedom of thought]], conscience and [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of information|information]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[Freedom of association|association]];\n|if the detention has been imposed for purely political reasons without connection to any offence;\n|if, for political motives, the length of the detention or its conditions are clearly out of proportion to the offence the person has been found guilty of or is suspected of;\n|if, for political motives, he or she is detained in a discriminatory manner as compared to other persons; or,\n|if the detention is the result of proceedings which were clearly unfair and this appears to be connected with political motives of the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The definition of political prisoner|url = http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?fileid=19150&lang=EN|accessdate = 2015-11-23|date = 3 October 2012|publisher = Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe}}</ref>\n}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Other definitions===\nIn the parlance of many political movements that utilize [[armed resistance]], [[guerrilla warfare]], and other forms of political violence, a political prisoner includes people who are imprisoned because they are awaiting trial for, or have been convicted of, actions which states they oppose describe as (accurately or otherwise) [[terrorism]]. These movements may consider the actions of political prisoners morally justified against some system of governance, may claim innocence, or have varying understandings of what types of violence are morally and ethically justified. For instance, French [[Anarchism|anarchist]] groups typically call the former members of [[Action Directe (gang)|Action Directe]] held in [[France]] political prisoners. While the French government deemed Action Directe illegal, the group fashioned itself as an [[urban guerilla]] movement, claiming a legitimate [[armed struggle]]. In this sense, \"political prisoner\" can be used to describe any politically active prisoner who is held in custody for a [[Freedom Fighter|violent action which supporters deem ethically justified]].\n\nSome libertarians (such as those who agree with the arguments of Lysander Spooner<ref>[http://www.lysanderspooner.org/works/] Lysander Spooner, \"The Constitution of No Authority,\" Vols 1,2, and 6. 1867\u20131870</ref>) also include all convicted for [[treason]] and some convicted of [[espionage]] in the category of political prisoners. Currently, there is still much controversy and debate around how to define this term and which cases to include or exclude.<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Tatiana Burudjieva |url=http://www.europost.bg/article?id=4878 |title=Who can be defined as political prisoner |publisher=Europost.bg |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>\n\nPolitical prisoners can also be imprisoned with no legal veneer by [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial processes]]. Some political prisoners need not be imprisoned at all. Supporters of [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] in the [[11th Panchen Lama controversy]] have called him a \"political prisoner\", despite the fact that he is not accused of a political offense. He is held under secluded [[house arrest]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4551425.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tibet's missing spiritual guide | date=May 16, 2005 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nPolitical prisoners are also arrested and tried with a veneer of [[legal process|legality]] where false [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[indictment|charges]], [[Falsified evidence|manufactured evidence]], and unfair trials ([[kangaroo court]]s, [[show trial]]s) are used to disguise the fact that an individual is a political prisoner. This is common in situations which may otherwise be decried nationally and internationally as a [[human rights]] violation or suppression of a [[political dissident]].  A political prisoner can also be someone that has been denied [[bail]] unfairly, denied [[parole]] when it would reasonably have been given to a prisoner charged with a comparable crime, or special powers may be invoked by the judiciary. Particularly in this latter situation, whether an individual is regarded as a political prisoner may depend upon subjective political perspective or interpretation of the evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordburmaalliance.org/uploads/9/1/8/4/9184764/the_recognition_of_political_prisoners_essential_to_democratic_and_national_reconciliation_process.pdf| work=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) | title=The recognition of political prisoners: essential to democratic and national reconciliation process|date=November 9, 2011| accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref><!-- This entire section lacks cites.

He was incarcerated on an accusation of \"incitement to trouble the public order\"]]\n\nA '''political prisoner''' is someone [[imprisoned]] because they have opposed or criticized the government responsible for their imprisonment.\n\nThe term is used by persons or groups challenging the legitimacy of the [[internment|detention]] of a prisoner. Supporters of the term define a political prisoner as someone who is imprisoned for his or her participation in [[politics|political activity]]. If a [[political offense]] was not the official reason for the prisoner's detention, the term would imply that the detention was motivated by the prisoner's politics.\n\n==Various definitions==\nSome understand the term political prisoner narrowly, equating it with the term [[prisoner of conscience]] (POC).\n\n===Amnesty International===\n[[Amnesty International]] campaigns for the release of prisoners of conscience, which include both political prisoners as well as those imprisoned for their religious or philosophical beliefs.  To reduce controversy, and as a matter of principle, the organization's policy applies only to prisoners who have not committed or advocated violence. Thus, there are political prisoners who do not fit the narrower criteria for POCs. The organisation defines the differences as follows:<ref>[http://www.amnesty-volunteer.org/aihandbook/ch3.html#Politicalprisoners \"AI's FOCUS\"]. Amnesty International. Retrieved April 5, 2012.</ref>\n<blockquote>\nAI uses the term \"political prisoner\" broadly. It does not use it, as some others do, to imply that all such prisoners have a special status or should be released. It uses the term only to define a category of prisoners for whom AI demands a fair and prompt trial.\n\nIn AI's usage, the term includes any prisoner whose case has a significant political element: whether the motivation of the prisoner's acts, the acts in themselves, or the motivation of the authorities.\n\n\"Political\" is used by AI to refer to aspects of human relations related to \"politics\": the mechanisms of society and civil order, the principles, organization, or conduct of government or public affairs, and the relation of all these to questions of language, ethnic origin, sex or religion, status or influence (among other factors).\n\nThe category of political prisoners embraces the category of [[prisoners of conscience]], the only prisoners who AI demands should be immediately and unconditionally released, as well as people who resort to criminal violence for a political motive.\n\nIn AI's use of the term, here are some examples of political prisoners:\n* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime carried out for political motives, such as murder or robbery carried out to support the objectives of an opposition group;\n* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime committed in a political context, such as at a demonstration by a trade union or a peasants' organization;\n* a member or suspected member of an armed opposition group who has been charged with treason or \"subversion\".\n\nGovernments often say they have no political prisoners, only prisoners held under the normal criminal law. AI however describes cases like the examples given above as \"political\" and uses the terms \"political trial\" and \"political imprisonment\" when referring to them. But by doing so AI does not oppose the imprisonment, except where it further maintains that the prisoner is a prisoner of conscience, or condemn the trial, except where it concludes that it was unfair.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe===\nThe [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has a much tighter definition:\n<blockquote>\nA person deprived of his or her personal liberty is to be regarded as a 'political prisoner':\n{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha\n|if the detention has been imposed in violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and its Protocols, in particular [[freedom of thought]], conscience and [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of information|information]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[Freedom of association|association]];\n|if the detention has been imposed for purely political reasons without connection to any offence;\n|if, for political motives, the length of the detention or its conditions are clearly out of proportion to the offence the person has been found guilty of or is suspected of;\n|if, for political motives, he or she is detained in a discriminatory manner as compared to other persons; or,\n|if the detention is the result of proceedings which were clearly unfair and this appears to be connected with political motives of the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The definition of political prisoner|url = http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?fileid=19150&lang=EN|accessdate = 2015-11-23|date = 3 October 2012|publisher = Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe}}</ref>\n}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Other definitions===\nIn the parlance of many political movements that utilize [[armed resistance]], [[guerrilla warfare]], and other forms of political violence, a political prisoner includes people who are imprisoned because they are awaiting trial for, or have been convicted of, actions which states they oppose describe as (accurately or otherwise) [[terrorism]]. These movements may consider the actions of political prisoners morally justified against some system of governance, may claim innocence, or have varying understandings of what types of violence are morally and ethically justified. For instance, French [[Anarchism|anarchist]] groups typically call the former members of [[Action Directe (gang)|Action Directe]] held in [[France]] political prisoners. While the French government deemed Action Directe illegal, the group fashioned itself as an [[urban guerilla]] movement, claiming a legitimate [[armed struggle]]. In this sense, \"political prisoner\" can be used to describe any politically active prisoner who is held in custody for a [[Freedom Fighter|violent action which supporters deem ethically justified]].\n\nSome libertarians (such as those who agree with the arguments of Lysander Spooner<ref>[http://www.lysanderspooner.org/works/] Lysander Spooner, \"The Constitution of No Authority,\" Vols 1,2, and 6. 1867\u20131870</ref>) also include all convicted for [[treason]] and some convicted of [[espionage]] in the category of political prisoners. Currently, there is still much controversy and debate around how to define this term and which cases to include or exclude.<ref>{{cite web|author=Prof. Tatiana Burudjieva |url=http://www.europost.bg/article?id=4878 |title=Who can be defined as political prisoner |publisher=Europost.bg |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>\n\nPolitical prisoners can also be imprisoned with no legal veneer by [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial processes]]. Some political prisoners need not be imprisoned at all. Supporters of [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] in the [[11th Panchen Lama controversy]] have called him a \"political prisoner\", despite the fact that he is not accused of a political offense. He is held under secluded [[house arrest]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4551425.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tibet's missing spiritual guide | date=May 16, 2005 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nPolitical prisoners are also arrested and tried with a veneer of [[legal process|legality]] where false [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[indictment|charges]], [[Falsified evidence|manufactured evidence]], and unfair trials ([[kangaroo court]]s, [[show trial]]s) are used to disguise the fact that an individual is a political prisoner. This is common in situations which may otherwise be decried nationally and internationally as a [[human rights]] violation or suppression of a [[political dissident]].  A political prisoner can also be someone that has been denied [[bail]] unfairly, denied [[parole]] when it would reasonably have been given to a prisoner charged with a comparable crime, or special powers may be invoked by the judiciary. Particularly in this latter situation, whether an individual is regarded as a political prisoner may depend upon subjective political perspective or interpretation of the evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordburmaalliance.org/uploads/9/1/8/4/9184764/the_recognition_of_political_prisoners_essential_to_democratic_and_national_reconciliation_process.pdf| work=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) | title=The recognition of political prisoners: essential to democratic and national reconciliation process|date=November 9, 2011| accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref><!-- This entire section lacks cites.

She would then go onto work for the [[Young Womens Christian Association]], and then with the [[American Friends Service Committee]]. In 1935, she became assistant to the director of Philadelphia's [[Works Progress Administration]] and also began politically organizing for the [[Democratic National Committee]]. In 1938, Fauset was elected to the Pennsylvania state legislature. She served for a year as a state representative in which she introduced nine bills and three amendments on issues ranging from affordable housing projects to fair employment legislation.\n\nDuring the Roosevelt administration, Fauset was appointed to the [[Office of Civilian Defense]] in October 20, 1941, and worked as a race relations advisor. In 1944, she broke away from the Democratic Party and publicly supported the Republican presidential candidate. In her later years, Fauset turned to global issues and helped found the United Nations Council of Philadelphia, later known as the World Affairs Council.\n\n==Personal life==\nCrystal Bird Fauset was born in [[Princess Anne, Maryland]] to parents Benjamin Oliver Bird and Portia E. Bird (n\u00e9e Lovett). She was one of nine children. Her father was the first principal of Princess Anne Academy, a school for black students. The Academy was the predecessor to the [[University of Maryland Eastern Shore]]. Portia Bird would become the principal after her husband\u2019s death in 1897, and would remain in the position till her death in 1900. Crystal Dreda Bird was then raised by her maternal aunt, Lucy Groves in Boston, who encouraged her to become an educator. Bird attended integrated public schools and, in 1914, graduated from [[Boston State College|Boston Normal School]]. She received a B.S. degree in education from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1931, the same year she married educator, civil rights activist, and anthropologist [[Arthur Fauset]] who was the half-brother of [[Jessie Redmon Fauset]], a Harlem Renaissance writer.

The AFSC had become interested in improving race relations in the United States and had formed their Interracial Section in 1925, two years before offering Bird a staffing position. One of the missions of the organization was to foster intercultural exchange as a way to better racial understanding, and the AFSC sponsored Bird as a touring speaker to promote this message. As an active member of the AFSC, she made about 200 public appearances between 1927 and 1928, addressing between 25,000 to 50,000 people at schools, churches, and civic groups. With her speeches, she aimed to have \"people of other racial groups understand the humanness of the Negro wherever he is found\" and to \"lift the curtain that separates the white people and the colored people, to lift the curtain of misunderstanding that is so dividing us.\" She analyzed racial prejudice and emphasized the contributions of black communities throughout history. The majority of Bird's appearances occurred with white audiences in places such as [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and [[Indiana]]. Her appearances in [[Philadelphia]] introduced her to the public and left them with a high level of impact.<ref>Austin, Allan W. \u201c\u2018Lets Do Away with Walls!\": The American Friends Service Committee's Interracial Section and the 1920s United States.\u201d ''Quaker History'', vol. 98, no. 1, 2009, pp. 1\u201334.

She then helped establish the Institute of Race Relations at [[Swarthmore College]] in 1933, for which she was the joint executive secretary of the summer seminars for two years. The Institute documented employment and housing inequalities against African Americans. Fauset was especially interested in slum clearance and affordable housing projects for the black communities of Philadelphia. She cited the poor infrastructure and a need for urban reform.<ref name=\":2\" /> She and other black [[Woman's club movement|clubwomen]] also pushed for more racial integration within the activities of the Philadelphia branch of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. Fauset spoke on her belief that disarmament and peace would be economically beneficial to African Americans and the nation, especially during that time of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Plastas|first=Melinda|title=A Band of Noble Women: Racial Politics in the Women\u2019s Peace Movement|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=145-192}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Fauset became assistant to the director of Philadelphia's [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), a [[New Deal]] agency centered on public works projects such as constructing roads and financing artistic and literary endeavors. During her time with Philadelphia's WPA, Fauset ended a racial quota system for sewing jobs which helped increase African American women's access to employment. She also began politically organizing for the Philadelphia Democratic Women's League and the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC), becoming the Director of Colored Women's Activities of the DNC in 1936.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=McGuire|first=John Thomas|date=2012-11-12|title=Working within the Labyrinth of Race|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0096144212465264|journal=Journal of Urban History|volume=39|issue=2|pages=172\u2013192|doi=10.1177/0096144212465264|issn=0096-1442}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1936 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Fauset organized black female WPA workers to form the Willing Works Democratic Organization (WWDO).

They developed a friendship and collaborated politically.<ref name=\":1\" /> Eleanor Roosevelt's willingness to meet with African American leaders, the New Deal programs under the Roosevelt administration (1933-1945), and increased governmental aid to black communities had led to a realignment of many black voters from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party by the time of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reelection in 1936.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n===State legislature===\n\nSupported by the Democrats, Fauset ran for state legislature in 1938. She became the first female African American state legislator in the United States after being elected to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] to represent the 18th District of Philadelphia, which was a primarily white neighborhood at the time. She had won by 7,000 votes and had gained strong support from women through her telephone campaign. She was one of the first American politicians to utilize telephoning in her campaign. Fauset promised her constituents: \"I shall work for legislation that affects the general welfare of the people regardless of color.<ref name=\":2\" /> Of her victory, she commented: \"My interest is in no way limited to my race, but is universal.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring her time as a state legislator, she represented an area that was 66% White. Fauset introduced nine bills and three amendments in which she advocated for affordable housing, public health efforts, public relief, and fair employment legislation to ban racial discrimination. Additionally, she sponsored an amendment to the Pennsylvania Female Labor Law of 1913 to improve women's workplace rights.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 1939, Fauset was awarded her first Meritorious Service Medal from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for her civic work. Additionally, she was invited to be the central speaker at the annual meeting of the [[National Council of Negro Women]], a non-profit organization founded by civil rights activist [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] to encourage and coordinate black women's political participation.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nIn January 1940, she resigned from the state legislature in order to begin a new position as assistant director of the education and recreation program of the WPA, as well as the organization's race relations advisor in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Office of Civilian Defense ===\nIn 1941, Fauset was appointed to the newly formed Race Relations Division of the [[Office of Civilian Defense]] (OCD), one of the [[World War II]] agencies of the Roosevelt administration. The OCD was headed by Mayor of [[New York City]], [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], from 1941 to 1942, and then by [[James M. Landis]]. The agency was tasked with coordinating and monitoring the volunteer defense activities of American men, women, and children on the home front. By the summer of 1942, there were about 10 million volunteers and OCD events included air-raid drills, salvage drives, and planting [[Victory garden|Victory Gardens]]. Fauset was hired to specifically look at African American efforts after the OCD had been criticized for its lack of racial inclusiveness.<ref name=\":5\">Allen, Holly.

She urged communities across the nation to allow black members to participate in local civil defense planning. She addressed complaints of racial discrimination among black servicemen such as their exclusion from [[United Service Organizations]] canteens and combat missions, and she spoke out against segregation in the U.S. military. She was also tasked with appointing race relations advisers to the nine civilian defense regions in the U.S., but was only able to appoint advisers to five regions, not including the Deep South.

Fauset became a member of the Republican National Committee's division on Negro Affairs in 1944 and publicly endorsed Thomas E. Dewey, the Republican presidential candidate. Her announcement received mixed reactions among African American newspapers.

Beginning in 1955, Fauset lobbied for the opening of an Africa House in New York, a proposed forum for black and white Americans to learn about the continent by interacting with Africans.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Later Life ==\nIn 1955, Fauset was awarded a second Meritorious Service Medal from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

They would eventually separate and finalize divorce in 1944.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Eric Ledell|date=Winter 1997|title=Crystal Bird Fauset Raises Her Vote for Human Rights.|url=|journal=Pennsylvania Heritage|volume=13, no. 1|pages=34-49|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Professional life==\nAfter graduating from Boston Normal School, Fauset was a public school teacher from 1914 to 1918 before taking the position as a field secretary for the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) where she worked on programs aimed at black youth and working girls throughout the United States. In this position, she also began to speak out about the concerns of black community and race relations in general. She later became actively involved in several different organizations geared towards the advancement for African Americans rights.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2588807879&v=2.1&u=umuser&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=263f88fb73e0c29bba3da146db03ff09|title=Fauset, Crystal Bird (1893\u20131965) - Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===American Friends Service Committee===\nWhile attending Columbia University, Bird joined the [[American Friends Service Committee]] (AFSC), a Quaker organization, in September 1927. The AFSC had become interested in improving race relations in the United States and had formed their Interracial Section in 1925, two years before offering Bird a staffing position. One of the missions of the organization was to foster intercultural exchange as a way to better racial understanding, and the AFSC sponsored Bird as a touring speaker to promote this message. As an active member of the AFSC, she made about 200 public appearances between 1927 and 1928, addressing between 25,000 to 50,000 people at schools, churches, and civic groups. With her speeches, she aimed to have \"people of other racial groups understand the humanness of the Negro wherever he is found\" and to \"lift the curtain that separates the white people and the colored people, to lift the curtain of misunderstanding that is so dividing us.\" She analyzed racial prejudice and emphasized the contributions of black communities throughout history. The majority of Bird's appearances occurred with white audiences in places such as [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and [[Indiana]]. Her appearances in [[Philadelphia]] introduced her to the public and left them with a high level of impact.<ref>Austin, Allan W. \u201c\u2018Lets Do Away with Walls!\": The American Friends Service Committee's Interracial Section and the 1920s United States.\u201d ''Quaker History'', vol. 98, no. 1, 2009, pp. 1\u201334.

She then helped establish the Institute of Race Relations at [[Swarthmore College]] in 1933, for which she was the joint executive secretary of the summer seminars for two years. The Institute documented employment and housing inequalities against African Americans. Fauset was especially interested in slum clearance and affordable housing projects for the black communities of Philadelphia. She cited the poor infrastructure and a need for urban reform.<ref name=\":2\" /> She and other black [[Woman's club movement|clubwomen]] also pushed for more racial integration within the activities of the Philadelphia branch of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. Fauset spoke on her belief that disarmament and peace would be economically beneficial to African Americans and the nation, especially during that time of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Plastas|first=Melinda|title=A Band of Noble Women: Racial Politics in the Women\u2019s Peace Movement|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=145-192}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Fauset became assistant to the director of Philadelphia's [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), a [[New Deal]] agency centered on public works projects such as constructing roads and financing artistic and literary endeavors. During her time with Philadelphia's WPA, Fauset ended a racial quota system for sewing jobs which helped increase African American women's access to employment. She also began politically organizing for the Philadelphia Democratic Women's League and the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC), becoming the Director of Colored Women's Activities of the DNC in 1936.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal|last=McGuire|first=John Thomas|date=2012-11-12|title=Working within the Labyrinth of Race|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0096144212465264|journal=Journal of Urban History|volume=39|issue=2|pages=172\u2013192|doi=10.1177/0096144212465264|issn=0096-1442}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1936 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Fauset organized black female WPA workers to form the Willing Works Democratic Organization (WWDO). Comprised of a thousand members, the WWDO helped increase voter participation and registration under the Democratic Party in Philadelphia, especially among black communities.<ref name=\":2\" /> Through her time at the Institute of Race Relations and then with the Democratic Party, Fauset became acquainted with First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. They developed a friendship and collaborated politically.<ref name=\":1\" /> Eleanor Roosevelt's willingness to meet with African American leaders, the New Deal programs under the Roosevelt administration (1933-1945), and increased governmental aid to black communities had led to a realignment of many black voters from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party by the time of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reelection in 1936.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n===State legislature===\n\nSupported by the Democrats, Fauset ran for state legislature in 1938. She became the first female African American state legislator in the United States after being elected to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] to represent the 18th District of Philadelphia, which was a primarily white neighborhood at the time. She had won by 7,000 votes and had gained strong support from women through her telephone campaign. She was one of the first American politicians to utilize telephoning in her campaign. Fauset promised her constituents: \"I shall work for legislation that affects the general welfare of the people regardless of color.<ref name=\":2\" /> Of her victory, she commented: \"My interest is in no way limited to my race, but is universal.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring her time as a state legislator, she represented an area that was 66% White. Fauset introduced nine bills and three amendments in which she advocated for affordable housing, public health efforts, public relief, and fair employment legislation to ban racial discrimination. Additionally, she sponsored an amendment to the Pennsylvania Female Labor Law of 1913 to improve women's workplace rights.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 1939, Fauset was awarded her first Meritorious Service Medal from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for her civic work. Additionally, she was invited to be the central speaker at the annual meeting of the [[National Council of Negro Women]], a non-profit organization founded by civil rights activist [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] to encourage and coordinate black women's political participation.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nIn January 1940, she resigned from the state legislature in order to begin a new position as assistant director of the education and recreation program of the WPA, as well as the organization's race relations advisor in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Office of Civilian Defense ===\nIn 1941, Fauset was appointed to the newly formed Race Relations Division of the [[Office of Civilian Defense]] (OCD), one of the [[World War II]] agencies of the Roosevelt administration. The OCD was headed by Mayor of [[New York City]], [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], from 1941 to 1942, and then by [[James M. Landis]]. The agency was tasked with coordinating and monitoring the volunteer defense activities of American men, women, and children on the home front. By the summer of 1942, there were about 10 million volunteers and OCD events included air-raid drills, salvage drives, and planting [[Victory garden|Victory Gardens]]. Fauset was hired to specifically look at African American efforts after the OCD had been criticized for its lack of racial inclusiveness.<ref name=\":5\">Allen, Holly.

She urged communities across the nation to allow black members to participate in local civil defense planning. She addressed complaints of racial discrimination among black servicemen such as their exclusion from [[United Service Organizations]] canteens and combat missions, and she spoke out against segregation in the U.S. military. She was also tasked with appointing race relations advisers to the nine civilian defense regions in the U.S., but was only able to appoint advisers to five regions, not including the Deep South. Additionally, Fauset advised both the First Lady and Fiorello LaGuardia on race relations.<ref name=\":32\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nBy some historical accounts, Fauset is considered a member of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]'s \"[[Black Cabinet]]\" that promoted civil rights for African Americans.<ref>\"Chapter 2: Setbacks and Advances - African-Americans Discover the Power of the Vote.\" ''One Man, One Vote: The History of the African-American Vote In the United States''.

Web.</ref> Despite her ten-year involvement with the Democratic Party, Fauset broke away after questioning the Party's inaction on supporting African American voters and civil rights, and becoming discontented with the Roosevelt administration's slow record on civil rights and the President's discouragement of meetings about racial matters during the 1944 presidential campaign. Fauset became a member of the Republican National Committee's division on Negro Affairs in 1944 and publicly endorsed Thomas E. Dewey, the Republican presidential candidate. Her announcement received mixed reactions among African American newspapers. Dewey would eventually be defeated by Roosevelt in the elections.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nFauset was a member of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]'s \"Black Cabinet\" that promoted civil rights for African Americans.
