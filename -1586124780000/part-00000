One, ''PLOS Clinical Trials'', has since been merged into ''[[PLOS ONE]]''. Following the merger, the company started the PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials to collect journal articles published in any PLOS journal and relating to clinical trials.\n\nThe PLOS journals are what is described as \"open-access content\"; all content is published under the [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|\"attribution\" license]]. The project states (quoting the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]]) that: \"The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.\"\n\nIn 2011, the Public Library of Science became an official financial supporting organization of [[Healthcare Information For All by 2015]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hifa2015.org/how-organisations-support-hifa2015/ |title=How organisations support HIFA2015 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> a global initiative that advocates unrestricted access to medical knowledge, sponsoring the first HIFA2015 Webinar in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hifa2015.org/hifa2015-webinars/ |title=HIFA2015 Webinars |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 the organization quit using the stylization \"PLoS\" to identify itself and began using only \"PLOS\".<ref name=Knutson2012)>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2012/07/new-plos-look/ |title=New PLOS look |author=David Knutson |date=23 July 2012 |work=PLOS BLOG |publisher=Public Library of Science |accessdate=6 August 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69j2pzKwV |archivedate=6 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, PLOS confirmed that their [[chief executive officer]] [[Elizabeth Marincola]] would be leaving for personal and professional reasons at the end of that year.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://twitter.com/PLOS/status/793126454615834625 |title=PLOS on Twitter |newspaper=Twitter |access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref> In May 2017, PLOS announced that their new CEO will be Alison Mudditt with effect from June.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stm-publishing.com/plos-appoints-alison-mudditt-chief-executive-officer/ |title=PLOS Appoints Alison Mudditt Chief Executive Officer {{!}} STM Publishing News |website=www.stm-publishing.com |language=en-US |access-date=2017-05-19}}</ref>\n\n== Financial model ==\nTo fund the journals, PLOS charges an [[article processing charge]] to be paid by the author or the author's employer or funder. In the United States, institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] have pledged that recipients of their grants will be allocated funds to cover such author charges. The Global Participation Initiative (GPI) was instituted in 2012, by which authors in \"group-one countries\" are not charged a fee, and those in group-two countries are given a fee reduction. (In all cases, decisions to publish are based solely on editorial criteria.)\nPLOS was launched with grants totaling US$13 million from the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]] and the [[Sandler Family Supporting Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = Declan Butler\n | title = Open-access journal hits rocky times\n | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n | volume = 441\n | page = 914\n | date = June 2006\n | doi = 10.1038/441914a\n | pmid = 16791161\n | issue = 7096\n | bibcode = 2006Natur.441..914B\n | author-link = Declan Butler\n }}</ref> PLOS confirmed in July 2011 that it no longer relies on subsidies from foundations and is covering its operational costs itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2011/07/2010-plos-progress-update/ |title=2010 PLOS Progress Update &#124; The Official PLOS Blog |publisher=Blogs.plos.org |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nii.ac.jp/sparc/en/publications/newsletter/14/fa1.html |title=How far has open access progressed? |first=Shigeki |last=Sugita |publisher=SPARC Japan |year=2014 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> Since then PLOS' balance sheet has improved from $20,511,000 net assets in 2012\u20132013 to $36,591,000 in 2014\u20132015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_hyperlinked-091813.pdf |title=2012-2013 Progress Update |publisher=PLOS |date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007113622/http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_hyperlinked-091813.pdf |accessdate=2014-01-01|archive-date=7 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_LO_RES_Update-9.15.15.pdf |title=2014-2015 Progress Update |publisher=PLOS |date=2015-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202614/https://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_LO_RES_Update-9.15.15.pdf |accessdate=2015-10-26|archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*''[[PLOS Biology]]'', {{ISSN|1544-9173}}; October 2003\n*''[[PLOS Medicine]]'', {{ISSN|1549-1676}}; October 2004\n*''[[PLOS Computational Biology]]'', {{ISSN|1553-7374}}; June 2005\n*''[[PLOS Genetics]]'', {{ISSN|1553-7404}}; July 2005\n*''[[PLOS Pathogens]]'', {{ISSN|1549-1676}}; September 2005\n*''[[PLOS Clinical Trials]]'' {{ISSN|1555-5887}}; May 2006, later merged into ''PLOS ONE''\n*''[[PLOS ONE]]'', {{ISSN|1932-6203}}; December 2006\n*''[[PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases]]'', {{ISSN|1935-2735}}; October 2007\n*''[[PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials]]'', third quarter 2007\n*''[[PLOS Currents]]'', {{ISSN|2157-3999}}; August 2009\n\n== Other partners ==\n\nIn April 2017, PLOS was one of the founding partners in the [[Initiative for Open Citations]].<ref name=\"I4OC\">{{cite web|url=https://i4oc.org/press.html|title=Press|date=6 April 2017|publisher=Initiative for Open Citations|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Headquarters ==\nPLOS has its main headquarters in Suite 225 in the Koshland East Building in [[Levi's Plaza]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plos.org/contact/ |title=Contact |publisher=PLoS |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> The company was previously located at 185 Berry Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plos.org/contact.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310204009/http://www.plos.org/contact.html |archivedate=2008-03-10 |title=Contact |work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=PLoS |date=2008-03-10 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> In June 2010, PLOS announced that it was moving to a new location in order to accommodate its rapid growth.

It launched its first journal, ''[[PLOS Biology]]'', in October 2003 and ({{As of|2015|10|lc=on}}) publishes seven journals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plos.org/publications/journals/ |title=Journals |publisher=plos.org |accessdate=2012-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mediashift.org/2015/07/why-academic-journals-are-teaming-up-with-reddit/ |title=Why Academic Journals Are Teaming Up With Reddit |first=Simon |last=Ownes |publisher=Media Shift |date=2015-07-13 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The organization is based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and has a European editorial office in [[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].

One, ''PLOS Clinical Trials'', has since been merged into ''[[PLOS ONE]]''. Following the merger, the company started the PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials to collect journal articles published in any PLOS journal and relating to clinical trials.\n\nThe PLOS journals are what is described as \"open-access content\"; all content is published under the [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|\"attribution\" license]]. The project states (quoting the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]]) that: \"The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.\"\n\nIn 2011, the Public Library of Science became an official financial supporting organization of [[Healthcare Information For All by 2015]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hifa2015.org/how-organisations-support-hifa2015/ |title=How organisations support HIFA2015 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> a global initiative that advocates unrestricted access to medical knowledge, sponsoring the first HIFA2015 Webinar in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hifa2015.org/hifa2015-webinars/ |title=HIFA2015 Webinars |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 the organization quit using the stylization \"PLoS\" to identify itself and began using only \"PLOS\".<ref name=Knutson2012)>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2012/07/new-plos-look/ |title=New PLOS look |author=David Knutson |date=23 July 2012 |work=PLOS BLOG |publisher=Public Library of Science |accessdate=6 August 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69j2pzKwV |archivedate=6 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, PLOS confirmed that their [[chief executive officer]] [[Elizabeth Marincola]] would be leaving for personal and professional reasons at the end of that year.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://twitter.com/PLOS/status/793126454615834625 |title=PLOS on Twitter |newspaper=Twitter |access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref> In May 2017, PLOS announced that their new CEO will be Alison Mudditt with effect from June.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stm-publishing.com/plos-appoints-alison-mudditt-chief-executive-officer/ |title=PLOS Appoints Alison Mudditt Chief Executive Officer {{!}} STM Publishing News |website=www.stm-publishing.com |language=en-US |access-date=2017-05-19}}</ref>\n\n== Financial model ==\nTo fund the journals, PLOS charges an [[article processing charge]] to be paid by the author or the author's employer or funder. In the United States, institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] have pledged that recipients of their grants will be allocated funds to cover such author charges. The Global Participation Initiative (GPI) was instituted in 2012, by which authors in \"group-one countries\" are not charged a fee, and those in group-two countries are given a fee reduction. (In all cases, decisions to publish are based solely on editorial criteria.)\nPLOS was launched with grants totaling US$13 million from the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]] and the [[Sandler Family Supporting Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = Declan Butler\n | title = Open-access journal hits rocky times\n | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n | volume = 441\n | page = 914\n | date = June 2006\n | doi = 10.1038/441914a\n | pmid = 16791161\n | issue = 7096\n | bibcode = 2006Natur.441..914B\n | author-link = Declan Butler\n }}</ref> PLOS confirmed in July 2011 that it no longer relies on subsidies from foundations and is covering its operational costs itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2011/07/2010-plos-progress-update/ |title=2010 PLOS Progress Update &#124; The Official PLOS Blog |publisher=Blogs.plos.org |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nii.ac.jp/sparc/en/publications/newsletter/14/fa1.html |title=How far has open access progressed? |first=Shigeki |last=Sugita |publisher=SPARC Japan |year=2014 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> Since then PLOS' balance sheet has improved from $20,511,000 net assets in 2012\u20132013 to $36,591,000 in 2014\u20132015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_hyperlinked-091813.pdf |title=2012-2013 Progress Update |publisher=PLOS |date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007113622/http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_hyperlinked-091813.pdf |accessdate=2014-01-01|archive-date=7 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_LO_RES_Update-9.15.15.pdf |title=2014-2015 Progress Update |publisher=PLOS |date=2015-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202614/https://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Progress-Update_FINAL_LO_RES_Update-9.15.15.pdf |accessdate=2015-10-26|archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*''[[PLOS Biology]]'', {{ISSN|1544-9173}}; October 2003\n*''[[PLOS Medicine]]'', {{ISSN|1549-1676}}; October 2004\n*''[[PLOS Computational Biology]]'', {{ISSN|1553-7374}}; June 2005\n*''[[PLOS Genetics]]'', {{ISSN|1553-7404}}; July 2005\n*''[[PLOS Pathogens]]'', {{ISSN|1549-1676}}; September 2005\n*''[[PLOS Clinical Trials]]'' {{ISSN|1555-5887}}; May 2006, later merged into ''PLOS ONE''\n*''[[PLOS ONE]]'', {{ISSN|1932-6203}}; December 2006\n*''[[PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases]]'', {{ISSN|1935-2735}}; October 2007\n*''[[PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials]]'', third quarter 2007\n*''[[PLOS Currents]]'', {{ISSN|2157-3999}}; August 2009\n\n== Other partners ==\n\nIn April 2017, PLOS was one of the founding partners in the [[Initiative for Open Citations]].<ref name=\"I4OC\">{{cite web|url=https://i4oc.org/press.html|title=Press|date=6 April 2017|publisher=Initiative for Open Citations|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Headquarters ==\nPLOS has its main headquarters in Suite 225 in the Koshland East Building in [[Levi's Plaza]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plos.org/contact/ |title=Contact |publisher=PLoS |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> The company was previously located at 185 Berry Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plos.org/contact.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310204009/http://www.plos.org/contact.html |archivedate=2008-03-10 |title=Contact |work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=PLoS |date=2008-03-10 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> In June 2010, PLOS announced that it was moving to a new location in order to accommodate its rapid growth.

After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=1|Host\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show will feature a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop.

She started the first free [[kindergarten]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1878 (the Silver Street Free Kindergarten). With her sister during the 1880s, she also established a training school for kindergarten teachers. Kate Wiggin devoted her adult life to the welfare of children in an era when children were commonly thought of as cheap labor.\n\nWiggin went to California to study kindergarten methods. She began to teach in San Francisco with her sister [[Nora Archibald Smith|Nora]] assisting her, and the two were instrumental in the establishment of over 60 kindergartens for the poor in San Francisco and [[Oakland]]. She moved from California to New York, and having no kindergarten work on hand, devoted herself to literature. She sent ''The Story of Patsy'' and ''The Bird's Christmas Carol'' to [[Houghton, Mifflin & Co.]] who accepted them at once. Besides the talent for story-telling, she was a musician, sang well, and composed settings for her poems. She was also an excellent elocutionist. Her first literary work was ''Half a Dozen Housekeepers'', a serial story which she sent to ''St. Nicholas''. After the death of her husband in 1889, she returned to California to resume her kindergarten work, serving as the head of a Kindergarten Normal School. Some of her other works included ''Cathedral Courtship'', ''A Summer in a Canon'', ''Timothy's Quest'', ''The Story Hour'', ''Kindergarten Chimes'', ''Polly Oliver's Problem'', and ''Children's Rights''.{{sfn|Rutherford|1894|pp=640-41}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:PostcardSalmonFallsMEHomeOfKateDouglasWiggin1916.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kate Douglas Wiggin House]] in the Salmon Falls section of [[Hollis, Maine]]]]\n\nKate Douglas Smith Wiggin was born in Philadelphia, the daughter of lawyer Robert N. Smith, and of [[Wales|Welsh]] descent.<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Sr-Z/Welsh-Americans.html Welsh Americans] at www.everyculture.com</ref><ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Wiggin, Kate Douglas |year=1905}}</ref> Kate experienced a happy childhood, even though it was colored by the [[American Civil War]] and her father's death. Kate and her sister Nora were still quite young when their widowed mother moved her little family from Philadelphia to [[Portland, Maine]], then, three years later, upon her remarriage, to the little village of [[Hollis, Maine|Hollis]]. There Kate matured in rural surroundings, with her sister and her new baby brother Philip.\n\nNotably, she once met the novelist [[Charles Dickens]]. Her mother and another relative had gone to hear Dickens read in Portland, but Wiggin, aged 11, was thought to be too young to warrant an expensive ticket. The following day, she found herself on the same train as Dickens and engaged him in a lively conversation for the course of the journey, an experience which she later detailed in a short memoir titled ''A Child's Journey with Dickens'' (1912).\n\nHer education was spotty, consisting of a short stint at a [[dame school]], some home schooling under the \"capable, slightly impatient, somewhat sporadic\" instruction of Albion Bradbury (her stepfather), a brief spell at the district school, a year as a boarder at the Gorham Female Seminary, a winter term at Morison Academy in Baltimore, Maryland, and a few months' stay at [[Abbot Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts, where she graduated with the class of 1873.  Although rather casual, this was more education than most women received at the time.\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1873, hoping to ease Albion Bradbury's lung disease, Kate's family moved to Santa Barbara, California, where Kate's stepfather died three years later. A kindergarten training class was opening in Los Angeles under Emma Marwedel (1818\u20131893),<ref name=nie/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Emma Marwedel, 1818\u20131893 : pioneer of the kindergarten in California|publisher=worldcat.org|oclc = 4457643}}</ref> and Kate enrolled. After graduation, in 1878, she headed the first free kindergarten in California, on Silver Street in the slums of San Francisco. The children were \"street Arabs of the wildest type\", but Kate had a loving personality and dramatic flair. By 1880 she was forming a teacher-training school in conjunction with the Silver Street kindergarten.\n\nIn 1881, Kate married (Samuel) Bradley Wiggin, a San Francisco lawyer.<ref name=nie/> According to the customs of the time, she was required to resign her teaching job.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/mss/kdwg.shtml|title=Kate Douglas Wiggin Collection M187|website=library.bowdoin.edu}}</ref> Still devoted to her school, she began to raise money for it through writing, first ''[[The Story of Patsy]]'' (1883), then ''[[The Birds' Christmas Carol]]'' (1887). Both privately printed books were issued commercially by [[Houghton Mifflin]] in 1889, with enormous success.\n\nKate Wiggin had no children. She moved to New York City in 1888.<ref name=nie/> When her husband died suddenly in 1889, Kate relocated to Maine. For the rest of her life she grieved, but she also traveled as frequently as she could, dividing her time between writing, visits to Europe, and giving public reading for the benefit of various children's charities.\n\nWiggin traveled abroad and back from [[Liverpool]] in the [[United Kingdom]] at least three times. Records from the [[Ellis Island]] logs show that she arrived back in [[New York City]] from [[Liverpool]] in October 1892, July 1893, and July 1894.<ref>[https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-result Ellis Island Records], Type in \"Kate D. Wiggin\"</ref> On the logs for the 1892 trip, Wiggin describes her occupation as \"Wife,\"<ref>[https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMjoiMTAzNDU4MDEwNjI4Ijs=/czo4OiJtYW5pZmVzdCI7 1892 Ellis Island logs], passenger logs for this ship</ref> despite her former husband dying three years prior. In 1893 and 1894, she describes herself as an \"Authoress.\"<ref>[https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMjoiMTAyODM0MTQxMzExIjs=/czo4OiJtYW5pZmVzdCI7 1893 Ellis island logs], 1893 passenger logs</ref>\n\nWiggin met dry goods (specifically, linen) importer George Christopher Riggs on her way to England in 1894. The pair are said to have hit it off and had agreed to marry even before the ship docked in England.<ref>[https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wiggin-kate-douglas-1856-1923 \"Wiggin, Kate Douglas (1856-1923)\"], Encyclopedia.com article</ref> In the [[Ellis Island]] logs from Wiggin's 1894 trip back to [[New York City]] from [[Liverpool]], the two sign their names next to each other, indicating their closeness.<ref>[https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMjoiMTAyODUwMTIwMjE4Ijs=/czo4OiJtYW5pZmVzdCI7, 1894 Ellis Island logs], 1894 ship passenger logs</ref> The pair married in [[New York City]] on March 30, 1895 at All Souls Church. George Riggs soon became one of Wiggin's biggest advocates as she became more successful.\n\nAfter the marriage she continued to write under the name of Wiggin. Her literary output included popular books for adults; with her sister, [[Nora Archibald Smith|Nora A. Smith]], she published scholarly work on the educational principles of [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]]: ''Froebel's Gifts'' (1895), ''Froebel's Occupations'' (1896), and ''Kindergarten Principles and Practice'' (1896);<ref name=\"nie\"/> and she wrote the classic children's novel ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1903), as well as the 1905 best-seller ''Rose o' the River.'' ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'' became an immediate bestseller; both it and ''[[Mother Carey's Chickens (novel)|Mother Carey's Chickens]]'' (1911) were adapted to the stage. Houghton Mifflin collected her writings in 10 volumes in 1917.\n\nFor a time, she lived at [[Kate Douglas Wiggin House|Quillcote]], her summer home in Hollis, Maine (now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]). Quillcote is around the corner from the town's library, the Salmon Falls Library, which Wiggin founded in 1911.<ref>''My Garden of Memory'', pp.365\u2013366</ref>  Wiggin founded the [[Dorcas Society]] of Hollis & Buxton, Maine in 1897.  The [[First Congregational Church of Buxton|Tory Hill Meeting House]] in the adjacent town of Buxton, Maine inspired her book (and later play) ''[[The Old Peabody Pew]]'' (1907).\n\n==Later life and death==\nWiggin was an active and popular hostess in New York and in the community of Upper Largo, Scotland, where she had a summer home and where she organized plays for many years, as detailed in her memoir ''My Garden of Memory.''\n\nIn 1921, Wiggin and her sister [[Nora Archibald Smith]] edited an edition of [[Jane Porter]]'s ''[[The Scottish Chiefs]]'', an 1809 novel of [[William Wallace]], for the [[Scribner's Illustrated Classics]] series, illustrated by [[N.C. Wyeth]].<ref>Porter, Jane. ''The Scottish Chiefs'', Scribner's Illustrated Classic series, reissued 1991, {{ISBN|0-684-19340-X}}, dust jacket copy</ref> During the spring of 1923, Kate Wiggin traveled to England as a New York delegate to the [[Dickens Fellowship]]. There she became ill and died, at age 66, of bronchial pneumonia. At her request, her ashes were brought home to Maine and scattered over the Saco River. Her autobiography ''My Garden of Memory'' was published after her death. In sorting through material for her autobiography, she put many items in a box she and her sister labelled \"Posthumous.\" Her sister Nora A. Smith later published her own reminiscences, titled ''Kate Douglas Wiggin as her Sister Knew Her,'' from these materials.\n\nWiggin was also a songwriter and composer of music. For \"Kindergarten Chimes\" (1885), she created some of the lyrics, music, and arrangements. For \"Nine Love Songs and a Carol\" (1896), she created all of the music.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Wiggin's first husband's distant cousin, Eric E. Wiggin, published updated versions of some books in Kate Douglas Wiggin's [[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]] series. He later published his own addition to the series, entitled, ''Rebecca Returns to Sunnybrook''.<ref>[http://www.loyalbooks.com/book/rebecca-of-sunnybrook-farm-by-kate-douglas-wiggin \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\", Loyal Books], Source explaining Eric's contributions</ref> Eric E. Wiggin extended Kate Douglas Wiggin's series after years of writing Christian literature, newspaper articles, and other children's books. When asked about his reasoning for writing the books, he said, \"Even though her books were in public domain, had Kate Douglas Wiggin not died childless I would not have attempted the project. I really have better things to do than quarrel with heirs who may be miffed at my treatment of their ancestor's books!\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Wiggin |first=Eric |subject-link=cousin of Kate Douglas Wiggin's husband |interviewer=Ethan Rotnem |title=Eric Wiggin|location=telephone |date=2019-09-16}}</ref> Eric E. Wiggin's books sold best among his target audience of homeschoolers; with their help, his updated novels and his new addition to the series have sold more than 50,000 copies.\n\nMany of Kate Douglas Wiggin's novels were made into movies. Perhaps the most famous film adaptation of her books is the [[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)]], which stars [[Shirley Temple]].\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:The Romance of a Christmas Card - Cover - Project Gutenberg eText 17456.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Romance of a Christmas Card'' (1916)]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''The Story of Patsy'' (1883)\n* ''[[The Birds' Christmas Carol]]'' (1887)\n* ''Timothy's Quest'' (1890), illustrated by [[Oliver Herford]]\n* ''Polly Oliver's Problem'' (1893)\n* ''A Cathedral Courtship, and Penelope's English Experiences'' (1893)\n* ''The Village Watch-Tower'' (1895)\n* ''Penelope's Progress'' (1898)\n* ''Penelope's Travels in Scotland'' (1898)\n* ''Penelope's Irish Experiences'' (1901)\n* [http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/HistChldBks&CISOPTR=34863&REC=7 ''The Diary of a Goose Girl''] (1902), illus.

She started the first free [[kindergarten]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1878 (the Silver Street Free Kindergarten). With her sister during the 1880s, she also established a training school for kindergarten teachers. Kate Wiggin devoted her adult life to the welfare of children in an era when children were commonly thought of as cheap labor.\n\nWiggin went to California to study kindergarten methods. She began to teach in San Francisco with her sister [[Nora Archibald Smith|Nora]] assisting her, and the two were instrumental in the establishment of over 60 kindergartens for the poor in San Francisco and [[Oakland]]. She moved from California to New York, and having no kindergarten work on hand, devoted herself to literature. She sent ''The Story of Patsy'' and ''The Bird's Christmas Carol'' to [[Houghton, Mifflin & Co.]] who accepted them at once. Besides the talent for story-telling, she was a musician, sang well, and composed settings for her poems. She was also an excellent elocutionist. Her first literary work was ''Half a Dozen Housekeepers'', a serial story which she sent to ''St. Nicholas''. After the death of her husband in 1889, she returned to California to resume her kindergarten work, serving as the head of a Kindergarten Normal School. Some of her other works included ''Cathedral Courtship'', ''A Summer in a Canon'', ''Timothy's Quest'', ''The Story Hour'', ''Kindergarten Chimes'', ''Polly Oliver's Problem'', and ''Children's Rights''.{{sfn|Rutherford|1894|pp=640-41}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:PostcardSalmonFallsMEHomeOfKateDouglasWiggin1916.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kate Douglas Wiggin House]] in the Salmon Falls section of [[Hollis, Maine]]]]\n\nKate Douglas Smith Wiggin was born in Philadelphia, the daughter of lawyer Robert N. Smith, and of [[Wales|Welsh]] descent.<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Sr-Z/Welsh-Americans.html Welsh Americans] at www.everyculture.com</ref><ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Wiggin, Kate Douglas |year=1905}}</ref> Kate experienced a happy childhood, even though it was colored by the [[American Civil War]] and her father's death. Kate and her sister Nora were still quite young when their widowed mother moved her little family from Philadelphia to [[Portland, Maine]], then, three years later, upon her remarriage, to the little village of [[Hollis, Maine|Hollis]]. There Kate matured in rural surroundings, with her sister and her new baby brother Philip.\n\nNotably, she once met the novelist [[Charles Dickens]]. Her mother and another relative had gone to hear Dickens read in Portland, but Wiggin, aged 11, was thought to be too young to warrant an expensive ticket. The following day, she found herself on the same train as Dickens and engaged him in a lively conversation for the course of the journey, an experience which she later detailed in a short memoir titled ''A Child's Journey with Dickens'' (1912).\n\nHer education was spotty, consisting of a short stint at a [[dame school]], some home schooling under the \"capable, slightly impatient, somewhat sporadic\" instruction of Albion Bradbury (her stepfather), a brief spell at the district school, a year as a boarder at the Gorham Female Seminary, a winter term at Morison Academy in Baltimore, Maryland, and a few months' stay at [[Abbot Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts, where she graduated with the class of 1873.  Although rather casual, this was more education than most women received at the time.\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1873, hoping to ease Albion Bradbury's lung disease, Kate's family moved to Santa Barbara, California, where Kate's stepfather died three years later. A kindergarten training class was opening in Los Angeles under Emma Marwedel (1818\u20131893),<ref name=nie/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Emma Marwedel, 1818\u20131893 : pioneer of the kindergarten in California|publisher=worldcat.org|oclc = 4457643}}</ref> and Kate enrolled. After graduation, in 1878, she headed the first free kindergarten in California, on Silver Street in the slums of San Francisco. The children were \"street Arabs of the wildest type\", but Kate had a loving personality and dramatic flair. By 1880 she was forming a teacher-training school in conjunction with the Silver Street kindergarten.\n\nIn 1881, Kate married (Samuel) Bradley Wiggin, a San Francisco lawyer.<ref name=nie/> According to the customs of the time, she was required to resign her teaching job.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/mss/kdwg.shtml|title=Kate Douglas Wiggin Collection M187|website=library.bowdoin.edu}}</ref> Still devoted to her school, she began to raise money for it through writing, first ''[[The Story of Patsy]]'' (1883), then ''[[The Birds' Christmas Carol]]'' (1887). Both privately printed books were issued commercially by [[Houghton Mifflin]] in 1889, with enormous success.\n\nKate Wiggin had no children. She moved to New York City in 1888.<ref name=nie/> When her husband died suddenly in 1889, Kate relocated to Maine. For the rest of her life she grieved, but she also traveled as frequently as she could, dividing her time between writing, visits to Europe, and giving public reading for the benefit of various children's charities.\n\nWiggin traveled abroad and back from [[Liverpool]] in the [[United Kingdom]] at least three times. Records from the [[Ellis Island]] logs show that she arrived back in [[New York City]] from [[Liverpool]] in October 1892, July 1893, and July 1894.<ref> [https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-result Ellis Island Records], Type in \"Kate D. Wiggin\" </ref> On the logs for the 1892 trip, Wiggin describes her occupation as \"Wife,\"<ref> [https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMjoiMTAzNDU4MDEwNjI4Ijs=/czo4OiJtYW5pZmVzdCI7 1892 Ellis Island logs], passenger logs for this ship </ref> despite her former husband dying three years prior. In 1893 and 1894, she describes herself as an \"Authoress.\"<ref> [https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMjoiMTAyODM0MTQxMzExIjs=/czo4OiJtYW5pZmVzdCI7 1893 Ellis island logs], 1893 passenger logs</ref>\n\nWiggin met dry goods (specifically, linen) importer George Christopher Riggs on her way to England in 1894. The pair are said to have hit it off and had agreed to marry even before the ship docked in England.<ref> [https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wiggin-kate-douglas-1856-1923 \"Wiggin, Kate Douglas (1856-1923)\"], Encyclopedia.com article</ref> In the [[Ellis Island]] logs from Wiggin's 1894 trip back to [[New York City]] from [[Liverpool]], the two sign their names next to each other, indicating their closeness.<ref> [https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMjoiMTAyODUwMTIwMjE4Ijs=/czo4OiJtYW5pZmVzdCI7, 1894 Ellis Island logs], 1894 ship passenger logs </ref> The pair married in [[New York City]] on March 30, 1895 at All Souls Church. George Riggs soon became one of Wiggin's biggest advocates as she became more successful. \n\nHer literary output included popular books for adults; with her sister, [[Nora Archibald Smith|Nora A. Smith]], she published scholarly work on the educational principles of [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]]: ''Froebel's Gifts'' (1895), ''Froebel's Occupations'' (1896), and ''Kindergarten Principles and Practice'' (1896);<ref name=\"nie\"/> and she wrote the classic children's novel ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1903), as well as the 1905 best-seller ''Rose o' the River.'' ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'' became an immediate bestseller; both it and ''[[Mother Carey's Chickens (novel)|Mother Carey's Chickens]]'' (1911) were adapted to the stage. Houghton Mifflin collected her writings in 10 volumes in 1917.\n\nFor a time, she lived at [[Kate Douglas Wiggin House|Quillcote]], her summer home in Hollis, Maine (now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]). Quillcote is around the corner from the town's library, the Salmon Falls Library, which Wiggin founded in 1911.<ref>''My Garden of Memory'', pp.365\u2013366</ref>  Wiggin founded the [[Dorcas Society]] of Hollis & Buxton, Maine in 1897.  The [[First Congregational Church of Buxton|Tory Hill Meeting House]] in the adjacent town of Buxton, Maine inspired her book (and later play) ''[[The Old Peabody Pew]]'' (1907).\n\n==Later life and death==\nWiggin was an active and popular hostess in New York and in the community of Upper Largo, Scotland, where she had a summer home and where she organized plays for many years, as detailed in her memoir ''My Garden of Memory.''\n\nIn 1921, Wiggin and her sister [[Nora Archibald Smith]] edited an edition of [[Jane Porter]]'s ''[[The Scottish Chiefs]]'', an 1809 novel of [[William Wallace]], for the [[Scribner's Illustrated Classics]] series, illustrated by [[N.C. Wyeth]].<ref>Porter, Jane. ''The Scottish Chiefs'', Scribner's Illustrated Classic series, reissued 1991, {{ISBN|0-684-19340-X}}, dust jacket copy</ref> During the spring of 1923, Kate Wiggin traveled to England as a New York delegate to the [[Dickens Fellowship]]. There she became ill and died, at age 66, of bronchial pneumonia. At her request, her ashes were brought home to Maine and scattered over the Saco River. Her autobiography ''My Garden of Memory'' was published after her death. In sorting through material for her autobiography, she put many items in a box she and her sister labelled \"Posthumous.\" Her sister Nora A. Smith later published her own reminiscences, titled ''Kate Douglas Wiggin as her Sister Knew Her,'' from these materials.\n\nWiggin was also a songwriter and composer of music. For \"Kindergarten Chimes\" (1885), she created some of the lyrics, music, and arrangements. For \"Nine Love Songs and a Carol\" (1896), she created all of the music.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Wiggin's first husband's distant cousin, Eric E. Wiggin, published updated versions of some books in Kate Douglas Wiggin's [[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]] series. He later published his own addition to the series, entitled, ''Rebecca Returns to Sunnybrook''.<ref> [http://www.loyalbooks.com/book/rebecca-of-sunnybrook-farm-by-kate-douglas-wiggin \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\", Loyal Books], Source explaining Eric's contributions </ref> Eric E. Wiggin extended Kate Douglas Wiggin's series after years of writing Christian literature, newspaper articles, and other children's books. When asked about his reasoning for writing the books, he said, \"Even though her books were in public domain, had Kate Douglas Wiggin not died childless I would not have attempted the project. I really have better things to do than quarrel with heirs who may be miffed at my treatment of their ancestor's books!\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Wiggin |first=Eric |subject-link=cousin of Kate Douglas Wiggin's husband |interviewer=Ethan Rotnem |title=Eric Wiggin|location=telephone |date=2019-09-16}}</ref>Eric E. Wiggin's books sold best among his target audience of homeschoolers; with their help, his updated novels and his new addition to the series have sold more than 50,000 copies.\n\nMany of Kate Douglas Wiggin's novels were made into movies. Perhaps the most famous film adaptation of her books is the [[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)]], which stars [[Shirley Temple]].\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:The Romance of a Christmas Card - Cover - Project Gutenberg eText 17456.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Romance of a Christmas Card'' (1916)]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''The Story of Patsy'' (1883)\n* ''[[The Birds' Christmas Carol]]'' (1887)\n* ''Timothy's Quest'' (1890), illustrated by [[Oliver Herford]]\n* ''Polly Oliver's Problem'' (1893)\n* ''A Cathedral Courtship, and Penelope's English Experiences'' (1893)\n* ''The Village Watch-Tower'' (1895)\n* ''Penelope's Progress'' (1898)\n* ''Penelope's Travels in Scotland'' (1898)\n* ''Penelope's Irish Experiences'' (1901)\n* [http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/HistChldBks&CISOPTR=34863&REC=7 ''The Diary of a Goose Girl''] (1902), illus.

Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more.\n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the [[tropical climate zone|intertropical zone]] between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], hence its interesting density of humidity.

Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more.\n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the [[tropical climate zone|intertropical zone]] between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], hence its interesting density of humidity. Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa,  but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures.

After receiving federal funding for Stage Two of the light rail system development, the Overbrook line was reconstructed as a fully rebuilt [[Double track|double-tracked]] line served by modern light rail vehicles, making this line a considerably faster commute.\n\nThe line was reopened on June 2, 2004 following major work which included doubling of the track and elimination of 22 traditional street level trolley stops in favor of eight new LRV style stations with platforms.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//five-cities-dedicate-light-rail-lines.html |title=Five cities dedicate light rail lines |author=JW, RAH |publisher=Railway Gazette |date=July 1, 2004 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Route ==\nThe line starts at [[Allegheny (PAT station)|Allegheny]] station on the North Shore, makes an additional stop at [[North Side (PAT station)|North Side]], then proceeds under the [[Allegheny River]] and continues underground to [[Gateway Center (PAT station)|Gateway Center]], [[Wood Street (PAT station)|Wood Street]] and [[Steel Plaza (PAT station)|Steel Plaza]]. The line then surfaces at [[First Avenue (PAT station)|First Avenue]]. Leaving downtown, it crosses the [[Monongahela River]] on the [[Panhandle Bridge]], stopping at [[Station Square]] before running through the [[Mount Washington Transit Tunnel]]. At [[South Hills Junction (PAT station)|South Hills Junction]] the Library branch rejoins the Beechview line and the former [[Brown Line (Pittsburgh)|Brown Line]], which ran over Mount Washington through the [[Allentown (Pittsburgh)|Allentown]] neighborhood. The Blue Line continues south through Beltzhoover, Bon Air, [[Carrick (Pittsburgh)|Carrick]], Brookline, and [[Overbrook (Pittsburgh)|Overbrook]]. At [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Park]] a transfer is provided to the [[Red Line (Pittsburgh)|Red Line]], which reaches the same location via [[Beechview (Pittsburgh)|Beechview]]. Beyond [[Washington Junction (PAT station)|Washington Junction]] the line splits.\n\nThe [[South Hills Village]] branch was created in 1987 to complement the [[Red Line (Pittsburgh)|Red Line]], which runs through [[Beechview (Pittsburgh)|Beechview]] before reaching the same terminus.  This line was originally operated using PCCs, most notably the [[Port Authority 4000 Series PCC|4000 series]], because the new light rail cars were incompatible with the Overbrook line due to its age and condition.  Service was suspended when the Overbrook Line closed in 1993, but was reinstated after that line was rebuilt and reopened in 2004.\n\nOn June 25, 2012, the Port Authority closed two stations on the South Hills Village Branch as part of a system-wide consolidation: [[Santa Barbara (PAT station)|Santa Barbara]] and [[Martin Villa (PAT station)|Martin Villa]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.portauthority.org/paac/NewsEvents/LatestNews/tabid/96/newsid731/932/mid/731/Eleven-T-Stops-Close-June-25-Smith-Road--Sandy-Creek-to-Remain-Open/Default.aspx |title=Eleven T Stops Close June 25 |publisher=Port Authority of Allegheny County |date=June 22, 2012 |access-date=July 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818134809/http://www.portauthority.org/paac/NewsEvents/LatestNews/tabid/96/newsid731/932/mid/731/Eleven-T-Stops-Close-June-25-Smith-Road--Sandy-Creek-to-Remain-Open/Default.aspx |archive-date=August 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Station list ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Kluwe played at [[Los Alamitos High School]] in [[Los Alamitos, California]], where he was a [[1999 USA Today All-USA high school football team|1999 ''USA Today'']] High School [[All-America]]n, and then attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he played [[college football]] for the [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]]. He was signed by the [[Seattle Seahawks]] as an [[undrafted sportsperson|undrafted free agent]] in 2005 and played professionally in the [[National Football League]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nKluwe is widely known for his eight seasons with the [[Minnesota Vikings]], where he set eight individual team records.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings 2015 Media Guide\">{{cite web |title=Minnesota Vikings 2015 Media Guide |url=http://prod.static.vikings.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/2015/media-guide-2015.pdf}}</ref> During this period, Kluwe became an outspoken advocate on social issues, including [[same sex marriage]] and [[gay rights]], which ultimately led to tension between Kluwe and coaching staff.\n\nKluwe was released by the Vikings after the 2012 season, signed with the Oakland Raiders prior to the 2013 season, and was subsequently released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000237219/article/chris-kluwe-released-by-oakland-raiders |title=Chris Kluwe released by Oakland Raiders |publisher=NFL.com |date=August 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref> Kluwe was unable to find another NFL team with which to sign and retired from professional football in 2013. Following his departure from football, he has pursued a writing career and was a humor columnist for the sports website ''[[Deadspin]]''.\n\n==Early career==\n\n===High school===\nKluwe played three years of varsity football for coach John Barnes at [[Los Alamitos High School]] in [[Los Alamitos, California]] and was selected to play in both the California-Texas Shrine game (where he kicked a 57-yard game-winning field goal with no time left) and the CaliFlorida Bowl. He also made the ''[[USA Today]]'' first-team All-American as a punter. He kicked an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and CIF Playoff record 60-yard field goal vs. [[Loyola High School (Los Angeles)|Loyola]] to force overtime in an eventual 30\u201323 victory. Averaging 46.6 yards as a punter, he had 10 punts of at least 60 yards and placed six kicks inside the 10-yard line. As a placekicker, he made 16 of 22 field goal attempts and 39 of 41 PATs. Prior to his senior year, he won the punting competition at the National Kicking Invitational with a 63-yard punt that had 4.98 seconds of hang time. Kluwe also played one year of baseball as a pitcher.\n\n===College===\nKluwe enrolled at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he developed into one of the top punters in the [[Pac-10 Conference]]. He graduated in 2005 with a double major in political science and history.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |last=Gervino |first=Tony |title=The punter makes his point |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/sports/football/punter-chris-kluwes-voice-is-heard-in-same-sex-marriage-debate.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |accessdate=January 9, 2013 |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 19, 2012}}</ref> He set school records for both total punt yardage and total number of punts in a season in 2003. In his senior year, he ranked 3rd in the Pac-10 and 12th in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] in yards per punt (43.4). He was selected as special teams player of the game in the [[Silicon Valley Football Classic]] against [[California State University, Fresno|Fresno State]] after averaging 44.3 yards on nine kicks. He also tied the bowl record with his nine punts and placed three kicks inside the 20-yard line.  Kluwe was a finalist in his senior year for the [[Ray Guy Award]] that annually recognizes the best collegiate punter.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Varsity Stats at UCLA\n|-\n!

Kluwe had been notified by both the Seahawks and [[St. Louis Rams]] that either team might draft him in the late rounds. As soon as the draft ended, Kluwe signed a free agent contract with Seattle. Kluwe had an excellent training camp with Seattle, to the point where [[Donnie Jones]] was released after the first week of Organized Team Activities, and Kluwe and [[Tom Rouen]] split time during the pre-season games for punting duties. Kluwe was told by the Seahawks prior to the final pre-season game they were going to take him to the practice squad as Rouen had a history over the prior three seasons of going on [[injured reserve]] during the season and the Seahawks wanted Kluwe both as a potential back-up and for developmental reasons. Due to NFL rules, the Seahawks had to place Kluwe on the waiver wire for 24 hours prior to signing him to a practice squad contract. The Seahawks waited until the last minute to place Kluwe on the waiver wire as they knew three teams had been scouting Kluwe as a potential punter for their team. The Seahawks concerns were well founded as Kluwe was claimed off the waiver wire early the next day by the Vikings.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Minnesota Vikings===\nKluwe became one of the most surprising pickups for the Vikings, finishing his first season with an average of 44.1 yards per punt, ranking second in the NFC and sixth in the league. He punted 71 times during his first season.  Kluwe was also named NFC special teams player of the month for September 2005 \u2013 a first for any Vikings special teams rookie.\n\nDuring a Week-13 game in Detroit, Lions safety [[Vernon Fox]] dove towards Kluwe during a punt and collided with Kluwe's plant foot. Although initial concerns were that Kluwe had a broken ankle, tests showed Kluwe had a sprained ankle. What the tests did also show was that earlier in the game when the ball was snapped over Kluwe's head and he had to make a running and jumping rugby style kick to avoid being blocked, he tore his right ACL when he landed after the kick.  Kicker [[Paul Edinger]] was the punter for the remainder of the game, but a few days later the Vikings signed 42-year-old veteran [[Darren Bennett (football)|Darren Bennett]] for 1 week.  Kluwe then returned to play the final 3 games of the 2005 season with a torn ACL in his kicking leg, which prompted his then coach Mike Tice to reply to a reporter's question about Kluwe's injury that \"My punter is a tough guy.\"  As Tice was not known to be sympathetic towards punters and kickers, this showed the amount of respect he had for Kluwe's willingness to play with a serious injury.  During the 2006 off-season Kluwe had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the ACL. The operation was successful and Kluwe returned to the Vikings in full health for the 2006 season.\n\nOn October 25, 2007, Kluwe signed an $8.3-million contract extension through 2013. The deal made Kluwe, who would have been a [[restricted free agent]] in the 2008 offseason, one of the 10 highest-paid punters in the NFL.\n\n[[File:Chris Kluwe postgame 2010-11-28.jpg|thumb|right|Kluwe after a game in 2010]]\n\nOn December 20, 2010, Kluwe had the dubious distinction of punting the ball that the [[Chicago Bears]]' [[Devin Hester]] would return for a touchdown, breaking the all-time NFL record for combined punt and kickoff returns for touchdowns.  Previously in the game, Kluwe had successfully kept the ball out of Hester's hands on four punts.<ref>[http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=7408 \"Hester runs into the NFL record book\"], Retrieved December 23, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Kluwe changed his jersey number when the Vikings acquired quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]]. McNabb previously wore #5 for the [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and requested the same number when he arrived in Minnesota, which was then being worn by Kluwe. Kluwe agreed on the condition that McNabb make a $5,000 donation to charity, to mention Kluwe's band Tripping Icarus a total of 5 times during McNabb's press conferences, and to buy Kluwe an ice cream cone.<ref>{{cite news |last=Novy |first=Eben |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-02/mcnabb-gets-vikings-no-5-jersey-for-donation-kluwe-band-pitch-ice-cream.html |title=McNabb Gets Vikings No. 5 Jersey for Donation, Kluwe Band Pitch, Ice Cream |publisher=Bloomberg |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> Kluwe took up #4 which had been worn by quarterback [[Brett Favre]] in 2009 and 2010.  Following McNabb's departure from the team, Kluwe reclaimed his old #5 for the 2012 season.  McNabb did mention Kluwe's band 3 times and did write the check for the donation, but didn't buy Kluwe the ice cream cone until 5 years later.<ref name=\"Chris Kluwe confirms he got the ice cream cone from Donovan McNabb.\">{{cite web|author=share |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3nq74m/per_donte_stallworth_tom_brady_paid_practice/cvqdndf |title=accipitradea comments on Per Donte Stallworth, Tom Brady paid practice squad players for intercepting him during practice |publisher=Reddit.com |date=October 6, 2015 |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter a poor performance in an October 25, 2012 game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], the Vikings brought in several punters for workouts to potentially replace Kluwe. Kluwe had been playing since 2007 with a torn meniscus. His discomfort caused by the condition late in 2012 led to him deciding to have surgery during the offseason. In January 2013, the team signed punter T.J. Conley to a futures contract.<ref name=kluwe /> Kluwe finished the 2012 season with an average of 45.0 yards per punt, ranking tenth in the NFC and 22nd in the league.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nKluwe had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus in early 2013.  Recovery was uneventful and Kluwe was back to full health in a matter of weeks.  During the 2013 NFL draft, the Vikings drafted Jeff Locke (UCLA) in the 5th round of the draft as a punter.  Speculation immediately surfaced that Kluwe's days were numbered with the Vikings due to the use of a relatively high draft round pick for a punter.  On May 6, 2013, Kluwe was released by the Minnesota Vikings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Minnesota Vikings release outspoken punter Chris Kluwe |url=http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2013/05/06/Minnesota-Vikings-release-outspoken-punter-Chris-Kluwe/UPI-97681367882983/ |publisher=UPI |accessdate=May 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Vikings team records====\nKluwe holds a number of team punt records for the Minnesota Vikings (see list below).<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings 2015 Media Guide\" />\n# #1 Career Punt Avg., 44.4, 2005\u20132012\n# #1 Game Punt Avg., 54.3, 2005\n# #1 Rookie Game Punt Avg., 54.3, 2005\n# #1 Career Playoff Punt Avg., 45.2, 2005\u20132012\n# #1 Average Punts per Season, 78, 2005\u20132012\n# #1 Career Punts Inside 20, 198, 2005\u20132012\n# #1, #2, #5 Season Punts Inside 20, 34 / 32 / 28, 2007 / 2010 / 2006\n# #1 Game Punts Inside 20, 5, 2007\n# #8 (tied) Career Blocked Punts, 1, 2005\u20132012\n# #2 Career Punts, 623, 2005\u20132012\n# #2 Rookie Season Punts, 71, 2005\n# #2 Season Fewest Touchbacks, 2, 2012\n# #2 Career Net Yds.

Kluwe played at [[Los Alamitos High School]] in [[Los Alamitos, California]], where he was a [[1999 USA Today All-USA high school football team|1999 ''USA Today'']] High School [[All-America]]n, and then attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he played [[college football]] for the [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]]. He was signed by the [[Seattle Seahawks]] as an [[undrafted sportsperson|undrafted free agent]] in 2005 and played professionally in the [[National Football League]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nKluwe is widely known for his eight seasons with the [[Minnesota Vikings]], where he set eight individual team records.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings 2015 Media Guide\">{{cite web |title=Minnesota Vikings 2015 Media Guide |url=http://prod.static.vikings.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/2015/media-guide-2015.pdf}}</ref> During this period, Kluwe became an outspoken advocate on social issues, including [[same sex marriage]] and [[gay rights]], which ultimately led to tension between Kluwe and coaching staff.\n\nKluwe was released by the Vikings after the 2012 season, signed with the Oakland Raiders prior to the 2013 season, and was subsequently released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000237219/article/chris-kluwe-released-by-oakland-raiders |title=Chris Kluwe released by Oakland Raiders |publisher=NFL.com |date=August 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref> Kluwe was unable to find another NFL team with which to sign and retired from professional football in 2013. Following his departure from football, he has pursued a writing career and is a humor columnist for the sports website ''[[Deadspin]]''.\n\n==Early career==\n\n===High school===\nKluwe played three years of varsity football for coach John Barnes at [[Los Alamitos High School]] in [[Los Alamitos, California]] and was selected to play in both the California-Texas Shrine game (where he kicked a 57-yard game-winning field goal with no time left) and the CaliFlorida Bowl. He also made the ''[[USA Today]]'' first-team All-American as a punter. He kicked an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and CIF Playoff record 60-yard field goal vs. [[Loyola High School (Los Angeles)|Loyola]] to force overtime in an eventual 30\u201323 victory. Averaging 46.6 yards as a punter, he had 10 punts of at least 60 yards and placed six kicks inside the 10-yard line. As a placekicker, he made 16 of 22 field goal attempts and 39 of 41 PATs. Prior to his senior year, he won the punting competition at the National Kicking Invitational with a 63-yard punt that had 4.98 seconds of hang time. Kluwe also played one year of baseball as a pitcher.\n\n===College===\nKluwe enrolled at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he developed into one of the top punters in the [[Pac-10 Conference]]. He graduated in 2005 with a double major in political science and history.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |last=Gervino |first=Tony |title=The punter makes his point |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/sports/football/punter-chris-kluwes-voice-is-heard-in-same-sex-marriage-debate.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |accessdate=January 9, 2013 |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 19, 2012}}</ref> He set school records for both total punt yardage and total number of punts in a season in 2003. In his senior year, he ranked 3rd in the Pac-10 and 12th in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] in yards per punt (43.4). He was selected as special teams player of the game in the [[Silicon Valley Football Classic]] against [[California State University, Fresno|Fresno State]] after averaging 44.3 yards on nine kicks. He also tied the bowl record with his nine punts and placed three kicks inside the 20-yard line.  Kluwe was a finalist in his senior year for the [[Ray Guy Award]] that annually recognizes the best collegiate punter.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Varsity Stats at UCLA\n|-\n!

Kluwe had been notified by both the Seahawks and [[St. Louis Rams]] that either team might draft him in the late rounds. As soon as the draft ended, Kluwe signed a free agent contract with Seattle. Kluwe had an excellent training camp with Seattle, to the point where [[Donnie Jones]] was released after the first week of Organized Team Activities, and Kluwe and [[Tom Rouen]] split time during the pre-season games for punting duties. Kluwe was told by the Seahawks prior to the final pre-season game they were going to take him to the practice squad as Rouen had a history over the prior three seasons of going on [[injured reserve]] during the season and the Seahawks wanted Kluwe both as a potential back-up and for developmental reasons. Due to NFL rules, the Seahawks had to place Kluwe on the waiver wire for 24 hours prior to signing him to a practice squad contract. The Seahawks waited until the last minute to place Kluwe on the waiver wire as they knew three teams had been scouting Kluwe as a potential punter for their team. The Seahawks concerns were well founded as Kluwe was claimed off the waiver wire early the next day by the Vikings.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Minnesota Vikings===\nKluwe became one of the most surprising pickups for the Vikings, finishing his first season with an average of 44.1 yards per punt, ranking second in the NFC and sixth in the league. He punted 71 times during his first season.  Kluwe was also named NFC special teams player of the month for September 2005 \u2013 a first for any Vikings special teams rookie.\n\nDuring a Week-13 game in Detroit, Lions safety [[Vernon Fox]] dove towards Kluwe during a punt and collided with Kluwe's plant foot. Although initial concerns were that Kluwe had a broken ankle, tests showed Kluwe had a sprained ankle. What the tests did also show was that earlier in the game when the ball was snapped over Kluwe's head and he had to make a running and jumping rugby style kick to avoid being blocked, he tore his right ACL when he landed after the kick.  Kicker [[Paul Edinger]] was the punter for the remainder of the game, but a few days later the Vikings signed 42-year-old veteran [[Darren Bennett (football)|Darren Bennett]] for 1 week.  Kluwe then returned to play the final 3 games of the 2005 season with a torn ACL in his kicking leg, which prompted his then coach Mike Tice to reply to a reporter's question about Kluwe's injury that \"My punter is a tough guy.\"  As Tice was not known to be sympathetic towards punters and kickers, this showed the amount of respect he had for Kluwe's willingness to play with a serious injury.  During the 2006 off-season Kluwe had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the ACL. The operation was successful and Kluwe returned to the Vikings in full health for the 2006 season.\n\nOn October 25, 2007, Kluwe signed an $8.3-million contract extension through 2013. The deal made Kluwe, who would have been a [[restricted free agent]] in the 2008 offseason, one of the 10 highest-paid punters in the NFL.\n\n[[File:Chris Kluwe postgame 2010-11-28.jpg|thumb|right|Kluwe after a game in 2010]]\n\nOn December 20, 2010, Kluwe had the dubious distinction of punting the ball that the [[Chicago Bears]]' [[Devin Hester]] would return for a touchdown, breaking the all-time NFL record for combined punt and kickoff returns for touchdowns.  Previously in the game, Kluwe had successfully kept the ball out of Hester's hands on four punts.<ref>[http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=7408 \"Hester runs into the NFL record book\"], Retrieved December 23, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Kluwe changed his jersey number when the Vikings acquired quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]]. McNabb previously wore #5 for the [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and requested the same number when he arrived in Minnesota, which was then being worn by Kluwe. Kluwe agreed on the condition that McNabb make a $5,000 donation to charity, to mention Kluwe's band Tripping Icarus a total of 5 times during McNabb's press conferences, and to buy Kluwe an ice cream cone.<ref>{{cite news |last=Novy |first=Eben |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-02/mcnabb-gets-vikings-no-5-jersey-for-donation-kluwe-band-pitch-ice-cream.html |title=McNabb Gets Vikings No. 5 Jersey for Donation, Kluwe Band Pitch, Ice Cream |publisher=Bloomberg |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> Kluwe took up #4 which had been worn by quarterback [[Brett Favre]] in 2009 and 2010.  Following McNabb's departure from the team, Kluwe reclaimed his old #5 for the 2012 season.  McNabb did mention Kluwe's band 3 times and did write the check for the donation, but didn't buy Kluwe the ice cream cone until 5 years later.<ref name=\"Chris Kluwe confirms he got the ice cream cone from Donovan McNabb.\">{{cite web|author=share |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3nq74m/per_donte_stallworth_tom_brady_paid_practice/cvqdndf |title=accipitradea comments on Per Donte Stallworth, Tom Brady paid practice squad players for intercepting him during practice |publisher=Reddit.com |date=October 6, 2015 |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter a poor performance in an October 25, 2012 game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], the Vikings brought in several punters for workouts to potentially replace Kluwe. Kluwe had been playing since 2007 with a torn meniscus. His discomfort caused by the condition late in 2012 led to him deciding to have surgery during the offseason. In January 2013, the team signed punter T.J. Conley to a futures contract.<ref name=kluwe /> Kluwe finished the 2012 season with an average of 45.0 yards per punt, ranking tenth in the NFC and 22nd in the league.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nKluwe had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus in early 2013.  Recovery was uneventful and Kluwe was back to full health in a matter of weeks.  During the 2013 NFL draft, the Vikings drafted Jeff Locke (UCLA) in the 5th round of the draft as a punter.  Speculation immediately surfaced that Kluwe's days were numbered with the Vikings due to the use of a relatively high draft round pick for a punter.  On May 6, 2013, Kluwe was released by the Minnesota Vikings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Minnesota Vikings release outspoken punter Chris Kluwe |url=http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2013/05/06/Minnesota-Vikings-release-outspoken-punter-Chris-Kluwe/UPI-97681367882983/ |publisher=UPI |accessdate=May 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Vikings team records====\nKluwe holds a number of team punt records for the Minnesota Vikings (see list below).<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings 2015 Media Guide\" />\n# #1 Career Punt Avg., 44.4, 2005\u20132012\n# #1 Game Punt Avg., 54.3, 2005\n# #1 Rookie Game Punt Avg., 54.3, 2005\n# #1 Career Playoff Punt Avg., 45.2, 2005\u20132012\n# #1 Average Punts per Season, 78, 2005\u20132012\n# #1 Career Punts Inside 20, 198, 2005\u20132012\n# #1, #2, #5 Season Punts Inside 20, 34 / 32 / 28, 2007 / 2010 / 2006\n# #1 Game Punts Inside 20, 5, 2007\n# #8 (tied) Career Blocked Punts, 1, 2005\u20132012\n# #2 Career Punts, 623, 2005\u20132012\n# #2 Rookie Season Punts, 71, 2005\n# #2 Season Fewest Touchbacks, 2, 2012\n# #2 Career Net Yds.
