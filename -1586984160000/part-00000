Wilson]]. Produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] as its first feature film, it was released by [[20th Century Fox]] on March 15, 2002. The film features the voices of [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], and [[Denis Leary]]. Set during the days of the [[Pleistocene|ice age]], the film centers around three main characters - Manny (Romano), a no-nonsense [[woolly mammoth]]; Sid (Leguizamo), a loudmouthed [[Megalonyx|ground sloth]]; and Diego (Leary), a sardonic [[smilodon|saber-tooth tiger]] -  who come across a neanderthal (referred in the film as a human) baby and work together to return it to its tribe. Additionally, the film occasionally follows Scrat, a speechless \"saber-toothed squirrel\" voiced by Wedge who is perpetually searching for a place in the ground to bury his acorn.\n\n''Ice Age'' was originally intended as a [[traditional animation|2D animated]] film developed by [[Fox Animation Studios]], but eventually became the first full-length animated film for the newly-reformed Blue Sky, which had been reshaped from a VFX house to a computer animation studio. Focus shifted from making an action-adventure drama film to a more comedy-oriented one, and several writers, such as [[Michael Berg (screenwriter)|Michael Berg]] and [[Peter Ackerman (playwright)|Peter Ackerman]], were brought on to bring out a wittier tone.\n\nUpon release, ''Ice Age'' received mostly positive reviews and was nominated at the [[75th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[Spirited Away]]''. It was a [[box office]] success and grossed over $383 million, starting the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' franchise]], being followed by four sequels: ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' in 2006, ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' in 2009, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' in 2012, and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Cronopio (mammal)|saber-toothed squirrel]] known as Scrat attempts to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. Eventually, as he tries to stomp it into the ground, he inadvertently causes a large crack to form in the ice that extends for miles before setting off a large avalanche which nearly crushes him. He barely escapes but finds himself getting stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals migrating south in order to escape the forthcoming [[ice age]]. Sid, a clumsy [[Megalonyx|ground sloth]], is left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself, but is attacked by two ''Brontotheres'' after ruining their meal and making them angry. Sid is soon rescued by Manny, a gruff [[woolly mammoth]] heading north, who fights the rhinos off and continues on his path. Sid joins Manny, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanor and wishes to migrate on his own, but Sid nonetheless continues to follow Manny. Meanwhile, Soto, the leader of a pack of [[Smilodon|saber-toothed tiger]]s, wants revenge on a tribe of neanderthals for killing half of his pack by eating the chief's infant son, Roshan,<ref name=\"Strong Official\">{{cite web |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192553/https://www.tarastrong.com/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url=https://www.tarastrong.com |title=Tara Strong official website |author=Tara Strong |accessdate=April 19, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> alive. Soto leads a raid on the neanderthal settlement, during which the Roshan's mother is separated from everyone else and jumps down a waterfall upon being cornered by Soto's lieutenant, [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]]. As punishment for his failure to retrieve Roshan, Diego is sent to find and retrieve the baby.\n\nLater, Sid and Manny encounter the mother struggling out of the lake, dying from her plunge. The mother only has enough strength to entrust Roshan to Manny before she dies and disappears into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but when they reach the neanderthal settlement, they find it deserted. They meet up with Diego, who convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the neanderthals. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to Half-Peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them.\n\nAfter encountering several misadventures on their way, the group reaches a cave with several [[cave painting]]s. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with the neanderthal hunters, in which they slaughtered his family, consisting of his mate and child, leaving Manny a depressed loner. Later, the group almost reaches their destination, Half-Peak, only to encounter a forming river of lava. Manny and Sid, along with Roshan, make it across safely, but Diego ends up hanging on a cliff, about to fall into the lava. Manny saves him, narrowly missing certain death by falling into the lava himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and Roshan takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who starts to have a change of heart about his mission.\n\nThe next day, the herd approaches the ambush, causing Diego, now full of respect for Manny for saving his life to change his mind and confess to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego asks for their trust and tries to foil the attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, but despite their efforts, Soto's associates manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks a distracted Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall onto Soto, impaling and instantly killing him. Horrified, the rest of the pack retreat. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego's injury, which they believe is fatal, and continue their journey without him. The two manage to successfully return Roshan to his tribe, and to their surprise, Diego manages to rejoin them, in time to see Roshan leave. The group then begin to head off to warmer climates.\n\n20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, ends up on the shores of a tropical island. As the ice slowly melts, an acorn that was also frozen in the same ice block is washed away. Scrat then finds a coconut and tries to stomp it into the ground, only to accidentally trigger a volcanic eruption.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Ice Age characters}}\nThe characters are all [[prehistory|prehistoric]] animals. The animals can talk to and understand each other and are voiced by a variety of famous [[actor]]s. Like many films of prehistoric life, the rules of time periods apply very loosely, as many of the species shown in the film never actually lived in the same time periods or the same geographic regions.\n[[File:15-07-21-Mexico-Stadtzentrum-RalfR-N3S 9683.jpg|thumb|A person wearing a Sid costume]]\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manfred \"Manny\"]], a [[woolly mammoth]] \n* [[Denis Leary]] as [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]], a ''[[Smilodon]]'' \n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]], a ''[[Megalonyx]]'' \n* [[Chris Wedge]] as [[Scrat]], a ''[[Cronopio (mammal)|Cronopio]]\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Soto, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Jack Black]] as Zeke, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Oscar, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Lenny, a ''[[Homotherium]]''\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Carl, an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' \n* [[Stephen Root]] as Frank, a ''[[Brontops]]''\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] and [[Lorri Bagley]] as Rachel and Jennifer, respectively, a pair of female giant ground sloths\n* [[Tara Strong]] as Roshan, a ''[[Neanderthal]]'' infant<ref name=\"Strong Official\"/>\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\n''Ice Age'' was originally pitched to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1997 by producer Lori Forte. The film, originally envisioned as a [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] movie with an action-oriented [[comedy-drama]] tone, was intended to be developed by [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]]'s [[Fox Animation Studios]]. Around the same time, [[Blue Sky Studios]], a small [[visual effects]] studio in [[White Plains, New York]], was bought out by Fox and reshaped into a full-fledged [[computer animation|CG animation]] film studio. In light of this, [[20th Century Fox Animation|Fox Animation]] head [[Chris Meledandri]] and executive producer Steve Bannerman approached Forte with the proposition of developing the film as a computer-animated movie, which Forte realized was \"basically a no-brainer,\" according to her. [[Michael J. Wilson]], who had written and developed the film's original story treatments in conjunction with Forte, wrote the first draft for the script, and [[Chris Wedge]], a co-founder of Blue Sky, was brought on to the project as the director in late 1998.

The name 'Scrat' is a combination of the words 'squirrel' and 'rat', as Scrat has characteristics of both species; Wedge has also called him \"saber-toothed squirrel.\" Scrat's opening adventure was inserted because, without it, the first real snow and ice sequence wouldn't take place until about 37 minutes into the film. This was the only role intended for Scrat, but he proved to be such a popular character with test audiences that he was given more scenes. The filmmakers made it so that many of the scenes with Scrat appear directly after dramatic moments in the film.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with [[Jay Leno]], [[Denis Leary]] revealed that his character, Diego the sabertooth, originally died near the end of the film. However, it was reported that kids in the test audience bursted into tears when his death was shown. Leary himself warned the producers that something like this would happen. When it was proven true, the scene was re-written to ensure Diego survived.\n\nOriginally, Sid the Sloth was supposed to be a con-artist and a hustler, and there was even finished scene of the character conning some aardvark kids. His character was later changed to a talkative-clumsy sloth because the team felt the audience would have hated him. There was also an alternate scene of Sid in the hottub with the ladies which shows him saying to them \"Let's jump in the gene pool and see what happens.\" One of the female sloths then kicks him in the groin. This was cut because it was not suitable for children and may have gotten the film a PG-13 rating. Other innuendos with Sid were also cut from the film. Sid was also supposed to have a female sloth named Sylvia (voiced by Kristen Johnston) chasing after him, whom he despised and kept ditching. All the removed scenes can be seen on the DVD.\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe characters and environments in ''Ice Age'' were modeled and animated using WaveFront's [[Maya (software)|Maya]] animation software. Rendering was completed using CGI Studio, an in-house [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] program being developed since Blue Sky's formation in 1987 and previously used for Wedge's 1998 short film, ''[[Bunny (short)|Bunny]]''. While ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', released three months before ''Ice Age'', became the first computer-animated film to make use of ray tracing technology, ''Ice Age'' would have received the distinction had it been released at the time Blue Sky began work on the movie.<ref name=\"Ice Pack\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/03/12/john_leguizamo_ice_age_interview.shtml|title=BBC - Films - interview - John Leguizamo|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice casting ===\nThe voice cast of ''Ice Age'' was encouraged to [[Improvisation|make up their own dialogue]] during recording.

Wilson]]. Produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] as its first feature film, it was released by [[20th Century Fox]] on March 15, 2002. The film features the voices of [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], and [[Denis Leary]]. Set during the days of the [[Pleistocene|ice age]], the film centers around three main characters - Manny (Romano), a no-nonsense [[woolly mammoth]]; Sid (Leguizamo), a loudmouthed [[ground sloth]]; and Diego (Leary), a sardonic [[smilodon|saber-tooth tiger]] -  who come across a human baby and work together to return it to its tribe. Additionally, the film occasionally follows Scrat, a speechless \"saber-toothed squirrel\" voiced by Wedge who is perpetually searching for a place in the ground to bury his acorn.\n\n''Ice Age'' was originally intended as a [[traditional animation|2D animated]] film developed by [[Fox Animation Studios]], but eventually became the first full-length animated film for the newly-reformed Blue Sky, which had been reshaped from a VFX house to a computer animation studio. Focus shifted from making an action-adventure drama film to a more comedy-oriented one, and several writers, such as [[Michael Berg (screenwriter)|Michael Berg]] and [[Peter Ackerman (playwright)|Peter Ackerman]], were brought on to bring out a wittier tone.\n\nUpon release, ''Ice Age'' received mostly positive reviews and was nominated at the [[75th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[Spirited Away]]''. It was a [[box office]] success and grossed over $383 million, starting the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' franchise]], being followed by four sequels: ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' in 2006, ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' in 2009, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' in 2012, and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Cronopio (mammal)|saber-toothed squirrel]] known as Scrat attempts to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. Eventually, as he tries to stomp it into the ground, he inadvertently causes a large crack to form in the ice that extends for miles before setting off a large avalanche which nearly crushes him. He barely escapes but finds himself getting stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals migrating south in order to escape the forthcoming [[ice age]]. Sid, a clumsy [[ground sloth]], is left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself, but is attacked by two ''Brontotheres'' after ruining their meal and making them angry. Sid is soon rescued by Manny, a gruff [[woolly mammoth]] heading north, who fights the rhinos off and continues on his path. Sid joins Manny, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanor and wishes to migrate on his own, but Sid nonetheless continues to follow Manny. Meanwhile, Soto, the leader of a pack of [[Smilodon|saber-toothed tiger]]s, wants revenge on a tribe of neanderthals for killing half of his pack by eating the chief's infant son, Roshan,<ref name=\"Strong Official\">{{cite web |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192553/https://www.tarastrong.com/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url=https://www.tarastrong.com |title=Tara Strong official website |author=Tara Strong |accessdate=April 19, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> alive. Soto leads a raid on the neanderthal camp, during which the Roshan's mother is separated from everyone else and jumps down a waterfall upon being cornered by Soto's lieutenant, [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]]. As punishment for his failure to retrieve Roshan, Diego is sent to find and retrieve the baby.\n\nLater, Sid and Manny encounter the mother struggling out of the lake, dying from her plunge. The mother only has enough strength to entrust Roshan to Manny before she dies and disappears into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but when they reach the neanderthal settlement, they find it deserted. They meet up with Diego, who convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the neanderthals. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to Half-Peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them.\n\nAfter encountering several misadventures on their way, the group reaches a cave with several [[cave painting]]s. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with the neanderthal hunters, in which they slaughtered his family, consisting of his mate and child, leaving Manny a depressed loner. Later, the group almost reaches their destination, Half-Peak, only to encounter a forming river of lava. Manny and Sid, along with Roshan, make it across safely, but Diego ends up hanging on a cliff, about to fall into the lava. Manny saves him, narrowly missing certain death by falling into the lava himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and Roshan takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who starts to have a change of heart about his mission.\n\nThe next day, the herd approaches the ambush, causing Diego, now full of respect for Manny for saving his life to change his mind and confess to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego asks for their trust and tries to foil the attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, but despite their efforts, Soto's associates manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks a distracted Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall onto Soto, impaling and instantly killing him. Horrified, the rest of the pack retreat. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego's injury, which they believe is fatal, and continue their journey without him. The two manage to successfully return Roshan to his tribe, and to their surprise, Diego manages to rejoin them, in time to see Roshan leave. The group then begin to head off to warmer climates.\n\n20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, ends up on the shores of a tropical island. As the ice slowly melts, an acorn that was also frozen in the same ice block is washed away.

Like many films of prehistoric life, the rules of time periods apply very loosely, as many of the species shown in the film never actually lived in the same time periods or the same geographic regions.\n[[File:15-07-21-Mexico-Stadtzentrum-RalfR-N3S 9683.jpg|thumb|A person wearing a Sid costume]]\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manfred \"Manny\"]], a [[woolly mammoth]] \n* [[Denis Leary]] as [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]], a ''[[Smilodon]]'' \n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]], a ''[[Megalonyx]]'' \n* [[Chris Wedge]] as [[Scrat]], a ''[[Cronopio (mammal)|Cronopio]]\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Soto, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Jack Black]] as Zeke, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Oscar, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Lenny, a ''[[Homotherium]]''\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Carl, an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' \n* [[Stephen Root]] as Frank, a ''[[Brontops]]''\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] and [[Lorri Bagley]] as Rachel and Jennifer, respectively, a pair of female giant ground sloths\n* [[Tara Strong]] as Roshan, a human infant<ref name=\"Strong Official\"/>\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\n''Ice Age'' was originally pitched to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1997 by producer Lori Forte. The film, originally envisioned as a [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] movie with an action-oriented [[comedy-drama]] tone, was intended to be developed by [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]]'s [[Fox Animation Studios]]. Around the same time, [[Blue Sky Studios]], a small [[visual effects]] studio in [[White Plains, New York]], was bought out by Fox and reshaped into a full-fledged [[computer animation|CG animation]] film studio. In light of this, [[20th Century Fox Animation|Fox Animation]] head [[Chris Meledandri]] and executive producer Steve Bannerman approached Forte with the proposition of developing the film as a computer-animated movie, which Forte realized was \"basically a no-brainer,\" according to her. [[Michael J. Wilson]], who had written and developed the film's original story treatments in conjunction with Forte, wrote the first draft for the script, and [[Chris Wedge]], a co-founder of Blue Sky, was brought on to the project as the director in late 1998. Fox also opted for the movie to take a more comedy-oriented direction (albeit while still maintaining some dramatic elements),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/coming-out-ice-age |title=Coming Out of the Ice Age |first=John C. |last=Donkin |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=March 12, 2002 |accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> and brought writer [[Michael Berg (screenwriter)|Michael Berg]] to help emphasize a funnier tone. After being hired, Berg reportedly told the studio that he couldn't write a kid's film, to which the studio responded \"Great!

Wilson stated on his blog that his daughter Flora came up with the idea for an animal that was a mixture of both squirrel and rat, naming it Scrat, and that the animal was obsessed with pursuing his acorn.<ref>[http://sootheatrenews.blogspot.com/2009/11/ice-age-story-behind-story-from-writer.html?m=1 Ice Age: The Story Behind the Story (from the writer Michael J. Wilson)], News from the Soo Theatre, Inc. Retrieved April 2nd, 2017.</ref> The plan to have Scrat talk was quickly dropped, as he worked better as a silent character for comedic effect. The name 'Scrat' is a combination of the words 'squirrel' and 'rat', as Scrat has characteristics of both species; Wedge has also called him \"saber-toothed squirrel.\" Scrat's opening adventure was inserted because, without it, the first real snow and ice sequence wouldn't take place until about 37 minutes into the film. This was the only role intended for Scrat, but he proved to be such a popular character with test audiences that he was given more scenes. The filmmakers made it so that many of the scenes with Scrat appear directly after dramatic moments in the film.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with [[Jay Leno]], [[Denis Leary]] revealed that his character, Diego the sabertooth, originally died near the end of the film. However, it was reported that kids in the test audience bursted into tears when his death was shown. Leary himself warned the producers that something like this would happen. When it was proven true, the scene was re-written to ensure Diego survived.\n\nOriginally, Sid the Sloth was supposed to be a con-artist and a hustler, and there was even finished scene of the character conning some aardvark kids. His character was later changed to a talkative-clumsy sloth because the team felt the audience would have hated him. There was also an alternate scene of Sid in the hottub with the ladies which shows him saying to them \"Let's jump in the gene pool and see what happens.\" One of the female sloths then kicks him in the groin. This was cut because it was not suitable for children and may have gotten the film a PG-13 rating. Other innuendos with Sid were also cut from the film. Sid was also supposed to have a female sloth named Sylvia (voiced by Kristen Johnston) chasing after him, whom he despised and kept ditching. All the removed scenes can be seen on the DVD.\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe characters and environments in ''Ice Age'' were modeled and animated using WaveFront's [[Maya (software)|Maya]] animation software. Rendering was completed using CGI Studio, an in-house [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] program being developed since Blue Sky's formation in 1987 and previously used for Wedge's 1998 short film, ''[[Bunny (short)|Bunny]]''. While ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', released three months before ''Ice Age'', became the first computer-animated film to make use of ray tracing technology, ''Ice Age'' would have received the distinction had it been released at the time Blue Sky began work on the movie.<ref name=\"Ice Pack\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/03/12/john_leguizamo_ice_age_interview.shtml|title=BBC - Films - interview - John Leguizamo|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice casting ===\nThe voice cast of ''Ice Age'' was encouraged to [[Improvisation|make up their own dialogue]] during recording.

Originally, when London consisted of little more than the [[City of London|City]], the term applied to all Londoners, but as the city grew this was replaced by less universal definitions. A common view is that in order to be a cockney, one must have been born within earshot of Bow Bells, the bells of [[St Mary-le-Bow]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/#/bow-bells/4535373284|title=St Mary-le-Bow|website=www.stmarylebow.co.uk}}</ref> which were cast at the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]]. However, the church of St Mary-le-Bow was destroyed in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London]] and rebuilt by [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. Although the bells were destroyed again in 1941 in [[the Blitz]], they had fallen silent on 13 June 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. Before they were replaced in 1961, there was a period when, by the \"within earshot\" definition, no \"Bow Bell\" cockneys could be born.<ref>J. Swinnerton, ''The London Companion'' (Robson, 2004), p. 21.</ref> The use of such a literal definition produces other problems, since the area around the church is no longer residential and the noise of the area makes it unlikely that many people would now be born within earshot of the bells,{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=11}} Similarly, there were in the past, several hospitals in audible range; but now there is just the [[Royal London Hospital]] in [[Whitechapel]], with home births now uncommon.\n\nThe terms \u201cEast End of London\u201d and \u201cwithin the sound of bow bells\u201d are used interchangeably, and the bells are a symbol of East End identity. However the Bow Bells definition reflects the earlier definition of Cockney as relating to all Londoners (at a time when London barely extended beyond the [[City of London|square mile]]. The use of the term to describe all [[London]]ers generally, however, survived into the 19th century<ref name=\"hott\" /> before becoming restricted to the working class and their particular accent. The term is now used loosely to describe all [[East End of London|East Londoners]], irrespective of their speech.\n\nA study was carried out by the [[City of London|City]] in 2000 to see how far away Bow Bells could be heard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-use/cockney/|title=Cockney - Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> and it was estimated that the bells would have been heard up to six miles to the east, five miles to the north, three miles to the south, and four miles to the west. According to the legend of [[Dick Whittington]] the bells could once be heard from as far away as the Highgate [[Archway, London|Archway]] (4.5 miles north). Based on a definition of the bells audible range, all East Enders are cockneys, but not all cockneys are East Enders; though whereas an East Ender would be likely to proudly claim that entitlement, a resident of west, north or south London would be less likely to. The traditional core districts of the [[East End of London|East End]] are [[Bethnal Green]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Spitalfields]], [[Stepney]], [[Wapping]], [[Limehouse]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Haggerston]], [[Aldgate]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Millwall]], [[Cubitt Town]], [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], [[Hoxton]], [[Bow, London|Bow]] and [[Mile End]]. The area north of the Thames gradually expanded to include [[East Ham]], [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[Leyton]], [[West Ham]] and [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] as more land was built upon.\n\nWriting in 1981, the dialectologist Peter Wright identified the building of the [[Becontree]] estate near [[Dagenham]] in Essex as influential in the spread of cockney dialect. This very large estate was built by the [[Corporation of London]] to house poor residents of London's East End on what was previously a rural area of Essex, and the residents generally kept their native cockney dialect rather than adopt an Essex dialect.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=146}} Wright also reports that cockney dialect spread along the main railway routes to towns in the surrounding counties as early as 1923, and cockney then spread further after World War II as many refugees left London owing to the bombing, but continued to speak cockney in their new homes.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=147}}\n\n== Notable cockneys ==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n<!-- *** ATTENTION*** Please cite entries with a reliable source for a person being explicitly known as, or calling themselves, a Cockney -->\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\n*[[Danny Baker]] (broadcaster, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Michael Caine]] (actor, born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr., 14 March 1933, in [[Rotherhithe]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Screening Room Special: Michael Caine|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/30/caine.october/|agency=CNN|issue=29 October 2007|date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Alfie Bass]] actor from [[Bethnal Green]].\n*[[Charlie Chaplin]] (comic actor, filmmaker, and composer, 16 April 1889, born in [[Walworth, London]])\n*[[Roger Daltrey]] (singer, actor and vocalist of [[The Who]], 1 March 1944, born in [[East Acton]], [[London]])\n*[[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]], (actor, born in [[Walworth]])\n*[[Steve Harley]] (musician, frontman of the band Cockney Rebel, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], musician, face, born in [[Shoreditch]] and lived in [[Hoxton]]\n*[[Lenny McLean]], bare knuckle/unlicensed boxer, actor, born in Hoxton\n*[[Claude Rains]], the actor born in [[Camberwell]] in 1889 became famous after abandoning his heavy cockney accent and developing a unique [[Mid-Atlantic accent]] described as \"half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in\".\n*[[Harry Redknapp]] (former footballer and manager born in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]])\n*[[Tommy Steele]] (1950s pop and film artist, born in [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Kray twins]], criminals, born in [[Hoxton]] and lived in [[Bethnal Green]]\n*[[Barbara Windsor]] actress born in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]]\n*[[Ray Winstone]] (actor, born in [[Homerton]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ray Winstone: Me cockney accent won the role|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/ray-winstone-me-cockney-accent-won-the-role-226465/|work=WhatsonTV|issue=13 November 2016|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]] (comedian from [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Micky Flanagan]] (comedian from [[Whitechapel]])\n*[[Eric Bristow]] (darts champion born in Hackney.

''Like'' and ''light'' can be homophones. \"Clapham\" can be said as ''Cla'am'' (i. e., {{IPA|[\u02c8kl\u0325\u025b\u0294m\u0329]}}).{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|pp=136\u2013137}} {{IPA|/t/}} may also be [[flapping|flapped]] intervocalically, e.g. ''utter'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250\u027e\u0259]}}. London {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are often aspirated in intervocalic and final environments, e.g., ''upper'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250p\u02b0\u0259]}}, ''utter'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250t\u02b0\u0259]}}, ''rocker'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u0252k\u02b0\u0259]}}, ''up'' {{IPA|[\u0250\u0294p\u02b0]}}, ''out'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0259\u032f\u0294t\u02b0]}}, ''rock'' {{IPA|[\u0279\u0252\u0294k\u02b0]}}, where [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] is traditionally described as having the unaspirated variants. Also, in broad cockney at least, the degree of aspiration is typically greater than in RP, and may often also involve some degree of affrication {{IPA|[p\u1db2\u02b0, t\u02e2\u02b0, k\u02e3\u02b0]}}.

These variants are retained when the addition of a suffix turns the dark l [[Alveolar lateral approximant|clear]]. Thus a phonemic split has occurred in London English, exemplified by the minimal pair ''wholly'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0252\u028ali]}} vs. ''holy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u0264\u0308li]}}.

All this reinforces the phonemic nature of the opposition and increases its functional load. It is now well-established in all kinds of London-flavoured accents, from broad cockney to near-RP.{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=312\u2013313}}\n** {{IPA|/\u028a/}} in some words (particularly ''good''){{Sfnp|Mott|2011|p=75}} is central {{IPAblink|\u028a\u0308}}.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}} In other cases, it is near-close near-back {{IPAblink|\u028a}}, as in traditional RP.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}}\n*[[L-vocalisation|Vocalisation of dark L]], hence {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u026aow\u0254\u02d0]}} for [[Millwall]]. The actual realisation of a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is influenced by surrounding vowels and it may be realised as {{IPA|[u]}}, {{IPA|[\u028a]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[\u0264]}}. It is also transcribed as a [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[w]}} by some linguists, e.g., Coggle and Rosewarne.{{Sfnp|Sivertsen|1960|p=132}} However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}, the vocalised dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP {{IPA|[\u026b]}} only by the lack of the alveolar contact.{{Sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=193}} Relatedly, there are many possible vowel neutralisations and absorptions in the context of a following dark L ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}) or its vocalised version; these include:{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=313\u2013317}}\n**In broad cockney, and to some extent in general popular London speech, a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is entirely absorbed by a preceding {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}: e.g., ''salt'' and ''sort'' become homophones (although the contemporary pronunciation of ''salt'' {{IPA|/s\u0252lt/}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/activities/phonological-change/ |title=Phonological change in spoken English |publisher=Bl.uk |date=12 March 2007 |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> would prevent this from happening), and likewise ''fault''-''fought''-''fort'', ''pause''-''Paul's'', ''Morden''-''Malden'', ''water''-''Walter''. Sometimes such pairs are kept apart, in more deliberate speech at least, by a kind of length difference: {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028adn\u0329]}} ''Morden'' vs. {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028a\u02d0dn\u0329]}} ''Malden''.\n**A preceding {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is also fully absorbed into vocalised {{IPA|/l/}}. The reflexes of earlier {{IPA|/\u0259l/}} and earlier {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0(l)/}} are thus phonetically similar or identical; speakers are usually ready to treat them as the same phoneme. Thus ''awful'' can best be regarded as containing two occurrences of the same vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0f\u0254\u02d0/}}. The difference between ''musical'' and ''music-hall'', in an ''H''-dropping broad cockney, is thus nothing more than a matter of stress and perhaps syllable boundaries.\n**With the remaining vowels a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is not absorbed, but remains phonetically present as a back vocoid in such a way that {{IPA|/Vl/}} and {{IPA|/V/}} are kept distinct.\n**The clearest and best-established neutralisations are those of {{IPA|/\u026a~i\u02d0~\u026a\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}}. Thus ''rill'', ''reel'' and ''real'' fall together in cockney as {{IPA|[\u0279\u026a\u0264]}}; while ''full'' and ''fool'' are {{IPA|[fo\u028a~f\u028au]}} and may rhyme with ''cruel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u02b0\u0279\u028au]}}. Before clear (i.e., prevocalic) {{IPA|/l/}} the neutralisations do not usually apply, thus {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ali]}} ''silly'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ail\u026an]}} ''ceiling''-''sealing'', {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028ali]}} ''fully'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028aul\u026an]}} ''fooling''.\n**In some broader types of cockney, the neutralisation of {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}} before non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} may also involve {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, so that ''fall'' becomes homophonous with ''full'' and ''fool'' {{IPA|[f\u0254o]}}.\n**The other pre-{{IPA|/l/}} neutralisation which all investigators agree on is that of {{IPA|/\u00e6~e\u026a~a\u028a/}}. Thus, ''Sal'' and ''sale'' can be merged as {{IPA|[s\u00e6\u0264]}}, ''fail'' and ''fowl'' as {{IPA|[f\u00e6\u0264]}}, and ''Val'', ''vale''-''veil'' and ''vowel'' as {{IPA|[v\u00e6\u0264]}}. The typical pronunciation of ''railway'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u00e6\u028aw\u00e6\u026a]}}.\n**According to Siversten, {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} can also join in this neutralisation. They may on the one hand neutralise with respect to one another, so that ''snarl'' and ''smile'' rhyme, both ending {{IPA|[-\u0251\u0264]}}, and ''Child's Hill'' is in danger of being mistaken for ''Charles Hill''; or they may go further into a fivefold neutralisation with the one just mentioned, so that ''pal'', ''pale'', ''foul'', ''snarl'' and ''pile'' all end in {{IPA|[-\u00e6\u0264]}}. But these developments are evidently restricted to broad cockney, not being found in London speech in general.\n**A neutralisation discussed by Beaken (1971) and Bowyer (1973), but ignored by Siversten (1960), is that of {{IPA|/\u0252~\u0259\u028a~\u028c/}}. It leads to the possibility of ''doll'', ''dole'' and ''dull'' becoming homophonous as {{IPA|[d\u0252\u028a]}} or {{IPA|[da\u0320\u0264]}}. Wells' impression is that the ''doll''-''dole'' neutralisation is rather widespread in London, but that involving ''dull'' less so.\n**One further possible neutralisation in the environment of a following non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} is that of {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, so that ''well'' and ''whirl'' become homophonous as {{IPA|[w\u025b\u028a]}}.\n*Cockney has been occasionally described as replacing {{IPA|/\u0279/}} with {{IPA|/w/}}. For example, ''thwee'' (or ''fwee'') instead of ''three'', ''fwasty'' instead of ''frosty''.

Originally, when London consisted of little more than the [[City of London|City]], the term applied to all Londoners, but as the city grew this was replaced by less universal definitions. A common view is that in order to be a cockney, one must have been born within earshot of Bow Bells, the bells of [[St Mary-le-Bow]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/#/bow-bells/4535373284|title=St Mary-le-Bow|website=www.stmarylebow.co.uk}}</ref> which were cast at the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]]. However, the church of St Mary-le-Bow was destroyed in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London]] and rebuilt by [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. Although the bells were destroyed again in 1941 in [[the Blitz]], they had fallen silent on 13 June 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. Before they were replaced in 1961, there was a period when, by the \"within earshot\" definition, no \"Bow Bell\" cockneys could be born.<ref>J. Swinnerton, ''The London Companion'' (Robson, 2004), p. 21.</ref> The use of such a literal definition produces other problems, since the area around the church is no longer residential and the noise of the area makes it unlikely that many people would now be born within earshot of the bells,{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=11}} Similarly, there were in the past, several hospitals in audible range; but now there is just the [[Royal London Hospital]] in [[Whitechapel]], with home births now uncommon.\n\nThe terms \u201cEast End of London\u201d and \u201cwithin the sound of bow bells\u201d are used interchangeably, and the bells are a symbol of East End identity. However the Bow Bells definition reflects the earlier definition of Cockney as relating to all Londoners (at a time when London barely extended beyond the [[City of London|square mile]]. The use of the term to describe all [[London]]ers generally, however, survived into the 19th century<ref name=\"hott\" /> before becoming restricted to the working class and their particular accent. The term is now used loosely to describe all [[East End of London|East Londoners]], irrespective of their speech.\n\nA study was carried out by the [[City of London|City]] in 2000 to see how far away Bow Bells could be heard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-use/cockney/|title=Cockney - Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> and it was estimated that the bells would have been heard up to six miles to the east, five miles to the north, three miles to the south, and four miles to the west. According to the legend of [[Dick Whittington]] the bells could once be heard from as far away as the Highgate [[Archway, London|Archway]] (4.5 miles north). Based on a definition of the bells audible range, all East Enders are cockneys, but not all cockneys are East Enders; though whereas an East Ender would be likely to proudly claim that entitlement, a resident of west, north or south London would be less likely to. The traditional core districts of the [[East End of London|East End]] are [[Bethnal Green]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Spitalfields]], [[Stepney]], [[Wapping]], [[Limehouse]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Haggerston]], [[Aldgate]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Millwall]], [[Cubitt Town]], [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], [[Hoxton]], [[Bow, London|Bow]] and [[Mile End]]. The area north of the Thames gradually expanded to include [[East Ham]], [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[Leyton]], [[West Ham]] and [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] as more land was built upon.\n\nWriting in 1981, the dialectologist Peter Wright identified the building of the [[Becontree]] estate near [[Dagenham]] in Essex as influential in the spread of cockney dialect. This very large estate was built by the [[Corporation of London]] to house poor residents of London's East End on what was previously a rural area of Essex, and the residents generally kept their native cockney dialect rather than adopt an Essex dialect.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=146}} Wright also reports that cockney dialect spread along the main railway routes to towns in the surrounding counties as early as 1923, and cockney then spread further after World War II as many refugees left London owing to the bombing, but continued to speak cockney in their new homes.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=147}}\n\n== Notable cockneys ==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n<!-- *** ATTENTION*** Please cite entries with a reliable source for a person being explicitly known as, or calling themselves, a Cockney -->\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\n*[[Danny Baker]] (broadcaster, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Michael Caine]] (actor, born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr., 14 March 1933, in [[Rotherhithe]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Screening Room Special: Michael Caine|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/30/caine.october/|agency=CNN|issue=29 October 2007|date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Alfie Bass]] actor from [[Bethnal Green]].\n*[[Charlie Chaplin]] (comic actor, filmmaker, and composer, 16 April 1889, born in [[Walworth, London]])\n*[[Roger Daltrey]] (singer, actor and vocalist of [[The Who]], 1 March 1944, born in [[East Acton]], [[London]])\n*[[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]], (actor, born in [[Walworth]])\n*[[Steve Harley]] (musician, frontman of the band Cockney Rebel, born in [[Deptford]])\n*[[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], musician, face, born in [[Shoreditch]] and lived in [[Hoxton]]\n*[[Lenny McLean]], bare knuckle/unlicensed boxer, actor, born in Hoxton\n*[[Claude Rains]], the actor born in [[Camberwell]] in 1889 became famous after abandoning his heavy cockney accent and developing a unique [[Mid-Atlantic accent]] described as \"half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in\".\n*[[Harry Redknapp]] (former footballer and manager born in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]])\n*[[Tommy Steele]] (1950s pop and film artist, born in [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Kray twins]], criminals, born in [[Hoxton]] and lived in [[Bethnal Green]]\n*[[Barbara Windsor]] actress born in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]]\n*[[Ray Winstone]] (actor, born in [[Homerton]])<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ray Winstone: Me cockney accent won the role|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/ray-winstone-me-cockney-accent-won-the-role-226465/|work=WhatsonTV|issue=13 November 2016|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]] (comedian from [[Bermondsey]])\n*[[Micky Flanagan]] (comedian from [[Whitechapel]])\n*[[Eric Bristow]] (darts champion born in Hackney.

These variants are retained when the addition of a suffix turns the dark l [[Alveolar lateral approximant|clear]]. Thus a phonemic split has occurred in London English, exemplified by the minimal pair ''wholly'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0252\u028ali]}} vs. ''holy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u0264\u0308li]}}. The development of ''L''-vocalisation (see next section) leads to further pairs such as ''sole''-''soul'' {{IPA|[s\u0252\u028a]}} vs. ''so''-''sew'' {{IPA|[s\u0250\u0264\u0308]}}, ''bowl'' {{IPA|[b\u0252\u028a]}} vs. ''Bow'' {{IPA|[b\u0250\u0264\u0308]}}, ''shoulder'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283\u0252\u028ad\u0259]}} vs. ''odour'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0250\u0264\u0308d\u0259]}}, while associated vowel neutralisations may make ''doll'' a homophone of ''dole'', compare ''dough'' {{IPA|[d\u0250\u0264\u0308]}}. All this reinforces the phonemic nature of the opposition and increases its functional load. It is now well-established in all kinds of London-flavoured accents, from broad cockney to near-RP.{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=312\u2013313}}\n** {{IPA|/\u028a/}} in some words (particularly ''good''){{Sfnp|Mott|2011|p=75}} is central {{IPAblink|\u028a\u0308}}.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}} In other cases, it is near-close near-back {{IPAblink|\u028a}}, as in traditional RP.{{Sfnp|Mott|2012|p=75}}\n*[[L-vocalisation|Vocalisation of dark L]], hence {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u026aow\u0254\u02d0]}} for [[Millwall]]. The actual realisation of a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is influenced by surrounding vowels and it may be realised as {{IPA|[u]}}, {{IPA|[\u028a]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[\u0264]}}. It is also transcribed as a [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[w]}} by some linguists, e.g., Coggle and Rosewarne.{{Sfnp|Sivertsen|1960|p=132}} However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}, the vocalised dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP {{IPA|[\u026b]}} only by the lack of the alveolar contact.{{Sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=193}} Relatedly, there are many possible vowel neutralisations and absorptions in the context of a following dark L ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}) or its vocalised version; these include:{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=313\u2013317}}\n**In broad cockney, and to some extent in general popular London speech, a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is entirely absorbed by a preceding {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}: e.g., ''salt'' and ''sort'' become homophones (although the contemporary pronunciation of ''salt'' {{IPA|/s\u0252lt/}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/activities/phonological-change/ |title=Phonological change in spoken English |publisher=Bl.uk |date=12 March 2007 |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> would prevent this from happening), and likewise ''fault''-''fought''-''fort'', ''pause''-''Paul's'', ''Morden''-''Malden'', ''water''-''Walter''. Sometimes such pairs are kept apart, in more deliberate speech at least, by a kind of length difference: {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028adn\u0329]}} ''Morden'' vs. {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254\u028a\u02d0dn\u0329]}} ''Malden''.\n**A preceding {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is also fully absorbed into vocalised {{IPA|/l/}}. The reflexes of earlier {{IPA|/\u0259l/}} and earlier {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0(l)/}} are thus phonetically similar or identical; speakers are usually ready to treat them as the same phoneme. Thus ''awful'' can best be regarded as containing two occurrences of the same vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0f\u0254\u02d0/}}. The difference between ''musical'' and ''music-hall'', in an ''H''-dropping broad cockney, is thus nothing more than a matter of stress and perhaps syllable boundaries.\n**With the remaining vowels a vocalised {{IPA|/l/}} is not absorbed, but remains phonetically present as a back vocoid in such a way that {{IPA|/Vl/}} and {{IPA|/V/}} are kept distinct.\n**The clearest and best-established neutralisations are those of {{IPA|/\u026a~i\u02d0~\u026a\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}}. Thus ''rill'', ''reel'' and ''real'' fall together in cockney as {{IPA|[\u0279\u026a\u0264]}}; while ''full'' and ''fool'' are {{IPA|[fo\u028a~f\u028au]}} and may rhyme with ''cruel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u02b0\u0279\u028au]}}. Before clear (i.e., prevocalic) {{IPA|/l/}} the neutralisations do not usually apply, thus {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ali]}} ''silly'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u026ail\u026an]}} ''ceiling''-''sealing'', {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028ali]}} ''fully'' but {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028aul\u026an]}} ''fooling''.\n**In some broader types of cockney, the neutralisation of {{IPA|/\u028a~u\u02d0~\u028a\u0259/}} before non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} may also involve {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, so that ''fall'' becomes homophonous with ''full'' and ''fool'' {{IPA|[f\u0254o]}}.\n**The other pre-{{IPA|/l/}} neutralisation which all investigators agree on is that of {{IPA|/\u00e6~e\u026a~a\u028a/}}. Thus, ''Sal'' and ''sale'' can be merged as {{IPA|[s\u00e6\u0264]}}, ''fail'' and ''fowl'' as {{IPA|[f\u00e6\u0264]}}, and ''Val'', ''vale''-''veil'' and ''vowel'' as {{IPA|[v\u00e6\u0264]}}. The typical pronunciation of ''railway'' is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u00e6\u028aw\u00e6\u026a]}}.\n**According to Siversten, {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} can also join in this neutralisation. They may on the one hand neutralise with respect to one another, so that ''snarl'' and ''smile'' rhyme, both ending {{IPA|[-\u0251\u0264]}}, and ''Child's Hill'' is in danger of being mistaken for ''Charles Hill''; or they may go further into a fivefold neutralisation with the one just mentioned, so that ''pal'', ''pale'', ''foul'', ''snarl'' and ''pile'' all end in {{IPA|[-\u00e6\u0264]}}. But these developments are evidently restricted to broad cockney, not being found in London speech in general.\n**A neutralisation discussed by Beaken (1971) and Bowyer (1973), but ignored by Siversten (1960), is that of {{IPA|/\u0252~\u0259\u028a~\u028c/}}. It leads to the possibility of ''doll'', ''dole'' and ''dull'' becoming homophonous as {{IPA|[d\u0252\u028a]}} or {{IPA|[da\u0320\u0264]}}. Wells' impression is that the ''doll''-''dole'' neutralisation is rather widespread in London, but that involving ''dull'' less so.\n**One further possible neutralisation in the environment of a following non-prevocalic {{IPA|/l/}} is that of {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, so that ''well'' and ''whirl'' become homophonous as {{IPA|[w\u025b\u028a]}}.\n*Cockney has been occasionally described as replacing {{IPA|/\u0279/}} with {{IPA|/w/}}. For example, ''thwee'' (or ''fwee'') instead of ''three'', ''fwasty'' instead of ''frosty''. Peter Wright, a [[Survey of English Dialects]] fieldworker, concluded that this was not a universal feature of cockneys but that it was more common to hear this in the London area than anywhere else in Britain.{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=135}} This description may also be a result of mishearing the [[R-labialisation|labiodental R]] as {{IPA|/w/}}, when it is still a distinct phoneme in cockney.\n*An unstressed final ''-ow'' may be pronounced {{IPAblink|\u0259}}. In broad cockney this can be lowered to {{IPAblink|\u0250}}.<ref name=\"ic.arizona.edu\" />{{Sfnp|Wells|1982|p=305}} This is common to most traditional, Southern English dialects except for those in the [[West Country]].{{Sfnp|Wright|1981|p=134}}\n*Grammatical features:<ref name=\"bucknell\" />\n**Use of ''me'' instead of ''my'', for example, \"At's me book you got 'ere\".

For example, in 1909 the Conference on the Teaching of English in London Elementary Schools issued by the [[London County Council]], stating that \"the Cockney mode of speech, with its unpleasant twang, is a modern corruption without legitimate credentials, and is unworthy of being the speech of any person in the capital city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]\".<ref name=\"Attitudes towards Cockney\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.humnet.unipi.it/slifo/articolosantipolo.pdf |title=5 |date= |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> Others defended the language variety: \"The London dialect is really, especially on the South side of the Thames, a perfectly legitimate and responsible child of the old kentish tongue [...] the dialect of London North of the Thames has been shown to be one of the many varieties of the Midland or Mercian dialect, flavoured by the East Anglian variety of the same speech\".<ref name=\"Attitudes towards Cockney\" /> Since then, the cockney accent has been more accepted as an alternative form of the English language rather than an inferior one. In the 1950s, the only accent to be heard on the [[BBC]] (except in entertainment programmes such as ''[[The Sooty Show]]'') was [[Received Pronunciation|RP]], whereas nowadays many different accents, including cockney or accents heavily influenced by it, can be heard on the BBC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/yourvoice/rpandbbc3.shtml#A |title=BBC English |publisher=BBC English |date= |access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> In a survey of 2,000 people conducted by [[Coolbrands]] in the autumn of 2008, cockney was voted equal fourth [[coolest]] accent in Britain with 7% of the votes, while [[Received Pronunciation|The Queen's English]] was considered the coolest, with 20% of the votes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3073282/Brummie-accent-voted-least-cool-in-Britain.html|title=RP still most popular accent |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date = September 2008|access-date=18 March 2009 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Irvine}}</ref> [[Brummie]] was voted least popular, receiving just 2%.

In many societies, children as young as 13 are seen as adults and engage in the same activities as adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe work of children was important in pre-industrial societies, as children needed to provide their labour for their survival and that of their group. Pre-industrial societies were characterised by low productivity and short life expectancy; preventing children from participating in productive work would be more harmful to their welfare and that of their group in the long run. In pre-industrial societies, there was little need for children to attend school. This is especially the case in non-literate societies. Most pre-industrial skill and knowledge were amenable to being passed down through direct mentoring or apprenticing by competent adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mill Children in Macon 2.jpg|Child labourers, [[Macon, Georgia]], 1909\nFile:Child Labor in New Jersey United States 1923.jpg|Children working in home-based assembly operations in United States (1923).\nFile:Abolish child slavery.jpg|Two girls protesting child labour (by calling it child slavery) in the 1909 New York City [[Labor Day]] parade.\nFile:Arthur Rothstein (American, 1915-1985).

Industrial cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool rapidly grew from small villages into large cities and improving [[child mortality]] rates.

The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 [[Factory Acts]] were passed to regulate the working hours of [[workhouse]] children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the \"Short Time Committees\" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11\u201318 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9\u201311 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to [[Factories Act 1847|another act in 1847]] limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAs technology improved and proliferated, there was a greater need for educated employees.

Improved technology and automation also made child labour redundant.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Early 20th century===\n\nIn the early 20th century, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries. [[Glass production|Glass making]] was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133&nbsp;\u00b0F). When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cuts, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00&nbsp;pm to 3:00&nbsp;am.

Less than 3% of child labour aged 5\u201314 across the world work outside their household, or away from their parents.<ref name=\"ep05\" />\n\nChild labour accounts for 22% of the workforce in Asia, 32% in Africa, 17% in Latin America, 1% in the US, Canada, Europe and other wealthy nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/237384/toolkitfr/pdf/facts.pdf|title=Server Error|website=info.worldbank.org}}</ref> The proportion of child labourers varies greatly among countries and even regions inside those countries. Africa has the highest percentage of children aged 5\u201317 employed as child labour, and a total of over 65 million. Asia, with its larger population, has the largest number of children employed as child labour at about 114 million. Latin America and the Caribbean region have lower overall population density, but at 14 million child labourers has high incidence rates too.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tackling child labour: From commitment to action|work=[[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] |publisher= ILO|year=2012|isbn=978-92-2-126374-6|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_181875/lang--en/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tyre shop worker1.jpg|thumb|left|A boy repairing a tire in [[Gambia]].]]\nAccurate present day child labour information is difficult to obtain because of disagreements between data sources as to what constitutes child labour.

While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, size of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author1=Christiaan Grootaert |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0312221225}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills|last=Galbi|first=Douglas|journal=Journal of Population Economics|year=1997|volume=10|issue=4|pages= 357\u2013375|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.pdf|doi=10.1007/s001480050048|pmid=12293082}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Brown, D.

According to ILO [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|minimum age convention (C138)]] of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12\u201314, and hazardous work done by children aged 15\u201317. Light work was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 171 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312283|title=International Labour Organisation|date=April 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n\n\nThe United Nations adopted the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in 1990, which was subsequently ratified by 193 countries.<ref name=untreaty>United Nations Treaty Collection.

This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of [[international labour standards]] implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.\n\nIn addition to setting the international law, the United Nations initiated International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC)|publisher=International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/lang--en/index.htm}}</ref> This initiative aims to progressively eliminate child labour through strengthening national capacities to address some of the causes of child labour. Amongst the key initiative is the so-called time-bounded programme countries, where child labour is most prevalent and schooling opportunities lacking. The initiative seeks to achieve amongst other things, universal primary school availability. The IPEC has expanded to at least the following target countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, [[Child labour in Nepal|Nepal]], Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Turkey.\n\nTargeted child labour campaigns were initiated by the [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) in order to advocate for prevention and elimination of all forms of child labour. The global Music against Child Labour Initiative was launched in 2013 in order to involve socially excluded children in structured musical activity and education in efforts to help protect them from child labour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Against Child Labour Initiative|publisher= IPEC, International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=2013|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/MusicInitiative/lang--en/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Exceptions granted===\n[[File:Amish - On the way to school by Gadjoboy-crop.jpg|thumb|right|The United States has passed a law that allows Amish children older than 14 to work in traditional wood enterprises with proper supervision.]]\n\nIn 2004, the United States passed an amendment to the Fair Labour Standards Act of 1938.

Children above the age of 13 <!--  -->may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country.

Child labour, claim these activists, also leads to poor labour standards for adults, depresses the wages of adults in developing countries as well as the developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work in poor countries, the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less, everywhere in the world.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is Child Labour Inefficient?|author=Jean\u2010Marie Baland and James A.

According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author1=Christiaan Grootaert |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|pages=8\u201354|isbn=978-0312221225}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Economics of Consumer Actions against Products with Child Labour Content|last=Edmonds|first=Eric|date=May 2007|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~eedmonds/clwa.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Child labour Nepal.jpg|thumb|[[Nepal]]i girls working in brick factory.]]\n\nThese scholars suggest, from their studies of economic and social data, that early 20th-century child labour in Europe and the United States ended in large part as a result of the economic development of the formal regulated economy, technology development and general prosperity. Child labour laws and ILO conventions came later. Edmonds suggests, even in contemporary times, the incidence of child labour in Vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and GDP growth.

William Cooke Tatlor wrote at the time about these reformers who, witnessing children at work in the factories, thought to themselves: 'How much more delightful would have been the gambol of the free limbs on the hillside; the sight of the green mead with its spangles of buttercups and daisies; the song of the bird and the humming bee...'\nBut for many of these children the factory system meant quite literally the only chance for survival. Today we overlook the fact that death from starvation and exposure was a common fate before the Industrial Revolution, for the pre-capitalist economy was barely able to support the population. Yes, children were working. Formerly they would have starved. It was only as goods were produced in greater abundance at a lower cost that men could support their families without sending their children to work. It was not the reformer or the politician that ended the grim necessity for child labour; it was capitalism.}}\n\n==Incidents==\n\n===Cocoa production===\n{{main|Children in cocoa production|Harkin-Engel Protocol}}\nIn 1998, [[UNICEF]] reported that [[Ivory Coast]] farmers used enslaved children \u2013 many from surrounding countries.<ref name=\"Raghavan1\">{{cite news |author1=Sudarsan Raghavan |author2=Sumana Chatterjee |title= Slaves feed world's taste for chocolate: Captives common in cocoa farms of Africa |newspaper= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date= 24 June 2001 |url= http://www2.jsonline.com/news/nat/jun01/slave24r062301.asp |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060917014323/http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kbranson/stopchocolateslavery/atasteofslavery.html| archivedate = 17 September 2006 |accessdate= 25 April 2012}}</ref> In late 2000 a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production of [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]]\u2014the main ingredient in [[chocolate]]<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2012/04/12/3475859.htm |title= Cocoa shortage to push up chocolate price |last= Bentley |first= Prue |publisher= ABC Ballarat |date= 12 April 2012 |accessdate= 28 April 2012}}</ref>\u2014 in [[West Africa]].<ref name=\"combating\">{{cite web |authorlink= International Labour Organization |title = Combating Child Labour in Cocoa Growing |publisher = [[International Labour Organization]] |year= 2005 |url= http://www.ilo.org/public//english//standards/ipec/themes/cocoa/download/2005_02_cl_cocoa.pdf |accessdate= 26 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=i2WeACR-WIYC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=bbc+documentary+children+chocolate+2000#v=onepage&q=bbc%20documentary%20children%20chocolate%202000&f=false |page= 98 |title= Naked Chocolate: The Astonishing Truth about the World's Greatest Food |authors= David Wolfe and Shazzie |publisher= North Atlantic Books |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-1556437311 |accessdate = 15 December 2011}}</ref> Other media followed by reporting widespread [[child slavery]] and [[Trafficking of children|child trafficking]] in the production of cocoa.<ref name=\"Raghavan1\" /><ref name=\"chocolate slavery\">{{cite news |last= Hawksley |first= Humphrey |authorlink = Humphrey Hawksley |title= Mali's children in chocolate slavery |work= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1272522.stm |date= 12 April 2001 |accessdate= 2 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"accuses companies\">{{cite news |last= Hawksley |first= Humphrey |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1311982.stm |title= Ivory Coast accuses chocolate companies |work= BBC News |date= 4 May 2001 |accessdate= 4 August 2010}}</ref> In 2001, the [[US State Department]] estimated there were 15,000 child slaves cocoa, cotton and coffee farms in the Ivory Coast,<ref name=\"commondreams.org\">{{cite news|last=Chatterjee |first=Sumana |title=Chocolate Firms Launch Fight Against 'Slave Free' Labels |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=1 August 2001 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0801-03.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308050847/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0801-03.htm |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}</ref> and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association acknowledged that child [[slave]]ry is used in the cocoa harvest.<ref name=\"commondreams.org\"/>{{failed verification|date=July 2012}}{{better source|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Mali]]an migrants have long worked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast, but in 2000 cocoa prices had dropped to a 10-year low and some farmers stopped paying their employees.<ref name=\"Blunt\"/> The Malian counsel had to rescue some boys who had not been paid for five years and who were beaten if they tried to run away.<ref name=\"Blunt\">{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/946952.stm |title= The bitter taste of slavery |date= 28 September 2000 |last= Blunt |first= Liz |publisher = BBC |accessdate = 15 December 2011}}</ref> Malian officials believed that 15,000 children, some as young as 11 years old, were working in the Ivory Coast in 2001.

It is informal sector of the economy. Human Rights Watch group estimates that about 12 percent of global gold production comes from artisanal mines. In west Africa, in countries such as [[Mali]] - the third largest exporter of gold in Africa - between 20,000 and 40,000 children work in artisanal mining. Locally known as ''orpaillage'', children as young as 6 years old work with their families. These children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including [[Mercury poisoning|mercury]], and do hazardous work such as digging shafts and working underground, pulling up, carrying and crushing the ore. The poor work practices harm the long-term health of children, as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers, ground water and lakes. Gold is important to the economy of Mali and Ghana. For Mali, it is the second largest earner of its export revenue.

However, others have raised concerns that [[boycott]]ing products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a [[UNICEF]] study found that after the [[Child Labor Deterrence Act|Child Labour Deterrence Act]] was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in [[Bangladesh]], leaving many to resort to jobs such as \"stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution\", jobs that are \"more hazardous and exploitative than garment production\". The study suggests that boycotts are \"blunt instruments with long-term consequences, that can actually harm rather than help the children involved.\"<ref name=\"unicef\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Milton Friedman]], before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture.<ref name=\"Schultz2010\">\"Some authors such as conservative Nobel economist Milton Friedman claim that child labour actually decreased during the industrial revolution.

In many societies, children as young as 13 are seen as adults and engage in the same activities as adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe work of children was important in pre-industrial societies, as children needed to provide their labour for their survival and that of their group. Pre-industrial societies were characterised by low productivity and short life expectancy; preventing children from participating in productive work would be more harmful to their welfare and that of their group in the long run. In pre-industrial societies, there was little need for children to attend school. This is especially the case in non-literate societies. Most pre-industrial skill and knowledge were amenable to being passed down through direct mentoring or apprenticing by competent adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mill Children in Macon 2.jpg|Child labourers, [[Macon, Georgia]], 1909\nFile:Child Labor in New Jersey United States 1923.jpg|Children working in home-based assembly operations in United States (1923).\nFile:Abolish child slavery.jpg|Two girls protesting child labour (by calling it child slavery) in the 1909 New York City [[Labor Day]] parade.\nFile:Arthur Rothstein (American, 1915-1985).

Industrial cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool rapidly grew from small villages into large cities and improving [[child mortality]] rates.

The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 [[Factory Acts]] were passed to regulate the working hours of [[workhouse]] children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the \"Short Time Committees\" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11\u201318 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9\u201311 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to [[Factories Act 1847|another act in 1847]] limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAs technology improved and proliferated, there was a greater need for educated employees. This saw an increase in schooling, with the eventual introduction of [[compulsory schooling]]. Improved technology and automation also made child labour redundant.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Early 20th century===\n\nIn the early 20th century, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries. [[Glass production|Glass making]] was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133&nbsp;\u00b0F). When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cuts, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00&nbsp;pm to 3:00&nbsp;am.

In France, over 58% of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5\u201314 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common.

If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution.

Today we overlook the fact that death from starvation and exposure was a common fate before the Industrial Revolution, for the pre-capitalist economy was barely able to support the population. Yes, children were working. Formerly they would have starved.

He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], before securing a place in the first team by the 2000\u201301 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002\u201303 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for ''the Hammers'', and in 2004, he moved to rival London club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee believed to be [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3.5&nbsp;million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for \u00a318&nbsp;million.\n\nFrom his debut onwards, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307]], their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008 Champions League final]], playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the [[Double (association football)#European Doubles|European Double]].

He served as the first chancellor of the [[University of Warwick]] from its foundation in 1965 to 1977.\n\n==Background, education and early career==\nRadcliffe was born in [[Llanychan]], [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]], Wales, the son of an army captain. His maternal grandfather was [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]] between 1890 and 1891.\n\nRadcliffe was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury College]]. He was then conscripted in [[World War I]] but his poor eyesight limited the options for service so he was allocated to the [[Labour Corps (United Kingdom)|Labour Corps]]. After the War, he attended [[New College, Oxford]] as a scholar, and took a first in [[Literae Humaniores|''literae humaniores'']] in 1921. In 1922 he was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He won the [[Eldon Law Scholarship]] in 1923.\n\nHe was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by the [[Inner Temple]] in 1924, and joined the chambers of [[Wilfred Greene, 1st Baron Greene|Wilfred Greene]], later the [[Master of the Rolls]]. He practised at the Chancery bar, and was appointed a [[King's counsel|King's Counsel]] in 1935.\n\nDuring World War II, Radcliffe joined the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] becoming its [[Director-General]] by 1941, where he worked closely with the Minister [[Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken|Brendan Bracken]]. In 1944 he was made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (KBE). He returned to the bar in 1945.\n\n==Indian Boundary Committees==\n{{Main|Radcliffe Line}}\n\nRadcliffe, a man who had never been east of Paris,<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZS40U5yFpc|title=Partition: The Day India Burned|date=2007-08-14|last=|first=|type=Television production|language=|publisher=BBC}}</ref> was given the chairmanship of the two boundary committees set up with the passing of the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian Independence Act]].  He was faced with the daunting task of drawing the borders for the new nations of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] in a way that would leave as many Hindus and Sikhs in India and Muslims in Pakistan as possible. Radcliffe submitted his partition map on 9 August 1947, which split [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] almost in half. The new boundaries were formally announced on 14 August 1947 \u2014 the day of Pakistan's independence and the day before India became independent of the United Kingdom.\n\nRadcliffe's efforts saw some 14 million people \u2014 roughly seven million from each side \u2014 flee across the border when they discovered the new boundaries left them in the \"wrong\" country. In the violence that ensued after independence, estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition vary between several hundred thousand and two million{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|\"The death toll remains disputed with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million.\"{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}}, and millions more were injured. After seeing the mayhem occurring on both sides of the boundary, Radcliffe refused his salary of 40,000 rupees (then 3,000 pounds). He was made a [[Knight Grand Cross of The Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1948.\n\nThe poet [[W. H. Auden]] referred to Radcliffe's role in the partition of India and Pakistan in his 1966 poem \"Partition\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Collected Poems|last=Auden|first=W.

In the 1940s and 1950s he chaired a string of public enquiries in addition to his legal duties and continued to hold numerous trusteeships, governorships and chairmanships right up until his death. He chaired the Committee of Enquiry into the Future of the [[British Film Institute]] (1948), whose recommendations led to the modernisation of the BFI in the post-war period. From 1957 he was chairman of the Radcliffe Committee, called to enquire into the working of the monetary and credit system. The committee published a report known as the [[Radcliffe report]] which suggested reforms on how [[monetary policy]] is run. He was also a frequent public speaker and wrote numerous books: he gave the [[BBC]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/reithlectures Reith Lecture] in 1951 - a series of seven broadcasts titled [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lwd Power and the State] which examined the features of democratic society, and considered the problematic notions of power and authority.

He served as the first chancellor of the [[University of Warwick]] from its foundation in 1965 to 1977.\n\n==Background, education and early career==\nRadcliffe was born in [[Llanychan]], [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]], Wales, the son of an army captain. His maternal grandfather was [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]] between 1890 and 1891.\n\nRadcliffe was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury College]]. He was then conscripted in [[World War I]] but his poor eyesight limited the options for service so he was allocated to the [[Labour Corps (United Kingdom)|Labour Corps]]. After the War, he attended [[New College, Oxford]] as a scholar, and took a first in [[Literae Humaniores|''literae humaniores'']] in 1921. In 1922 he was elected to a prize fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He won the [[Eldon Law Scholarship]] in 1923.\n\nHe was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by the [[Inner Temple]] in 1924, and joined the chambers of [[Wilfred Greene, 1st Baron Greene|Wilfred Greene]], later the [[Master of the Rolls]]. He practised at the Chancery bar, and was appointed a [[King's counsel|King's Counsel]] in 1935.\n\nDuring World War II, Radcliffe joined the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] becoming its [[Director-General]] by 1941, where he worked closely with the Minister [[Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken|Brendan Bracken]]. In 1944 he was made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (KBE). He returned to the bar in 1945.\n\n==Indian Boundary Committees==\n{{Main|Radcliffe Line}}\n\nRadcliffe, a man who had never been east of Paris,<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZS40U5yFpc|title=Partition: The Day India Burned|date=2007-08-14|last=|first=|type=Television production|language=|publisher=BBC}}</ref> was given the chairmanship of the two boundary committees set up with the passing of the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian Independence Act]].  He was faced with the daunting task of drawing the borders for the new nations of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] in a way that would leave as many Hindus and Sikhs in India and Muslims in Pakistan as possible. Radcliffe submitted his partition map on 9 August 1947, which split [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] almost in half. The new boundaries were formally announced on 14 August 1947 \u2014 the day of Pakistan's independence and the day before India became independent of the United Kingdom.\n\nRadcliffe's efforts saw some 14 million people \u2014 roughly seven million from each side \u2014 flee across the border when they discovered the new boundaries left them in the \"wrong\" country. In the violence that ensued after independence, estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition vary between several hundred thousand and two million{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}{{efn|\"The death toll remains disputed with figures ranging from 200,000 to 2 million.\"{{sfn|Talbot|Singh|2009|p=2}}}}, and millions more were injured. After seeing the mayhem occurring on both sides of the boundary, Radcliffe refused his salary of 40,000 rupees (then 3,000 pounds). He was made a [[Knight Grand Cross of The Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1948.\n\nThe poet [[W. H. Auden]] referred to Radcliffe's role in the partition of India and Pakistan in his 1966 poem \"Partition\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Collected Poems|last=Auden|first=W. H.|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=604|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1949, Radcliffe was made a [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Lord of Appeal in Ordinary]], sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], and created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Radcliffe''', of [[Werneth, Greater Manchester|Werneth]] in the County of Lancaster.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38627 |date=3 June 1949 |page=2748 }}</ref> Unusually, he had not previously been a judge. In the 1940s and 1950s he chaired a string of public enquiries in addition to his legal duties and continued to hold numerous trusteeships, governorships and chairmanships right up until his death. He chaired the Committee of Enquiry into the Future of the [[British Film Institute]] (1948), whose recommendations led to the modernisation of the BFI in the post-war period. From 1957 he was chairman of the Radcliffe Committee, called to enquire into the working of the monetary and credit system. The committee published a report known as the [[Radcliffe report]] which suggested reforms on how [[monetary policy]] is run. He was also a frequent public speaker and wrote numerous books: he gave the [[BBC]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/reithlectures Reith Lecture] in 1951 - a series of seven broadcasts titled [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lwd Power and the State] which examined the features of democratic society, and considered the problematic notions of power and authority. He also presented the [[Oxford University]] [[Romanes Lectures|Romanes Lecture]] in 1963 on [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]].<ref name=\"romanes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/public_affairs/about_us/events_office/lectures_and_seminars/romanes_lectures.html |title=Romanes Lectures since 1892 |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> In 1962 he was made a [[hereditary peer]] as '''Viscount Radcliffe''', of Hampton Lucy in the County of Warwick.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=42729 |date=13 July 1962 |page=5563}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nLord Radcliffe married Antonia Mary Roby, daughter of [[Godfrey Benson, 1st Baron Charnwood]] and former wife of John Tennant, in 1939.
