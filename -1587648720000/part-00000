[[Bhayandar]] is divided into two parts by the Mumbai suburban rail line - East and West. [[Mira Road]] has seen development only in the East part, while the West part, on the other side of the railway line is covered with salt pans and mangroves. Mira Road East is a predominantly residential area. Its calm, quiet surroundings and low pollution make it a desirable residential oasis.\n\nBhayandar West was traditionally residential, and the East predominantly an industrial area in the field of steel utensils manufacturing. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighbouring Mira Road on the East side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. Government-owned Salt Pans and marshland in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a large industrial complex.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nAmong minority languages, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] is spoken by 8.13% of the population and [[Hindi]] by 23.90%.<ref>{{cite web|title=51st REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR LINGUISTIC MINORITIES IN INDIA|url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|website=nclm.nic.in|publisher=[[Ministry of Minority Affairs]]|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=15 February 2018|page=151|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025959/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061031153222/http://thane.nic.in/htmldocs/history.htm Ancient History of Thane]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190126050559/https://mbmc.gov.in/ Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation official site].\n{{Mumbai metropolitan area}}\n{{Maharashtra}}\n\nhttps://mystylestore91.business.site/ Mira-Bhayandar Mystylestore91 official site].\n\n\n[[Category:Mira-Bhayandar]]\n[[Category:Cities in Maharashtra]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Mira-Bhayandar (Mira-Bhaindar)\n| settlement_type                 = Suburb\n| image_skyline                   = File:Tower blocks in Mira Road.jpg\n| image_alt                       = \n| image_caption                   = High-rise residential apartments in Mira Road (East)\n| pushpin_map                     = India Mumbai#India Maharashtra#India\n| pushpin_label_position          = \n| pushpin_map_alt                 = \n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location in Maharashtra, India\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|19.29|N|72.85|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|India}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[Maharashtra]]\n| subdivision_type2               = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name2               = [[Thane district|Thane]]\n| established_title               = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date                = \n| founder                         = \n| named_for                       = \n| government_type                 = \n| governing_body                  = \n| leader_title                    = [[Mayor]]\n| leader_name                     = Jyotsana Hasnale\n| leader_title2                   = [[Deputy Mayor]]\n| leader_name2                    = Hasmukh Gehlot\n| unit_pref                       = Metric\n| area_footnotes                  = \n| area_rank                       = \n| area_total_km2                  = 79.4\n| elevation_footnotes             = \n| elevation_m                     = \n| population_total                = 814655\n| population_as_of                = 2011\n| population_rank                 = \n| population_density_km2          = auto\n| population_demonym              = \n| population_footnotes            = \n| demographics_type1              = Language\n| demographics1_title1            = Official\n| demographics1_info1             = [[Marathi  language|Marathi]]\n| timezone1                       = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1                     = +5:30\n| postal_code_type                = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code                     = 401107- For [[Mira Road]] & 401101- For [[Bhayandar]](W) & 401105- For [[Bhayandar]](E)\n| area_code_type                  = Telephone code\n| area_code                       = 022\n| registration_plate              = MH-04\n| blank1_name_sec1                = [[Human sex ratio|Sex ratio]]\n| blank1_info_sec1                = 1.22:1 [[male|\u2642]]/[[female|\u2640]]\n| website                         = {{URL|www.mbmc.gov.in}}\n| footnotes                       = \n}}\n\n'''Mira-Bhayandar''' which also abbreviated as ''''Mira-Bhaindar'''' is a municipality in the [[Thane district]] in the state of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] located in the northern part of [[Salsette Island]], and shares a border with North Mumbai.

It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].\n\nLike all railway stations on Mumbai suburban railway, Bhayandar is divided into two parts by the rail line: East and West. The West was traditionally residential, and the East was predominantly an industrial area. Another distinct distribution between East and West Bhayandar is the food. East will provide you a huge range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes whereas West region offers predominantly vegetarian food. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb.

There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a gargantuan industrial complex.\n\nThe east Indian villages in Bhayandar are Murdha, Rai,Morva, Dongri, Uttan, Pali Chowk, Tarodi, etc. They were formed by Portuguese travelers when [[Vasai]] (formerly Bassein) was a famous port.

[[Gorai]] is popular for its beach and nearby Manori beach and is a popular weekend getaway for Bhayandar residents. It also is a great place for meditators who visit the Pagoda. In the 1970s Bhayandar was a village before the builders converted the fertile farming land into a concrete jungle.\n\nThe MBMC's (Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation) main office is in Bhayandar (West). Departments like Property Tax, Octroi, Transportation, Health, Ambulance for Emergency, Library, Water, Education, Birth-Death Registration, Tree, Advertising Fee, Animals, Public Construction, City Development, Accounts, etc. are a part of the MBMC's suite.\n\nThe recent success of real estate in Mumbai has helped Bhayandar become one of the populated stations on the Western railway circuit.

It is in the north of Mumbai City and is governed by the [[Mira-Bhayandar]] Municipal Corporation (MBMC).It was once Asia's largest steel utensils manufacturer. It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].The city is Just 5.6 KM away from [[Ghodbunder Fort]] and port which was once major port of India for Arabian Horse Imports. The city is the major Tourist gateway for [[Global Vipassana Pagoda]] which is 14.8 Km south of the city and to Essle world and Water Kingdom[https://www.esselworld.in/] which is Asia's Biggest Amusement Park.The city has a plenty of Hotels and Temples.The city has a majority of Population of Hindus followed by Jain's and the Muslims.The city also has 2 public Library and well designed Study Hubs.Bhayander is well connected to rest of Mumbai by railways ([[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]) and Roadways.The current Mayor of Bhayander is [[Geeta Bharat Jain]].\n\nIt is in the north of Mumbai City 8 km away and is governed by the [[Mira-Bhayandar]] Municipal Corporation (MBMC). It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].\n\nLike all railway stations on Mumbai suburban railway, Bhayandar is divided into two parts by the rail line: East and West. The West was traditionally residential, and the East was predominantly an industrial area. Another distinct distribution between East and West Bhayandar is the food. East will provide you a huge range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes whereas West region offers predominantly vegetarian food. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. Government-owned [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] and [[marshland]] in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a gargantuan industrial complex.\n\nThe east Indian villages in Bhayandar are Murdha, Rai,Morva, Dongri, Uttan, Pali Chowk, Tarodi, etc. They were formed by Portuguese travelers when [[Vasai]] (formerly Bassein) was a famous port. One route for \"Essel World\" is via Gorai, one of the villages close to Bhayandar. [[Gorai]] is popular for its beach and nearby Manori beach and is a popular weekend getaway for Bhayandar residents. It also is a great place for meditators who visit the Pagoda. In the 1970s Bhayandar was a village before the builders converted the fertile farming land into a concrete jungle.\n\nThe MBMC's (Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation) main office is in Bhayandar (West). Departments like Property Tax, Octroi, Transportation, Health, Ambulance for Emergency, Library, Water, Education, Birth-Death Registration, Tree, Advertising Fee, Animals, Public Construction, City Development, Accounts, etc. are a part of the MBMC's suite.\n\nThe recent success of real estate in Mumbai has helped Bhayandar become one of the populated stations on the Western railway circuit. There are trains starting and ending at this station; this shows the growth of Bhayandar in the last decade. Nowadays Mira Bhayandar Municipal Transport (MBMT) bus service are provided which runs in the Mira - Bhayandar city. Mahanagar Gas (MGL) pipeline service is available. Tata Power, as well as Adani Energy, has 24-hour electric supply. Multiplex and hyper market called Maxus Mall which includes a six-screen multiplex and [[Big Bazaar]]. D-Mart and Sahakari Bhandar have made a mark in the city. Bhayandar has witnessed hike in property rates in a short time and have shown that Bhayandar is coming up as an important destination. The famous residential landmarks are Chandan Park, Jesal Park, Sarvoday Paradise, Golden Nest, Indralok in the East side.one of best marketing agency in Mira bhayander area is illustrake located at navghar area\n\nThere are many hotels in Bhayandar. One of the best is the Veg Sagar near flyover end, Bhayandar west. There are many playing grounds for children such as Netaji SubhashChandra Bose Ground, Agarwal and Maxus cricket ground and morva bhati ground.\n\nMost recent development has been noticed with regards to hospitals having world class facilities for all.One of them being MIrabhayandar Institute for Reproductive Assistance (MIRA) providing fertility clinic and total woman care.\n\n==Mira Bhayander Sports Complex==\nFirst-ever sports complex in Mira Bhayander which gives sports enthusiasts a great platform to the participants to show their talent and chase their passion of sports with the help of professional coaches and live their dreams.\n==Schools==\n[[File:Bhayandar stationboard.jpg|alt=Bhayander Railway station - one of the busiest railway station in Western Suburban Railways.|thumb|Bhayandar Railway Station]]\n\n*ST.Xavier's High school (SSC)\n*Mother Mary English High School (SSC)\n*RBK International School (IGCSE)\n*Our Lady Of Nazareth High school and Jr. College (SSC)\n*Sardar Vallabhai Patel vidyalaya (SSC)\n*St. Francis High School\n*RBK Global School (CBSE) \n*Mother Teresa High school\n*D'silva High School (SSC)\n*St. Soldier Public School\n*St  Aloysius English  High School\n*Tapovan Vidhyalay CBSE School\n*S.L.
