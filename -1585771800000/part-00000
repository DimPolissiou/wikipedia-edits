Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals, hymns and early gospel songs as part of their repertoire. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black [[gospel music]]. Prior to [[World War II]], American churches, black and white, regarded jazz and blues with suspicion or outright hostility as \"the devil's music.\" It was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings and/or as religious expression. Since the 1950's, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowes |first1=Malcolm |title=Jazz in the chapel |journal=Music Journal |date=11 January 1966 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=45 |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nFew music historians or musicologists have written about sacred jazz. One of the first and the most extensive treatise to date is a 2013 doctoral dissertation, in which Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of [[musicology]] and history.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> He noted that the historically parallel traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce \"sacred jazz.\" The two are similar in religious intent but differ in gospel's lack of extended instrumental passages and instrumental improvisation and in gospel's hymn-like structure, and concern with social and political issues. Prominent artists [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Rosetta Tharpe]] contributed to gospel and sacred jazz. Versace maintained that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer [[Mary Lou Williams]], known for her jazz masses in the 1950s and [[Duke Ellington]]. Prior to his later sacred compositions, Ellington included \"Come Sunday\" and \"Twenty-third Psalm\" in his \"Black, Brown and Beige\", which he recorded in 1958 with Mahalia Jackson. However, a number of other jazz artists, black and white, contributed to the movement.\n\nThe marked societal changes of the [[1960s]] included changes in attitudes toward the arts in both [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Churches, which slowly became more open to the liturgical use of jazz.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> Mary Lou Williams continued composing sacred jazz including her \"Black Christ of the Andes\" (1964) in honor of newly canonized Martin De Porres. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, [[Duke Ellington]] wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 - A Concert of Sacred Music; 1968 - Second Sacred Concert; 1973 - Third Sacred Concert. Other popular and influential artists including [[John Coltrane]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Lalo Schifrin]] and [[Vince Guaraldi]] performed and recorded major sacred jazz works. Most works were in the [[Christian]] tradition but some were inspired by Asian and African religious traditions, e.g. John Contrane's \"[[A Love Supreme]],\" [[Alice Coltrane]]'s \"Universal Consciousness\", and [[Pharoah Sanders]]' \"Karma.\"\n\nThe last decades of the [[20th century]] and the first of the [[21st century]] saw continued regular composition, performance and recording of sacred jazz by established and new artists. Yet, sacred jazz never achieved a high visibility in the mainstream [[media]] or even among jazz lovers or much commercial success.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> However, this is a testament to the sincere religious motivation of its practitioners and advocates who persist in their calling.<ref name=\"Reed\" />\n\n==The jazz mass==\nThe most common form of sacred jazz is the jazz mass. Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was [[Mary Lou Williams]].

An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the [[temperature]] of the atmosphere is low.\n\nThe [[atmosphere of Earth]] is composed of [[nitrogen]] (about 78%), [[oxygen]] (about 21%), [[argon]] (about 0.9%), [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (0.04%) and other gases in trace amounts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthhow.com/earth-atmosphere-composition/|title=Earth's Atmosphere Composition: Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon and CO2|date=2017-07-31|website=Earth How|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> Oxygen is used by most [[organism]]s for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]; nitrogen is [[nitrogen fixation|fixed]] by bacteria and [[lightning]] to produce [[ammonia]] used in the construction of [[nucleotides]] and [[amino acids]]; and [[carbon dioxide]] is used by [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] for [[photosynthesis]]. The atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by [[sunlight|solar]] [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], [[solar wind]] and [[cosmic rays]]. The current composition of the Earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical [[Modification Detection Code|modification]] of the [[paleoatmosphere]] by living organisms.\n\nThe term [[stellar atmosphere]] describes the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion above the [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[photosphere]]. Stars with sufficiently low temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound [[molecule]]s.\n\n==Pressure==\n {{main|Atmospheric pressure}}\nAtmospheric pressure at a particular location is the [[force]] per unit area perpendicular to a surface determined by the [[weight]] of the vertical column of atmosphere above that location. On Earth, units of air pressure are based on the internationally recognized [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm), which is defined as 101.325 k[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (760&nbsp;[[Torr]] or 14.696 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]). It is measured with a [[barometer]].\n\n[[Atmospheric pressure]] decreases with increasing altitude due to the diminishing mass of gas above. The height at which the pressure from an atmosphere declines by a factor of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' (an [[irrational number]] with a value of 2.71828...) is called the [[scale height]] and is denoted by ''H''. For an atmosphere with a uniform temperature, the scale height is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the product of the mean [[molecular mass]] of dry air and the local acceleration of gravity at that location. For such a model atmosphere, the pressure declines exponentially with increasing altitude. However, atmospheres are not uniform in temperature, so estimation of the atmospheric pressure at any particular altitude is more complex.\n\n==Atmospheric escape==\n{{main|Atmospheric escape}}\n[[Surface gravity]] differs significantly among the planets. For example, the large gravitational force of the giant planet [[Jupiter]] retains light gases such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] that escape from objects with lower gravity. Secondly, the distance from the Sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its molecules' [[thermal motion]] exceed the planet's [[escape velocity]], allowing those to escape a planet's gravitational grasp. Thus, distant and cold [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and [[Pluto]] are able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities.\n\nSince a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide range of velocities, there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of gas into space. Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal [[kinetic energy]], and so gases of low [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] are lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight. It is thought that [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] may have lost much of their water when, after being [[Photodissociation|photodissociated]] into hydrogen and oxygen by solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation, the hydrogen escaped. [[Earth's magnetic field]] helps to prevent this, as, normally, the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen. However, over the past 3 billion years Earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity, including a net 2% of its atmospheric oxygen.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Seki, K. | author2=Elphic, R.

Objects that have no atmosphere, or that have only an exosphere, have terrain that is covered in [[impact crater|craters]]. Without an atmosphere, the planet  has no protection from [[meteoroid]]s, and all of them collide with the surface as [[meteorites]] and create craters.\n\nMost meteoroids burn up as [[meteors]] before hitting a planet's surface. When [[meteoroids]] do impact, the effects are often erased by the action of wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/06/27/scientists-detected-an-incoming-asteroid-the-size-of-a-car-last-week-why-that-matters-to-us/#3fb514894869 |title=Scientists Detected An Incoming Asteroid The Size Of A Car Last Week - Why That Matters To Us}}</ref> As a result, craters are rare on objects with atmospheres.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[Wind erosion]] is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with atmospheres, and over time can erase the effects of both craters and [[volcanoes]]. In addition, since [[liquid]]<nowiki/>s can not exist without pressure, an atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface, resulting in [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[ocean]]s. [[Earth]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that [[Mars]] had liquid on its surface in the past.\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|Earth's atmospheric [[gas]]es scatter blue light more than other wavelengths, giving [[Earth]] a blue halo when seen from [[space]]]]\n\nA planet's initial atmospheric composition is related to the chemistry and temperature of the local [[solar nebula]] during planetary formation and the subsequent escape of interior gases. The original atmospheres started with a rotating disc of gases that collapsed to form a series of spaced rings that condensed to form the planets. The planet's atmospheres were then modified over time by various complex factors, resulting in quite different outcomes.\n\nThe atmospheres of the planets [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] are primarily composed of [[carbon dioxide]], with small quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[oxygen]] and traces of other gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universetoday.com/35796/atmosphere-of-the-planets/|title=What Is The Atmosphere Like On Other Planets?|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=2016-01-07|website=Universe Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThe composition of Earth's atmosphere is largely governed by the by-products of the life that it sustains. Dry air from [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and traces of hydrogen, helium, and other \"noble\" gases (by volume), but generally a variable amount of water vapor is also present, on average about 1% at sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/classes/m201/Atmosphere/AtmosphericComposition.html|title=Atmospheric Composition|website=tornado.sfsu.edu|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThe low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar System's [[giant planet]]s\u2014[[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]\u2014allow them more readily to retain gases with low [[molecular mass]]es. These planets have hydrogen\u2013helium atmospheres, with trace amounts of more complex compounds.\n\nTwo satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres. [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], a moon of Saturn, and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of [[nitrogen]].  When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, [[Pluto]] has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Triton's, but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the Sun.\n\nOther bodies within the [[Solar System]] have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium. These include the [[Moon]] ([[sodium]] gas), [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (sodium gas), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (oxygen), [[Io (moon)|Io]] ([[sulfur]]), and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] ([[water vapor]]).\n\nThe first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is [[HD 209458]]b, a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus]]. Its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000&nbsp;K, and is steadily escaping into space. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planet's inflated atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news | author1=Weaver, D. | author2=Villard, R. | title=Hubble Probes Layer-cake Structure of Alien World's Atmosphere | publisher=Hubble News Center | date=2007-01-31 | url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/ | accessdate=2007-03-11 |url-status = live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314043755/http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/ | archivedate=2007-03-14 | df= }}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Earth atmosphere===\n{{main|Atmosphere of Earth}}\n[[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] consists of a number of layers that differ in properties such as composition, temperature and pressure. The lowest layer is the [[troposphere]], which extends from the surface to the bottom of the [[stratosphere]]. Three quarters of the atmosphere's mass resides within the troposphere, and is the layer within which the Earth's terrestrial weather develops. The depth of this layer varies between 17&nbsp;km at the equator to 7&nbsp;km at the poles. The stratosphere, extending from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the [[mesosphere]], contains the [[ozone layer]]. The ozone layer ranges in altitude between 15 and 35&nbsp;km, and is where most of the [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the Sun is absorbed. The top of the mesosphere, ranges from 50 to 85&nbsp;km, and is the layer wherein most [[meteors]] burn up. The  [[thermosphere]] extends from 85&nbsp;km to the base of the [[exosphere]] at 400&nbsp;km and contains the [[ionosphere]], a region where the atmosphere is ionised by incoming solar radiation. The ionosphere increases in thickness and moves closer to the Earth during daylight and rises at night allowing certain frequencies of radio communication over a greater range. The [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]], located within the thermosphere at an altitude of 100&nbsp;km, is commonly used to define the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and [[outer space]]. The [[exosphere]] begins variously from about 690 to 1,000&nbsp;km above the surface, where it interacts with the planet's [[magnetosphere]]. Each of the layers has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height.\n\n===Others===\nOther astronomical bodies such as these listed have known atmospheres.\n\n====In the Solar System====\n[[File:Solar system escape velocity vs surface temperature.svg|thumb|Graphs of escape velocity against surface temperature of some Solar System objects showing which gases are retained.

An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the [[temperature]] of the atmosphere is low.\n\nThe [[atmosphere of Earth]] is composed of [[nitrogen]] (about 78%), [[oxygen]] (about 21%), [[argon]] (about 0.9%), [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (0.04%) and other gases in trace amounts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthhow.com/earth-atmosphere-composition/|title=Earth's Atmosphere Composition: Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon and CO2|date=2017-07-31|website=Earth How|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> Oxygen is used by most [[organism]]s for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]; nitrogen is [[nitrogen fixation|fixed]] by bacteria and [[lightning]] to produce [[ammonia]] used in the construction of [[nucleotides]] and [[amino acids]]; and [[carbon dioxide]] is used by [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] for [[photosynthesis]]. The atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by [[sunlight|solar]] [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], [[solar wind]] and [[cosmic rays]]. The current composition of the Earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical [[Modification Detection Code|modification]] of the [[paleoatmosphere]] by living organisms.\n\nThe term [[stellar atmosphere]] describes the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion above the [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[photosphere]]. Stars with sufficiently low temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound [[molecule]]s.\n\n==Pressure==\n {{main|Atmospheric pressure}}\nAtmospheric pressure at a particular location is the [[force]] per unit area perpendicular to a surface determined by the [[weight]] of the vertical column of atmosphere above that location. On Earth, units of air pressure are based on the internationally recognized [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm), which is defined as 101.325 k[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (760&nbsp;[[Torr]] or 14.696 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]). It is measured with a [[barometer]].\n\n[[Atmospheric pressure]] decreases with increasing altitude due to the diminishing mass of gas above. The height at which the pressure from an atmosphere declines by a factor of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' (an [[irrational number]] with a value of 2.71828...) is called the [[scale height]] and is denoted by ''H''. For an atmosphere with a uniform temperature, the scale height is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the product of the mean [[molecular mass]] of dry air and the local acceleration of gravity at that location. For such a model atmosphere, the pressure declines exponentially with increasing altitude. However, atmospheres are not uniform in temperature, so estimation of the atmospheric pressure at any particular altitude is more complex.\n\n==Atmospheric escape==\n{{main|Atmospheric escape}}\n[[Surface gravity]] differs significantly among the planets. For example, the large gravitational force of the giant planet [[Jupiter]] retains light gases such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] that escape from objects with lower gravity. Secondly, the distance from the Sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its molecules' [[thermal motion]] exceed the planet's [[escape velocity]], allowing those to escape a planet's gravitational grasp. Thus, distant and cold [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and [[Pluto]] are able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities.\n\nSince a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide range of velocities, there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of gas into space. Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal [[kinetic energy]], and so gases of low [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] are lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight. It is thought that [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] may have lost much of their water when, after being [[Photodissociation|photodissociated]] into hydrogen and oxygen by solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation, the hydrogen escaped. [[Earth]]'s [[magnetic field]] helps to prevent this, as, normally, the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen. However, over the past 3 billion years Earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity, including a net 2% of its atmospheric oxygen.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Seki, K. | author2=Elphic, R.

Objects that have no atmosphere, or that have only an exosphere, have terrain that is covered in [[impact crater|craters]]. Without an atmosphere, the planet  has no protection from [[meteoroid]]s, and all of them collide with the surface as [[meteorites]] and create craters.\n\nMost meteoroids burn up as [[meteors]] before hitting a planet's surface. When [[meteoroids]] do impact, the effects are often erased by the action of wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/06/27/scientists-detected-an-incoming-asteroid-the-size-of-a-car-last-week-why-that-matters-to-us/#3fb514894869 |title=Scientists Detected An Incoming Asteroid The Size Of A Car Last Week - Why That Matters To Us}}</ref> As a result, craters are rare on objects with atmospheres.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}\n\n[[Wind erosion]] is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with atmospheres, and over time can erase the effects of both craters and [[volcanoes]]. In addition, since [[liquid]]<nowiki/>s can not exist without pressure, an atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface, resulting in [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[ocean]]s. [[Earth]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that [[Mars]] had liquid on its surface in the past.\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|Earth's atmospheric [[gas]]es scatter blue light more than other wavelengths, giving [[Earth]] a blue halo when seen from [[space]]]]\n\nA planet's initial atmospheric composition is related to the chemistry and temperature of the local [[solar nebula]] during planetary formation and the subsequent escape of interior gases. The original atmospheres started with a rotating disc of gases that collapsed to form a series of spaced rings that condensed to form the planets. The planet's atmospheres were then modified over time by various complex factors, resulting in quite different outcomes.\n\nThe atmospheres of the planets [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] are primarily composed of [[carbon dioxide]], with small quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[oxygen]] and traces of other gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universetoday.com/35796/atmosphere-of-the-planets/|title=What Is The Atmosphere Like On Other Planets?|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=2016-01-07|website=Universe Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThe composition of Earth's atmosphere is largely governed by the by-products of the life that it sustains. Dry air from [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and traces of hydrogen, helium, and other \"noble\" gases (by volume), but generally a variable amount of water vapor is also present, on average about 1% at sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/classes/m201/Atmosphere/AtmosphericComposition.html|title=Atmospheric Composition|website=tornado.sfsu.edu|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThe low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar System's [[giant planet]]s\u2014[[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]\u2014allow them more readily to retain gases with low [[molecular mass]]es. These planets have hydrogen\u2013helium atmospheres, with trace amounts of more complex compounds.\n\nTwo satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres. [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], a moon of Saturn, and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of [[nitrogen]].  When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, [[Pluto]] has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Triton's, but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the Sun.\n\nOther bodies within the [[Solar System]] have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium. These include the [[Moon]] ([[sodium]] gas), [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (sodium gas), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (oxygen), [[Io (moon)|Io]] ([[sulfur]]), and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] ([[water vapor]]).\n\nThe first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is [[HD 209458]]b, a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus]]. Its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000&nbsp;K, and is steadily escaping into space.

The lowest layer is the [[troposphere]], which extends from the surface to the bottom of the [[stratosphere]]. Three quarters of the atmosphere's mass resides within the troposphere, and is the layer within which the Earth's terrestrial weather develops. The depth of this layer varies between 17&nbsp;km at the equator to 7&nbsp;km at the poles. The stratosphere, extending from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the [[mesosphere]], contains the [[ozone layer]]. The ozone layer ranges in altitude between 15 and 35&nbsp;km, and is where most of the [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the Sun is absorbed. The top of the mesosphere, ranges from 50 to 85&nbsp;km, and is the layer wherein most [[meteors]] burn up.

The game showcases teams from the NCAA Division I [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). For the game's first three editions, it was played at campus sites; since 2017, the game has been played at a neutral site, the [[Cramton Bowl]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. The game is televised nationally by [[ESPN]], and for sponsorship reasons is officially the '''Guardian Credit Union FCS Kickoff'''.\n\n==History==\nIn February 2013, [[ESPN]] announced that the 2014 college football season would begin at its earliest point in 11 years with the creation of the \"FCS Kickoff\", an annual game which would showcase two top-level teams from the NCAA Division I [[Football Championship Subdivision]].

However, an exception to this rule has been carved out for nationally televised events (on either over-the-air or cable networks); teams may participate in such an event against an out-of-conference opponent on the Saturday or Sunday preceding the standard season start date. No more than one team from a conference can participate in such an event in a given season, and no team can appear in such a game in three consecutive seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D119.pdf |title=Bylaw 17.10.3.2: First Contest, Exception\u2014Nationally Televised Contest\u2014Championship Subdivision |work=2018\u201319 NCAA Division I Manual |page=272 |publisher=NCAA |date=July 2018 |accessdate=March 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 edition marked several changes for the event. First, ESPN took ownership of the event through its [[ESPN Events]] division. The event was moved to a neutral site (the Cramton Bowl in Montgomery, Alabama); received a name sponsorship by Guardian Credit Union, a small Montgomery-based [[credit union]]; was co-branded as the Montgomery Kickoff Classic; and also took on Alabama FCS member [[Jacksonville State University]] as a partner for the 2017 and 2018 editions.

The game showcases teams from the NCAA Division I [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). For the game's first three editions, it was played at campus sites; since 2017, the game has been played at a neutral site, the [[Cramton Bowl]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. The game is televised nationally by [[ESPN]], and for sponsorship reasons is officially the '''Guardian Credit Union FCS Kickoff'''.\n\n==History==\nIn February 2013, [[ESPN]] announced that the 2014 college football season would begin at its earliest point in 11 years with the creation of the \"FCS Kickoff\", an annual game which would showcase two top-level teams from the NCAA Division I [[Football Championship Subdivision]].  ESPN stated that during meetings with FCS conference commissioners there was an interest in creating a \"tentpole type\" event around FCS football<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2014/02/20/college-football-season-kickoff-espn/5640283/ |title=ESPN to give college football season an early start in 2014 |publisher=usatoday.com |accessdate=February 20, 2014}}</ref> and to showcase the quality and depth of FCS football to a national audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/college-football-season-kick-off-fcs-battle-between-213317929--ncaaf.html?pt=tAD1SCT8P72012-07-31.html?discipline_codearchery/ |title=College football season to kick off with FCS battle between Sam Houston State and Eastern Washington on August 23 |publisher=sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=February 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nUnder current NCAA rules, FBS teams are not allowed to play their first regular-season game until the Thursday preceding Labor Day. However, an exception to this rule has been carved out for nationally televised events (on either over-the-air or cable networks); teams may participate in such an event against an out-of-conference opponent on the Saturday or Sunday preceding the standard season start date. No more than one team from a conference can participate in such an event in a given season, and no team can appear in such a game in three consecutive seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D119.pdf |title=Bylaw 17.10.3.2: First Contest, Exception\u2014Nationally Televised Contest\u2014Championship Subdivision |work=2018\u201319 NCAA Division I Manual |page=272 |publisher=NCAA |date=July 2018 |accessdate=March 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 edition marked several changes for the event. First, ESPN took ownership of the event through its [[ESPN Events]] division. The event was moved to a neutral site (the Cramton Bowl in Montgomery, Alabama); received a name sponsorship by Guardian Credit Union, a small Montgomery-based [[credit union]]; was co-branded as the Montgomery Kickoff Classic; and also took on Alabama FCS member [[Jacksonville State University]] as a partner for the 2017 and 2018 editions. As such, [[Jacksonville State Gamecocks football|JSU]] participated in both editions of the event.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/10/12/espn-announces-monrtgomery-kickoff-classic-2017/91939454/|title=ESPN announces Montgomery Kickoff Classic for 2017||first1=Duane|last1=Rankin|first2=Matthew|last2=Stevens|date=October 12, 2016|newspaper=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://espnevents.com/blog/press/guardian-credit-union-joins-fcs-kickoff-title-sponsor/|title=Guardian Credit Union Joins FCS Kickoff as Title Sponsor|date=March 21, 2017 |publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref> With Jacksonville State barred from a third consecutive FCS Kickoff appearance by NCAA rule, ESPN chose another Alabama program, [[Samford Bulldogs football|Samford]], as the de facto home team for the 2019 edition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/samford-youngstown-state-meet-2019-fcs-kickoff-171227978--ncaaf.html |title=Samford, Youngstown State to meet in 2019 FCS Kickoff |first=Craig |last=Haley |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Yahoo Sports|Yahoo!
