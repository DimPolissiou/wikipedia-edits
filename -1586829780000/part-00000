Modifications to the ''Java Edition'' of ''Minecraft'' are possible because for each new major version of the game, the community reverse-engineers ''Minecraft''{{'s}} source code, which is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].<ref>Koene 2015, Hour 1, pg. 1</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=November 2019}}.  Mojang and Microsoft provide little official support for this (for example, the game provides no modding API for Java, although Mojang does provide methods for deobfuscating the game), but the EULA permits non-commercial mods.\n\nModding to the mobile and console versions of ''Minecraft'' on the [[Minecraft#Pocket/Bedrock Edition|Bedrock codebase]] are different, because that iteration of the game is written in C++ rather than Java.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" /> Players who wish to mod their game on Bedrock codebase versions have a simpler process, due to the version's built-in official support for \"add-ons\", which can be installed faster than ''Java Edition'' mods, and require no external mod loaders.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the first version of ''Minecraft'' was released in May 2009,<ref name=\"PcGamerFirstMoments\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-moments-of-minecraft/ |title=The First Moments of Minecraft |last=Smith |first=Graham |date=6 February 2012 |website=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> client-side modding of the game did not become popular in earnest until the game reached its [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha stage]] in June 2010. The only mods that were released during ''Minecraft''{{'s}} Indev and Infdev development stages were a few client-side mods which had minor changes to the game.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the release of Alpha, the first server-side mods began to appear.{{cn|date=April 2020}} One of them was hMod, which added some simple but necessary tools to manage a server.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Michael Stoyke, also known as Searge who would later go on to work for Mojang, created Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), which was later renamed to Mod Coder Pack, keeping the same acronym. MCP was a tool which decompiled and deobfuscated ''Minecraft'' code. MCP would recompile and reobfuscate new and changed classes, which can be injected into the game. But, if multiple mods modified the same base code, it would conflict. To solve this problem, Risugami's Modloader was created; Modloader prevented any conflict occurring due to multiple mods modifying the same base classes or game resources.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nTowards the end of 2010, new mods were released which featured more content than previous ones. ''Minecraft'' was now preparing to move into its [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta development phase]], and popular mods such as ''IndustrialCraft'', ''Railcraft'' and ''BuildCraft'' were first released. As opposed to their predecessors, these mods had the potential to change the entire game instead of simply tweaking minor aspects of it.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Bukkit, a server-side mod intended to replace hMod was also released during this time. CraftBukkit, a server software which implemented the Bukkit API was also released. Bukkit allowed server owners to install plug-ins which modified the server's way of taking input and giving output to the player without players having to install client-side mods.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAround November 2011, the Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge were released. Forge allowed players to be able to run several mods simultaneously. Forge utilized MCP mappings. Forge also released a server version of  Forge, which allowed mods to be run on servers, which eventually led to people creating modded servers. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate the base source code, allowing separate mods to run together without requiring them to touch the base source code.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Forge also included many libraries and hooks which made mod development easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:@jeb talking at the modders panel @ MineCon 2012.jpg|thumb|In 2012, Mojang organized a panel on modding at [[MineCon#2012|MineCon 2012]], where ''Minecraft''{{'s}} lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]] held a talk.]]\nAfter ''Minecraft'' was fully released in November 2011, the game's modding community continued to grow.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> In February 2012, Mojang hired developers of the Bukkit to work on an official modding [[Application programming interface|API]], allowing mod developers easier access to the ''Minecraft'' game files.<ref name=\"ModdingAPIEurogamer\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-29-mojang-hires-bukkit-server-mod-team-to-make-official-minecraft-api |title=Mojang hires Bukkit server-mod team to make official Minecraft API |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=29 February 2012 |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Bukkit was then maintained by the community. A fork of CraftBukkit, called Spigot which was backward compatible with plugins was also in development. An Alternative to forge named Liteloader was released. Liteloader made modding very simple and promoted adding new content instead of modifying existing content. Like forge, Liteloader also used MCP mappings.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2013, Forge Mod Loader soon replaced Risugami's Modloader as Modloader wasn't being updated in time by its developers.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In early 2014, a new server software named Sponge, which had a very powerful plugin API compared to Bukkit, and was also compatible with running Forge mods was released. Sponge also introduced [[mixin]]s, an alternatively to modifying byte code. Soon, Liteloader implemented mixins into their API allowing developers to modify in-game content.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn mid-2014, Spigot released a server software made to link many servers together. The project was called BungeeCord, and had a separate plugin API from spigot and spigot plugins could work side by side with BungeeCord. Many popular Minecraft servers use BungeeCord to link up Minecraft servers together.{{cn|date=April 2020}} PaperMC also released a modified version of BungeeCord called Waterfall, which included optimizations that were not present in Spigot.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nConcern arose following Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang in late 2014. Members of the modding community feared that ''Minecraft''{{'}}s new American owners would put an end to Mojang's established practice of giving free rein to mod developers.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/microsoft-turns-a-minecraft-mod-into-an-education-business |title=Microsoft Turns a Minecraft Mod Into an Education Business |last=Brustein |first=Joshua |date=19 January 2016 |website=Bloomberg L.P. |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Despite the concerns, Microsoft did not announce any changes to Mojang's policies, and modding was unaffected.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Microsoft announced that it was adding a ''Minecraft'' Mod Developer Pack to [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], granting users of the application creation software an easier way to program ''Minecraft'' mods.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-embraces-minecraft-modding-with-new-visual-studio-tools-1621890/ |title=Microsoft embraces Minecraft modding with new Visual Studio tools |last=Mathews |first=Lee |date=1 May 2015 |website=Geek.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Media |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Microsoft released the new pack open source and free of charge, amidst a drive to push towards more open source software.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\" /><ref name=\"MicrosoftOpenSource\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/microsoft-moves-toward-open-source-linux-fills-cloud/ |title=Microsoft Moves Toward Open Source as Linux Fills Its Cloud |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=12 August 2015 |website=Wired |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Publishing |access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2016, a new modding toolchain known as Fabric was released. Fabric devised its own set of free mappings to use instead of MCP mappings. Fabric also used Sponge's mixins.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Fabric was very light and did not have all the elements of a forge mod, and could also be released from developmental snapshot versions of Minecraft, which other mod loaders could not.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nA new [[Windows 10]] version of ''Minecraft'' was announced shortly after which, unlike the previous versions, was to be programmed in [[C++]].<ref name=\"ViceModding\">{{Cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-gamers-are-worried-about-minecraft-windows-10-edition |title='Why Gamers Are Worried About 'Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition' |last=Maiberg |first=Emanuel |date=6 July 2015 |website=VICE |publisher=Motherboard |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> This announcement sparked concern amongst the game's fanbase that the Java-based versions would end up being phased out entirely, which would hamper the production of mods as C++ is not as \"reverse engineerable\" as Java is known to be. However, Mojang developer Tommaso Checchi reassured fans on [[Reddit]] that modding was \"too important\" to ''Minecraft'' for the Java-based versions to be discontinued.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" />\n\nIn April 2017, Mojang announced the upcoming creation of the ''Minecraft Marketplace'', where players would be able to sell user-created content for the Windows 10 version of the game (running on the Bedrock codebase).<ref name=\"PcGamesMarketplace\" /> Although this new digital store would specialize in adventure maps, skins, texture packs, PC World did note that this addition would move the Windows 10 version \"a bit closer to the moddable worlds familiar to classic players\" of the original ''Java Edition''.<ref name=\"PcWorldMarketplace\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3188093/gaming/minecraft-pulls-pocket-users-closer-to-windows-with-paid-dlc-and-paint-3d-support.html |title=Minecraft pulls Pocket users closer to Windows with paid DLC and Paint 3D support |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=10 April 2017 |website=PCWorld |publisher=IDG |access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Forge underwent a large rewrite, partially because of the large changes in ''Java Edition'' version 1.13 and to support their new long-term support system for upcoming versions.{{cn|date=April 2020}} This made many modders use 1.12.2 as their primary version.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Mod Coder Pack stopped recieving updates after 1.12.2. Liteloader was not updated for 1.13, and in its succession came Rift. Rift was a light mod loader for 1.13 to 1.13.2 which also used mixins. However, Liteloader and Rift did not release a mod loader for servers, so Liteloader and Rift mods could only run on the game client.{{cn|date=April 2020}} A new server software for 1.12.2 named Magma was released, which allowed using PaperMC plugins and Forge mods together.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn late 2018, Fabric underwent a complete rewrite. Mappings' names were changed and more hooks were added to make modding easier. Fabric also began becoming very popular and 1.14 modding began to split between Forge and Fabric.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Forge released their new long-term support system for ''Java Edition'' version 1.14, and updating mods to newer versions was made easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn August 2019, Microsoft decided to partnering with [[Nvidia]] to add support for ray tracing technology. This new update is expected to be released in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.minecraftglobal.com/minecraft-with-ray-tracing/ |title=Minecraft with Ray Tracing explained |date=8 November 2019 |website=Minecraft Global |access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, as of 2020, the modding community is split up between Forge and Fabric. Server modding is split up between CraftBukkit, Spigot, PaperMC and Sponge. Server linking software is split between BungeeCord and Waterfall.{{cn|date=April 2020}} \n\n===Controversies===\nOver the course of the years, there have been mod-related controversies with ''Minecraft''. One surrounded a mod called GregTech, which was aimed at increasing ''Minecraft''{{'}}s difficulty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |title=Feed The Beast: The Mod Wars |last=Stitz |first=Joe |date=18 August 2013 |website=CrysisTV |publisher=CrysisTV |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216051233/http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |archive-date=16 February 2016 |access-date=11 February 2016}}</ref> In 2013, its developer, Greg, noticed that some of GregTech's added recipes had been overwritten by another mod named Tinkers' Construct. Greg, in retaliation, deliberately inserted code into GregTech which would crash the game client if it detected any other mods (such as Tinkers' Construct). The authors of both mods later settled their dispute.<ref name=\"RockPaperShotgun\" /><ref name=\"PcGamesGregTinkers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/minecraft-mod-gregtech-contains-code-crash-game-should-its-changes-be-undone-other-mods |title=Minecraft mod GregTech contains code to crash game |last=Benson |first=Julian |date=30 June 2013 |website=PCGamesN |publisher=Network N |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother surrounded the mod Bukkit, an API which enabled others to install server-side mods.<ref name=\"Cadenhead2\">Cadenhead 2014, p. 2</ref> In 2014, the leader of the Bukkit team Warren \"EvilSeph\" Loo (who previously worked for Mojang) announced that development would cease, and Mojang stepped in to save the project.<ref name=\"AsModTurns\" /> With Mojang's announcement, the intellectual rights to the project became ambiguous.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Licensing conflicts arose between the original creators of Bukkit and maintainers, largely revolving around the who \"owned\" the project after the primary maintainers resigned.

Modifications to the ''Java Edition'' of ''Minecraft'' are possible because for each new major version of the game, the community reverse-engineers ''Minecraft''{{'s}} source code, which is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].<ref>Koene 2015, Hour 1, pg. 1</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=November 2019}}.  Mojang and Microsoft provide little official support for this (for example, the game provides no modding API for Java, although Mojang does provide methods for deobfuscating the game), but the EULA permits non-commercial mods.\n\nModding to the mobile and console versions of ''Minecraft'' on the [[Minecraft#Pocket/Bedrock Edition|Bedrock codebase]] are different, because that iteration of the game is written in C++ rather than Java.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" /> Players who wish to mod their game on Bedrock codebase versions have a simpler process, due to the version's built-in official support for \"add-ons\", which can be installed faster than ''Java Edition'' mods, and require no external mod loaders.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the first version of ''Minecraft'' was released in May 2009,<ref name=\"PcGamerFirstMoments\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-moments-of-minecraft/ |title=The First Moments of Minecraft |last=Smith |first=Graham |date=6 February 2012 |website=PC Gamer |publisher=Future plc |access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> client-side modding of the game did not become popular in earnest until the game reached its [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha stage]] in June 2010. The only mods that were released during ''Minecraft''{{'s}} Indev and Infdev development stages were a few client-side mods which had minor changes to the game.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the release of Alpha, the first server-side mods began to appear.{{cn|date=April 2020}} One of them was hMod, which added some simple but necessary tools to manage a server.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Michael Stoyke, also known as Searge who would later go on to work for Mojang, created Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), which was later renamed to Mod Coder Pack, keeping the same acronym. MCP was a tool which decompiled and deobfuscated ''Minecraft'' code. MCP would recompile and reobfuscate new and changed classes, which can be injected into the game. But, if multiple mods modified the same base code, it would conflict. To solve this problem, Risugami's Modloader was created; Modloader prevented any conflict occurring due to multiple mods modifying the same base classes or game resources.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nTowards the end of 2010, new mods were released which featured more content than previous ones. ''Minecraft'' was now preparing to move into its [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta development phase]], and popular mods such as ''IndustrialCraft'', ''Railcraft'' and ''BuildCraft'' were first released. As opposed to their predecessors, these mods had the potential to change the entire game instead of simply tweaking minor aspects of it.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Bukkit, a server-side mod intended to replace hMod was also released during this time. CraftBukkit, a server software which implemented the Bukkit API was also released. Bukkit allowed server owners to install plug-ins which modified the server's way of taking input and giving output to the player without players having to install client-side mods.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAround November 2011, the Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge were released. Forge allowed players to be able to run several mods simultaneously. Forge utilized MCP mappings. Forge also released a server version of  Forge, which allowed mods to be run on servers, which eventually led to people creating modded servers. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate the base source code, allowing separate mods to run together without requiring them to touch the base source code.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Forge also included many libraries and hooks which made mod development easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:@jeb talking at the modders panel @ MineCon 2012.jpg|thumb|In 2012, Mojang organized a panel on modding at [[MineCon#2012|MineCon 2012]], where ''Minecraft''{{'s}} lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]] held a talk.]]\nAfter ''Minecraft'' was fully released in November 2011, the game's modding community continued to grow.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> In February 2012, Mojang hired developers of the Bukkit to work on an official modding [[Application programming interface|API]], allowing mod developers easier access to the ''Minecraft'' game files.<ref name=\"ModdingAPIEurogamer\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-29-mojang-hires-bukkit-server-mod-team-to-make-official-minecraft-api |title=Mojang hires Bukkit server-mod team to make official Minecraft API |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=29 February 2012 |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Bukkit was then maintained by the community. A fork of CraftBukkit, called Spigot which was backward compatible with plugins was also in development. An Alternative to forge named Liteloader was released. Liteloader made modding very simple and promoted adding new content instead of modifying existing content. Like forge, Liteloader also used MCP mappings.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2013, Forge Mod Loader soon replaced Risugami's Modloader as Modloader wasn't being updated in time by its developers.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In early 2014, a new server software named Sponge, which had a very powerful plugin API compared to Bukkit, and was also compatible with running Forge mods was released. Sponge also introduced [[mixin]]s, an alternatively to modifying byte code. Soon, Liteloader implemented mixins into their API allowing developers to modify in-game content.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn mid-2014, Spigot released a server software made to link many servers together. The project was called BungeeCord, and had a separate plugin API from spigot and spigot plugins could work side by side with BungeeCord. Many popular Minecraft servers use BungeeCord to link up Minecraft servers together.{{cn|date=April 2020}} PaperMC also released a modified version of BungeeCord called Waterfall, which included optimizations that were not present in Spigot.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nConcern arose following Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang in late 2014. Members of the modding community feared that ''Minecraft''{{'}}s new American owners would put an end to Mojang's established practice of giving free rein to mod developers.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/microsoft-turns-a-minecraft-mod-into-an-education-business |title=Microsoft Turns a Minecraft Mod Into an Education Business |last=Brustein |first=Joshua |date=19 January 2016 |website=Bloomberg L.P. |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Despite the concerns, Microsoft did not announce any changes to Mojang's policies, and modding was unaffected.<ref name=\"BloombergEdu\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Microsoft announced that it was adding a ''Minecraft'' Mod Developer Pack to [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], granting users of the application creation software an easier way to program ''Minecraft'' mods.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-embraces-minecraft-modding-with-new-visual-studio-tools-1621890/ |title=Microsoft embraces Minecraft modding with new Visual Studio tools |last=Mathews |first=Lee |date=1 May 2015 |website=Geek.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Media |access-date=13 February 2016}}</ref> Microsoft released the new pack open source and free of charge, amidst a drive to push towards more open source software.<ref name=\"GeekVisualStudio\" /><ref name=\"MicrosoftOpenSource\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/microsoft-moves-toward-open-source-linux-fills-cloud/ |title=Microsoft Moves Toward Open Source as Linux Fills Its Cloud |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=12 August 2015 |website=Wired |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Publishing |access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2016, a new modding toolchain known as Fabric was released. Fabric devised its own set of free mappings to use instead of MCP mappings. Fabric also used Sponge's mixins.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Fabric was very light and did not have all the elements of a forge mod, and could also be released from developmental snapshot versions of Minecraft, which other mod loaders could not.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nA new [[Windows 10]] version of ''Minecraft'' was announced shortly after which, unlike the previous versions, was to be programmed in [[C++]].<ref name=\"ViceModding\">{{Cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-gamers-are-worried-about-minecraft-windows-10-edition |title='Why Gamers Are Worried About 'Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition' |last=Maiberg |first=Emanuel |date=6 July 2015 |website=VICE |publisher=Motherboard |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> This announcement sparked concern amongst the game's fanbase that the Java-based versions would end up being phased out entirely, which would hamper the production of mods as C++ is not as \"reverse engineerable\" as Java is known to be. However, Mojang developer Tommaso Checchi reassured fans on [[Reddit]] that modding was \"too important\" to ''Minecraft'' for the Java-based versions to be discontinued.<ref name=\"ViceModding\" />\n\nIn April 2017, Mojang announced the upcoming creation of the ''Minecraft Marketplace'', where players would be able to sell user-created content for the Windows 10 version of the game (running on the Bedrock codebase).<ref name=\"PcGamesMarketplace\" /> Although this new digital store would specialize in adventure maps, skins, texture packs, PC World did note that this addition would move the Windows 10 version \"a bit closer to the moddable worlds familiar to classic players\" of the original ''Java Edition''.<ref name=\"PcWorldMarketplace\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3188093/gaming/minecraft-pulls-pocket-users-closer-to-windows-with-paid-dlc-and-paint-3d-support.html |title=Minecraft pulls Pocket users closer to Windows with paid DLC and Paint 3D support |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=10 April 2017 |website=PCWorld |publisher=IDG |access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Forge underwent a large rewrite, partially because of the large changes in ''Java Edition'' version 1.13 and to support their new long-term support system for upcoming versions.{{cn|date=April 2020}} This made many modders use 1.12.2 as their primary version.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Mod Coder Pack stopped recieving updates after 1.12.2. Liteloader was not updated for 1.13, and in its succession came Rift. Rift was a light mod loader for 1.13 to 1.13.2 which also used mixins. However, Liteloader and Rift did not release a mod loader for servers, so Liteloader and Rift mods could only run on the game client.{{cn|date=April 2020}} A new server software for 1.12.2 named Magma was released, which allowed using PaperMC plugins and Forge mods together.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn late 2018, Fabric underwent a complete rewrite. Mappings' names were changed and more hooks were added to make modding easier. Fabric also began becoming very popular and 1.14 modding began to split between Forge and Fabric.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Forge released their new long-term support system for ''Java Edition'' version 1.14, and updating mods to newer versions was made easier.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn August 2019, Microsoft decided to partnering with [[Nvidia]] to add support for ray tracing technology. This new update is expected to be released in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.minecraftglobal.com/minecraft-with-ray-tracing/ |title=Minecraft with Ray Tracing explained |date=8 November 2019 |website=Minecraft Global |access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, as of 2020, the modding community is split up between Forge and Fabric. Server modding is split up between CraftBukkit, Spigot, PaperMC and Sponge. Server linking software is split between BungeeCord and Waterfall.{{cn|date=April 2020}} \n\n===Controversies===\nOver the course of the years, there have been mod-related controversies with ''Minecraft''. One surrounded a mod called GregTech, which was aimed at increasing ''Minecraft''{{'}}s difficulty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |title=Feed The Beast: The Mod Wars |last=Stitz |first=Joe |date=18 August 2013 |website=CrysisTV |publisher=CrysisTV |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216051233/http://crysis.tv/feed-the-beast-the-mod-wars/ |archive-date=16 February 2016 |access-date=11 February 2016}}</ref> In 2013, its developer, Greg, noticed that some of GregTech's added recipes had been overwritten by another mod named Tinkers' Construct. Greg, in retaliation, deliberately inserted code into GregTech which would crash the game client if it detected any other mods (such as Tinkers' Construct). The authors of both mods later settled their dispute.<ref name=\"RockPaperShotgun\" /><ref name=\"PcGamesGregTinkers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/minecraft-mod-gregtech-contains-code-crash-game-should-its-changes-be-undone-other-mods |title=Minecraft mod GregTech contains code to crash game |last=Benson |first=Julian |date=30 June 2013 |website=PCGamesN |publisher=Network N |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother surrounded the mod Bukkit, an API which enabled others to install server-side mods.<ref name=\"Cadenhead2\">Cadenhead 2014, p. 2</ref> In 2014, the leader of the Bukkit team Warren \"EvilSeph\" Loo (who previously worked for Mojang) announced that development would cease, and Mojang stepped in to save the project.<ref name=\"AsModTurns\" /> With Mojang's announcement, the intellectual rights to the project became ambiguous.<ref name=\"packtpub history\" /> Licensing conflicts arose between the original creators of Bukkit and maintainers, largely revolving around the who \"owned\" the project after the primary maintainers resigned. One major contributor tried to pull the rights to use their code in the game, effectively forcing Bukkit to fall in a state of disrepair for a time.<ref name=\"ProgrammableWeb\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.programmableweb.com/news/minecraft-server-software-and-modding-plug-ins-facing-uncertain-future/analysis/2014/09/24 |title=Minecraft Server Software and Modding Plug-Ins Facing Uncertain Future |last=Wagner |first=Janet |date=24 September 2014 |website=ProgrammableWeb.com |publisher=ProgrammableWeb |access-date=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"packtpub history\" /><ref name=\"AsModTurns\">{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017235432/http://gamepolitics.com/2014/09/05/mod-turns-latest-ongoing-minecraft-bukkit-saga/ |url-status=dead |title=As The Mod Turns: The Latest In The Ongoing Minecraft 'Bukkit' Saga |last=Fudge |first=James |date=5 September 2014 |website=GamePolitics.com |publisher=Entertainment Consumers Association |access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> \n\nAnother controversy came about in March 2017, when Slovakian cybercompany [[ESET]] revealed that 87 examples of [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] malware were distributed through the [[Google Play Store]] under the guise of ''Minecraft'' mods.

A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of [[smallpox vaccination]], which it may resemble.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nBCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection. The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars. The insertion to the [[deltoid muscle]] is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given [[intradermal]]ly. If given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional [[lymph nodes]], causing either suppurative (production of [[pus]]) and non-suppurative [[lymphadenitis]]. Conservative management is usually adequate for non-suppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need [[needle aspiration]]. For non-resolving suppuration, [[surgical excision]] may be required.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\nDr. [[R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] [WHO]).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of [[smallpox vaccination]], which it may resemble.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nBCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection. The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars. The insertion to the [[deltoid muscle]] is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given [[intradermal]]ly. If given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional [[lymph nodes]], causing either suppurative (production of [[pus]]) and non-suppurative [[lymphadenitis]]. Conservative management is usually adequate for non-suppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need [[needle aspiration]]. For non-resolving suppuration, [[surgical excision]] may be required. Evidence for the treatment of these complications is scarce.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Treating BCG-induced disease in children|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 23440826|pages = CD008300|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008300.pub2|first = Carlos A.|last = Cuello-Garc\u00eda|first2 = Giordano|last2 = P\u00e9rez-Gaxiola|first3 = Carlos|last3 = Jim\u00e9nez Guti\u00e9rrez|pmc = 6532703}}</ref>\n\nUncommonly, breast and [[gluteal]] abscesses can occur due to haematogenous (carried by the blood) and lymphangiomatous spread.

Still, they are similar enough to their wild ancestors to provide some degree of immunity against human tuberculosis.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\nDr. [[R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] [WHO]).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

Throughout continental Europe, the three-door was called '''Opel Frontera Sport''', with the '''Vauxhall Frontera Sport''' title used in the United Kingdom, and '''Holden Frontera Sport''' in Australasia.\n\nThe long-wheelbase (five-door) version was available as the Isuzu Wizard in Japan, and in North America as '''Isuzu Rodeo''' and the [[Honda Passport]]. [[Opel]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], and [[Holden]] each also sold rebadged versions of the five-door as the '''Opel Frontera''', '''Vauxhall Frontera''', and '''Holden Frontera'''. It was also sold as the '''Chevrolet Frontera''' in Egypt, the '''Isuzu Cameo''' and '''Isuzu Vega''' in [[Thailand]], the '''Isuzu Frontier''' in South America, and as '''Chevrolet Rodeo''' in Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia.\n__TOC__{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|First|UCS55|UCS69}} First generation (UCS55/UCS69GW; 1989\u20131998) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 1st-Isuzu-Rodeo.jpg\n| caption = Isuzu Rodeo\n| aka = Isuzu Amigo <br> Isuzu MU Wizard<br />Isuzu Cameo (Thailand only)<br />Isuzu Rodeo<br />Isuzu Vega (Thailand only)<br />Chevrolet Frontera<br />Chevrolet Rodeo<br />Holden Frontera<br />[[Honda Jazz]]<br />Honda Passport<br />Opel Frontera<br />Vauxhall Frontera\n| production = 1989\u20131998<br />1993\u20132002 (Thailand)<br />1998\u20132003 (Egypt)\n| assembly = {{ubl |Japan: [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa]] ([[Isuzu Motors#Japan|Fujisawa Plant]]) |Egypt: [[6th of October City]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Satyam |url=http://www.gmegypt.com/content_data/LAAM/ME/en/GBPME/999/EG/gm_history.html |title=GM Egypt History |publisher=GM Egypt |accessdate=19 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010141548/http://www.gmegypt.com/content_data/LAAM/ME/en/GBPME/999/EG/gm_history.html |archivedate=10 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> |Thailand: [[Rayong]] |United Kingdom: [[Luton]] |United States: [[Lafayette, Indiana]]}}\n| designer = Hiromu Wada (1987)<ref>{{cite web|title=Automotive vehicle|url=https://www.google.com/patents/USD318827}}</ref>\n| related = [[Isuzu Faster]] (TF)\n| engine = 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZD1|4ZD1]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.4&nbsp;L ''[[C24SE]]'' I4 (GM, Aus)<br />2.4&nbsp;L ''[[C24NE]]'' I4 (Euro)<br />2.6&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZE1|4ZE1]]'' I4<br />3.1&nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LG6|LG6]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (GM)<br />3.2&nbsp;L ''[[Isuzu V engine#6VD1|6VD1/6VD1W]]'' V6<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JA1|4JA1]]'' [[Diesel engine|diesel]] I4 (Cameo, [[Thailand|TH]])<br />2.8&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JB1|4JB1-T]]'' [[Turbodiesel|turbo diesel]] I4<br />3.0&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JH1|4JH1-T]]'' turbo diesel I4<br />3.1&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JG2|4JG2]]'' turbo diesel I4\n| transmission = 5-speed manual<br />4-speed ''[[GM 4L30-E transmission|4L30-E]]'' automatic\n| wheelbase = SWB: {{convert|91.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />LWB: {{convert|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|3490|-|3820|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1989-1992 Isuzu MU (UCS55) hardtop (2015-07-16).jpg|thumb|left|1989\u20131992 Isuzu MU (UCS55) 3-door (Australia)]]\n\nThe three-door Isuzu MU made its debut in Japan during 1989, with the five-door MU Wizard introduced the following year. Based on the [[Isuzu Faster#TF|Isuzu Faster (TF)]] pickup truck of 1988, both the three- and five-door models shared bodywork and most internal components from the front doors forward. Like the Faster pickup, the MU and MU Wizard featured rear- and four-wheel drive layout configurations. Japanese sales were limited by the fact that the exterior width dimensions were not in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]], and the engine displacement obligated Japanese drivers for higher levels of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, [[Honda]] retailed three-door versions of the MU under the name [[Honda Jazz]] for the Japanese market under a model sharing arrangement that resulted in several Isuzu models being badged Honda and vice versa.\n\n=== Market ===\n;North America\nSales of the three-door began in the United States during the second quarter of 1989 under the Isuzu Amigo name. A 2.3-liter ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZD1|4ZD1]]'' [[inline-four engine]], producing {{convert|76|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} came standard with the RWD while the 4WD was offered with the 2.6-liter ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZE1|4ZE1]]'' engine. The transmission was initially [[manual transmission|manual]] only. There were very limited options for the early Amigo including air conditioning, seating for two or four, and two trim levels to choose from, S or XS. Some of the model year changes throughout production included: small cosmetic alterations for 1991, the standardization of the 2.6-liter engine for 1992, and the added availability of a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] on the RWD version for 1992 and 1993. No major changes were made for 1993, but for 1994, a high mount rear stop light was added, power steering and mirrors were made standard. The Amigo was dropped by Isuzu in the US market in 1994. A limited number of XS-F editions (with the \"F\" standing for \"Frontera\") were produced which had additional options such as power windows and locking, four-wheel [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] (ABS) (inactive in low-range 4WD mode, only active on the rear wheels in 4WD high-range). This version of the Amigo had only 49-state emissions (reasons unknown) and there are no official sales numbers, although most dealers agree there were fewer than 75 sold. The only badging that shows this model is a sport blue XS symbol with a sport-font \"F\" beside it (also sport blue).\n\n[[File:Isuzu Amigo XS.jpg|thumb|left|1990\u20131994 Isuzu Amigo XS (US)]]\n[[File:Isuzu Wizard 004.JPG|thumb|left|1995\u20131998 Isuzu MU Wizard 3.1 D Turbo Type X (UCS69GW; Japan)]]\n\nIsuzu introduced the five-door Isuzu Rodeo to the United States in 1990 for the 1991 model year. It was available with either a 2.6-liter inline-four engine rated at {{convert|89|kW|hp}} or a 3.1-liter [[V6 engine]] made by [[General Motors]] (GM) which had the same power output as the 2.6, but had more torque. An automatic transmission was available for the V6. The Rodeo, like the Amigo was available in both RWD and 4WD, with the latter featuring manually [[locking hubs]] on the S version and automatically locking hubs on the XS and top-of-the-line LS. Rear-wheel ABS were standard feature on 4WDs. A RWD manual transmission model with a {{convert|21.9|usgal|L|abbr=on}} tank was rated at {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} in city driving by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], and {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} on the highway. A 4WD model with the V6 and automatic transmission was rated at {{convert|15|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway.\n\nAll Rodeos had a rear seat bottom which folded forward and rear seat back which folded down, extending the {{convert|35|cuft|L|adj=on}} cargo area. The vehicle's lug wrench was stored under the seat bottom, concealed by a carpeted [[Velcro]] flap. The jack was located behind a plastic panel in the rear left of the cargo area along with the rear windshield washer fluid reservoir if equipped. The LS was available with privacy glass, [[velour]] upholstery, and split-folding rear seats. A secret locking compartment was fitted in the depths of the center console below a removable cassette storage bin. The vehicle weighed {{convert|3490|-|3820|lb|kg}}, depending on engine and options.\n\nFor the 1993 model year, Isuzu replaced the GM V6 engine with their own 3.2-liter 24-valve [[SOHC]] V6 which was rated at {{convert|130|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Manually locking hubs were eliminated, but the floor-mounted [[transfer case]] shifter remained. The 1993 Rodeo featured a recalibrated suspension system, softened spring rates and softened shock valving. The Rodeo now weighed between {{convert|3536|-|4120|lb|kg}} and the EPA rating was {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|21|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway. Also for 1993, a ''[[Family II engine#D-TEC|Family II]]'' 2.4&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine from [[Holden]] was introduced, and the Rodeo gained a third brake light above the rear window and a more refined center console. The \"V6\" badge on V6 models was moved behind the front wheels. Midway through 1995, the Rodeo received an updated dashboard and steering wheel, both of which added airbags. The \"ISUZU\" badge on the front grille also shrunk in size. For 1996 Isuzu increased the power of their 3.2-liter V6 up to {{convert|145|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|262|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque, and the top level trim LS received the same 16-inch aluminium wheels as the [[Isuzu Bighorn|Trooper]], and was available in two-tone exterior colors.\n\nIsuzu sold 24,612 Rodeos in 1991 and 45,257 Rodeos in 1992.<ref name=1993Trib>Mateja, Jim.

It was launched in November 1991 and built at the former [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford van]] factory in [[Luton]], England; it would become known as the IBC factory (''I''suzu ''B''edford ''C''ompany). In the 1980s the plant had come under joint control between Isuzu and General Motors, with the Frontera being built alongside a number of other commercial vehicle models. The Australian and New Zealand version of the model range was known as the Holden Frontera and these were also produced at the Luton facility. The Frontera was Vauxhall's answer to the growing demand for 4X4 vehicles in Europe - particularly the right-hand drive British market - during the 1980s, where [[Japan]]ese imported products from [[Daihatsu]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Nissan]], [[Suzuki]] and [[Toyota]] had proven hugely successful, not to mention the success of the long-running British [[Land Rover]] and [[Range Rover]]. Despite the vast and growing competition in the 4X4 market, the Frontera sold well throughout Europe.\n\nThe early cars (to 1995) had a choice of engines, with the LWB available with either a 2.4-liter petrol (C24NE) engine (developed in the Opel Manta i240) or the 2.3-liter diesel (23DTR) engine originally fitted in the Bedford CF van and Vauxhall Carlton. The Frontera sport (Isuzu Amigo) was available with the 2.0-liter petrol Vauxhall Cavalier engine (C20NE).\n\nIn 1995, the model went through a facelift and the Frontera received rear coil springs and a new line up of engines. The SWB gained a new 2.0-liter petrol (X20 series) engine, updated trim, and also the first diesel engine available for the SWB, the 2.8-liter (4JB1-TC). The LWB also had new engines, with the 2.2-liter petrol (X22SE) and the 2.8 diesel 4JB1-TC being made available.\n\nIn the 1996\u20131997 models interior trim, including the dashboard, was changed, and a new 2.5-liter diesel (''[[VM Motori|VM]]41'') engine was fitted. This engine was also used in the [[Range Rover Classic]] and [[Jeep Cherokee]] in the UK.\n\nA redesign took place in 1998, and the Frontera was produced in Britain for a total of 13 years until it was finally discontinued in 2004.\n\n;Australasia\n[[Holden]] of Australia and New Zealand introduced the MU under the Holden Frontera badge in October 1995. Designated the ''UT'' or ''M7'' series, the Holden was based on the three-door body and manufactured in the United Kingdom.<ref name=marque>[http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/040524_Holden_Frontera.htm Holden Frontera 1998\u20132005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511134814/http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/040524_Holden_Frontera.htm |date=11 May 2013 }} Retrieved from www.marque.com.au on 23 February 2010</ref> It was offered in one level of trim, the \"Sport 4 \u00d7 4\", They were offered in both 5 speed manual and 4 speed automatic, diesel and petrol. \n\nPetrol models featured the 6VD1 V6 engine.

It featured a 4-cylinder turbo charged watercooled in-line direct injection and also a high revving high output diesel engine with its VE rotary injection pump. These models were more sought after due to its reliability status compared to its similar 4 cylinder 8 OHV brother the 4JG2-t.\n\nThe later 3.1L (3,059 cc) 4JG2-t producing 114 PS (84 kW; 112 hp) at 3600 rpm, and 260 N\u22c5m (192 lb\u22c5ft) at 2000 rpm. The 4JG2 is an indirect injection engine and was upgraded from mechanical injection to electronically controlled mechanical injection. The 4JG2 also powered other Larger Isuzu vehicles such as the Mu Wizard, Bighorn and Trooper.\n\n;Asia\nJiangling ([[Jiangling Motors]] Corporation Limited) Landwind in China produces a copy of the Isuzu Rodeo for the Chinese market. It is the first SUV to fail the [[EuroNCAP]] crash tests. The Landwind is based on the first generation Rodeo although there was no collaboration between JMC and Isuzu or GM. While the Landwind looks like the Rodeo it is not an Isuzu vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nFor the Thai market, the MU Wizard was sold as the Isuzu Cameo (1993\u20131996) and Isuzu Vega (1999\u20132004) in Thailand.

The Amigo was originally only available only as a soft top with a five-speed transmission. Standard rear-mounted spare tire, ABS, and removable sunroof rounded out the feature set. Fender flares and special 16-inch wheels were available on the V6 and 4WD models. The Rodeo could also be optioned with a rear-mounted spare tire and its own 16-inch wheels on higher trim packages.\n\nA new 2.2-liter ''[[X22SE]]'' engine built by [[Holden]] in Australia served as the base engine. Isuzu also offered the {{convert|205|hp|kW|abbr=on}} ''[[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu V engine|6VD1]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] that produced {{convert|214|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at 3000&nbsp;rpm. Fuel consumption is an estimated {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway. From a technical perspective, the Rodeo and Amigo were built with a rigid frame that has eight crossmembers. Front suspension has independent lower and upper arms, with a solid rear axle. The Rodeo and Amigo 4WD models came with a modified Dana 44 rear axle and push-button four-wheel drive. They also had a traditional floor mounted lever for switching from high- to low-range. Underneath, both vehicles came with protective skid plates as a standard feature.\n\nThe North American Isuzu Amigo and Isuzu Rodeo were built at the [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.|Subaru Isuzu Automotive, Inc.]] assembly plant in [[Lafayette, Indiana]].\n\n[[File:2004 Isuzu Rodeo -- 10-20-2010.jpg|thumb|2003-2004 Isuzu Rodeo (US)]]\n* 1998: Second generation Rodeo and Amigo debut.\n* 1999: The Amigo gains a hardtop version and an optional automatic transmission. The Amigo logo is changed to block letters to better match the Rodeo and other Isuzu models.\n* 2000: The Rodeo and Amigo receive a visual refresh with beefier bumpers, new headlights, taillights, and grille designs. On the inside, new seats and seat fabrics are introduced. The Amigo gets its own unique grille, light gray bumpers with faux bumper guard, matching light gray fender flares, and black-trimmed headlights. For the five-door Rodeo, adjustable shock absorbers were new this year and 16-inch tires became standard on all models. Cruise control was now standard on V6 Rodeos, and an automatic transmission became standard on the LSE edition. A new ''Intelligent Suspension Control'' featuring a dashboard button to adjust shock damping between ''sport'' and ''normal'' settings became standard on the LSE and optional on LS models. The Honda Passport did not get the adjustable-shock system. A new Ironman package debuted for the LS, marking Isuzu's sponsorship of the Ironman triathlon competition. The package included white or black paint over gray lower body panels, crossbars for the roof rack, and special graphics.\n* 2001: In celebration of Isuzu's 85th year, an Anniversary Edition was added, along with a revised Ironman Package. The Amigo is renamed the Rodeo Sport.\n* 2002: Last model year for Rodeo sales in Canada, as a result of Isuzu withdrawing from Canada after the 2002 model year. This is also the last year for the [[Honda Passport]].\n* 2003: New grille and headlights debut; as well as a revised dash and steering wheel. Last year for the Rodeo Sport. Halfway through the 2003 model year Isuzu switched to the [[Aisin AW30-40LS]] automatic transmission. This resulted in 4WD models losing their physical shifter and gaining a dash mounted knob to engage high and low-range.\n* 2004: The Rodeo Sport (three-door model) is discontinued as well as the four-cylinder engine on the Rodeo. However, a new optional 3.5-liter {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=on}} engine debuts.

Vehicles with more severe corrosion would have a reinforcement bracket installed.  In some cases, corrosion was so severe that repairs could not be made, resulting in Isuzu and Honda purchasing vehicles from the owners. The final MU rolled of the assembly line in June 5, 2004.\n\n;Europe\n[[File:Opel Frontera front 20080118.jpg|thumb|Opel Frontera (Europe)]]\n[[File:2000 Vauxhall Frontera Limited DTi 2.2 Front (1).jpg|thumb|Vauxhall Frontera (United Kingdom)]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the second generation Isuzu MU and Wizard were sold as the Vauxhall Frontera (five-door) and Vauxhall Frontera Sport (three-door). In continental Europe it was sold as the Opel Frontera (five-door) and Opel Frontera Sport (three-door).\n\nAfter General Motors took full control over the IBC Vehicles factory in 1998, the Frontera production line was planned to be transferred to General Motors' Vauxhall plant in [[Ellesmere Port]]. However, with the closure of the Vauxhall Luton plant the decision to move was reversed. In 1998 the new model series was introduced with a choice of 2.2- petrol, 2.2-liter diesel (''X22DTH'') and 3.2-liter V6 petrol engines. Further modifications were carried out on the diesel engine post-2001, with the final version to be fitted in the marque being the 2.2-liter (''Y22'') version. This model met the Euro 4 Emissions standard.\n\nThe Frontera was discontinued from production at IBC Luton in 2004 (the final models in the UK were produced in Olympus trim). In Australia and New Zealand, the Holden Frontera was replaced by a Holden badged version of the [[Chevrolet Captiva]] model range.\n\n;Australasia\nHolden in Australia and New Zealand also retailed the second generation model from February 1999 as the ''UE'' or ''MX'' series Frontera. This time, both three- and five-door bodies were offered\u2014now produced in the US.<ref name=marque/> The five-door models had the 3.2-liter V6 engine rated at {{convert|151|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|290|Nm|0|abbr=on}} with optional [[automatic transmission]], whilst the three-door Frontera Sport retained a four-cylinder engine and manual transmission only. Although the Frontera Sport came in just one specification, the five-door wagon offered base, S and SE trims. Holden facelifted the model in 2000 with a revised front grille and front bumper, reshaped headlamps and new taillamp lenses. In late 2001, a second upgrade arrived, bringing reductions in engine noise, the fitment of an electronic throttle, a change to the SE model's ABS calibration to bring improvements to dirt road performance, and several interior upgrades. Holden discontinued the Frontera Sport in June 2002. The five-door wagon continued until 2003, with enough production stockpiled to last until mid-2004, but it was ultimately semi-replaced with the [[Holden Commodore (VY)#Adventra|Adventra]] in 2003.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:2000 Holden Frontera (UE) Sport hardtop (2015-11-13) 01.jpg|Holden Frontera Sport 3-door\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Isuzu MU}}\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n{{Opel}}\n{{Opel timeline}}\n{{Vauxhall Motors}}\n\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|MU]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Compact sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport utility vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the automobile sold in between 2002 and 2013 as the \"Isuzu MU-7\", and its successor, the \"Isuzu MU-X\"|Isuzu D-Max}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Isuzu MU\n| image = 2001-2003 Isuzu Rodeo.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[Isuzu]]\n| production = 1989\u20132004\n| class = [[Mid-size car|Mid-size]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[station wagon|wagon]]<br />5-door [[station wagon|wagon]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[Front-engine, four-wheel drive layout|four-wheel drive]]\n| successor = '''For Opel/Vauxhall:'''<br />[[Opel Antara]] (Europe)<br />Vauxhall Antara (United Kingdom)<br /><br />'''For Isuzu:'''<br />[[Isuzu Ascender]] (North America)<br />[[Isuzu Alterra|Isuzu MU-7]] (Southeast Asia)<br /><br />'''For Honda Passport:'''<br />[[Honda Pilot]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Isuzu MU''' is a mid-size [[SUV]] that was produced by the Japan-based manufacturer [[Isuzu]].

This time, the five-door version dropped the \"MU\" prefix, to become the '''Isuzu Wizard'''. The acronym \"MU\" is short for \"Mysterious Utility\". Isuzu manufactured several variations to the MU and its derivates for sale in other countries.\n\nThe short-wheelbase (three-door) version was sold as the Isuzu MU and '''Honda Jazz''' in Japan, with the names '''Isuzu Amigo''' and later '''Isuzu Rodeo Sport''' used in the United States. Throughout continental Europe, the three-door was called '''Opel Frontera Sport''', with the '''Vauxhall Frontera Sport''' title used in the United Kingdom, and '''Holden Frontera Sport''' in Australasia.\n\nThe long-wheelbase (five-door) version was available as the Isuzu Wizard in Japan, and in North America as '''Isuzu Rodeo''' and the [[Honda Passport]]. [[Opel]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], and [[Holden]] each also sold rebadged versions of the five-door as the '''Opel Frontera''', '''Vauxhall Frontera''', and '''Holden Frontera'''. It was also sold as the '''Chevrolet Frontera''' in Egypt, the '''Isuzu Cameo''' and '''Isuzu Vega''' in [[Thailand]], the '''Isuzu Frontier''' in South America, and as '''Chevrolet Rodeo''' in Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia.\n__TOC__{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|First|UCS55|UCS69}} First generation (UCS55/UCS69GW; 1989\u20131998) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 1st-Isuzu-Rodeo.jpg\n| caption = Isuzu Rodeo\n| aka = Isuzu Amigo <br> Isuzu MU Wizard<br />Isuzu Cameo (Thailand only)<br />Isuzu Rodeo<br />Isuzu Vega (Thailand only)<br />Chevrolet Frontera<br />Chevrolet Rodeo<br />Holden Frontera<br />[[Honda Jazz]]<br />Honda Passport<br />Opel Frontera<br />Vauxhall Frontera\n| production = 1989\u20131998<br />1993\u20132002 (Thailand)<br />1998\u20132003 (Egypt)\n| assembly = {{ubl |Japan: [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa]] ([[Isuzu Motors#Japan|Fujisawa Plant]]) |Egypt: [[6th of October City]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Satyam |url=http://www.gmegypt.com/content_data/LAAM/ME/en/GBPME/999/EG/gm_history.html |title=GM Egypt History |publisher=GM Egypt |accessdate=19 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010141548/http://www.gmegypt.com/content_data/LAAM/ME/en/GBPME/999/EG/gm_history.html |archivedate=10 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> |Thailand: [[Rayong]] |United Kingdom: [[Luton]] |United States: [[Lafayette, Indiana]]}}\n| designer = Hiromu Wada (1987)<ref>{{cite web|title=Automotive vehicle|url=https://www.google.com/patents/USD318827}}</ref>\n| related = [[Isuzu Faster]] (TF)\n| engine = 2.3&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZD1|4ZD1]]'' [[inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.4&nbsp;L ''[[C24SE]]'' I4 (GM, Aus)<br />2.4&nbsp;L ''[[C24NE]]'' I4 (Euro)<br />2.6&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZE1|4ZE1]]'' I4<br />3.1&nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LG6|LG6]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (GM)<br />3.2&nbsp;L ''[[Isuzu V engine#6VD1|6VD1/6VD1W]]'' V6<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JA1|4JA1]]'' [[Diesel engine|diesel]] I4 (Cameo, [[Thailand|TH]])<br />2.8&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JB1|4JB1-T]]'' [[Turbodiesel|turbo diesel]] I4<br />3.0&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JH1|4JH1-T]]'' turbo diesel I4<br />3.1&nbsp;L ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4JG2|4JG2]]'' turbo diesel I4\n| transmission = 5-speed manual<br />4-speed ''[[GM 4L30-E transmission|4L30-E]]'' automatic\n| wheelbase = SWB: {{convert|91.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />LWB: {{convert|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|3490|-|3820|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1989-1992 Isuzu MU (UCS55) hardtop (2015-07-16).jpg|thumb|left|1989\u20131992 Isuzu MU (UCS55) 3-door (Australia)]]\n\nThe three-door Isuzu MU made its debut in Japan during 1989, with the five-door MU Wizard introduced the following year. Based on the [[Isuzu Faster#TF|Isuzu Faster (TF)]] pickup truck of 1988, both the three- and five-door models shared bodywork and most internal components from the front doors forward. Like the Faster pickup, the MU and MU Wizard featured rear- and four-wheel drive layout configurations. Japanese sales were limited by the fact that the exterior width dimensions were not in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]], and the engine displacement obligated Japanese drivers for higher levels of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, [[Honda]] retailed three-door versions of the MU under the name [[Honda Jazz]] for the Japanese market under a model sharing arrangement that resulted in several Isuzu models being badged Honda and vice versa.\n\n=== Market ===\n;North America\nSales of the three-door began in the United States during the second quarter of 1989 under the Isuzu Amigo name. A 2.3-liter ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZD1|4ZD1]]'' [[inline-four engine]], producing {{convert|76|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} came standard with the RWD while the 4WD was offered with the 2.6-liter ''[[list of Isuzu engines#4ZE1|4ZE1]]'' engine. The transmission was initially [[manual transmission|manual]] only. There were very limited options for the early Amigo including air conditioning, seating for two or four, and two trim levels to choose from, S or XS. Some of the model year changes throughout production included: small cosmetic alterations for 1991, the standardization of the 2.6-liter engine for 1992, and the added availability of a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] on the RWD version for 1992 and 1993. No major changes were made for 1993, but for 1994, a high mount rear stop light was added, power steering and mirrors were made standard. The Amigo was dropped by Isuzu in the US market in 1994. A limited number of XS-F editions (with the \"F\" standing for \"Frontera\") were produced which had additional options such as power windows and locking, four-wheel [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] (ABS) (inactive in low-range 4WD mode, only active on the rear wheels in 4WD high-range). This version of the Amigo had only 49-state emissions (reasons unknown) and there are no official sales numbers, although most dealers agree there were fewer than 75 sold. The only badging that shows this model is a sport blue XS symbol with a sport-font \"F\" beside it (also sport blue).\n\n[[File:Isuzu Amigo XS.jpg|thumb|left|1990\u20131994 Isuzu Amigo XS (US)]]\n[[File:Isuzu Wizard 004.JPG|thumb|left|1995\u20131998 Isuzu MU Wizard 3.1 D Turbo Type X (UCS69GW; Japan)]]\n\nIsuzu introduced the five-door Isuzu Rodeo to the United States in 1990 for the 1991 model year. It was available with either a 2.6-liter inline-four engine rated at {{convert|89|kW|hp}} or a 3.1-liter [[V6 engine]] made by [[General Motors]] (GM) which had the same power output as the 2.6, but had more torque. An automatic transmission was available for the V6. The Rodeo, like the Amigo was available in both RWD and 4WD, with the latter featuring manually [[locking hubs]] on the S version and automatically locking hubs on the XS and top-of-the-line LS. Rear-wheel ABS were standard feature on 4WDs. A RWD manual transmission model with a {{convert|21.9|usgal|L|abbr=on}} tank was rated at {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} in city driving by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], and {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} on the highway. A 4WD model with the V6 and automatic transmission was rated at {{convert|15|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway.\n\nAll Rodeos had a rear seat bottom which folded forward and rear seat back which folded down, extending the {{convert|35|cuft|L|adj=on}} cargo area. The vehicle's lug wrench was stored under the seat bottom, concealed by a carpeted [[Velcro]] flap. The jack was located behind a plastic panel in the rear left of the cargo area along with the rear windshield washer fluid reservoir if equipped. The LS was available with privacy glass, [[velour]] upholstery, and split-folding rear seats. A secret locking compartment was fitted in the depths of the center console below a removable cassette storage bin. The vehicle weighed {{convert|3490|-|3820|lb|kg}}, depending on engine and options.\n\nFor the 1993 model year, Isuzu replaced the GM V6 engine with their own 3.2-liter 24-valve [[SOHC]] V6 which was rated at {{convert|130|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Manually locking hubs were eliminated, but the floor-mounted [[transfer case]] shifter remained. The 1993 Rodeo featured a recalibrated suspension system, softened spring rates and softened shock valving. The Rodeo now weighed between {{convert|3536|-|4120|lb|kg}} and the EPA rating was {{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|21|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway. Also for 1993, a ''[[Family II engine#D-TEC|Family II]]'' 2.4&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine from [[Holden]] was introduced, and the Rodeo gained a third brake light above the rear window and a more refined center console. The \"V6\" badge on V6 models was moved behind the front wheels. Midway through 1995, the Rodeo received an updated dashboard and steering wheel, both of which added airbags. The \"ISUZU\" badge on the front grille also shrunk in size. For 1996 Isuzu increased the power of their 3.2-liter V6 up to {{convert|145|kW|hp|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|262|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque, and the top level trim LS received the same 16-inch aluminium wheels as the [[Isuzu Bighorn|Trooper]], and was available in two-tone exterior colors.\n\nIsuzu sold 24,612 Rodeos in 1991 and 45,257 Rodeos in 1992.<ref name=1993Trib>Mateja, Jim.

It was launched in November 1991 and built at the former [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford van]] factory in [[Luton]], England; it would become known as the IBC factory (''I''suzu ''B''edford ''C''ompany). In the 1980s the plant had come under joint control between Isuzu and General Motors, with the Frontera being built alongside a number of other commercial vehicle models. The Australian and New Zealand version of the model range was known as the Holden Frontera and these were also produced at the Luton facility. The Frontera was Vauxhall's answer to the growing demand for 4X4 vehicles in Europe - particularly the right-hand drive British market - during the 1980s, where [[Japan]]ese imported products from [[Daihatsu]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Nissan]], [[Suzuki]] and [[Toyota]] had proven hugely successful, not to mention the success of the long-running British [[Land Rover]] and [[Range Rover]]. Despite the vast and growing competition in the 4X4 market, the Frontera sold well throughout Europe.\n\nThe early cars (to 1995) had a choice of engines, with the LWB available with either a 2.4-liter petrol (C24NE) engine (developed in the Opel Manta i240) or the 2.3-liter diesel (23DTR) engine originally fitted in the Bedford CF van and Vauxhall Carlton. The Frontera sport (Isuzu Amigo) was available with the 2.0-liter petrol Vauxhall Cavalier engine (C20NE).\n\nIn 1995, the model went through a facelift and the Frontera received rear coil springs and a new line up of engines. The SWB gained a new 2.0-liter petrol (X20 series) engine, updated trim, and also the first diesel engine available for the SWB, the 2.8-liter (4JB1-TC). The LWB also had new engines, with the 2.2-liter petrol (X22SE) and the 2.8 diesel 4JB1-TC being made available.\n\nIn the 1996\u20131997 models interior trim, including the dashboard, was changed, and a new 2.5-liter diesel (''[[VM Motori|VM]]41'') engine was fitted. This engine was also used in the [[Range Rover Classic]] and [[Jeep Cherokee]] in the UK.\n\nA redesign took place in 1998, and the Frontera was produced in Britain for a total of 13 years until it was finally discontinued in 2004.\n\n;Australasia\n[[Holden]] of Australia and New Zealand introduced the MU under the Holden Frontera badge in October 1995. Designated the ''UT'' or ''M7'' series, the Holden was based on the three-door body and manufactured in the United Kingdom.<ref name=marque>[http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/040524_Holden_Frontera.htm Holden Frontera 1998\u20132005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511134814/http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/040524_Holden_Frontera.htm |date=11 May 2013 }} Retrieved from www.marque.com.au on 23 February 2010</ref> It was offered in one level of trim, the \"Sport 4 \u00d7 4\", They were offered in both 5 speed manual and 4 speed automatic, diesel and petrol. \n\nPetrol models featured the 6VD1 V6 engine.

These models were more sought after due to its reliability status compared to its similar 4 cylinder 8 OHV brother the 4JG2-t.\n\nThe later 3.1L (3,059 cc) 4JG2-t producing 114 PS (84 kW; 112 hp) at 3600 rpm, and 260 N\u22c5m (192 lb\u22c5ft) at 2000 rpm. The 4JG2 is an indirect injection engine and was upgraded from mechanical injection to electronically controlled mechanical injection. The 4JG2 also powered other Larger Isuzu vehicles such as the Mu Wizard, Bighorn and Trooper.\n\n;Asia\nJiangling ([[Jiangling Motors]] Corporation Limited) Landwind in China produces a copy of the Isuzu Rodeo for the Chinese market. It is the first SUV to fail the [[EuroNCAP]] crash tests. The Landwind is based on the first generation Rodeo although there was no collaboration between JMC and Isuzu or GM.

The Rodeo weighs in at a little over {{convert|3800|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}, with an EPA estimated gas mileage for 2007 of {{convert|16|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway for the two wheel drive model, and {{convert|15|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} city and {{convert|20|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway for the four wheel drive model.\n\nThe second generation Isuzu Rodeo and its twin, the [[Honda Passport]] received a rating of \"marginal\" in the IIHS frontal offset test conducted at {{convert|40|mph|abbr=on}} due to a possible injury to the right leg and the head, but dummy movement was reasonably well controlled.\n\n=== Markets ===\n;North America\n\nThe Amigo made a comeback in the US for 1998 after a three-year hiatus with the second generation model alongside the redesigned Rodeo. The Amigo was originally only available only as a soft top with a five-speed transmission. Standard rear-mounted spare tire, ABS, and removable sunroof rounded out the feature set. Fender flares and special 16-inch wheels were available on the V6 and 4WD models. The Rodeo could also be optioned with a rear-mounted spare tire and its own 16-inch wheels on higher trim packages.\n\nA new 2.2-liter ''[[X22SE]]'' engine built by [[Holden]] in Australia served as the base engine. Isuzu also offered the {{convert|205|hp|kW|abbr=on}} ''[[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu V engine|6VD1]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] that produced {{convert|214|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at 3000&nbsp;rpm. Fuel consumption is an estimated {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} highway. From a technical perspective, the Rodeo and Amigo were built with a rigid frame that has eight crossmembers. Front suspension has independent lower and upper arms, with a solid rear axle. The Rodeo and Amigo 4WD models came with a modified Dana 44 rear axle and push-button four-wheel drive. They also had a traditional floor mounted lever for switching from high- to low-range. Underneath, both vehicles came with protective skid plates as a standard feature.\n\nThe North American Isuzu Amigo and Isuzu Rodeo were built at the [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.|Subaru Isuzu Automotive, Inc.]] assembly plant in [[Lafayette, Indiana]].\n\n[[File:2004 Isuzu Rodeo -- 10-20-2010.jpg|thumb|2003-2004 Isuzu Rodeo (US)]]\n* 1998: Second generation Rodeo and Amigo debut.\n* 1999: The Amigo gains a hardtop version and an optional automatic transmission. The Amigo logo is changed to block letters to better match the Rodeo and other Isuzu models.\n* 2000: The Rodeo and Amigo receive a visual refresh with beefier bumpers, new headlights, taillights, and grille designs. On the inside, new seats and seat fabrics are introduced. The Amigo gets its own unique grille, light gray bumpers with faux bumper guard, matching light gray fender flares, and black-trimmed headlights. For the five-door Rodeo, adjustable shock absorbers were new this year and 16-inch tires became standard on all models. Cruise control was now standard on V6 Rodeos, and an automatic transmission became standard on the LSE edition. A new ''Intelligent Suspension Control'' featuring a dashboard button to adjust shock damping between ''sport'' and ''normal'' settings became standard on the LSE and optional on LS models. The Honda Passport did not get the adjustable-shock system. A new Ironman package debuted for the LS, marking Isuzu's sponsorship of the Ironman triathlon competition. The package included white or black paint over gray lower body panels, crossbars for the roof rack, and special graphics.\n* 2001: In celebration of Isuzu's 85th year, an Anniversary Edition was added, along with a revised Ironman Package. The Amigo is renamed the Rodeo Sport.\n* 2002: Last model year for Rodeo sales in Canada, as a result of Isuzu withdrawing from Canada after the 2002 model year. This is also the last year for the [[Honda Passport]].\n* 2003: New grille and headlights debut; as well as a revised dash and steering wheel. Last year for the Rodeo Sport. Halfway through the 2003 model year Isuzu switched to the [[Aisin AW30-40LS]] automatic transmission. This resulted in 4WD models losing their physical shifter and gaining a dash mounted knob to engage high and low-range.\n* 2004: The Rodeo Sport (three-door model) is discontinued as well as the four-cylinder engine on the Rodeo. However, a new optional 3.5-liter {{convert|250|hp|0|abbr=on}} engine debuts. Added midyear was a standard tire-pressure monitor.\n\nIn October 2010, the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) recalled 1998\u20132002 Rodeos, 2002 [[Isuzu Axiom]]s, and 1998\u20132002 [[Honda Passport]]s due to corrosion of the vehicle's frame in the vicinity of the rear suspension.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2010/10/recall-alert-1998-2002-isuzu-rodeo-2002-isuzu-axiom-1998-2002-honda-passport.html |title=Recall Alert: 1998\u20132002 Isuzu Rodeo, 2002 Isuzu Axiom, 1998\u20132002 Honda Passport \u2013 KickingTires |publisher=Blogs.cars.com |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref> Vehicles without corrosion in the affected area would be treated with an anti-corrosion compound.  Vehicles with more severe corrosion would have a reinforcement bracket installed.  In some cases, corrosion was so severe that repairs could not be made, resulting in Isuzu and Honda purchasing vehicles from the owners. The final MU rolled of the assembly line in June 5, 2004.\n\n;Europe\n[[File:Opel Frontera front 20080118.jpg|thumb|Opel Frontera (Europe)]]\n[[File:2000 Vauxhall Frontera Limited DTi 2.2 Front (1).jpg|thumb|Vauxhall Frontera (United Kingdom)]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the second generation Isuzu MU and Wizard were sold as the Vauxhall Frontera (five-door) and Vauxhall Frontera Sport (three-door). In continental Europe it was sold as the Opel Frontera (five-door) and Opel Frontera Sport (three-door).\n\nAfter General Motors took full control over the IBC Vehicles factory in 1998, the Frontera production line was planned to be transferred to General Motors' Vauxhall plant in [[Ellesmere Port]]. However, with the closure of the Vauxhall Luton plant the decision to move was reversed. In 1998 the new model series was introduced with a choice of 2.2- petrol, 2.2-liter diesel (''X22DTH'') and 3.2-liter V6 petrol engines. Further modifications were carried out on the diesel engine post-2001, with the final version to be fitted in the marque being the 2.2-liter (''Y22'') version. This model met the Euro 4 Emissions standard.\n\nThe Frontera was discontinued from production at IBC Luton in 2004 (the final models in the UK were produced in Olympus trim). In Australia and New Zealand, the Holden Frontera was replaced by a Holden badged version of the [[Chevrolet Captiva]] model range.\n\n;Australasia\nHolden in Australia and New Zealand also retailed the second generation model from February 1999 as the ''UE'' or ''MX'' series Frontera. This time, both three- and five-door bodies were offered\u2014now produced in the US.<ref name=marque/> The five-door models had the 3.2-liter V6 engine rated at {{convert|151|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|290|Nm|0|abbr=on}} with optional [[automatic transmission]], whilst the three-door Frontera Sport retained a four-cylinder engine and manual transmission only. Although the Frontera Sport came in just one specification, the five-door wagon offered base, S and SE trims. Holden facelifted the model in 2000 with a revised front grille and front bumper, reshaped headlamps and new taillamp lenses. In late 2001, a second upgrade arrived, bringing reductions in engine noise, the fitment of an electronic throttle, a change to the SE model's ABS calibration to bring improvements to dirt road performance, and several interior upgrades. Holden discontinued the Frontera Sport in June 2002. The five-door wagon continued until 2003, with enough production stockpiled to last until mid-2004, but it was ultimately semi-replaced with the [[Holden Commodore (VY)#Adventra|Adventra]] in 2003.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:2000 Holden Frontera (UE) Sport hardtop (2015-11-13) 01.jpg|Holden Frontera Sport 3-door\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Isuzu MU}}\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n{{Opel}}\n{{Opel timeline}}\n{{Vauxhall Motors}}\n\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|MU]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Compact sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport utility vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Nintendo fan since 2008", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSecond generation (UER25FW, UES25FW, UES73FW; 1998\u20132004)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isuzu_MU"}
