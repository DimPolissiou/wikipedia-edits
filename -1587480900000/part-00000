Schrader\n}}\n'''Henry R. Schrader''' [[Special agent|ASAC]] is a fictional character of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] drama series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and its spin-off series ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. He is portrayed by [[Dean Norris]] and was created by series creator [[Vince Gilligan]]. Hank's character development over the course of the series and Norris' performance have been critically acclaimed.\n\n== Character biography ==\nHank is the brother-in-law of main character [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], and is a [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agent in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Throughout the series, he leads the investigation of the [[methamphetamine]] cook \"Heisenberg\"&nbsp;\u2014 unaware that the elusive drug kingpin is his own brother-in-law. Hank is also faced with numerous threats from the rival drug cartels which takes a toll on Hank's mental health as the series progresses, and eventually starts taking more extreme measures to find \"Heisenberg\" and arrest him.\n\n=== Background ===\nHank is a special agent with the DEA, where he rose through the ranks to become the supervisor of all investigations handled by his [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] office, under the watchful eye of [[Special agent|ASAC]] [[List of Breaking Bad characters#ASAC George Merkert|George Merkert]] ([[Michael Shamus Wiles]]) and SAC Ramey. He is married to Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]), with whom he has no children. He is close to his family-by-marriage, the Whites: Walt, his wife (and Marie's sister) [[Skyler White|Skyler]] ([[Anna Gunn]]), and their son Walter Jr. ([[RJ Mitte]]). In contrast with the mild-mannered Walt, Hank is extroverted, ambitious and apparently fearless, eager to take on dangerous investigations to further his career. Beneath his tough, unflappable exterior, however, he struggles with some of his own vulnerabilities: he had cold feet when it came to marrying Marie, and despite his ambition he is afraid to move outside his comfort zone at work, primarily due to the effects of [[PTSD]] since killing [[Tuco Salamanca]] and subsequent bloody encounters during drug busts in El Paso.\n\nAs a hobby, Hank [[homebrewing|home brews]] his own beer, which he calls \"Schraderbr\u00e4u\". After he gets shot by the Salamanca cousins, he spends part of season 4 taking up [[mineral collecting]], much to Marie's chagrin.\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWhen Domingo Molina (later to be known as \"Krazy-8\") is arrested on drug possession, he spends two days in prison then announces he is willing to talk. Hank and his partner Steven Gomez arrive to interrogate him. Just as Domingo is prepared to give out a list of dead drops that belong to Gus Fring's drug operation, Saul Goodman interrupts the meeting acting as Domingo's lawyer. Hank immediately is suspicious of this and believes there's no dead drops, but Saul's fast-talking leads to Hank accepting to release Domingo into his protection as a personal CI after getting and confirming Domingo's information on the dead drops. Hank and Steven leave, unaware this was a rouse by Saul, at Lalo Salamanca's command, not only to get Domingo out of prison before he could talk about the Salamanca drug operation, but to expose their competitors to the DEA. Though Nacho Varga warns Gus Fring about this, he is unable to act without alerting Lalo to the mole in his organization.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 1)}}\nDuring Walt's fiftieth birthday party, Hank shows off a news report covering a [[methamphetamine|meth]] bust that he had led. Later, Walt takes up Hank's offer to go on a [[ride-along]]. Based on a tip from Krazy-8, Hank's team raids a [[meth lab]] while Walt stays in the car, where he witnesses his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]) escaping the bust, but does not say anything to Hank. Secretly, Walt engages with Jesse to start to produce their own meth using chemistry equipment from the school Walt teaches at. Due to the precursors they used, the product gains a unique blue tint but has an extremely high purity. Walt takes the name \"Heisenberg\" as he and Jesse sell the blue meth to the local drug trade. The blue meth and \"Heisenberg\" quickly draw the attention of Hank and the DEA. Hank's initial lead traces back to Walt's school, but Hank wrongly arrests the school janitor.\n\nHank generally teases Walt through this period. However, when Walt tells the family that he is suffering from inoperable [[lung cancer]], Hank promises to be there for him, and to take care of Walter Jr. and Walt's unborn daughter should he die. He also takes Walter Jr. under his wing, trying to \"scare him straight\" when he believes the boy is smoking [[marijuana]]. When Hank sees Walt interacting with Jesse, Walt explains that Jesse is supplying him with marijuana.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter a drug deal goes bad, Walt and Jesse are kidnapped by the unstable [[Tuco Salamanca]] ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and taken to a remote abode with his uncle, retired drug cartel boss Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]). Hank helps with efforts to find Walt, and traces him via Jesse to Tuco's abode. Just before Hank arrives, Walt and Jesse manage to escape, wounding Tuco in the process. Hank kills Tuco in a shootout and arrests Hector. Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse and flee back to Albuquerque, where Walt explains his disappearance to Skyler as being in a [[fugue state]]. Hank questions Hector on the blue meth and Heisenberg, but Hector refuses to answer. Hank also questions Jesse, but Jesse provides no conclusive statements to provide leads to Heisenberg.\n\nHank is promoted and transferred to the [[El Paso, Texas]] DEA office for killing Tuco. Though initially happy, Hank starts having [[panic attack]]s. During a joint DEA/Mexican police operation, an informant is beheaded and their head used to hide an explosive, killing several DEA agents and officers; Hank escapes unarmed as he had fled on having a panic attack upon seeing the head of the informant. Hank develops symptoms of [[PTSD]] and transfers back to the Albuquerque office to continue his investigation into the blue meth.\n\nMeanwhile, Walt and Jesse, having lost the Salamancas for selling meth, have engaged with Jesse's friends. One, Badger ([[Matt L. Jones]]), gets caught in a police sting, and Hank presses hard on Badger to reveal Heisenberg's identity. Walt gets help from the fast-talking lawyer [[Saul Goodman]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) to get a [[fall guy]] to act as Heisenberg, but Badger fingers the wrong person while Hank and his team look on. Walt and Jesse rush in to obstruct Hank's view to correct Badger in time. While Saul's hired Heisenberg is arrested, Hank suspects the real Heisenberg remains at larger.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nHank remains committed to finding the identity of Heisenberg, but his superiors start to believe the case is unsolvable and want him to move onto other investigations. He picks up a lead on  the case after Jesse used some of the blue meth to pay for gas for the  [[recreational vehicle]] he and Walt use to cook the product. Ultimately, he identifies Jesse as the RV's owner, and races to the junkyard where Jesse has been staying in the RV. Hank calls Walt on the news, giving Walt the opportunity to beat Hank there. Hiding in the RV with Jesse, Walt gives instructions to Jesse to prevent Hank from entering the RV legally, and gets Saul to lure Hank away from the junkyard by phoning him with a fake claim about his wife Marie being hospitalized. He abruptly leaves, allowing them to crush the RV in the meantime, destroying the evidence. After seeing the RV gone when he returns, a infuriated Hank goes to Jesse's home and assaults him. Jesse is hospitalized, while Hank is suspended from the DEA without pay.\n\nAs Hank is leaving his disciplinary meeting, he receives an anonymous call from [[Gus Fring]], warning him that he is about to be killed by [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Leonel & Marco Salamanca|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] (Daniel and Luis Moncada) in revenge for killing Tuco; though Gus has told the brothers to target Hank instead of Walt, Gus realized that Walt would be unable to cook meth for him if Hank died. Hank is able to kill one brother and mortally wound the other, but he himself becomes temporarily paralyzed from the waist down after the gunfight, with the doctors fearing he may become [[paraplegic]] without physical therapy. Marie finds their insurance will not cover this, and Walt and Skyler agree to help cover the costs, unbeknown to Hank.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nHank struggles through his recovery due to his helplessness, harshly lashing out at Marie, and tries to collect minerals to pass the time. His interest is piqued when the [[Albuquerque Police Department]] ask him to help with looking over evidence from the murder of [[Gale Boetticher]] ([[David Costabile]]), who had been Walt's lab assistant at Gus' meth superlab under an industrial laundry. Among the evidence is a lab notebook with Gale's notes on the construction of the lab, the synthesis of meth, and other details that leads Hank to believe Gale was Heisenberg. During a shared dinner, Hank talks about Gale's notebook, and Walt drunkenly suggests Gale was merely copying the real Heisenberg's work.\n\nHank is curious at this comment, and reviewing the evidence again, makes a connection between Gale and Gus. Hank, only just starting to physically recover, leans on Walt to help him investigate Gus' activities, the Los Pollos Hermanos' restaurant chain and its [[parent company]], Madrigal Electromotive, and properties they own in Albuquerque, including the industrial laundry. Walt panics knowing that this not only may lead Hank to discover that he is Heisenberg, but may lead to Gus taking deadly action to end Hank's investigation, since Walt and Jesse were already on thin ice for killing Gale. Walt has Saul fake a threat on Hank's life, and the DEA arrange for around-the-clock protection for Hank's and Walt's families, temporarily halting Hank's investigation. This also allows Walt to operate without interference to take out Gus by working with Hector after learning he and Gus are nemesis. Hector claims to want to talk to the DEA, and Hank is brought under protection to help with the interview, but Hector then refuses to cooperate and is returned to the nursing home. This was part of Walt's plan as Gus, learning of Hector's interview, goes to see Hector, upon which Hector triggers a pipe bomb Walt had planted on his wheelchair, killing them both. Walt and Jesse subsequently destroy the superlab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n===== Part 1 =====\nThe destruction of the superlab leads to evidence directly tying to Gus and the drug trade, and Hank is heralded as a hero. They secure a laptop from Gus' office and put it into police evidence. On learning of this, Walt and Jesse with help from Mike Ehrmantraut ([[Jonathan Banks]]) use a giant electromagnetic to try to wipe the laptop, making a mess of the evidence room. The police find nothing on the laptop but from a picture frame broken in the destruction, the numbers to several accounts of Gus' that point to Mike's informants that have been helping to keep the drug trade secret. By this point, Hank's superiors have concluded that Gus was Heisenberg and tell Hank to drop the case, but Hank still believes there is more, and want to pursue the informants tied to the accounts. Walt is forced to kill Mike to get the informants' names and arrange for their murders before they can be questioned.\n\nSeveral months pass, in which Walt has accumulated over $70 million and has left the drug trade. With no blue meth on streets and no leads, Hank has given up his investigation and moved on. At a dinner at the Whites, Hank goes to the bathroom and while there, pages through a copy of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' that Gale had given Walter. He recognizes the writing from Gale's notebook, and from Gale's dedication to Walt, is shocked to conclude that Walt is Heisenberg.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nHank feigns a stomach bug to leave early, taking the copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' with him, and suffers another panic attack. Later, he sneaks a GPS onto Walt's car. Walt discovers the copy of the book missing and the GPS device, similar to the one used to track Gus, and confronts Hank. Hank asserts Walt is Heisenberg, but Walt neither confirms or denies, only that his cancer has returned and by the time Hank can prove anything, he will be dead. Hank demands Walt to tell Skyler and the children to stay with him, but Walt refuses. Hank tries to talk to Skyler, but she stays silent on what she knows. Marie learns some details through Skyler, but Hank still has insufficient evidence to go forward against Walt.\n\nJesse is arrested and Hank tries to convince Jesse to speak out against Walt, but Jesse refuses, still angered over Hank's prior assault. Walt crafts a DVD that appears to be a self-confession from Hank that he is Heisenberg, threatening to release it if Hank does not stop trying to interfere with his family. Hank also realizes that his post-shooting physical therapy was paid with Walt's drug money, making him an [[accessory after the fact]]. Hank once again approaches Jesse and finally convinces they need to work together to stop Walt.  Hank initially tries to have Jesse meet with Walt while wearing a [[wire tap]], but Jesse backs out at the last minute, fearing Walt will kill him. Instead, Jesse suggests they target Walt's money, which they know has been hidden as cash somewhere locally. After trying to locate it on their own, Hank has Jesse call Walt pretending to have found the money and preparing to destroy it. Walt takes off to the money, buried on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]], and when he finds it intact, realizes Jesse has fooled him, and orders a hit on Jesse through Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]). Jesse soon arrives with Hank and Gomez, and Walt tries to call off the hit, preparing to surrender himself to Hank. However, Jack's men arrive before then, and a firefight breaks out, which kills Gomez and critically wounds Hank. Walt pleads to Jack to spare Hank's life, offering his entire fortune to Jack. Hank refuses to beg for his life and asks Walt how such an intelligent man could be too naive to see that Jack had already made his decision. Hank then tells Jack to do what he has to do and Jack kills him with a shot to the head.\n\nJack's men bury Hank and Gomez' bodies in the hole Walt had stored his money. Several months later, after Walt had fled the state with a new identity, he returns to make his amends, and gives Skyler the location of the bodies, knowing it will help her to plea bargain her case.\n\n== Casting and creation ==\nPrior to being cast in ''Breaking Bad'', [[Dean Norris]] had a history of being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as law enforcement and military type characters. Norris reasons \"I guess you have a certain look, it's kind of an authoritative law enforcement-type look, and that look is certainly the first thing that people cast you with before you get a chance to do some acting.\"<ref name=\"Gross\">{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Terry|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/07/19/203326959/dean-norris-on-playing-good-in-breaking-bad|title=Breaking Bad \"Blood Money\" Review \"Hello, Carol.\"|work=[[NPR]]|date=July 19, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Huffington\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/breaking-bad-dean-norris-hank_n_2615390.html|title='Breaking Bad': Dean Norris Asked Vince Gilligan To Kill Hank Off So He Could Do A Comedy Pilot|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 4, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Schilling\">{{cite web|first=Mary Kaye|last=Schilling|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/breaking-bad-dean-norris-interview.html|title=Dean Norris on the Breaking Bad Premiere, Hank\u2019s Machismo, and Bryan Cranston's Overachiever E-mails|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=New York Media|location=New York City|date=August 11, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Moore\">{{cite web|first=Frazier|last=Moore|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=503796|title='Breaking Bad' star Dean Norris never misses it|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=August 22, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> [[Vince Gilligan]] had talked to an actual DEA agent about creating Hank's character.<ref name=\"Schilling\" />\n\n== Development ==\nCritics have commented on the character's development.

Norris and Gilligan both wanted Hank to be smart and capable; \"Otherwise,\" Norris said, \"he\u2019s just a doofus and you'll dismiss him.\" Norris notes that Hank bullies Walt in the pilot and the first season, and makes racist jokes about his DEA partner [[Steven Gomez]]. However, his racist jokes toward Gomez were toned down as the series progressed and were turned into good-natured ribbing.<ref name=\"Schilling\" />\n\nSean Collins of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' considered Hank in the pilot to be an \"obnoxious blowhard\". Gilligan had not considered the character as much more than a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to Walt at first. However, as Gilligan got to know Norris, he developed Hank into a \"more nuanced and complex character\" who makes both \"personal and professional growth\".<ref name=\"Collins2\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Sean T.|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/q-a-breaking-bad-star-dean-norris-on-the-many-faces-of-hank-20120813|title=Q&A: 'Breaking Bad' Star Dean Norris on the Many Faces of Hank|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrazier Moore of [[The Associated Press]] writes of Hank's introduction in the pilot; \"Hank seemed a potentially problematic character.

Norris attributed the PTSD to the fact that it is actually very rare for law enforcement officers to draw their weapons, let alone kill someone in a combat situation. Mary Kaye Schilling praised the way the writers handled the PTSD and how they waited an entire season to explain the cause of it.<ref name=\"Schilling\" /> Noel Murray of ''[[The A.V.

Norris was eventually filmed from the side to obscure the fact that he was crying.<ref name=\"Schilling\" />\n\nIn the early [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]] episodes, Hank is bedridden after being shot multiple times in the chest by Tuco Salamanca's cousins, and is increasingly hostile toward Marie while she tries to take care of him.

Schrader\n}}\n'''Henry R. Schrader''' [[Special agent|ASAC]] is a fictional character of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] drama series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and its spin-off series ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. He is portrayed by [[Dean Norris]] and was created by series creator [[Vince Gilligan]]. Hank's character development over the course of the series and Norris' performance have been critically acclaimed.\n\n== Character biography ==\nHank is the brother-in-law of main character [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], and is a [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agent in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Throughout the series, he leads the investigation of the [[methamphetamine]] cook \"Heisenberg\"&nbsp;\u2014 unaware that the elusive drug kingpin is his own brother-in-law. Hank is also faced with numerous threats from the rival drug cartels which takes a toll on Hank's mental health as the series progresses, and eventually starts taking more extreme measures to find \"Heisenberg\" and arrest him.\n\n=== Background ===\nHank is a special agent with the DEA, where he rose through the ranks to become the supervisor of all investigations handled by his [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] office, under the watchful eye of [[Special agent|ASAC]] [[List of Breaking Bad characters#ASAC George Merkert|George Merkert]] ([[Michael Shamus Wiles]]) and SAC Ramey. He is married to Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]), with whom he has no children. He is close to his family-by-marriage, the Whites: Walt, his wife (and Marie's sister) [[Skyler White|Skyler]] ([[Anna Gunn]]), and their son Walter Jr. ([[RJ Mitte]]). In contrast with the mild-mannered Walt, Hank is extroverted, ambitious and apparently fearless, eager to take on dangerous investigations to further his career. Beneath his tough, unflappable exterior, however, he struggles with some of his own vulnerabilities: he had cold feet when it came to marrying Marie, and despite his ambition he is afraid to move outside his comfort zone at work, primarily due to the effects of [[PTSD]] since killing [[Tuco Salamanca]] and subsequent bloody encounters during drug busts in El Paso.\n\nAs a hobby, Hank [[homebrewing|home brews]] his own beer, which he calls \"Schraderbr\u00e4u\". After he gets shot by the Salamanca cousins, he spends part of season 4 taking up [[mineral collecting]], much to Marie's chagrin.\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWhen Domingo Molina (later to be known as \"Krazy-8\") is arrested on drug possession, he spends two days in prison then announces he is willing to talk. Hank and his partner Steven Gomez arrive to interrogate him. Just as Domingo is prepared to give out a list of dead drops that belong to Gus Fring's drug operation, Saul Goodman interrupts the meeting acting as Domingo's lawyer. Hank immediately is suspicious of this and believes there's no dead drops, but Saul's fast-talking leads to Hank accepting to release Domingo into his protection as a personal CI after getting and confirming Domingo's information on the dead drops. Hank and Steven leave, unaware this was a rouse by Saul, at Lalo Salamanca's command, not only to get Domingo out of prison before he could talk about the Salamanca drug operation, but to expose their competitors to the DEA. Though Nacho Varga warns Gus Fring about this, he is unable to act without alerting Lalo to the mole in his organization.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 1)}}\nDuring Walt's fiftieth birthday party, Hank shows off a news report covering a [[methamphetamine|meth]] bust that he had led. Later, Walt takes up Hank's offer to go on a [[ride-along]]. Based on a tip from Krazy-8, Hank's team raids a [[meth lab]] while Walt stays in the car, where he witnesses his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]) escaping the bust, but does not say anything to Hank. Secretly, Walt engages with Jesse to start to produce their own meth using chemistry equipment from the school Walt teaches at. Due to the precursors they used, the product gains a unique blue tint but has an extremely high purity. Walt takes the name \"Heisenberg\" as he and Jesse sell the blue meth to the local drug trade. The blue meth and \"Heisenberg\" quickly draw the attention of Hank and the DEA. Hank's initial lead traces back to Walt's school, but Hank wrongly arrests the school janitor.\n\nHank generally teases Walt through this period. However, when Walt tells the family that he is suffering from inoperable [[lung cancer]], Hank promises to be there for him, and to take care of Walter Jr. and Walt's unborn daughter should he die. He also takes Walter Jr. under his wing, trying to \"scare him straight\" when he believes the boy is smoking [[marijuana]]. When Hank sees Walt interacting with Jesse, Walt explains that Jesse is supplying him with marijuana.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter a drug deal goes bad, Walt and Jesse are kidnapped by the unstable [[Tuco Salamanca]] ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and taken to a remote abode with his uncle, retired drug cartel boss Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]). Hank helps with efforts to find Walt, and traces him via Jesse to Tuco's abode. Just before Hank arrives, Walt and Jesse manage to escape, wounding Tuco in the process. Hank kills Tuco in a shootout and arrests Hector. Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse and flee back to Albuquerque, where Walt explains his disappearance to Skyler as being in a [[fugue state]]. Hank questions Hector on the blue meth and Heisenberg, but Hector refuses to answer. Hank also questions Jesse, but Jesse provides no conclusive statements to provide leads to Heisenberg.\n\nHank is promoted and transferred to the [[El Paso, Texas]] DEA office for killing Tuco. Though initially happy, Hank starts having [[panic attack]]s. During a joint DEA/Mexican police operation, an informant is beheaded and their head used to hide an explosive, killing several DEA agents and officers; Hank escapes unarmed as he had fled on having a panic attack upon seeing the head of the informant. Hank develops symptoms of [[PTSD]] and transfers back to the Albuquerque office to continue his investigation into the blue meth.\n\nMeanwhile, Walt and Jesse, having lost the Salamancas for selling meth, have engaged with Jesse's friends. One, Badger ([[Matt L. Jones]]), gets caught in a police sting, and Hank presses hard on Badger to reveal Heisenberg's identity. Walt gets help from the fast-talking lawyer [[Saul Goodman]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) to get a [[fall guy]] to act as Heisenberg, but Badger fingers the wrong person while Hank and his team look on. Walt and Jesse rush in to obstruct Hank's view to correct Badger in time. While Saul's hired Heisenberg is arrested, Hank suspects the real Heisenberg remains at larger.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nHank remains committed to finding the identity of Heisenberg, but his superiors start to believe the case is unsolvable and want him to move onto other investigations. He picks up a lead on  the case after Jesse used some of the blue meth to pay for gas for the  [[recreational vehicle]] he and Walt use to cook the product. Ultimately, he identifies Jesse as the RV's owner, and races to the junkyard where Jesse has been staying in the RV. Hank calls Walt on the news, giving Walt the opportunity to beat Hank there. Hiding in the RV with Jesse, Walt gives instructions to Jesse to prevent Hank from entering the RV legally, and gets Saul to lure Hank away from the junkyard by phoning him with a fake claim about his wife Marie being hospitalized. He abruptly leaves, allowing them to crush the RV in the meantime, destroying the evidence. After seeing the the RV gone when he returns, a infuriated Hank goes to Jesse's home and assaults him. Jesse is hospitalized, while Hank is suspended from the DEA without pay.\n\nAs Hank is leaving his disciplinary meeting, he receives an anonymous call from [[Gus Fring]], warning him that he is about to be killed by [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Leonel & Marco Salamanca|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] (Daniel and Luis Moncada) in revenge for killing Tuco; though Gus has told the brothers to target Hank instead of Walt, Gus realized that Walt would be unable to cook meth for him if Hank died. Hank is able to kill one brother and mortally wound the other, but he himself becomes temporarily paralyzed from the waist down after the gunfight, with the doctors fearing he may become [[paraplegic]] without physical therapy. Marie finds their insurance will not cover this, and Walt and Skyler agree to help cover the costs, unbeknown to Hank.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nHank struggles through his recovery due to his helplessness, harshly lashing out at Marie, and tries to collect minerals to pass the time. His interest is piqued when the [[Albuquerque Police Department]] ask him to help with looking over evidence from the murder of [[Gale Boetticher]] ([[David Costabile]]), who had been Walt's lab assistant at Gus' meth superlab under an industrial laundry. Among the evidence is a lab notebook with Gale's notes on the construction of the lab, the synthesis of meth, and other details that leads Hank to believe Gale was Heisenberg. During a shared dinner, Hank talks about Gale's notebook, and Walt drunkenly suggests Gale was merely copying the real Heisenberg's work.\n\nHank is curious at this comment, and reviewing the evidence again, makes a connection between Gale and Gus. Hank, only just starting to physically recover, leans on Walt to help him investigate Gus' activities, the Los Pollos Hermanos' restaurant chain and its [[parent company]], Madrigal Electromotive, and properties they own in Albuquerque, including the industrial laundry. Walt panics knowing that this not only may lead Hank to discover that he is Heisenberg, but may lead to Gus taking deadly action to end Hank's investigation, since Walt and Jesse were already on thin ice for killing Gale. Walt has Saul fake a threat on Hank's life, and the DEA arrange for around-the-clock protection for Hank's and Walt's families, temporarily halting Hank's investigation. This also allows Walt to operate without interference to take out Gus by working with Hector after learning he and Gus are nemesis. Hector claims to want to talk to the DEA, and Hank is brought under protection to help with the interview, but Hector then refuses to cooperate and is returned to the nursing home. This was part of Walt's plan as Gus, learning of Hector's interview, goes to see Hector, upon which Hector triggers a pipe bomb Walt had planted on his wheelchair, killing them both. Walt and Jesse subsequently destroy the superlab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n===== Part 1 =====\nThe destruction of the superlab leads to evidence directly tying to Gus and the drug trade, and Hank is heralded as a hero. They secure a laptop from Gus' office and put it into police evidence. On learning of this, Walt and Jesse with help from Mike Ehrmantraut ([[Jonathan Banks]]) use a giant electromagnetic to try to wipe the laptop, making a mess of the evidence room. The police find nothing on the laptop but from a picture frame broken in the destruction, the numbers to several accounts of Gus' that point to Mike's informants that have been helping to keep the drug trade secret. By this point, Hank's superiors have concluded that Gus was Heisenberg and tell Hank to drop the case, but Hank still believes there is more, and want to pursue the informants tied to the accounts. Walt is forced to kill Mike to get the informants' names and arrange for their murders before they can be questioned.\n\nSeveral months pass, in which Walt has accumulated over $70 million and has left the drug trade. With no blue meth on streets and no leads, Hank has given up his investigation and moved on. At a dinner at the Whites, Hank goes to the bathroom and while there, pages through a copy of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' that Gale had given Walter. He recognizes the writing from Gale's notebook, and from Gale's dedication to Walt, is shocked to conclude that Walt is Heisenberg.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nHank feigns a stomach bug to leave early, taking the copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' with him, and suffers another panic attack. Later, he sneaks a GPS onto Walt's car. Walt discovers the copy of the book missing and the GPS device, similar to the one used to track Gus, and confronts Hank. Hank asserts Walt is Heisenberg, but Walt neither confirms or denies, only that his cancer has returned and by the time Hank can prove anything, he will be dead. Hank demands Walt to tell Skyler and the children to stay with him, but Walt refuses. Hank tries to talk to Skyler, but she stays silent on what she knows. Marie learns some details through Skyler, but Hank still has insufficient evidence to go forward against Walt.\n\nJesse is arrested and Hank tries to convince Jesse to speak out against Walt, but Jesse refuses, still angered over Hank's prior assault. Walt crafts a DVD that appears to be a self-confession from Hank that he is Heisenberg, threatening to release it if Hank does not stop trying to interfere with his family. Hank also realizes that his post-shooting physical therapy was paid with Walt's drug money, making him an [[accessory after the fact]]. Hank once again approaches Jesse and finally convinces they need to work together to stop Walt.  Hank initially tries to have Jesse meet with Walt while wearing a [[wire tap]], but Jesse backs out at the last minute, fearing Walt will kill him. Instead, Jesse suggests they target Walt's money, which they know has been hidden as cash somewhere locally. After trying to locate it on their own, Hank has Jesse call Walt pretending to have found the money and preparing to destroy it. Walt takes off to the money, buried on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]], and when he finds it intact, realizes Jesse has fooled him, and orders a hit on Jesse through Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]). Jesse soon arrives with Hank and Gomez, and Walt tries to call off the hit, preparing to surrender himself to Hank. However, Jack's men arrive before then, and a firefight breaks out, which kills Gomez and critically wounds Hank. Walt pleads to Jack to spare Hank's life, offering his entire fortune to Jack. Hank refuses to beg for his life and asks Walt how such an intelligent man could be too naive to see that Jack had already made his decision. Hank then tells Jack to do what he has to do and Jack kills him with a shot to the head.\n\nJack's men bury Hank and Gomez' bodies in the hole Walt had stored his money. Several months later, after Walt had fled the state with a new identity, he returns to make his amends, and gives Skyler the location of the bodies, knowing it will help her to plea bargain her case.\n\n== Casting and creation ==\nPrior to being cast in ''Breaking Bad'', [[Dean Norris]] had a history of being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as law enforcement and military type characters. Norris reasons \"I guess you have a certain look, it's kind of an authoritative law enforcement-type look, and that look is certainly the first thing that people cast you with before you get a chance to do some acting.\"<ref name=\"Gross\">{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Terry|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/07/19/203326959/dean-norris-on-playing-good-in-breaking-bad|title=Breaking Bad \"Blood Money\" Review \"Hello, Carol.\"|work=[[NPR]]|date=July 19, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Huffington\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/breaking-bad-dean-norris-hank_n_2615390.html|title='Breaking Bad': Dean Norris Asked Vince Gilligan To Kill Hank Off So He Could Do A Comedy Pilot|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 4, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Schilling\">{{cite web|first=Mary Kaye|last=Schilling|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/breaking-bad-dean-norris-interview.html|title=Dean Norris on the Breaking Bad Premiere, Hank\u2019s Machismo, and Bryan Cranston's Overachiever E-mails|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=New York Media|location=New York City|date=August 11, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Moore\">{{cite web|first=Frazier|last=Moore|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=503796|title='Breaking Bad' star Dean Norris never misses it|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=August 22, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> [[Vince Gilligan]] had talked to an actual DEA agent about creating Hank's character.<ref name=\"Schilling\" />\n\n== Development ==\nCritics have commented on the character's development.

Norris and Gilligan both wanted Hank to be smart and capable; \"Otherwise,\" Norris said, \"he\u2019s just a doofus and you'll dismiss him.\" Norris notes that Hank bullies Walt in the pilot and the first season, and makes racist jokes about his DEA partner [[Steven Gomez]]. However, his racist jokes toward Gomez were toned down as the series progressed and were turned into good-natured ribbing.<ref name=\"Schilling\" />\n\nSean Collins of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' considered Hank in the pilot to be an \"obnoxious blowhard\". Gilligan had not considered the character as much more than a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to Walt at first. However, as Gilligan got to know Norris, he developed Hank into a \"more nuanced and complex character\" who makes both \"personal and professional growth\".<ref name=\"Collins2\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Sean T.|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/q-a-breaking-bad-star-dean-norris-on-the-many-faces-of-hank-20120813|title=Q&A: 'Breaking Bad' Star Dean Norris on the Many Faces of Hank|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrazier Moore of [[The Associated Press]] writes of Hank's introduction in the pilot; \"Hank seemed a potentially problematic character. With his cocky, macho style, he was perilously close to a stereotype\"; however, he has said \"Norris has brought depth and nuance to his character, emerging as fully the equal of his fine fellow cast mates [...] as he displayed not just braggadocio but also emotional trauma.\" Norris and Gilligan admitted that Hank began as a \"mechanical construct\" whose main purpose was to provide [[comic relief]].<ref name=\"Moore\" />\n\nHank begins showing signs of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] in \"Breakage\" after killing [[Tuco Salamanca]] in \"Grilled\", the first deconstruction of his \"tough cop\" persona. Norris attributed the PTSD to the fact that it is actually very rare for law enforcement officers to draw their weapons, let alone kill someone in a combat situation. Mary Kaye Schilling praised the way the writers handled the PTSD and how they waited an entire season to explain the cause of it.<ref name=\"Schilling\" /> Noel Murray of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' compared season 1-era Hank to a \"veiled (and unacknowledged) [[Vic Mackey]] parody,\" but praised his development which began with his suffering PTSD.<ref name=\"Murray\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Noel|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/breakage,26220/|title='Breaking Bad' Breakage Review|work=[[The A.V.

Norris was eventually filmed from the side to obscure the fact that he was crying.<ref name=\"Schilling\" />\n\nIn the early [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]] episodes, Hank is bedridden after being shot multiple times in the chest by Tuco Salamanca's cousins, and is increasingly hostile toward Marie while she tries to take care of him.
