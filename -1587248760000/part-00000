The new district included the home of [[Bill Lowery (US politician)|Bill Lowery]], a fellow Republican who had represented most of the other side of San Diego for the past 12 years. They faced one another in the Republican primary. Despite Lowery's seniority, his involvement in the [[House banking scandal]] hurt him.

Cunningham breezed to victory in November.\n\nEven though the district (renumbered as the 50th after the 2000 census) was not nearly as conservative as the other two Republican-held districts in the San Diego area, Cunningham was reelected six times with no less than 55 percent of the vote.\n\nCunningham was a member of the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] and [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]] committees, and chaired the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Human Intelligence Analysis and Counterintelligence during the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]].

The new district included the home of [[Bill Lowery (US politician)|Bill Lowery]], a fellow Republican who had represented most of the other side of San Diego for the past 12 years. They faced one another in the Republican primary. Despite Lowery's seniority, his involvement in the [[House banking scandal]] hurt him. As polls showed Cunningham with a substantial lead, Lowery dropped out of the primary race, effectively handing Cunningham the nomination. Cunningham breezed to victory in November.\n\nEven though the district (renumbered as the 50th after the 2000 census) was not nearly as conservative as the other two Republican-held districts in the San Diego area, Cunningham was reelected six times with no less than 55 percent of the vote.\n\nCunningham was a member of the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] and [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]] committees, and chaired the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Human Intelligence Analysis and Counterintelligence during the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]]. He was considered a leading Republican expert on national security issues. He was also a champion of education, using his position on the Appropriations Education Subcommittee to steer federal dollars to schools in San Diego. After surgery for [[prostate cancer]] in 1998, he became a champion of early testing for the disease.\n\nCunningham was known for making controversial comments.

It is also responsible for clearing up any misunderstandings pertaining to the Spanish language. One of the main preoccupations of the Manual has been to provide alternatives to English words and phrases that have begun to influence the language. The manual also clears up any misinterpretations of how proper Spanish would utilize diverse linguistic aspects, such as pronunciation, orthography, and punctuation. The 19th edition was published in 2015. <!-- An example from the Manual reads:\n\n<blockquote>''Jugar un papel'' \u2013 la locuci\u00f3n ''jugar un papel'' aparece con bastante frecuencia en las noticias y se emplea cada vez m\u00e1s en el espa\u00f1ol tanto escrito como hablado, sin tener en cuenta que no es correcta\u2026 Entre las dieciocho acepciones que tiene el verbo ''jugar'' en espa\u00f1ol, no hay ninguna que autorice la expresi\u00f3n ''jugar un papel'' anglo-galicismo que tiene sus ra\u00edces en el ingles \u201cto play a role\u201d y en el franc\u00e9s \u201cjouer un r\u00f4le\u201d\u2026 Jugar un papel en el sentido de \u201cdesempe\u00f1ar una funci\u00f3n\u201d, \u201ccumplir con una misi\u00f3n o encargo\u201d, \u201cestar de acuerdo con la posici\u00f3n\u201d\u2026 es traducci\u00f3n servil y locuci\u00f3n tan inadmisible y ajena a nuestra lengua como lo ser\u00eda decir \u201cjugar una comedia\u201d (''to play a comedy'') o \u201cjugar al piano\u201d (''to play the piano'').</blockquote>\n\n For example, in regards to \u201cel [[seseo]]\u201d and \u201cel [[ceceo]]\u201d (the varying regionalistic ways that the letters \u2018s\u2019, \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018z\u2019 may be pronounced), the Manual of Urgent Spanish says:\n\n<blockquote>[E]l seseo, es decir, la pronunciaci\u00f3n de las letras c y z como s, es caracter\u00edstico de algunas zonas meridionales de la Pen\u00ednsula, de las islas Canarias y de Am\u00e9rica.

This [[elixir]] was also said to [[Panacea (medicine)|cure all diseases]]. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir. The concept originated in ancient India or China where the concept preceded that in Europe by millennia.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== China ===\n[[File:La expedici\u00f3n de Xu Fu, por Utagawa Kuniyoshi.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Xu Fu]]'s first expedition to the [[Mount Penglai|Mount of the immortals]]. By [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]\nIn ancient China, many [[emperor]]s sought the fabled elixir with varying results{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}. In the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent [[Taoist]] alchemist [[Xu Fu]] with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found [[Japan]] instead). When Qin Shi Huang visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.\n\nThe ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as [[jade]], [[cinnabar]] or [[hematite]] would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them.  [[Gold]] was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC.  The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to [[Sun Simiao]] (c. 581 \u2013 c. 682 CE),<ref>Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia, A Glick, T.F., A Livesey, S.J., Wallis, F., Routledge, p. 20 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582108/Tan-chin-yao-chueh|title=Tan chin yao chueh \u2013 occultism|work=britannica.com}}</ref> a famous medical specialist respectfully called \"King of Medicine\" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.\n\nMany of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed \"Elixir of Life\" conjured by alchemists.\n\n=== India ===\n[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.\n\nWith the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job\u2014they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.\n\nThe oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.\n\nIt is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]\nIn European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].\n\n===Japan===\nIn the eight-century ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'', {{nihongo|'waters of rejuvenation'|[[:ja:\u5909\u82e5\u6c34|\u5909\u82e5\u6c34]]|ochimizu}} are said to be in the possession of the moon god [[Tsukuyomi]]. Similarities have been noted with a folktale from the [[Ryukyu Islands]], in which the moon god decides to give man the water of life ({{lang-mvi|s\u00eflimiz\u00ef}}), and serpents the water of death (s\u00efnimiz\u00ef). However, the person entrusted with carrying the pails down to Earth gets tired and takes a break, and a serpent bathes in the water of life, rendering it unusable. This is said to be why serpents can rejuvenate themselves each year by shedding their skin while men are doomed to die.<ref name=\"Naumann2000\">{{cite book|author=Nelly Naumann|title=Japanese Prehistory: The Material and Spiritual Culture of the J\u014dmon Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yrla4QyhFasC&pg=PA133|year=2000|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-04329-8|page=133}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevsky |first1=Nikolai |authorlink1=Nikolai Nevsky |editor1-last=Masao |editor1-first=Oka |editor1-link=Masao Oka |title=\u6708\u3068\u4e0d\u6b7b [Tsuki to fushi] |date=April 1971 |publisher=\u5e73\u51e1\u793e |isbn=9784582801859 |url=https://docs.miko.org/index.php/%E6%9C%88%E3%81%A8%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%BB |accessdate=17 December 2018 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n== Names ==\nThe Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, \"al iksir\".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to \"the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]\" or \"the [[Fountain of Life]]\").  \"But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\"  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their \"liquid gold\": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.\n\n''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means \"water of life\".<ref>I.

Retrieved 12 February 2012.</ref>  \"Chashma-i-Kausar\" (not \"hasma\") is the \"Fountain of Bounty\", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, \"Amrit Ras\" means \"immortality juice\", \"Maha Ras\" means \"great juice\", and \"Soma Ras\" means \"juice of Soma\".  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  \"Ras\" later came to mean \"sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music\"; there are altogether nine of them.

The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed \"Elixir of Life\" conjured by alchemists.\n\n=== India ===\n[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.\n\nWith the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job\u2014they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.\n\nThe oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.\n\nIt is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}\n[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]\nIn European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].\n\n===Japan===\nIn the eight-century ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'', {{nihongo|'waters of rejuvenation'|[[:ja:\u5909\u82e5\u6c34|\u5909\u82e5\u6c34]]|ochimizu}} are said to be in the possession of the moon god [[Tsukuyomi]]. Similarities have been noted with a folktale from the [[Ryukyu Islands]], in which the moon god decides to give man the water of life ({{lang-mvi|s\u00eflimiz\u00ef}}), and serpents the water of death (s\u00efnimiz\u00ef). However, the person entrusted with carrying the pails down to Earth gets tired and takes a break, and a serpent bathes in the water of life, rendering it unusable. This is said to be why serpents can rejuvenate themselves each year by shedding their skin while men are doomed to die.<ref name=\"Naumann2000\">{{cite book|author=Nelly Naumann|title=Japanese Prehistory: The Material and Spiritual Culture of the J\u014dmon Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yrla4QyhFasC&pg=PA133|year=2000|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-04329-8|page=133}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevsky |first1=Nikolai |authorlink1=Nikolai Nevsky |editor1-last=Masao |editor1-first=Oka |editor1-link=Masao Oka |title=\u6708\u3068\u4e0d\u6b7b [Tsuki to fushi] |date=April 1971 |publisher=\u5e73\u51e1\u793e |isbn=9784582801859 |url=https://docs.miko.org/index.php/%E6%9C%88%E3%81%A8%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%BB |accessdate=17 December 2018 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n== Names ==\nThe Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, \"al iksir\".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to \"the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]\" or \"the [[Fountain of Life]]\").  \"But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\"  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their \"liquid gold\": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.\n\n''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means \"water of life\".<ref>I. K. Poonawala. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-ii-water-in-muslim-iranian-culture \"\u0100B ii. Water in Muslim Iranian culture\"].  ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 12 February 2012.</ref>  \"Chashma-i-Kausar\" (not \"hasma\") is the \"Fountain of Bounty\", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, \"Amrit Ras\" means \"immortality juice\", \"Maha Ras\" means \"great juice\", and \"Soma Ras\" means \"juice of Soma\".  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  \"Ras\" later came to mean \"sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music\"; there are altogether nine of them.  [[Mansarovar]], the \"mind lake\" is  the  holy  lake at the foot  of [[Mt. Kailash]] in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}\n\nThe elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including [[animation]], [[comics]], [[film|films]], musical compositions, [[novel|novels]], and [[video games]].

It is widely known for the production of drugs such as MS Contin, Oxycontin, and Ryzolt. In 1972, Contin (a controlled drug-release system) was developed. In 1984, its extended-release formulation of morphine, MS Contin was released. In 1996 its extended-release formulation of oxycodone, OxyContin was released.<ref name=\"Purduepharma.com_About\" />\n\nThe controversy behind the company emerged as a result of the drugs that they made and how they carried high potential for addiction. The most commonly abused medications that the company produces are MS Contin and OxyContin. Both can be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These ingestion methods create a significant risk to the abuser; they can result in overdose and death. Drug-seeking tactics that addicts undergo to obtain the medication include \"[[doctor shopping]]\", which is visiting a number of different physicians to obtain additional prescriptions and refusal to follow up with appropriate examinations. Along with the high potential for abuse among people without prescriptions, there is also a risk for physical dependency and reduced reaction or drug desensitization for patients that are prescribed them. Nevertheless, strong analgesic drugs remain indispensable to patients suffering from severe acute and cancer pain.<ref>World Health Organization. Cancer pain relief and palliative care. Geneva: WHO 1990</ref>\n\nOxyContin, introduced in 1995, was Purdue Pharma's breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that [[Arthur Sackler]] had pioneered decades earlier, the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements.

It is widely known for the production of drugs such as MS Contin, Oxycontin, and Ryzolt. In 1972, Contin (a controlled drug-release system) was developed. In 1984, its extended-release formulation of morphine, MS Contin was released. In 1996 its extended-release formulation of oxycodone, OxyContin was released.<ref name=\"Purduepharma.com_About\" />\n\nThe controversy behind the company emerged as a result of the drugs that they made and how they carried high potential for addiction. The most commonly abused medications that the company produces are MS Contin and OxyContin. Both can be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These ingestion methods create a significant risk to the abuser; they can result in overdose and death. Drug-seeking tactics that addicts undergo to obtain the medication include \"[[doctor shopping]]\", which is visiting a number of different physicians to obtain additional prescriptions and refusal to follow up with appropriate examinations. Along with the high potential for abuse among people without prescriptions, there is also a risk for physical dependency and reduced reaction or drug desensitization for patients that are prescribed them. Nevertheless, strong analgesic drugs remain indispensable to patients suffering from severe acute and cancer pain.<ref>World Health Organization. Cancer pain relief and palliative care. Geneva: WHO 1990</ref>\n\nOxyContin, introduced in 1995, was Purdue Pharma's breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that [[Arthur Sackler]] had pioneered decades earlier, the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements.
