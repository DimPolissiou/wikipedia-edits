Its pedestal is a bonfire made of railway sleepers. A plaque commemorates the abductees on the wall of the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Myers|first=Richard S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3zM1injK8QC&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=the+Martyr+Monument+hungary+esztergom&source=bl&ots=dKkSf7AhQf&sig=ACfU3U0upkn_0HdwDqXRCigWadwt0STgDA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtx-iHpNzoAhVQIKwKHf5bDDwQ6AEwDXoECAwQKA#v=onepage&q=the%20Martyr%20Monument%20hungary%20esztergom&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Social Thought, Social Science, and Social Policy: Supplement|last2=Varacalli|first2=Joseph A.|date=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8266-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://epiteszforum.hu/node/12112 \u00c9p\u00edt\u00e9szf\u00f3rum - Az esztergomi zsinag\u00f3ga \u00fajj\u00e1\u00e9led\u00e9se]\n* Pifk\u00f3 P\u00e9ter \u2013 Zachar Anna:Esztergom helyt\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja a kezdetekt\u0151l 1950-ig\n* Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom megye m\u0171eml\u00e9kjegyz\u00e9ke (2006)\n* Esztergom 2000 enciklop\u00e9dia\n* Annales Strigonienses 1994, 145. o.\n* [https://budapestbeacon.com/jobbik-books-synagogue-for-valentines-day-political-rally/ Budapest Beacon - Jobbik books synagogue for Valentine\u2019s day political rally]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:19th-century synagogues]]\n[[Category:Jewish Hungarian history]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Esztergom]]\n[[Category:Synagogues in Hungary]]\n", "name_user": "LucasGK123", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esztergom_Synagogue"}

Slater had the best performance, and scored the most touchdowns in the game.  Haddon, Hoagland, and Thompson also scored.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Slater had the best performance, and scored the most touchdowns in the game.  Haddon, Hoagland, and Thompson also scored.  The most points of the day were the result of fullback brown and his five PATs (at the time called goals after touchdowns, and worth 2 points) for 10 points.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193854/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349847459/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193877/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the roster of the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]].\n\n==History==\nThe stadium was built in the 1950s. Its original name was '''Krasnoye Znamya Stadium''', before it was attached to [[Minsk Tractor Works]] and renamed to Traktor Stadium in 1976. During Soviet years the stadium was a home ground for [[FC Traktor Minsk|Traktor Minsk]] in [[Belarusian SSR]] league as well as [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] reserves in the Soviet Reserves league.\n\nIn 1976, the stadium was renovated. During 1978\u20131980, it became a temporary home stadium for [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] senior team, while [[Dinamo Stadium (Minsk)|Dinamo Stadium]] was closed for renovation in preparation for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] football tournament.\n\nIn the 1990s, the stadium served as a home for several clubs, including [[FC Dinamo-93 Minsk|Dinamo-93 Minsk]], [[FC Ataka Minsk|Ataka Minsk]], as well as [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] in 1997 (while Dinamo Stadium was reserved only for international matches due to pitch condition). Second reconstruction started in 1997 and included installation of the fence and plastic seats.\n\nIn 2000s the stadium was shared between [[FC Partizan Minsk|MTZ-RIPO Minsk]] and [[FC Zvezda-BGU Minsk|Zvezda-BGU Minsk]].

It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]].\n\n==History==\nThe stadium was built in the 1950s. Its original name was '''Krasnoye Znamya Stadium''', before it was attached to [[Minsk Tractor Works]] and renamed to Traktor Stadium in 1976. During Soviet years the stadium was a home ground for [[FC Traktor Minsk|Traktor Minsk]] in [[Belarusian SSR]] league as well as [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] reserves in the Soviet Reserves league.\n\nIn 1976, the stadium was renovated. During 1978\u20131980 it became a temporary home stadium for [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] senior team, while [[Dinamo Stadium (Minsk)|Dinamo Stadium]] was closed for renovation in preparation for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] football tournament.\n\nIn the 1990s the stadium served as a home for several clubs, including [[FC Dinamo-93 Minsk|Dinamo-93 Minsk]], [[FC Ataka Minsk|Ataka Minsk]], as well as [[FC Dinamo Minsk|Dinamo Minsk]] in 1997 (while Dinamo Stadium was reserved only for international matches due to pitch condition). Second reconstruction started in 1997 and included installation of the fence and plastic seats.\n\nIn 2000s the stadium was shared between [[FC Partizan Minsk|MTZ-RIPO Minsk]] and [[FC Zvezda-BGU Minsk|Zvezda-BGU Minsk]]. Traktor Stadium hosted a [[2002 Belarusian Premier League]] decider match and in [[2010\u201311 Belarusian Cup]] final.

It takes its name from the [[Royal Navy]] ship HMS ''Racer'', which encountered the cyclone in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]]. Termed \"one of the most famous and destructive hurricanes of the century\" by meteorology historian [[David Ludlum]],<ref name=\"ludlum144\"/> the storm first affected [[Jamaica]] with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September&nbsp;26 and&nbsp;27, before entering the [[Gulf of Mexico]] by October&nbsp;1. As the hurricane struck northern [[Tamaulipas]] and southern [[Texas]], it slowed to a crawl and turned sharply northeastward. The storm battered the Gulf Coast from Texas to the [[Florida Panhandle]] between October&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;7. After crossing the [[Southeastern United States]], it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the [[Carolinas]] by October 9. \n\nThe effects of the tropical cyclone were far-reaching. [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], on the southern bank of the [[Rio Grande]], faced hurricane conditions for several days, with significant damage to ships. Many towns along the Texas shoreline were inundated by [[storm surge]], which flooded the coastal plains for many miles inland. [[Galveston Island]] was devastated, with nearly every building washed away and most vessels driven ashore. To the east, a water level rise of {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} on [[Lake Pontchartrain]] submerged low-lying areas of [[New Orleans]]. Many steamboats on the lake were wrecked and buildings along its shores demolished. Storm surge and wind damage extended into [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], but with less severity. In the interior Southeast, sugar cane and cotton crops bore heavy losses. As the weakening storm buffeted the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] on October&nbsp;9, the passenger steamship [[SS Home|SS&nbsp;''Home'']] ran aground about {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} off [[Cape Hatteras]] and rapidly broke up in the pounding surf.

It takes its name from the [[Royal Navy]] ship HMS ''Racer'', which encountered the hurricane in the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]]. Termed \"one of the most famous and destructive hurricanes of the century\" by meteorology historian [[David Ludlum]],<ref name=\"ludlum144\"/> the storm first affected [[Jamaica]] with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September&nbsp;26 and&nbsp;27, before entering the [[Gulf of Mexico]] by October&nbsp;1. As the hurricane approached northern [[Tamaulipas]] and southern [[Texas]], it slowed to a crawl and turned sharply northeastward. The storm battered the Gulf Coast from Texas to the [[Florida Panhandle]] between October&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;7. After crossing the [[Southeastern United States]], it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the [[Carolinas]] by October 9. \n\nThe effects of the tropical cyclone were far-reaching. [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], on the southern bank of the [[Rio Grande]], faced hurricane conditions for several days, with significant damage to ships. Many towns along the Texas shoreline were inundated by [[storm surge]], which flooded the coastal plains for many miles inland. [[Galveston Island]] was devastated, with nearly every building washed away and most vessels driven ashore. To the east, a water level rise of {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} on [[Lake Pontchartrain]] submerged low-lying areas of [[New Orleans]]. Many steamboats on the lake were wrecked and buildings along its shores demolished. Storm surge and wind damage extended into [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], but with less severity. In the interior Southeast, sugar cane and cotton crops bore heavy losses. As the weakening storm buffeted the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] on October&nbsp;9, the passenger steamship [[SS Home|SS&nbsp;''Home'']] ran aground about {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} off [[Cape Hatteras]] and rapidly broke up in the pounding surf. About 90 passengers and crewmen died in the wreck. Overall, Racer's hurricane killed an estimated 105&nbsp;people.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n[[File:Racer's hurricane approximate track.jpg|left|thumb|Approximate track of the hurricane from the [[Weather Prediction Center]]|alt=A map centered on the Gulf of Mexico, including parts of the northern Caribbean Sea, eastern Mexico, the Southeastern United States, and the Western Atlantic.

Fireman challenged corporate America to become more socially responsible and demonstrated that all corporations could succeed financially, while simultaneously serving the public good. He sold Reebok to Adidas in 2006, but his life and business ventures continue to reflect his philanthropy in serving people and communities throughout the country today. \n\n==Early Life and Education==\nFireman was born February 14, 1944 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, MA]] to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref name=rynecki>{{cite news|last1=Rynecki|first1=David|title=FIREMAN'S FANTASY|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/10/17/8358052/index.htm|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=Fortune|date=17 October 2005}}</ref> and raised in the working-class city of [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], also called 'Shoe City'.

Starting in 1986, Reebok acquired several companies to create a multinational corporation, including Avia, a rival athletic shoemaker; John A. Frye, the prestigious and stylish boot maker; Rockport, a company known for its sporting and casual shoes; and [[Ellesse]], an Italian company known for making expensive athletic shoes and clothing.

In 1995 Fireman purchased a mile of neglected and decaying New Jersey shoreline along the Hudson River that was an eyesore. The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was \u201ca toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/24/golf-barclays-pga-lifestyle-sports-golf-liberty-national.html|title=Inside A $250 Million Golf Course|last=Bertoni|first=Steven|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \u201cI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,\u201d Fireman says. \u201cI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world.
