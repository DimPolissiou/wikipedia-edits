Burden, J. Douglas Faires (2000), ''Numerical Analysis'', (7th Ed),  Brooks/Cole. {{isbn|0-534-38216-9}}.</ref> Choosing a small number ''h'',  ''h'' represents a small change in ''x'', and it can be either positive or negative.  The slope of this line is\n: <math>\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.</math>\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]] (also known as a first-order [[divided difference]]).\n\nThe slope of this secant line differs from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to ''h''. As ''h'' approaches zero, the slope of the secant line approaches the slope of the tangent line. Therefore, the true '''derivative of''' '''''f''''' '''at''' '''''x''''' is the limit of the value of the difference quotient as the secant lines get closer and closer to being a tangent line:\n: <math>f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.</math>\n\nSince immediately [[substitution (logic)|substituting]] 0 for ''h'' results in <math>\\frac{0}{0}</math> [[indeterminate form]] , calculating the derivative directly can be unintuitive.\n\nEquivalently, the slope could be estimated by employing positions (''x''\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''h'') and ''x''.\n\nAnother two-point formula is to compute the slope of a nearby secant line through the points (''x''\u00a0-\u00a0''h'', ''f''(''x''\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''h'')) and (''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''h'', ''f''(''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''h'')). The slope of this line is\n: <math>\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}.</math>\n\nThis formula is known as the [[symmetric difference quotient]]. In this case the first-order errors cancel, so the slope of these secant lines differ from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to <math>h^2</math>. Hence for small values of ''h'' this is a more accurate approximation to the tangent line than the one-sided estimation. However, although the slope is being computed at ''x'', the value of the function at ''x'' is not involved.\n\nThe estimation error is given by\n\n: <math>R = \\frac{-f^{(3)}(c)}{6} h^2</math>,\n\nwhere <math>c</math> is some point between <math>x - h</math> and <math>x + h</math>.\nThis error does not include the [[rounding error]] due to numbers being represented and calculations being performed in limited precision.\n\nThe symmetric difference quotient is employed as the method of approximating the derivative in a number of calculators, including [[TI-82]], [[TI-83]], [[TI-84]], [[TI-85]], all of which use this method with ''h''\u00a0= 0.001.<ref name=\"Merseth2003\">{{cite book |author=Katherine Klippert Merseth |title=Windows on Teaching Math: Cases of Middle and Secondary Classrooms |year=2003 |publisher=Teachers College Press |isbn=978-0-8077-4279-2 |page=34}}</ref><ref name=\"RubySellers2014\">{{cite book |author1=Tamara Lefcourt Ruby |author2=James Sellers |author3=Lisa Korf |author4=Jeremy Van Horn |author5=Mike Munn |title=Kaplan AP Calculus AB & BC 2015 |year=2014 |publisher=Kaplan Publishing |isbn=978-1-61865-686-5 |page=299}}</ref>\n\n==Step size==\n{{see also|Adaptive step size}}\n[[Image:AbsoluteErrorNumericalDifferentiationExample.png|thumb|300px|Example showing the difficulty of choosing <math>h</math> due to both rounding error and formula error]]\n\nAn important consideration in practice when the function is calculated using [[floating-point arithmetic]] is the choice of step size, ''h''. If chosen too small, the subtraction will yield a large [[rounding error]]. In fact, all the finite-difference formulae are [[ill-conditioned]]<ref name=Fornberg1>Numerical Differentiation of Analytic Functions, B Fornberg \u2013 ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS), 1981.</ref> and due to cancellation will produce a value of zero if ''h'' is small enough.<ref name=SquireTrapp1>Using Complex Variables to Estimate Derivatives of Real Functions, W. Squire, G. Trapp \u2013 SIAM REVIEW, 1998.</ref> If too large, the calculation of the slope of the secant line will be more accurately calculated, but the estimate of the slope of the tangent by using the secant could be worse.\n\nFor the numerical derivative formula evaluated at ''x'' and ''x'' + ''h'', a choice for ''h'' that is small without producing a large rounding error is <math>\\sqrt{\\varepsilon} x</math> (though not when ''x''\u00a0= 0), where the [[machine epsilon]] ''\u03b5'' is typically of the order of 2.2{{e|\u221216}}.<ref>Following ''[[Numerical Recipes]] in C'', [http://www.nrbook.com/a/bookcpdf/c5-7.pdf Chapter 5.7].</ref> A formula for ''h'' that balances the rounding error against the secant error for optimum accuracy is<ref>[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT-INF1100/h10/kompendiet/kap11.pdf p. 263].</ref>\n\n: <math>h = 2\\sqrt{\\varepsilon\\left|\\frac{f(x)}{f''(x)}\\right|}</math>\n\n(though not when <math>f''(x) = 0</math>), and to employ it will require knowledge of the function.\n\nFor [[single precision]] the problems are exacerbated because, although ''x'' may be a [[representable floating-point number]], ''x'' + ''h'' almost certainly will not be. This means that ''x'' + ''h'' will be changed (by rounding or truncation) to a nearby machine-representable number, with the consequence that (''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''h'')\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''x'' will ''not'' equal ''h''; the two function evaluations will not be exactly ''h'' apart. In this regard, since most decimal fractions are recurring sequences in binary (just as 1/3 is in decimal) a seemingly round step such as ''h''\u00a0= 0.1 will not be a round number in binary; it is 0.000110011001100...<sub>2</sub> A possible approach is as follows:\n  h := sqrt(eps) * x;\n  xph := x + h;\n  dx := xph - x;\n  slope := (F(xph) - F(x)) / dx;\nHowever, with computers, [[compiler optimization]] facilities may fail to attend to the details of actual computer arithmetic and instead apply the axioms of mathematics to deduce that ''dx'' and ''h'' are the same. With [[C (programming language)|C]] and similar languages, a directive that ''xph'' is a [[volatile variable]] will prevent this.\n\n==Other methods==\n===Higher-order methods===\n{{further|Finite difference coefficient}}\nHigher-order methods for approximating the derivative, as well as methods for higher derivatives, exist.\n\nGiven below is the five-point method for the first derivative ([[five-point stencil]] in one dimension):<ref>Abramowitz & Stegun, Table 25.2.</ref>\n: <math>f'(x) = \\frac{-f(x + 2h) + 8 f(x + h) - 8 f(x - h) + f(x - 2h)}{12h} + \\frac{h^4}{30} f^{(5)}(c),</math>\nwhere <math>c \\in [x - 2h, x + 2h]</math>.\n\nFor other stencil configurations and derivative orders, the [http://web.media.mit.edu/~crtaylor/calculator.html Finite Difference Coefficients Calculator] is a tool that can be used to generate derivative approximation methods for any stencil with any derivative order (provided a solution exists).\n\n=== Higher derivatives ===\nUsing Newton's difference quotient,\n\n: <math>f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}</math>\n\nthe following can be shown<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shilov |first1=George |title=Elementary Real and Complex Analysis}}</ref> (for ''n>0''):\n\n:<math>f^{(n)}(x) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{1}{h^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k+n} \\binom{n}{k} f(x + kh).</math>\n<!-- [the following clearly has a wrong sign for n = 1]\nHowever, a factor seems to be missing:\n\n: <math>f^{(n)}(x)= (-1)^n \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{1}{h^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{n}{k} f(x + kh).</math>\n-->\n\n==Complex-variable methods==\n\nThe classical finite-difference approximations for numerical differentiation are ill-conditioned.

The slope of this line is\n: <math>\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.</math>\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]] (also known as a first-order [[divided difference]]).\n\nThe slope of this secant line differs from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to ''h''. As ''h'' approaches zero, the slope of the secant line approaches the slope of the tangent line. Therefore, the true '''derivative of''' '''''f''''' '''at''' '''''x''''' is the limit of the value of the difference quotient as the secant lines get closer and closer to being a tangent line:\n: <math>f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.</math>\n\nSince immediately [[substitution (logic)|substituting]] 0 for ''h'' results in <math>\\frac{0}{0}.</math> [[indeterminate form]] , calculating the derivative directly can be unintuitive.\n\nEquivalently, the slope could be estimated by employing positions (''x''\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''h'') and ''x''.\n\nAnother two-point formula is to compute the slope of a nearby secant line through the points (''x''\u00a0-\u00a0''h'', ''f''(''x''\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''h'')) and (''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''h'', ''f''(''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''h'')). The slope of this line is\n: <math>\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}.</math>\n\nThis formula is known as the [[symmetric difference quotient]]. In this case the first-order errors cancel, so the slope of these secant lines differ from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to <math>h^2</math>. Hence for small values of ''h'' this is a more accurate approximation to the tangent line than the one-sided estimation. However, although the slope is being computed at ''x'', the value of the function at ''x'' is not involved.\n\nThe estimation error is given by\n\n: <math>R = \\frac{-f^{(3)}(c)}{6} h^2</math>,\n\nwhere <math>c</math> is some point between <math>x - h</math> and <math>x + h</math>.\nThis error does not include the [[rounding error]] due to numbers being represented and calculations being performed in limited precision.\n\nThe symmetric difference quotient is employed as the method of approximating the derivative in a number of calculators, including [[TI-82]], [[TI-83]], [[TI-84]], [[TI-85]], all of which use this method with ''h''\u00a0= 0.001.<ref name=\"Merseth2003\">{{cite book |author=Katherine Klippert Merseth |title=Windows on Teaching Math: Cases of Middle and Secondary Classrooms |year=2003 |publisher=Teachers College Press |isbn=978-0-8077-4279-2 |page=34}}</ref><ref name=\"RubySellers2014\">{{cite book |author1=Tamara Lefcourt Ruby |author2=James Sellers |author3=Lisa Korf |author4=Jeremy Van Horn |author5=Mike Munn |title=Kaplan AP Calculus AB & BC 2015 |year=2014 |publisher=Kaplan Publishing |isbn=978-1-61865-686-5 |page=299}}</ref>\n\n==Step size==\n{{see also|Adaptive step size}}\n[[Image:AbsoluteErrorNumericalDifferentiationExample.png|thumb|300px|Example showing the difficulty of choosing <math>h</math> due to both rounding error and formula error]]\n\nAn important consideration in practice when the function is calculated using [[floating-point arithmetic]] is the choice of step size, ''h''. If chosen too small, the subtraction will yield a large [[rounding error]]. In fact, all the finite-difference formulae are [[ill-conditioned]]<ref name=Fornberg1>Numerical Differentiation of Analytic Functions, B Fornberg \u2013 ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS), 1981.</ref> and due to cancellation will produce a value of zero if ''h'' is small enough.<ref name=SquireTrapp1>Using Complex Variables to Estimate Derivatives of Real Functions, W. Squire, G. Trapp \u2013 SIAM REVIEW, 1998.</ref> If too large, the calculation of the slope of the secant line will be more accurately calculated, but the estimate of the slope of the tangent by using the secant could be worse.\n\nFor the numerical derivative formula evaluated at ''x'' and ''x'' + ''h'', a choice for ''h'' that is small without producing a large rounding error is <math>\\sqrt{\\varepsilon} x</math> (though not when ''x''\u00a0= 0), where the [[machine epsilon]] ''\u03b5'' is typically of the order of 2.2{{e|\u221216}}.<ref>Following ''[[Numerical Recipes]] in C'', [http://www.nrbook.com/a/bookcpdf/c5-7.pdf Chapter 5.7].</ref> A formula for ''h'' that balances the rounding error against the secant error for optimum accuracy is<ref>[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT-INF1100/h10/kompendiet/kap11.pdf p. 263].</ref>\n\n: <math>h = 2\\sqrt{\\varepsilon\\left|\\frac{f(x)}{f''(x)}\\right|}</math>\n\n(though not when <math>f''(x) = 0</math>), and to employ it will require knowledge of the function.\n\nFor [[single precision]] the problems are exacerbated because, although ''x'' may be a [[representable floating-point number]], ''x'' + ''h'' almost certainly will not be. This means that ''x'' + ''h'' will be changed (by rounding or truncation) to a nearby machine-representable number, with the consequence that (''x''\u00a0+\u00a0''h'')\u00a0\u2212\u00a0''x'' will ''not'' equal ''h''; the two function evaluations will not be exactly ''h'' apart. In this regard, since most decimal fractions are recurring sequences in binary (just as 1/3 is in decimal) a seemingly round step such as ''h''\u00a0= 0.1 will not be a round number in binary; it is 0.000110011001100...<sub>2</sub> A possible approach is as follows:\n  h := sqrt(eps) * x;\n  xph := x + h;\n  dx := xph - x;\n  slope := (F(xph) - F(x)) / dx;\nHowever, with computers, [[compiler optimization]] facilities may fail to attend to the details of actual computer arithmetic and instead apply the axioms of mathematics to deduce that ''dx'' and ''h'' are the same. With [[C (programming language)|C]] and similar languages, a directive that ''xph'' is a [[volatile variable]] will prevent this.\n\n==Other methods==\n===Higher-order methods===\n{{further|Finite difference coefficient}}\nHigher-order methods for approximating the derivative, as well as methods for higher derivatives, exist.\n\nGiven below is the five-point method for the first derivative ([[five-point stencil]] in one dimension):<ref>Abramowitz & Stegun, Table 25.2.</ref>\n: <math>f'(x) = \\frac{-f(x + 2h) + 8 f(x + h) - 8 f(x - h) + f(x - 2h)}{12h} + \\frac{h^4}{30} f^{(5)}(c),</math>\nwhere <math>c \\in [x - 2h, x + 2h]</math>.\n\nFor other stencil configurations and derivative orders, the [http://web.media.mit.edu/~crtaylor/calculator.html Finite Difference Coefficients Calculator] is a tool that can be used to generate derivative approximation methods for any stencil with any derivative order (provided a solution exists).\n\n=== Higher derivatives ===\nUsing Newton's difference quotient,\n\n: <math>f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}</math>\n\nthe following can be shown<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shilov |first1=George |title=Elementary Real and Complex Analysis}}</ref> (for ''n>0''):\n\n:<math>f^{(n)}(x) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{1}{h^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k+n} \\binom{n}{k} f(x + kh).</math>\n<!-- [the following clearly has a wrong sign for n = 1]\nHowever, a factor seems to be missing:\n\n: <math>f^{(n)}(x)= (-1)^n \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{1}{h^n} \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{n}{k} f(x + kh).</math>\n-->\n\n==Complex-variable methods==\n\nThe classical finite-difference approximations for numerical differentiation are ill-conditioned.
