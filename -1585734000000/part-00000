A player will hit the ball with a racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. Normally players begin a serve by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the highest point of the toss). The ball can only touch the net on a return and will be considered good if it falls on the opposite side. If the ball contacts the net on the serve but then proceeds to the proper service box, it is called a ''let''; this is not a legal serve in the major tours (but see below) although it is also not a ''fault''. \nPlayers normally serve overhead, however serving underhand is allowed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/tennis/french-open-tennis-chang-lendl-underhand-kyrgios-spt-int/ | title=French Open Underarm serves revive memories of Chang's cheeky shot |last=Ubha |first=Ravi |publisher=CNN.com |date=May 29, 2019 |access-date=May 31, 2019}}</ref> The serve is the only shot a player can take their time to set up instead of having to react to an opponent's shot.

Advanced players can hit the serve in many different ways and often use it as an offensive weapon to gain an advantage in the point or to win it outright. Because of this, players above beginner level are expected to win most of their service games, and the ability to [[Tennis terminology#B|break]] an opponent's serve plays a crucial role in a match.\n\nFor any serve, the server stands behind the baseline without touching it. For the first point of any [[game (tennis)|game]], the server stands to the right of the center point of the baseline and serves diagonally across the net to the left side (from the server's perspective) of the court, into the [[tennis terminology#S|service box]] which extends to the service line about midway into the opponent's court. For the second point of the game, the serve is diagonally from the left to the right side of the court, and for each subsequent point of the same game the positioning is the opposite of that on the previous point.\n\n== Rules ==\n\nAn attempt at a serve may result in one of the following outcomes:\n* a good serve\n* a let\n* a fault\n* (very rarely) immediate award of the point to the server.\n\n=== Good ===\n\nA ''good serve'' occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box or on any line bounding it without touching anything in flight. Once a ''good serve'' is hit, the play begins.\n\n=== Let ===\n\nA ''let'' occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box having touched the net cord (but not the net post or any other object).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}<!-- This explanation is not a valid reference. Please provide one. <ref>As of 1999, in [[NCAA]] Division I collegiate tennis, a let service is considered playable. This rule change was made to prevent receivers from falsely claiming a valid service to be a let, which is a call that cannot be overruled. Thus, a service that hits the net before landing in the service box is a playable shot, and must be returned by the receiver. Otherwise, the receiver loses the point.</ref> --> Play stops immediately, and the server is allowed another attempt.  The umpire (or opposing player when there is no umpire) will usually say \"let\" or \"net\" to signal to the server a let has occurred. Lets occur more often on first serves, as the server is more cautious on the success of a second serve{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\n=== Fault ===\n\nThere are multiple reasons why a service attempt may result in a fault.\n*  A ''foot fault'' takes place when the server assumes an illegal position while serving.  The server's feet may touch only the ground behind the baseline, between the extensions of the center line and the sideline.  The server's feet must not touch the baseline or the extension of the center line or sideline at any time before the ball is struck. The server is also required to stay roughly on the same position to prevent the opponent from being misled as to where the serve will originate. Running or walking while serving is not allowed, however jumping is permitted.\n* Illegal release of the ball.  The server must release the ball from one hand (exceptions are made for one-handed players, who may use the racket to release the ball).\n* A miss.  If the server swings but misses the ball, it is a fault.  However, if a server releases the ball but does not attempt to hit it, there is no fault and the server may repeat the service attempt.<ref name=\"serve_rules\">International Tennis Federation: Rules of Tennis 2011 - Rule 19. SERVICE FAULT, Case 1: After tossing a ball to serve, the server decides not to hit it and catches it instead. Is this a fault?\nDecision: No. A player, who tosses the ball and then decides not to hit it, is allowed to catch the ball with the hand or the racket, or to let the ball bounce.[http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_54581_original.PDF]</ref>\n* If the ball, before bouncing, hits any object other than the net cord, the opponent's racket or body, it is a fault. For example, if the ball hits the net post and then bounces into the correct court, the service is still a fault.\n* If the ball fails to clear the net, or bounces anywhere other than the cross-court service box, it is a fault.\n\nAfter a fault, play stops immediately.  If there has been only one fault on this point, the server is then allowed another attempt.  If there have been two faults on this point, the point is awarded to the receiver: this is known as a ''{{visible anchor|double fault}}''.\n\n=== Award of point to the server ===\n\nOn a service, the receiver is required to allow the ball to bounce before attempting to hit it. In the extremely rare event of the receiver's racket or body touching a legally delivered ball before it bounces, the point is immediately awarded to the server.<ref>[https://www.itftennis.com/media/1232/2019-rules-of-tennis-english.pdf Laws of tennis, 24(e)]</ref>\n\n== First and second ==\n\nA ''first serve'' is made when there has been no fault on the point;  a ''second serve'' occurs when there has already been one fault on the point.  On a second serve, the server is in danger of losing the point if there is another fault.\n\nThe rules make no distinction between the first and second serve. However, the tactics used are different. The first serve is typically struck with the maximum power, skill, and deception the player is capable of with the aim of winning the point either outright or on the next stroke, by forcing the receiver into a disadvantageous position. The second serve is usually more conservative to avoid getting a double fault, and is typically hit with less power or a higher curve. Second serves often have more topspin and kick on the ball.\n\n== Stances ==\n\nThere are two popular stances in the tennis serve: the platform stance and the pinpoint stance.\n\nIn the platform stance the feet are kept about shoulder-width apart throughout the serve, providing stable support and easy weight transfer from the back to the front foot. The hips rotate, and sometimes the back foot swings forward to complete the hip rotation.\n\nIn the pinpoint stance, the feet start apart, but as the serve unfolds, the back foot slides or steps forward until it is adjacent to or slightly behind the front foot. As a result, the feet provide a very small base of support and balance may be a problem<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/british-tennis-membership/serve-tips/|title=How to improve your tennis serve and other tips to make you court-ready|last=Pickup|first=Oliver|date=|website=Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sportsdomainlab.com/how-to-serve-in-tennis-like-a-pro/|title=How to serve in tennis like a Pro|last=|first=|date=|website=Sports Domain Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== Advantages of platform stance and the pinpoint stance ===\n\nThe pinpoint serve provides better velocity, since the feet come together as a single unit, allowing them to push harder against the ground and gain more leg power.  However, the center of gravity moves more than in the platform stance, so the player must have good body control in order to contact the ball consistently.\n \nPlayers will sacrifice some power with the platform serve, but their balance will be better so they should be more consistent. It's still possible to produce good power with the platform serve\u2014some big servers, such as Milos Raonic and Roger Federer, use a variation of a platform stance.\n\nThe serve each player uses will depend on their individual abilities and what they need the most\u2014power or consistency.\nIf they already have good body control but would like to produce extra power, they could try the pinpoint stance. If consistency is their problem, they can use the platform stance.\n\n=== Alternative stances ===\n\nPlatform stance and the pinpoint stance are closed stances. For a very long time, the use of an open stance to serve had been regarded as a sign of tennis beginner. Things have changed in recent years. At elite level, Venus Williams had used semi-open stance to serve in the past (she went back to use traditional closed stance and stayed to the old way currently). Beside Venus, Nikola Mektic<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Xq7m3sagE</ref> and Viktor Troicki<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llcFOZMQ72Y</ref> both have abandoned closed stance to use open stance to serve.\n\n== Types ==\n\nIn the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/sports/tennis/the-genteel-origins-of-tennis-and-the-serve.html|title=How the Serve Went Over the Top|last=Macdonald|first=Geoff|date=August 28, 2011|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref> All of these serves are legal in professional and amateur play.\n\nThe term ''kick serve'' is ambiguous. It may be used as a synonym for the twist serve or the American twist. However, ''kick serve'' is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.\n\nServers can gain a tactical advantage by varying the type of serve and the ball's placement. The flat serve and slice serve are used primarily as first serves because they are more likely to yield an ace or force an error, although they require high accuracy. Second serves usually have topspin or kick on them, which makes them less likely to land in the net or out of bounds. Kick serves also make a good change-up{{clarify|date=July 2012}} as a first serve.\n\n=== Flat ===\n\nA flat serve is hit with a [[Grip (tennis)#The Continental grip|Continental grip]] (holding the racket as if it were an axe) and a swing path directly through the ball, which causes the ball to cut quickly through the air without spinning. Some professional players can hit flat serves at speeds near {{convert|150|mph|kph}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/aussie-smashes-tennis-serve-speed-record-20120513-1ykfk.html|title=Aussie smashes tennis serve speed record|date=May 13, 2012|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA flat serve must come close to the net therefore having a small margin for error. Therefore, flat serves are usually hit straight across the center, where the net is lowest. They are usually delivered as first serves, when the server does not risk a [[Glossary of tennis terms#D|double fault]]. The ball is thrown straight above and slightly forward for the optimal serving point.\n\n=== Slice/reverse slice ===\n\nA slice serve is hit with sidespin, which requires the server to brush the back of the ball toward their [[Handedness|dominant side]] with the racket. It is commonly hit with the Continental grip or the [[Grip (tennis)#The Eastern Forehand grip|Eastern backhand grip]] (using the forehand face of the racket). The ball is thrown slightly to the dominant side of the server then is struck laterally on the server's dominant side.\n\nFor a right-handed player, a sliced serve's sidespin [[Magnus effect|causes the ball to curve]] leftward. When the ball bounces, it skids and curves farther leftward. The curve of a good slice serve can draw the receiver {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide of the singles sideline to play the ball.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Since a slice serve has little or no topspin on it, it cannot be aimed high over the net and has little margin for error. Therefore, it is generally used as a first serve. It can be used to ace the receiver, to draw the receiver out of position, or to \"jam\" the receiver with a serve curving sharply towards his or her body.\n\nThe reverse slice serve (or inside-out serve) is analogous to the [[Screwball |screwball pitch]] in baseball.  It is hit with the opposite spin of the slice serve.  The server must [[Pronation|pronate]] his or her racket arm and sweep the racket across his or her body while striking the ball when hitting a reverse slice serve.  Because the direction of spin applied is reversed relative to the standard slice serve, a reverse slice serve from a right-handed player will have the same motion as a slice serve from a left-handed player, and ''vice versa''.\n\nIn professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word ''reverse'' is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the slice struck serve.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Kick/topspin/American twist/Reverse kick ===\n\n[[Holcombe Ward]] and [[Dwight F. Davis|Dwight Davis]] introduced the kick/American twist serve in the late 1800s. The kick (or topspin) serve is generated by tossing the ball over the head, then hitting it laterally on the server's [[Handedness|non-dominant side]] brushing upward toward the dominant side. When hit correctly, the ball clears the net in a high [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] with heavy topspin, causing the ball to dive into the service box. Upon hitting the surface of the court, the ball may bounce high directly toward the receiver for a kick serve, or to the left for the receiver for an American twist serve. The physics of the spinning ball in flight involves the [[Magnus effect]] because the spinning ball creates a whirlpool of air around itself. The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7\u20138 o'clock position to the 1\u20132 o'clock position, and faster swing speeds. If performed exceptionally, it can completely change the direction of the ball movement away from the other player, although this requires a very strong and flexible back.\n\nKick/topspin serves are often used as both first and second serves.  As a first serve, a player will put more pace on the ball, while it is a consistent second serve since the spin brings it into the service box with high net clearance.\n\nThe reverse kick/American twist serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word \"reverse\" is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the kick struck serve.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Underhand ===\n\nThe underhand serve is struck below shoulder level. In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on {{convert|36|ft|m}} courts. Although this serve is legal, it may be seen as unsportsmanlike in adult tennis. Some notable examples include [[Michael Chang]]'s in the Round of 16 at the [[1989 French Open]] against [[Ivan Lendl]], and [[Martina Hingis]] was booed by the crowd for hitting one at the [[1999 French Open]]. This serve has gained some prominence since 2019 as a surprise tactic when playing deep returners, heralded by Nick Kyrigos against Rafael Nadal.\n\n===Pat-a-cake===\n\nA [[Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man|pat-a-cake]] serve is a serve in which the racket is not swung behind the head (as in a proper serve). The player will simply toss the ball up and \"pat\" or tap it over the net to get it in play. It is often used by beginning players, or players who never had proper instruction. The term is usually employed belittlingly.\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n* [[Ace (tennis)|Ace]] &ndash; a serve that lands in the service box and is then untouched by the opponent.\n* Break &ndash; server losing his or her game. Every match must have at least one break in order to end.\n* Break point &ndash; one point away from a break.\n* [[Hawk-Eye|Challenge]] &ndash; when either player disputes whether the ball landed in or out. A line judge may overturn a call made, or in professional settings, a review of the play may be made. Players are allowed a certain number of challenges per match.\n* Double fault &ndash; hitting a fault on the second service. The server loses the point.\n* Fault &ndash; an unsuccessful serve that does not start the point because the ball does not land in the opponent's designated service box.\n* Foot fault &ndash; a fault caused by the server stepping on or across his base line or the center line before striking the ball with his racquet.\n* Hold &ndash; server winning the game.\n* Let &ndash; a serve is called a let when the ball hits the net cord but still lands in the service court. Such a serve is not considered a fault and the server may repeat the service attempt. A ball that hits the net cord but lands outside the service box is still a fault.\n* On serve &ndash; both players have held each of their service games in the set or had an equal number of service breaks in the set, putting them \"back on serve\".\n* Service winner &ndash; a serve that is touched by the opponent, but not returned.\n\n== Players with great serves ==\n{{See also|Fastest recorded tennis serves}}\n\n=== Serve-record holders ===\n\n* [[Pete Sampras]] (considered by many to have the greatest serve of all time.

If a controlled return of service is possible, a hard [[groundstroke]] to one side or the other of the opponents's [[tennis terminology#B|baseline]] may be performed. If the server rushes the net immediately upon hitting the serve, the returner has several options: return the ball at the feet of the server not far past the net, forcing him to hit a [[half volley]] (which is hard to do aggressively); [[lob (tennis)|lob]] the ball over the rushing server's head; or hit a [[passing shot]] hard and low over the net too far to the left or right for the server to hit it.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Roger Federer (26 June 2009, Wimbledon) 2.jpg|[[Roger Federer]] serving at the [[2009 Wimbledon Championships]].\nFile:Rafa Nadal 2011 FO R1.jpg|[[Rafael Nadal]] serving at the [[2011 French Open]].\nFile:Novak Djokovic at the 2011 Australian Open2.jpg|[[Novak Djokovic]] serving at the [[2011 Australian Open]].\nFile:Serena Wimbledon 2008.jpg|[[Serena Williams]] serving at the [[2008 Wimbledon Championships]].\nFile:Azarenka Roland Garros 2009 2.jpg|[[Victoria Azarenka]] prepares to serve at the [[2009 French Open]].\nFile:Sara Errani at the 2010 US Open 03.jpg|[[Sara Errani]] prepares to serve at the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]].\nFile:Elena Vesnina (19033184615).jpg|Waiting to receive a serve in [[partial squatting]] position.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Tennis}}\n* [[Glossary of tennis terms]]\n* [[Tennis shots]]\n* [https://sportsedtv.com/sport/tennis/serve/tips Tennis Serve Videos]\n\n== References ==\n<!--See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Service (tennis)}}\n{{Wiktionary|serve}}\n* [http://tennis.about.com/od/serve/Tennis_Serve_Learn_Basics_Toss_and_Topspin_Slice_and_Twist_Spins.htm Tennis Serve]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/skills/4229090.stm BBC Serve Basics]\n* [http://www.tennismindgame.com/topspin-tennis-serve.html Topspin Serve Instruction]\n* [https://serveandvolleytennis.com/5-steps-to-a-great-tennis-serve-for-beginners-with-pics-and-video/ Beginners Serve Technique]\n* [http://www.feeltennis.net/serve-technique/ Tennis Serve Technique]\n* [https://sportsedtv.com/sport/tennis/serve/tips Tennis Serve] Videos\n{{tennis box}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Serve (Tennis)}}\n[[Category:Tennis shots]]\n\n[[simple:Tennis#Shots]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n[[File:Tommy Haas serves.jpg|thumb|[[Tommy Haas]] serving]]\nA '''serve''' (or, more formally, a '''service''') in [[tennis]] is a shot to start a [[point (tennis)|point]].

If there have been two faults on this point, the point is awarded to the receiver: this is known as a ''{{visible anchor|double fault}}''.\n\n=== Award of point to the server ===\n\nOn a service, the receiver is required to allow the ball to bounce before attempting to hit it. In the extremely rare event of the receiver's racket or body touching a legally delivered ball before it bounces, the point is immediately awarded to the server.<ref>[https://www.itftennis.com/media/1232/2019-rules-of-tennis-english.pdf Laws of tennis, 24(e)]</ref>\n\n== First and second ==\n\nA ''first serve'' is made when there has been no fault on the point;  a ''second serve'' occurs when there has already been one fault on the point.  On a second serve, the server is in danger of losing the point if there is another fault.\n\nThe rules make no distinction between the first and second serve. However, the tactics used are different. The first serve is typically struck with the maximum power, skill, and deception the player is capable of with the aim of winning the point either outright or on the next stroke, by forcing the receiver into a disadvantageous position. The second serve is usually more conservative to avoid getting a double fault, and is typically hit with less power or a higher curve. Second serves often have more topspin and kick on the ball.\n\n== Stances ==\n\nThere are two popular stances in the tennis serve: the platform stance and the pinpoint stance.\n\nIn the platform stance the feet are kept about shoulder-width apart throughout the serve, providing stable support and easy weight transfer from the back to the front foot. The hips rotate, and sometimes the back foot swings forward to complete the hip rotation.\n\nIn the pinpoint stance, the feet start apart, but as the serve unfolds, the back foot slides or steps forward until it is adjacent to or slightly behind the front foot. As a result, the feet provide a very small base of support and balance may be a problem<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/british-tennis-membership/serve-tips/|title=How to improve your tennis serve and other tips to make you court-ready|last=Pickup|first=Oliver|date=|website=Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sportsdomainlab.com/how-to-serve-in-tennis-like-a-pro/|title=How to serve in tennis like a Pro|last=|first=|date=|website=Sports Domain Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== Advantages of platform stance and the pinpoint stance ===\n\nThe pinpoint serve provides better velocity, since the feet come together as a single unit, allowing them to push harder against the ground and gain more leg power.  However, the center of gravity moves more than in the platform stance, so the player must have good body control in order to contact the ball consistently.\n \nPlayers will sacrifice some power with the platform serve, but their balance will be better so they should be more consistent. It's still possible to produce good power with the platform serve\u2014some big servers, such as Milos Raonic and Roger Federer, use a variation of a platform stance.\n\nThe serve each player uses will depend on their individual abilities and what they need the most\u2014power or consistency.\nIf they already have good body control but would like to produce extra power, they could try the pinpoint stance. If consistency is their problem, they can use the platform stance.\n\n=== Alternative stances ===\n\nPlatform stance and the pinpoint stance are closed stances. For a very long time, the use of an open stance to serve had been regarded as a sign of tennis beginner. Things have changed in recent years. At elite level, Venus Williams had used semi-open stance to serve in the past (she went back to use traditional closed stance and stayed to the old way currently). Beside Venus, Nikola Mektic<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Xq7m3sagE</ref> and Viktor Troicki<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llcFOZMQ72Y</ref> both have abandoned closed stance to use open stance to serve.\n\n== Types ==\n\nIn the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the \"flat serve\", the \"slice serve\", the \"kick serve\", and the \"underhand serve\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/sports/tennis/the-genteel-origins-of-tennis-and-the-serve.html|title=How the Serve Went Over the Top|last=Macdonald|first=Geoff|date=August 28, 2011|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref> All of these serves are legal in professional and amateur play.\n\nThe term ''kick serve'' is ambiguous. It may be used as a synonym for the twist serve or the American twist. However, ''kick serve'' is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.\n\nServers can gain a tactical advantage by varying the type of serve and the ball's placement. The flat serve and slice serve are used primarily as first serves because they are more likely to yield an ace or force an error, although they require high accuracy. Second serves usually have topspin or kick on them, which makes them less likely to land in the net or out of bounds. Kick serves also make a good change-up{{clarify|date=July 2012}} as a first serve.\n\n=== Flat ===\n\nA flat serve is hit with a [[Grip (tennis)#The Continental grip|Continental grip]] (holding the racket as if it were an axe) and a swing path directly through the ball, which causes the ball to cut quickly through the air without spinning. Some professional players can hit flat serves at speeds near {{convert|150|mph|kph}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/aussie-smashes-tennis-serve-speed-record-20120513-1ykfk.html|title=Aussie smashes tennis serve speed record|date=May 13, 2012|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA flat serve must come close to the net therefore having a small margin for error. Therefore, flat serves are usually hit straight across the center, where the net is lowest. They are usually delivered as first serves, when the server does not risk a [[Glossary of tennis terms#D|double fault]]. The ball is thrown straight above and slightly forward for the optimal serving point.\n\n=== Slice/reverse slice ===\n\nA slice serve is hit with sidespin, which requires the server to brush the back of the ball toward their [[Handedness|dominant side]] with the racket. It is commonly hit with the Continental grip or the [[Grip (tennis)#The Eastern Forehand grip|Eastern backhand grip]] (using the forehand face of the racket). The ball is thrown slightly to the dominant side of the server then is struck laterally on the server's dominant side.\n\nFor a right-handed player, a sliced serve's sidespin [[Magnus effect|causes the ball to curve]] leftward. When the ball bounces, it skids and curves farther leftward. The curve of a good slice serve can draw the receiver {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide of the singles sideline to play the ball.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Since a slice serve has little or no topspin on it, it cannot be aimed high over the net and has little margin for error. Therefore, it is generally used as a first serve. It can be used to ace the receiver, to draw the receiver out of position, or to \"jam\" the receiver with a serve curving sharply towards his or her body.\n\nThe reverse slice serve (or inside-out serve) is analogous to the [[Screwball |screwball pitch]] in baseball.  It is hit with the opposite spin of the slice serve.  The server must [[Pronation|pronate]] his or her racket arm and sweep the racket across his or her body while striking the ball when hitting a reverse slice serve.  Because the direction of spin applied is reversed relative to the standard slice serve, a reverse slice serve from a right-handed player will have the same motion as a slice serve from a left-handed player, and ''vice versa''.\n\nIn professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word ''reverse'' is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the slice struck serve.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Kick/topspin/American twist/Reverse kick ===\n\n[[Holcombe Ward]] and [[Dwight F. Davis|Dwight Davis]] introduced the kick/American twist serve in the late 1800s. The kick (or topspin) serve is generated by tossing the ball over the head, then hitting it laterally on the server's [[Handedness|non-dominant side]] brushing upward toward the dominant side. When hit correctly, the ball clears the net in a high [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] with heavy topspin, causing the ball to dive into the service box. Upon hitting the surface of the court, the ball may bounce high directly toward the receiver for a kick serve, or to the left for the receiver for an American twist serve. The physics of the spinning ball in flight involves the [[Magnus effect]] because the spinning ball creates a whirlpool of air around itself. The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7\u20138 o'clock position to the 1\u20132 o'clock position, and faster swing speeds. If performed exceptionally, it can completely change the direction of the ball movement away from the other player, although this requires a very strong and flexible back.\n\nKick/topspin serves are often used as both first and second serves.  As a first serve, a player will put more pace on the ball, while it is a consistent second serve since the spin brings it into the service box with high net clearance.\n\nThe reverse kick/American twist serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word \"reverse\" is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the kick struck serve.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Underhand ===\n\nThe underhand serve is struck below shoulder level. In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on {{convert|36|ft|m}} courts. Although this serve is legal, it may be seen as unsportsmanlike in adult tennis. Some notable examples include [[Michael Chang]]'s in the Round of 16 at the [[1989 French Open]] against [[Ivan Lendl]], and [[Martina Hingis]] was booed by the crowd for hitting one at the [[1999 French Open]]. The underhand. This serve has gained some prominence since 2019 as a surprise tactic when playing deep returners, heralded by Nick Kyrigos against Rafael Nadal.\n\n===Pat-a-cake===\n\nA [[Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man|pat-a-cake]] serve is a serve in which the racket is not swung behind the head (as in a proper serve). The player will simply toss the ball up and \"pat\" or tap it over the net to get it in play. It is often used by beginning players, or players who never had proper instruction. The term is usually employed belittlingly.\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n* [[Ace (tennis)|Ace]] &ndash; a serve that lands in the service box and is then untouched by the opponent.\n* Break &ndash; server losing his or her game. Every match must have at least one break in order to end.\n* Break point &ndash; one point away from a break.\n* [[Hawk-Eye|Challenge]] &ndash; when either player disputes whether the ball landed in or out. A line judge may overturn a call made, or in professional settings, a review of the play may be made. Players are allowed a certain number of challenges per match.\n* Double fault &ndash; hitting a fault on the second service. The server loses the point.\n* Fault &ndash; an unsuccessful serve that does not start the point because the ball does not land in the opponent's designated service box.\n* Foot fault &ndash; a fault caused by the server stepping on or across his base line or the center line before striking the ball with his racquet.\n* Hold &ndash; server winning the game.\n* Let &ndash; a serve is called a let when the ball hits the net cord but still lands in the service court. Such a serve is not considered a fault and the server may repeat the service attempt. A ball that hits the net cord but lands outside the service box is still a fault.\n* On serve &ndash; both players have held each of their service games in the set or had an equal number of service breaks in the set, putting them \"back on serve\".\n* Service winner &ndash; a serve that is touched by the opponent, but not returned.\n\n== Players with great serves ==\n{{See also|Fastest recorded tennis serves}}\n\n=== Serve-record holders ===\n\n* [[Pete Sampras]] (considered by many to have the greatest serve of all time.

If a controlled return of service is possible, a hard [[groundstroke]] to one side or the other of the opponents's [[tennis terminology#B|baseline]] may be performed. If the server rushes the net immediately upon hitting the serve, the returner has several options: return the ball at the feet of the server not far past the net, forcing him to hit a [[half volley]] (which is hard to do aggressively); [[lob (tennis)|lob]] the ball over the rushing server's head; or hit a [[passing shot]] hard and low over the net too far to the left or right for the server to hit it.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Roger Federer (26 June 2009, Wimbledon) 2.jpg|[[Roger Federer]] serving at the [[2009 Wimbledon Championships]].\nFile:Rafa Nadal 2011 FO R1.jpg|[[Rafael Nadal]] serving at the [[2011 French Open]].\nFile:Novak Djokovic at the 2011 Australian Open2.jpg|[[Novak Djokovic]] serving at the [[2011 Australian Open]].\nFile:Serena Wimbledon 2008.jpg|[[Serena Williams]] serving at the [[2008 Wimbledon Championships]].\nFile:Azarenka Roland Garros 2009 2.jpg|[[Victoria Azarenka]] prepares to serve at the [[2009 French Open]].\nFile:Sara Errani at the 2010 US Open 03.jpg|[[Sara Errani]] prepares to serve at the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]].\nFile:Elena Vesnina (19033184615).jpg|Waiting to receive a serve in [[partial squatting]] position.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Tennis}}\n* [[Glossary of tennis terms]]\n* [[Tennis shots]]\n* [https://sportsedtv.com/sport/tennis/serve/tips Tennis Serve Videos]\n\n== References ==\n<!--See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Service (tennis)}}\n{{Wiktionary|serve}}\n* [http://tennis.about.com/od/serve/Tennis_Serve_Learn_Basics_Toss_and_Topspin_Slice_and_Twist_Spins.htm Tennis Serve]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/skills/4229090.stm BBC Serve Basics]\n* [http://www.tennismindgame.com/topspin-tennis-serve.html Topspin Serve Instruction]\n* [https://serveandvolleytennis.com/5-steps-to-a-great-tennis-serve-for-beginners-with-pics-and-video/ Beginners Serve Technique]\n* [http://www.feeltennis.net/serve-technique/ Tennis Serve Technique]\n* [https://sportsedtv.com/sport/tennis/serve/tips Tennis Serve] Videos\n{{tennis box}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Serve (Tennis)}}\n[[Category:Tennis shots]]\n\n[[simple:Tennis#Shots]]\n", "name_user": "MarmotteNZ", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnderhand:Removed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)"}

In 2019 it handled 3.45 million passengers and some 13,000 tons of cargo.\n\nNamed after [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], the first [[President of Croatia]], the airport is located some {{Convert|10|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Zagreb Central Station]]<ref name=\"AIP\"/> in [[Velika Gorica]]. It is the [[airline hub|hub]] of the Croatian [[flag carrier]] [[Croatia Airlines]] and a focus city for [[Trade Air]]. The main base of the [[Croatian Air Force]] is also located at the airport's premises. Moreover, the Croatian Air Traffic Control has its administratration situated on the grounds of the airport.\n\nThe airport was awarded to the [[ZAIC]] consortium (Zagreb Airport International Company) in a 30-year [[concession (contract)|concession]] under the terms of a contract signed by the [[Government of Croatia]] with the aforementioned. The contract includes the financing, designing and construction of a new passenger terminal which was opened in March 2017. For the purpose of managing the airport ZAIC registered a company called [[Joint-stock company|MZLZ d.d.]] (Me\u0111unarodna zra\u010dna luka Zagreb d.d.) that is now the operator of the Airport.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of Zagreb civil aviation began in 1909 when the first airfield was built close to the western city neighborhood ([[Zagreb#city districts|city district]]) of [[\u010crnomerec]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nWith the creation of the first Yugoslav flag carrier [[Aeroput]] in 1927, the airport was relocated to the [[Borongaj]] airfield in 1928 which began serving the ever-growing number of passengers on 15 February of that year. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Although several European airliners connected the city it was mostly Aeroput which connected Zagreb to major destinations across Europe and thus significantly increased traffic at Zagreb in the period preceding the [[Second World War]].\n\nFollowing World War II commercial services were moved to a former military airbase near the village of [[Lu\u010dko]] south-west of the city in 1947. [[Jat Airways|JAT Yugoslav Airlines]] took the role of Aeroput and made Zagreb its second hub. At its peak in 1959, Lu\u010dko served 167,000 passengers.\n[[File:Novi putni\u010dki terminal .jpg|thumb|left|280px|Zagreb Airport terminal|alt=]]\n\nThe current location of the airport at Pleso in the south-east of Lu\u010dko opened in 1962 with a {{convert|2500|m|abbr=on}} long [[runway]] and {{convert|1000|m2|abbr=on}} [[airport terminal|terminal]]. By 1966 Zagreb Airport got a new {{convert|5000|m2|abbr=on}} state-of-the-art passenger terminal. The runway capacity was lengthened to its current {{convert|3252|m|abbr=on}} in 1974.\n\nIn the 1980s Zagreb Airport was the second largest in Yugoslavia by passenger and aircraft movements. Yugoslav flag-carrier JAT maintained a hub in Zagreb and connected the city to numerous destinations including New York, Chicago, Toronto which inevitably had a major impact on air traffic at Zagreb during that period.\n\nFollowing an increase in passenger numbers and the necessity to upgrade its infrastructure, the airport installed a CAT-IIIb [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) in 2004.\n\nIn 2008 a new VIP terminal was added and the terminal extended for extra amenities, restaurants and bars. The terminal was expanded to {{convert|15500|m2|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zagreb-airport.hr/Povijest-i-razvoj-kroz-vrijeme-71.aspx|title=Me\u0111unarodna zra\u010dna luka Zagreb \u2013 Zagreb International Airport \u2013 Naslovna|accessdate=3 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408155848/http://www.zagreb-airport.hr/Povijest-i-razvoj-kroz-vrijeme-71.aspx|archivedate=8 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy 2010 the old terminal has been nearing its maximum annual capacity. That year the passenger terminal received a major facelift in the course of which a viewing platform with a bar was added.\n\nOn 12 April 2012 the ZAIC ([[Groupe ADP]]) consortium received a 30-year concession for the airport from the [[Government of Croatia]]. The concession includes financing, designing and constructing a new passenger terminal. The construction of a brand new {{convert|70000|m2|abbr=on}} terminal facility designed by Neidhardt architects of Zagreb and carried out by Bouygues B\u00e2timent International in partnership with Viadukt began on 18 December 2013 with the aim to replace the old terminal. It now has an initial annual capacity of 5.5 million passengers in the first phase and was officially completed in October 2016. The official inauguration of the terminal was on 28 March 2017. ZAIC now operates the entire airport for 30 years including the runways, the current passenger terminal, the cargo terminal, car parks and all future property developments.

Furthermore, the new apron has three remote stands next to the terminal, while 23 stands at the old passenger building are also used during the peak season. Each of the aircraft parking positions at the facility includes a visual docking guidance system which gives information to a pilot on how to park their aircraft.

In 2019 it handled 3.45 million passengers and some 13,000 tons of cargo.\n\nNamed after [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], the first [[President of Croatia]], the airport is located some {{Convert|10|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Zagreb Central Station]]<ref name=\"AIP\"/> in [[Velika Gorica]]. It is the [[airline hub|hub]] of the Croatian [[flag carrier]] [[Croatia Airlines]] and a focus city for [[Trade Air]]. The main base of the [[Croatian Air Force]] is also located at the airport's premises. Moreover, the Croatian Air Traffic Control has its administratration situated on the grounds of the airport.\n\nThe airport was awarded to the [[ZAIC]] consortium (Zagreb Airport International Company) in a 30-year [[concession (contract)|concession]] under the terms of a contract signed by the [[Government of Croatia]] with the aforementioned. The contract includes the financing, designing and construction of a new passenger terminal which was opened in March 2017. For the purpose of managing the airport ZAIC registered a company called [[Joint-stock company|MZLZ d.d.]] (Me\u0111unarodna zra\u010dna luka Zagreb d.d.) that is now the operator of the Airport.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of Zagreb civil aviation began in 1909 when the first airfield was built close to the western city neighborhood ([[Zagreb#city districts|city district]]) of [[\u010crnomerec]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nWith the creation of the first Yugoslav flag carrier [[Aeroput]] in 1927, the airport was relocated to the [[Borongaj]] airfield in 1928 which began serving the ever-growing number of passengers on 15 February of that year. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Although several European airliners connected the city it was mostly Aeroput which connected Zagreb to major destinations across Europe and thus significantly increased traffic at Zagreb in the period preceding the [[Second World War]].\n\nFollowing World War II commercial services were moved to a former military airbase near the village of [[Lu\u010dko]] south-west of the city in 1947. [[Jat Airways|JAT Yugoslav Airlines]] took the role of Aeroput and made Zagreb its second hub. At its peak in 1959, Lu\u010dko served 167,000 passengers.\n[[File:Novi putni\u010dki terminal .jpg|thumb|left|280px|Zagreb Airport terminal|alt=]]\n\nThe current location of the airport at Pleso in the south-east of Lu\u010dko opened in 1962 with a {{convert|2500|m|abbr=on}} long [[runway]] and {{convert|1000|m2|abbr=on}} [[airport terminal|terminal]]. By 1966 Zagreb Airport got a new {{convert|5000|m2|abbr=on}} state-of-the-art passenger terminal. The runway capacity was lengthened to its current {{convert|3252|m|abbr=on}} in 1974.\n\nIn the 1980s Zagreb Airport was the second largest in Yugoslavia by passenger and aircraft movements. Yugoslav flag-carrier JAT maintained a hub in Zagreb and connected the city to numerous destinations including New York, Chicago, Toronto which inevitably had a major impact on air traffic at Zagreb during that period.\n\nFollowing an increase in passenger numbers and the necessity to upgrade its infrastructure, the airport installed a CAT-IIIb [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) in 2004.\n\nIn 2008 a new VIP terminal was added and the terminal extended for extra amenities, restaurants and bars. The terminal was expanded to {{convert|15500|m2|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zagreb-airport.hr/Povijest-i-razvoj-kroz-vrijeme-71.aspx|title=Me\u0111unarodna zra\u010dna luka Zagreb \u2013 Zagreb International Airport \u2013 Naslovna|accessdate=3 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408155848/http://www.zagreb-airport.hr/Povijest-i-razvoj-kroz-vrijeme-71.aspx|archivedate=8 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy 2010 the old terminal has been nearing its maximum annual capacity. That year the passenger terminal received a major facelift in the course of which a viewing platform with a bar was added.\n\nOn 12 April 2012 the ZAIC ([[Groupe ADP]]) consortium received a 30-year concession for the airport from the [[Government of Croatia]]. The concession includes financing, designing and constructing a new passenger terminal. The construction of a brand new {{convert|70000|m2|abbr=on}} terminal facility designed by Neidhardt architects of Zagreb and carried out by Bouygues B\u00e2timent International in partnership with Viadukt began on 18 December 2013 with the aim to replace the old terminal. It now has an initial annual capacity of 5.5 million passengers in the first phase and was officially completed in October 2016. The official inauguration of the terminal was on 28 March 2017. ZAIC now operates the entire airport for 30 years including the runways, the current passenger terminal, the cargo terminal, car parks and all future property developments. The concession contract involves a total investment of around \u20ac324m (\u00a3259m): \u20ac236 million for the design and construction of the new terminal and \u20ac88 million for operation of all airport infrastructure for the entire period of the concession.<ref>[http://www.vlada.hr/hr/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2012/travanj/potpisan_ugovor_o_koncesiji_za_izgradnju_i_upravljanje_zracnom_lukom_zagreb ''Vlada Republika Hrvatska'' Potpisan Ugovor O Koncesiji za izgradnju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701144934/http://www.vlada.hr/hr/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2012/travanj/potpisan_ugovor_o_koncesiji_za_izgradnju_i_upravljanje_zracnom_lukom_zagreb |date=1 July 2012 }} (In Croatian) 11 April 2012</ref>\n\n== Terminal ==\n[[File:Zagreb_Airport_Terminal_20170506205714.jpg|thumb|left|Departures area]]\nThe current terminal building was opened to the public on 28 March 2017.<ref>http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/126124</ref>{{failed verification|reason=Source is a 2012 journal article|date=August 2018}} It stretches over {{cvt|65800|m2}} on three levels featuring three baggage carousels, 8 air bridges, 9 security checkpoints, 30 check-in desks, 23 passport control booths and a car park with the capacity of 1,100 vehicles. Furthermore, the new apron has three remote stands next to the terminal, while 23 stands at the old passenger building are also used during the peak season. Each of the aircraft parking positions at the facility includes a visual docking guidance system which gives information to a pilot on how to park their aircraft. The terminal itself features a large 600 square metre [[duty-free shop]] operated by Aelia, 16 caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants and snack bars.\n\nEnough space has been left for 30 additional check-in counters and 2 baggage carousels to be added once the new terminal reaches its current maximum capacity of 5 million passengers. Further extensions envisaged along the thirty-year concession period will potentially see expanding current apron from present {{cvt|100000|to|300000|m2}} and terminal capacity increased to 8&nbsp;million through gradual expansion of the terminal in four Phase 2 expansions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ne\u0161to o pregovorima s Francuzima, Nizozemskoj bolesti i gospodinu Petitu, bacanju papira i vremenu od travnja 2012. godine do prosinca 2013. godine. - Sini\u0161a Hajda\u0161 Don\u010di\u0107 |url=https://hajdasdoncic.hr/2017/03/18/nesto-pregovorima-s-francuzima-nizozemskoj-bolesti-gospodinu-petitu-bacanju-papira-vremenu-travnja-2012-godine-do-prosinca-2013-godine/ |website=Sini\u0161a Hajda\u0161 Don\u010di\u0107 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |language=hr-HR |date=18 March 2017}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2018}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Grand opening of the new passenger terminal of Franjo Tu\u0111man Airport |url=http://www.zagreb-airport.hr/business/newsroom/press-releases/grand-opening-of-the-new-passenger-terminal-of-franjo-tudjman-airport/272 |website=Zagreb Airport |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Zagreb International Airport\u2019s New Terminal - Airport Technology |url=https://www.airport-technology.com/projects/new-terminal-zagreb-international-airport |website=Airport Technology |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aegean Airlines]] | [[Athens International Airport|Athens]] \n<!-- -->\n| [[Aeroflot]] | [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Moscow\u2013Sheremetyevo]] \n<!-- -->\n| [[Air Canada Rouge]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto\u2013Pearson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aircanada.mediaroom.com/2017-09-28-Air-Canada-Expands-its-Global-Network-with-New-and-Enhanced-Services-to-Europe-South-America-and-Africa-for-Summer-2018 |title=Air Canada Expands its Global Network |publisher=Air Canada |date= |accessdate=2017-09-28}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Air France]] | [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] \n<!-- -->\n| [[Air Serbia]] | [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|Belgrade]] \n<!-- -->\n| [[Air Transat]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Toronto-Pearson Airport|Toronto\u2013Pearson]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Austrian Airlines]] | [[Vienna International Airport|Vienna]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[British Airways]] | [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]] \n<!-- -->\n| [[Brussels Airlines]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]] \n<!-- -->\n| [[Croatia Airlines]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport|Barcelona]], [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]], [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]], [[Dublin Airport|Dublin]], [[Dubrovnik Airport|Dubrovnik]], [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]], [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]], [[Mostar Airport|Mostar]], [[Munich Airport|Munich]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]], [[Pula Airport|Pula]], [[Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport|Rome\u2013Fiumicino]], [[Sarajevo International Airport|Sarajevo]], [[Skopje International Airport|Skopje]], [[Split Airport|Split]], [[Vienna International Airport|Vienna]], [[Zadar Airport|Zadar]], [[Z\u00fcrich Airport|Zurich]]<br>'''Seasonal:''' [[Athens International Airport|Athens]], [[Bra\u010d Airport|Bra\u010d]]<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO \"BOL AIRPORT\".

The {{convert|1.7|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate consists of a {{frac|1|1|2}}-story main building flanked by slightly smaller ells. The {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} walls are constructed of quartz fieldstone quarried from the property and the mansion is covered with a grey gambrel roof.<ref name=\"dhr.virginia.gov\" /> The estate was purchased by Liberty University in the late 1970s to function as the headquarters of the university administration, housing the main office of university founder Jerry Falwell. One of the many reasons for the estate's continued fame is that Falwell died at his desk at the Carter Glass Mansion on May 15, 2007; his office has been preserved in the same condition ever since. Falwell and his wife were buried on the rear lawn of the mansion and a memorial to Falwell was placed there, overlooking the rest of the campus. The estate now serves mainly as a tourist site for the historically restored mansion as well as the Falwell office, while the upstairs section of the mansion has been converted to a bed and breakfast for Liberty University guests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2008/may/15/falwells_family_preserving_his_office_at_carter_gl-ar-224228/ |title=Falwell's family preserving his

Most of Liberty University's revenue came from taxpayer-funded sources. ProPublica/New York Times reported that each of the university's 300 salespeople were pressured to enroll up to eight students per day. A division of 60 sales people targeted members of the military specifically because they had greater access to federal tuition assistance. The university's salespeople were instructed to make the university appear more affordable by describing the tuition costs per credits rather than per course. The salespeople were also instructed to not inform potential students of the Christian orientation of the education; the first classes include three required Bible-studies classes.

Most of Liberty University's revenue came from taxpayer-funded sources. ProPublica/New York Times reported that each of the university's 300 salespeople were pressured to enroll up to eight students per day. A division of 60 sales people targeted members of the military specifically because they had greater access to federal tuition assistance. The university's salespeople were instructed to make the university appear more affordable by describing the tuition costs per credits rather than per course. The salespeople were also instructed to not inform potential students of the Christian orientation of the education; the first classes include three required Bible-studies classes. The credits for the Bible-studies classes are usually not transferable to other universities, which disincentivizes students from leaving Liberty University for other universities. According to a former employee, the university accepts any student with a grade point average above 0.5 (equivalent to a D-minus).<ref name=\"MacGillis\" />\n\n==== Sponsorships ====\nLiberty University has sponsored [[NASCAR]] driver [[William Byron (racing driver)|William Byron]], also a LU student, since 2014 in a late model program run by [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]]'s [[JR Motorsports]].<ref name=JRM-WByronLateModel-2014>{{cite web|author1=Press Release|title=JRM Adds William Byron to Late Model Program for 2014|url=http://www.jrmracing.com/media/2014/01/17/jrm-adds-william-byron-to-late-model-program-for-2014|website=[[JR Motorsports|jrmracing.com]]|publisher=[[JR Motorsports]]|accessdate=1 July 2015|location=[[Mooresville, North Carolina]]|date=January 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703180736/http://www.jrmracing.com/media/2014/01/17/jrm-adds-william-byron-to-late-model-program-for-2014|archive-date=July 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Liberty is in the midst of a two-year deal with Byron and [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] team [[Hendrick Motorsports]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/08/30/liberty-university-set-to-support-william-byrons-24-through-2019/|title=William Byron sponsorship: Liberty, Hendrick ink two-year deal &#124; NASCAR.com|date=August 30, 2017|website=Official Site Of NASCAR|access-date=July 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703174953/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/08/30/liberty-university-set-to-support-william-byrons-24-through-2019/|archive-date=July 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Federal funding ===\nIn 2010,  students received about $445 million in federal financial aid money in 2010, the highest total of any school in Virginia and one of the highest in the country.<ref name=\"tops\">{{Cite news|url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2011/mar/27/liberty-tops-state-federal-aid-its-students-ar-929147/?referer=None&shorturl=http://newsadvance.com/ar/929147/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110814054227/http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2011/mar/27/liberty-tops-state-federal-aid-its-students-ar-929147/?referer=None&shorturl=http://newsadvance.com/ar/929147/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 14, 2011|title=Liberty tops state in federal aid for its students|last=Barry|first=Liz|date=March 27, 2011|newspaper=[[The News & Advance]]|accessdate=March 28, 2011|location=Lynchburg, Virginia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E2_Report.ASP|title=Fall Headcount Enrollment|publisher=Research.schev.edu|accessdate=July 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722235554/http://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E2_Report.asp|archive-date=July 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The total, a 56 percent increase over the prior year, was mostly in the form of student loans, but also included some grants and other forms of aid.<ref name=\"tops\" /> Campus officials estimated the total received in 2013 at $775 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/14/liberty-university/2764789/|title=Jerry Falwell's legacy: A thriving Liberty University|last=Marklein|first=Mary Beth|date=September 14, 2013|accessdate=October 24, 2013|publisher=Religion News Service from USA Today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006015006/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/14/liberty-university/2764789/|archive-date=October 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2011, Liberty University blocked campus access to a local Lynchburg newspaper, the ''News & Advocate'', after the newspaper reported on the school's dependence on federal financial aid.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/campus-overload/post/falwells-liberty-university-blocks-newspaper-web-site/2011/04/13/AFLYNJXD_blog.html|title=Falwell's Liberty University blocks campus access to newspaper Web site|last=Johnson|first=Jenna|date=2011-04-13|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2018-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424202926/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/campus-overload/post/falwells-liberty-university-blocks-newspaper-web-site/2011/04/13/AFLYNJXD_blog.html|archive-date=April 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Falwell Jr. said that the decision to block the newspaper was unrelated to content published in the paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/liberty-u-is-said-to-block-campus-access-to-local-newspapers-web-site/32043|title=Liberty U.

Butterfield's knowledge was slim and it was purposely kept that way throughout filming so it would be easier for him to convey his character's innocence.
