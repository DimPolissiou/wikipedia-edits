The quarry man's 'make-do' railroad solution was the continent's ''<u>first chartered railway</u>, <u>first operational non-temporary railway</u>, first well documented railroad, ''and'' first constructed railroad'' also ''meant to be permanent''.  It was perhaps the only railroad replaced by a canal, and also one of the first to close, and of those, perhaps is alone in reopening again in 1858.\n\n==1825-1832==\nInspired by the speedy success of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] (1825) in [[History of rail transport in Great Britain to 1830|England's railway]] historical record, capitalists in the United States &mdash; already embarking upon [[Main Line of Public Works|great public works infrastructure projects]] to connect the new territories of the United States with the older seaboard cities industries by the canals of [[America's Canal Age]], almost overnight began dreaming up projects using railroads &mdash; a technology in its infancy, but one employing steam engines which were rapidly becoming widely known from their successful use on steamboats.  American Steam engine pioneers were willing to experiment with [[Heat Engine]]s using higher pressures than the mainly [[Atmospheric engine]]s still fashionable in Great Britain. The rest of the world lagged the two English speaking nations.  Railroads began to be proposed where canals wouldn't do, or would be too costly and with an increase in rolling stock tonnage capacity, locomotive power, and a growing confidence born of experience and [[anthracite pig iron|new materials]] in less than three decades, the United States generally would discard canals as the principal design choice in favor of far more capable freight haulage technologies.\n\n* 1825 [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens (inventor)]], British expatriate builds a test track and runs a locomotive around it in his summer home estate, [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  This partially settles the tractive power questions, showing that on level track, metal on metal wheels can provide tractive effort and pull a load.  The ability for any engine to do so on a grade is still widely doubted in the press and minds of potential investors (pubs, clubs, boardrooms, etc.), while the minds of many potential investors were well aware that most railroads in the capital poor United States would have to surmount significant grades to be useful technology.  And while news from Europe was delayed 4\u20138 weeks, well connected Americans were aware in general of United Kingdom news coverage's and to a lesser extent, that of continental European developments.  In consequence, the 1825 success of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] only gradually eroded the three-way nay-sayer beliefs that the careful expensive gentle engineered grades extant in the early British railways was impracticable in most cases in America and that such grades were necessary since steel on iron rails would not provide traction on hills, were it possible to build an locomotive engine powerful enough to surmount such grades.  In each case, it would take experience and success against such over at least several months before the misconceptions fell into disdain.<!--\n--->\n* 1826: The {{convert|3|mi}} industrial [[animal power]]ed [[Granite Railroad]] opens in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], to convey quarried granite for the Bunker Hill monument.

By the 1860s, in any case, where all the important older canals were to be found any canal with functions satisfiable by parallel railways (excepting by definition, ship canals) is eyed by investors to be supplanted by a competing railroad.

The quarry man's 'make-do' railroad solution was the continent's ''<u>first chartered railway</u>, <u>first operational non-temporary railway</u>, first well documented railroad, ''and'' first constructed railroad'' also ''meant to be permanent''.  It was perhaps the only railroad replaced by a canal, and also one of the first to close, and of those, perhaps is alone in reopening again in 1858.\n\n==1825-1832==\nInspired by the speedy success of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] (1825) in [[History of rail transport in Great Britain to 1830|England's railway]] historical record, capitalists in the United States &mdash; already embarking upon [[Main Line of Public Works|great public works infrastructure projects]] to connect the new territories of the United States with the older seaboard cities industries by the canals of [[America's Canal Age]], almost overnight began dreaming up projects using railroads &mdash; a technology in its infancy, but one employing steam engines which were rapidly becoming widely known from their successful use on steamboats.  American Steam engine pioneers were willing to experiment with [[Heat Engine]]s using higher pressures than the mainly [[Atmospheric engine]]s still fashionable in Great Britain. The rest of the world lagged the two English speaking nations.  Railroads began to be proposed where canals wouldn't do, or would be too costly and with an increase in rolling stock tonnage capacity, locomotive power, and a growing confidence born of experience and [[anthracite pig iron|new materials]] in less than three decades, the United States generally would discard canals as the principal design choice in favor of far more capable freight haulage technologies.\n\n* 1825 [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens (inventor)]], British expatriate builds a test track and runs a locomotive around it in his summer home estate, [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  This partially settles the tractive power questions, showing that on level track, metal on metal wheels can provide tractive effort and pull a load.  The ability for any engine to do so on a grade is still widely doubted in the press and minds of potential investors (pubs, clubs, boardrooms, etc.), while the minds of many potential investors were well aware that most railroads in the capital poor United States would have to surmount significant grades to be useful technology.  And while news from Europe was delayed 4\u20138 weeks, well connected Americans were aware in general of United Kingdom news coverage's and to a lesser extent, that of continental European developments.  In consequence, the 1825 success of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] only gradually eroded the three-way nay-sayer beliefs that the careful expensive gentle engineered grades extant in the early British railways was impracticable in most cases in America and that such grades were necessary since steel on iron rails would not provide traction on hills, were it possible to build an locomotive engine powerful enough to surmount such grades.  In each case, it would take experience and success against such over at least several months before the misconceptions fell into disdain.<!--\n--->\n* 1826: The {{convert|3|mi}} industrial [[animal power]]ed [[Granite Railroad]] opens in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], to convey quarried granite for the Bunker Hill monument.

By the 1860s, in any case, where all the important older canals were to be found any canal with functions satisfiable by parallel railways (excepting by definition, ship canals) is eyed by investors to be supplanted by a competing railroad. The idea of a rail network in the US, which is by then showing early signs some areas have overbuilt in the Eastern United States is still not a common business model.
