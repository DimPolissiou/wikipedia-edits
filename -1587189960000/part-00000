She studied piano with Annie Lord at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]], Dublin, and music at [[Trinity College Dublin]] (BA 1936, BMus 1937) and continued her studies at the [[Royal College of Music]] (RCM), London, until 1940 (piano with [[Arthur Benjamin]] and composition with [[Herbert Howells]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]).<ref>Klein (1996), p. 466; see Bibliography.</ref>\n\nShe first gained notice as part of a piano duo with her sister Valerie (1917\u20131980), earning a first prize at a Belfast music competition as early as 1925.<ref>Jamieson (2013), p. 1008; see Bibliography.</ref> Joan also composed a number of works for two pianos which the duo performed. A 1938 recital at the RCM, at which they performed three of them, was their breakthrough. Other composers wrote works for them, too, including ''[[Jamaican Rumba]]'' by [[Arthur Benjamin]], which became a signature tune for the duo. Trimble's ''Phantasy Trio'' (1940) won the Cobbett Prize for chamber music. The sisters also performed modern music, including works by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Luigi Dallapiccola|Dallapiccola]], [[Arthur Bliss]] and [[Lennox Berkeley]] and continued to perform in public until 1970. Trimble married in 1942 and had children, which restricted her compositional output. In 1957 her opera ''Blind Raftery'' was the third opera commissioned by the [[BBC]] for television, and the first [[List of television operas|television opera]] written by a female composer. Between 1959 and 1977 she taught piano at the RCM, with the years since 1967 travelling from Northern Ireland.\n\nJoan Trimble's music is conservative for her time. She combined the impressionist harmonic language she had learned since her studies with Annie Lord with melodic and rhythmic inflections derived from Irish traditional music. Her arrangements of Irish airs for two pianos do not differ stylistically from her original compositions. Her most advanced music will be found in the ''Sonatina'' for two pianos (1940) and the impressive song cycle ''The County Mayo'' (1949). Trimble's music is always melodic, tastefully written, and rewarding for performers.\n\nAfter her father's death in 1967 she went to work on his newspaper, ''[[The Impartial Reporter]]'' in Enniskillen, and cared for her husband who was severely ill for decades. She regained some attention in the 1990s when she was commissioned for a new composition<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1352386/Joan-Trimble.html Obituary at the Daily Telegraph]</ref> and the first recordings of her music appeared. She died in Enniskillen just two weeks after her husband.\n\n==Legacy==\nOn 18 June 2015 \"Music in Fermanagh\" presented A Celebration Concert, as part of the Joan Trimble Centenary Celebration, at the Ardhowen Theatre in [[Enniskillen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/THE-JOAN-TRIMBLE-CENTENARY-CELEBRATION-A-Celebration-Concert-Enniskillen-P50256 |title=THE JOAN TRIMBLE CENTENARY CELEBRATION: A Celebration Concert |publisher=Discovernorthernireland.com |date=2015-02-23 |accessdate=2015-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609181323/http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/THE-JOAN-TRIMBLE-CENTENARY-CELEBRATION-A-Celebration-Concert-Enniskillen-P50256 |archive-date=9 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Baron |first=Alexander |url=http://www.thelatestnews.com/the-joan-trimble-centenary/ |title=The Joan Trimble Centenary |publisher=The Latest News |date=2015-06-11 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nList derived from Jamieson (2013), see Bibliography.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Opera'''\n*''Blind Raftery'', television opera in two scenes (BBC, May 1957)\n\n'''Orchestra'''\n*''15 Ulster Airs'' (arrangements of trad. tunes, 1939\u201340)\n*''In Glenade'' for string orchestra (1942)\n*''Suite for Strings'' for string orchestra (1951)\n\n'''Chamber Music'''\n*''The Coolin'' (Irish air) (1939) for cello & piano.
