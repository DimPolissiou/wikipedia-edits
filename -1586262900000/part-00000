Overall, with the county being situated in the east, it receives below-average rainfall for the UK, but the upper Dales of the Pennines are one of the wettest parts of England, where in contrast the driest parts of the Vale of Mowbray are some of the driest areas in the UK.\nSummer temperatures are above average, at 22&nbsp;\u00b0C, but highs can regularly reach up to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C, with over 30&nbsp;\u00b0C reached in [[heat waves]]. Winter temperatures are below average, with average lows of 1&nbsp;\u00b0C. Snow and Fog can be expected depending on location, with the [[North York Moors]] and [[Pennines]] having snow lying for an average of between 45 and 75 days per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/regmapavge.html#|title=Regional mapped climate averages|accessdate=27 September 2010|publisher=The Met Office|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229172355/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/regmapavge.html|archivedate=29 December 2010}}</ref> Sunshine is most plentiful on the coast, receiving an average of 1650 hours a year, and reduces further west in the county, with the [[Pennines]] only receiving 1250 hours a year.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = North Yorkshire\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 15\n|Feb record high C = 17\n|Mar record high C = 21\n|Apr record high C = 24\n|May record high C = 29\n|Jun record high C = 32\n|Jul record high C = 34\n|Aug record high C = 33\n|Sep record high C = 29\n|Oct record high C = 28\n|Nov record high C = 19\n|Dec record high C = 16\n|Jan high C = 6\n|Feb high C = 7\n|Mar high C = 10\n|Apr high C = 13\n|May high C = 16\n|Jun high C = 19\n|Jul high C = 22\n|Aug high C = 22\n|Sep high C = 18\n|Oct high C = 14\n|Nov high C = 10\n|Dec high C = 7\n|Jan low C = 1\n|Feb low C = 1\n|Mar low C = 2\n|Apr low C = 4\n|May low C = 7\n|Jun low C = 10\n|Jul low C = 12\n|Aug low C = 12\n|Sep low C = 10\n|Oct low C = 7\n|Nov low C = 4\n|Dec low C = 1\n|Jan record low C = -14\n|Feb record low C = -10\n|Mar record low C = -13\n|Apr record low C = -3\n|May record low C = -1\n|Jun record low C = 2\n|Jul record low C = 5\n|Aug record low C = 4\n|Sep record low C = -1\n|Oct record low C = -7\n|Nov record low C = -14\n|Dec record low C = -19\n|Jan precipitation mm = 40\n|Feb precipitation mm = 35\n|Mar precipitation mm = 43\n|Apr precipitation mm = 46\n|May precipitation mm = 42\n|Jun precipitation mm = 47\n|Jul precipitation mm = 51\n|Aug precipitation mm = 59\n|Sep precipitation mm = 53\n|Oct precipitation mm = 62\n|Nov precipitation mm = 56\n|Dec precipitation mm = 59\n|year precipitation mm = 593\n|source 1 =<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/ukmapavge.html \n |title=UK mapped climate averages \n |accessdate=27 September 2010 \n |publisher=The Met Office \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230185431/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/ukmapavge.html \n |archivedate=30 December 2010 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-11908065|title=Temperature of \u221219C is new Yorkshire record|date=3 December 2010|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 December 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206045542/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-11908065|archivedate=6 December 2010}}</ref>\n|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Settlements==\n\n===Map===\n\n{{Location map+|North Yorkshire\n |width=550|float=center|caption=The 19 largest settlements of North Yorkshire, along with Malton.

Yorkshire]]. [[Yorkshire Television]] and [[Tyne Tees Television]] are also received in most areas of the County, [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]] and the Western part of the [[Craven]] area is served by [[BBC North West]] and [[Granada Television]].\n[[BBC Tees]] is broadcast to northern parts of the county, whist [[BBC Radio York]] is broadcast more widely. [[BBC Radio Leeds]] and [[Minster FM]] (Based in [[York]]) broadcast to southern parts of the county.\n\n[[Yorkshire Coast Radio]] serves the coastal towns of Scarborough, Whitby, and Filey providing a daily local news service from studios in Scarborough.\n\n==Transport==\nThe main road through the county is the north\u2013south [[A1(M) motorway (Great Britain)|A1(M)]] which has gradually been upgraded to motorway status since the early 1990s. The only other motorways within the county are the short [[A66 road#A66(M)|A66(M)]] near [[Darlington]] and a small stretch of the [[M62 motorway]] close to [[Eggborough]].<ref name=NY/> The other nationally maintained trunk routes are the [[A168 road|A168]]/[[A19 road|A19]], [[A64 road|A64]], the [[A66 road|A66]] and [[A174 road|A174]].\n\nThe [[East Coast Main Line]] (ECML) bisects the county stopping at [[Northallerton railway station|Northallerton]], [[Thirsk railway station|Thirsk]] and [[York railway station|York]]. Passenger services on the ECML within the county are operated by [[London North Eastern Railway]], [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]]. TransPennine Express run services on the [[York to Scarborough Line]] and the [[Northallerton\u2013Eaglescliffe Line]] (for [[Middlesbrough railway station|Middlesbrough]]) that both branch off the ECML.\n\n[[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] operate the remaining lines in the county including commuter services on the [[Harrogate Line]], [[Airedale Line]] and York & Selby Lines, of which the former two are covered by the [[West Yorkshire Metro|Metro]] ticketing area. Remaining branch lines operated by Northern include the [[Yorkshire Coast Line]] from Scarborough to Hull, the [[Hull to York Line]] via [[Selby railway station|Selby]], the [[Tees Valley Line]] from [[Darlington railway station|Darlington]] to [[Saltburn railway station|Saltburn]] and the [[Esk Valley Line]] from Middlesbrough to [[Whitby railway station|Whitby]]. Last but certainly not least, the [[Settle-Carlisle Line]] runs through the west of the county with services again operated by Northern.\n[[File:North yorkshire moors railway map.gif|thumb|right|Current and former railway routes in eastern North Yorkshire]]\nThe county suffered badly under the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching]] cuts of the 1960s. Places such as [[Richmond railway station (North Yorkshire)|Richmond]], [[Ripon railway station|Ripon]], [[Tadcaster railway station|Tadcaster]], [[Helmsley railway station|Helmsley]], [[Pickering railway station|Pickering]] and the [[Wensleydale]] communities lost their passenger services. Notable lines closed were the [[Scarborough and Whitby Railway]], [[Malton and Driffield Railway]] and the secondary main line between Northallerton and Harrogate via Ripon.\n\nHeritage railways within North Yorkshire include the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]] between [[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]] and [[Grosmont, North Yorkshire|Grosmont]], which opened in 1973, the [[Derwent Valley Light Railway]] near York, and the [[Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway]]. The [[Wensleydale Railway]], which started operating in 2003, runs services between [[Leeming Bar railway station|Leeming Bar]] and [[Redmire railway station|Redmire]] along a former freight-only line. The medium-term aim is to operate into Northallerton station on the ECML once an agreement can be reached with [[Network Rail]]. In the longer term, the aim is to reinstate the full line west via [[Hawes]] to [[Garsdale railway station|Garsdale]] on the Settle-Carlisle line.\n\n[[York railway station]] is the largest station in the county with 11 platforms and is a major tourist attraction in its own right. The station is immediately adjacent to the [[National Railway Museum]].\n\nLong-distance coach services are operated by [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] and [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]]. Local bus service operators include [[Arriva Yorkshire]], [[Harrogate Bus Company]], Scarborough & District ([[East Yorkshire Motor Services]]), [[Yorkshire Coastliner]], [[First York]] and the local [[Dales & District]].\n\nThere are no major airports in the county itself but nearby airports include [[Durham Tees Valley Airport|Durham Tees Valley]], [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]], [[Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield|Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield]] and [[Leeds Bradford International Airport|Leeds Bradford]].\n\n==Sports==\nNorth Yorkshire is home to several football clubs, including [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] who play in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]] who play in the [[National League (division)|National League]] finishing in 6th place and qualifying for the National League playoffs in their first season in the league. [[York City F.C.|York City]] who play in The [[National League North]] and finished 11th during the [[2017-18 National League]] season. [[Whitby Town FC]] have reached the FA Cup first round seven times, and have played the likes of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], Wigan and Plymouth Argyle, they currently play in the Evo-Stik Premier League. Other lower league clubs include [[Harrogate Railway Athletic F.C.|Harrogate Railway Athletic]], [[Northallerton Town F.C.|Northallerton Town]], [[Pickering Town F.C.|Pickering Town]], [[Scarborough Athletic F.C.|Scarborough Athletic]], [[Selby Town F.C.|Selby Town]] and [[Tadcaster Albion F.C.|Tadcaster Albion]].\n\n[[Rugby union]] teams in the county include [[Middlesbrough rugby union football team|Middlesbrough RUFC]] who play their league games in [[Durham/Northumberland 1]]. [[York City Knights]] (previously [[York F.C.]]) are a [[rugby league]] team who play in the [[Rugby League Championships]].\n\nNorth Yorkshire is home to many [[racecourses]]; these include [[Catterick Bridge Racecourse|Catterick Bridge]], [[Redcar Racecourse|Redcar]], [[Ripon Racecourse|Ripon]], [[Thirsk Racecourse|Thirsk]] and [[York Racecourse|York]]. It also has one [[Auto racing|motor racing]] circuit, [[Croft Circuit]]; the circuit holds meetings of the [[British Touring Car Championship]], [[British Superbike]] and [[Pickup Truck Racing]] race series and one Motorcycle Racing Circuit at Oliver's Mount, Scarborough.\n\n[[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]], play a number of fixtures at [[North Marine Road]], [[Scarborough, North

Yorkshire]]. [[Yorkshire Television]] and [[Tyne Tees Television]] are also received in most areas of the County, [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]] and the Western part of the [[Craven]] area is served by [[BBC North West]] and [[Granada Television]].\n[[BBC Tees]] is broadcast to northern parts of the county, whist [[BBC Radio York]] is broadcast more widely. [[BBC Radio Leeds]] and [[Minster FM]] (Based in [[York]]) broadcast to southern parts of the county.\n\n[[Yorkshire Coast Radio]] serves the coastal towns of Scarborough, Whitby, and Filey providing a daily local news service from studios in Scarborough.\n\n==Transport==\nThe main road through the county is the north\u2013south [[A1(M) motorway (Great Britain)|A1(M)]] which has gradually been upgraded to motorway status since the early 1990s. The only other motorways within the county are the short [[A66 road#A66(M)|A66(M)]] near [[Darlington]] and a small stretch of the [[M62 motorway]] close to [[Eggborough]].<ref name=NY/> The other nationally maintained trunk routes are the [[A168 road|A168]]/[[A19 road|A19]], [[A64 road|A64]], the [[A66 road|A66]] and [[A174 road|A174]].\n\nThe [[East Coast Main Line]] (ECML) bisects the county stopping at [[Northallerton railway station|Northallerton]], [[Thirsk railway station|Thirsk]] and [[York railway station|York]]. Passenger services on the ECML within the county are operated by [[London North Eastern Railway]], [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]]. TransPennine Express run services on the [[York to Scarborough Line]] and the [[Northallerton\u2013Eaglescliffe Line]] (for [[Middlesbrough railway station|Middlesbrough]]) that both branch off the ECML.\n\n[[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] operate the remaining lines in the county including commuter services on the [[Harrogate Line]], [[Airedale Line]] and York & Selby Lines, of which the former two are covered by the [[West Yorkshire Metro|Metro]] ticketing area. Remaining branch lines operated by Northern include the [[Yorkshire Coast Line]] from Scarborough to Hull, the [[Hull to York Line]] via [[Selby railway station|Selby]], the [[Tees Valley Line]] from [[Darlington railway station|Darlington]] to [[Saltburn railway station|Saltburn]] and the [[Esk Valley Line]] from Middlesbrough to [[Whitby railway station|Whitby]]. Last but certainly not least, the [[Settle-Carlisle Line]] runs through the west of the county with services again operated by Northern.\n[[File:North yorkshire moors railway map.gif|thumb|right|Current and former railway routes in eastern North Yorkshire]]\nThe county suffered badly under the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching]] cuts of the 1960s. Places such as [[Richmond railway station (North Yorkshire)|Richmond]], [[Ripon railway station|Ripon]], [[Tadcaster railway station|Tadcaster]], [[Helmsley railway station|Helmsley]], [[Pickering railway station|Pickering]] and the [[Wensleydale]] communities lost their passenger services. Notable lines closed were the [[Scarborough and Whitby Railway]], [[Malton and Driffield Railway]] and the secondary main line between Northallerton and Harrogate via Ripon.\n\nHeritage railways within North Yorkshire include the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]] between [[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]] and [[Grosmont, North Yorkshire|Grosmont]], which opened in 1973, the [[Derwent Valley Light Railway]] near York, and the [[Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway]]. The [[Wensleydale Railway]], which started operating in 2003, runs services between [[Leeming Bar railway station|Leeming Bar]] and [[Redmire railway station|Redmire]] along a former freight-only line. The medium-term aim is to operate into Northallerton station on the ECML once an agreement can be reached with [[Network Rail]]. In the longer term, the aim is to reinstate the full line west via [[Hawes]] to [[Garsdale railway station|Garsdale]] on the Settle-Carlisle line.\n\n[[York railway station]] is the largest station in the county with 11 platforms and is a major tourist attraction in its own right. The station is immediately adjacent to the [[National Railway Museum]].\n\nLong-distance coach services are operated by [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] and [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]]. Local bus service operators include [[Arriva Yorkshire]], [[Harrogate Bus Company]], Scarborough & District ([[East Yorkshire Motor Services]]), [[Yorkshire Coastliner]], [[First York]] and the local [[Dales & District]].\n\nThere are no major airports in the county itself but nearby airports include [[Durham Tees Valley Airport|Durham Tees Valley]], [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]], [[Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield|Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield]] and [[Leeds Bradford International Airport|Leeds Bradford]].\n\n==Sports==\nNorth Yorkshire is home to several football clubs, including [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] who play in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] and [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]] who play in the [[National League (division)|National League]] finishing in 6th place and qualifying for the National League playoffs in their first season in the league. [[York City F.C.|York City]] who play in The [[National League North]] and finished 11th during the [[2017-18 National League]] season. [[Whitby Town FC]] have reached the FA Cup first round seven times, and have played the likes of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], Wigan and Plymouth Argyle, they currently play in the Evo-Stik Premier League. Other lower league clubs include [[Harrogate Railway Athletic F.C.|Harrogate Railway Athletic]], [[Northallerton Town F.C.|Northallerton Town]], [[Pickering Town F.C.|Pickering Town]], [[Scarborough Athletic F.C.|Scarborough Athletic]], [[Selby Town F.C.|Selby Town]] and [[Tadcaster Albion F.C.|Tadcaster Albion]].\n\n[[Rugby union]] teams in the county include [[Middlesbrough rugby union football team|Middlesbrough RUFC]] who play their league games in [[Durham/Northumberland 1]]. [[York City Knights]] (previously [[York F.C.]]) are a [[rugby league]] team who play in the [[Rugby League Championships]].\n\nNorth Yorkshire is home to many [[racecourses]]; these include [[Catterick Bridge Racecourse|Catterick Bridge]], [[Redcar Racecourse|Redcar]], [[Ripon Racecourse|Ripon]], [[Thirsk Racecourse|Thirsk]] and [[York Racecourse|York]]. It also has one [[Auto racing|motor racing]] circuit, [[Croft Circuit]]; the circuit holds meetings of the [[British Touring Car Championship]], [[British Superbike]] and [[Pickup Truck Racing]] race series and one Motorcycle Racing Circuit at Oliver's Mount, Scarborough.\n\n[[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]], play a number of fixtures at [[North Marine Road]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]].\n\nThe ball game [[Rock-It-Ball]] was developed in the county.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lord Lieutenant of North Yorkshire|List of Lords Lieutenant of North Yorkshire]]\n* [[High Sheriff of North Yorkshire|List of High Sheriffs of North Yorkshire]]\n* [[North Yorkshire Police]]\n* [[North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|North Yorkshire}}\n{{Commons category|North Yorkshire}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n* [http://www.northyorks.gov.uk/ North Yorkshire County Council]\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/ BBC North Yorkshire] \u2013 North Yorkshire features, videos and pictures from the BBC\n* [http://www.yorkshiredalesriverstrust.org.uk/  Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust]\n* {{curlie|Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/North_Yorkshire}}\n* [http://viewfinder.english-heritage.org.uk/search/results.aspx?index=0&mainQuery=&searchType=all&form=basic&theme=&county=NORTH%20YORKSHIRE&district=&placeName= Images of North Yorkshire] at the [[English Heritage Archive]]\n* [https://www.yorkshirecoastradio.com/ Yorkshire Coast Radio]\n\n{{North Yorkshire}}\n{{Yorkshire}}\n{{Yorkshire and the Humber}}\n{{England counties}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{coord|54|10|N|1|20|W|region:GB_type:adm1st|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:North Yorkshire| ]]\n[[Category:Counties of England established in 1974]]\n[[Category:Non-metropolitan counties]]\n", "name_user": "Twotwofourtysix", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yorkshire"}

The term ''software as a service'' (SaaS), however, is commonly used in more specific settings:\n\n* While most initial ASP's focused on managing and hosting third-party [[independent software vendor]]s' software, {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} SaaS vendors typically develop and manage their own software.\n* Whereas many initial ASPs offered more traditional [[client-server model|client-server]] applications, which require installation of software on users' [[personal computer]]s, SaaS solutions of today rely predominantly [[Web application|on the Web]] and only requires a web browser to use.\n* Whereas the [[software architecture]] used by most initial ASPs mandated maintaining a separate instance of the application for each business, {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} SaaS solutions normally utilize a [[multitenancy|multitenant]] architecture, in which the application serves multiple businesses and users, and partitions its data accordingly.\n\nThe acronym first appeared in the goods and services description of a [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] [[trademark]], filed on September 23, 1985.<ref>{{Cite journal\n |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73559543&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch \n |title=USPTO Service Mark\n |publisher=USPTO\n |location=[[Alexandria, VA]] \n}}</ref>\n\nDbaaS ([[database as a service]]) has emerged as a sub-variety of SaaS,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last          = Ferrari\n| first         = Elena\n| title         = Access Control in Data Management Systems\n| url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=sfEXMcvWzyoC\n| accessdate    = 2012-02-13\n| series        = Synthesis Lectures on Data Management\n| year          = 2010\n| publisher     = Morgan & Claypool Publishers\n| isbn          = 978-1-60845-375-7\n| page          = 77\n| quote         = [...] a new emerging option is represented by the Database as a Service (DbaaS) paradigm [...].

However, as the market has grown, SaaS and managed service players have been forced to try to redefine their role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.compubase.net/The-year-of-Cloud-adoption-by-the-Channel_a188.html |title=The year of Cloud adoption by the Channel |publisher=compuBase |accessdate=February 13, 2013|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Pricing ==\nUnlike traditional software, which is conventionally sold as a [[perpetual license]] with an up-front cost (and an optional ongoing support fee), SaaS providers generally price applications using a subscription fee, most commonly a monthly fee or an annual fee.<ref>{{cite web |title=Software as a Service (SaaS) Definition and Solutions |url=http://www.cio.com/article/109704/Software_as_a_Service_SaaS_Definition_and_Solutions |work=CIO |last=Levinson |first=Meridith |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2015-03-24}}</ref> Consequently, the initial setup cost for SaaS is typically lower than the equivalent enterprise software. SaaS vendors typically price their applications based on some usage parameters, such as the number of users using the application. However, because in a SaaS environment customers' data reside with the SaaS vendor, opportunities also exist to charge per transaction, event, or other units of value, such as the number of processors required.<ref name=\"box.com\">{{cite web|url=https://bvp.box.com/shared/static/05d7zb2zi64q7rbv1opl.pdf|title=Software as a Service Pricing Strategies|date=July 2013|author=Byron Deeter and Ryan Jung}}</ref>\n\nThe relatively low cost for [[Provisioning#User provisioning|user provisioning]] (i.e., setting up a new customer) in a multitenant environment enables some SaaS vendors to offer applications using the [[freemium]] model.<ref name=\"box.com\"/> In this model, a free service is made available with limited functionality or scope, and fees are charged for enhanced functionality or larger scope.<ref name=\"box.com\"/> Some other SaaS applications are completely free to users, with revenue being derived from alternative sources such as advertising.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jain|first=Shalin|title=Pricing your SaaS Application|url=http://tenmiles.com/blog/2010/04/pricing-your-saas-application/|work=Tenmiles Blog}}</ref>\n\nA key driver of SaaS growth is SaaS vendors' ability to provide a price that is competitive with on-premises software. This is consistent with the traditional rationale for outsourcing IT systems, which involves applying [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]] to application operation, i.e., an outside service provider may be able to offer better, cheaper, more reliable applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/build-vs-buy-know-buy-software-build-01755435|title=Build vs. Buy: How to Know When to Buy Software or Build It Yourself|website=Business 2 Community|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe vast majority of SaaS solutions are based on a [[Multitenancy|multitenant]] architecture.  With this model, a single [[software versioning|version]] of the application, with a single [[computer configuration|configuration]] ([[personal computer hardware|hardware]], [[computer network|network]], [[operating system]]), is used for all customers (\"tenants\"). To support [[scalability]], the application can be installed on multiple machines (called [[horizontal scaling]]). In some cases, a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers access to pre-release versions of the applications (e.g., a [[beta version]]) for [[Software testing|testing]] purposes. This is contrasted with traditional software, where multiple physical copies of the software \u2014 each potentially of a different version, with a potentially different configuration, and often customized \u2014 are installed across various customer sites.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hacig\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f |first1=Hakan |last2=Balakrishna |first2=R.

In other words, like traditional enterprise software, a single customer can alter the set of configuration options (a.k.a. [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s) that affect its functionality and [[look-and-feel]]. Each customer may have its own settings (or: parameter values) for the configuration options. The application can be customized to the degree it was designed for based on a set of predefined configuration options.\n\nFor example, to support customers' common need to change an application's look-and-feel so that the application appears to be having the customer's [[brand]] (or\u2014if so desired\u2014[[co-branding|co-branded]]), many SaaS applications let customers provide (through a [[self-service]] interface or by working with application provider staff) a custom logo and sometimes a set of custom colors. The customer cannot, however, change the [[page layout]] unless such an option was designed for.\n\n===Accelerated feature delivery===\nSaaS applications are often updated more frequently than traditional software,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.gartner.com/guy-creese/2010/05/18/saas-vs-software-the-development-cycle-for-saas-is-usually-not-always-faster/ |title = SaaS vs. Software: The Release Cycle for SaaS Is Usually (Not Always) Faster |work = Blog |publisher = Gartner |date = 18 May 2010 |first = Guy |last = Creese |accessdate = 24 April 2011}}</ref> in many cases on a weekly or monthly basis. This is enabled by several factors:\n* The application is hosted centrally, so an update is decided and executed by the provider, not by customers.\n* The application only has a single configuration, making development testing faster.\n* The application vendor does not have to expend resources updating and maintaining backdated versions of the software, because there is only a single version.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.saasmarket.in/pages/Benefits_of_SaaS |title = Benefits of SaaS |work = SaaSMarket |date = 10 December 2016 |accessdate = 10 December 2016\n}}</ref> \n* The application vendor has access to all customer data, expediting [[software design|design]] and [[regression testing]].\n* The solution provider has access to user behavior within the application (usually via [[web analytics]]), making it easier to identify areas worthy of improvement.\n\nAccelerated feature delivery is further enabled by [[agile software development]] methodologies.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.devx.com/SaaS/Article/36357/0/page/1 |title = Jumping to SaaS? Take Agile Software Development Along with You |work = DevX |publisher = QuinStreet |date = 8 January 2008 |accessdate = 24 April 2011 |first = Eric | last = Kuhnen}}</ref> Such methodologies, which have evolved in the mid-1990s, provide a set of [[software development tool]]s and practices to support frequent software releases.\n\n===Open integration protocols===\nBecause SaaS applications cannot access a company's internal systems (databases or internal services), they predominantly offer integration protocols<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cimpl.com/bid/205831/The-Arguments-for-Software-as-a-Service-SaaS|title=The Arguments for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)|last=Cimpl|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref> and [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) that operate over a [[wide area network]]. Typically, these are protocols based on [[HTTP]], [[REST]], and [[SOAP]].\n\nThe ubiquity of SaaS applications and other Internet services and the standardization of their API technology has spawned the development of [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]s, which are lightweight applications that combine data, presentation and functionality from multiple services, creating a compound service. Mashups further differentiate SaaS applications from on-premises software as the latter cannot be easily integrated outside a company's  [[firewall (computing)|firewall]].\n\n===Collaborative (and \"social\") functionality===\nInspired by the success of [[online social network]]s and other so-called ''[[web 2.0]]'' functionality, many SaaS applications offer features that let their users [[collaboration|collaborate]] and [[information sharing|share information]].\n\nFor example, many [[project management]] applications delivered in the SaaS model offer\u2014in addition to traditional project planning functionality\u2014collaboration features letting users comment on tasks and plans and share documents within and outside an organization. Several other SaaS applications let users vote on and offer new feature ideas.\n\nAlthough some collaboration-related functionality is also integrated into on-premises software, (implicit or explicit) collaboration between users or different customers is only possible with centrally hosted software.\n\n===OpenSaas===\n'''OpenSaaS''' refers to software as a service (SaaS) based on [[Open-source software|open source]] code. Similar to SaaS applications, Open SaaS is a web-based application that is hosted, supported and maintained by a service provider. While the roadmap for Open SaaS applications is defined by its community of users, upgrades and product enhancements are managed by a central provider. The term was coined in 2011 by [[Dries Buytaert]], creator of the [[Drupal]] content management framework.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url = http://buytaert.net/acquia-product-strategy-and-vision\n  |title = Acquia product strategy and vision\n  |publisher = Dries Buytaert weblog\n  |date = 24 January 2011\n  |first = Dries\n  |last = Buytaert\n  |accessdate = 5 October 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nAndrew Hoppin, a former Chief Information Officer for the [[New York State Senate]], has been a vocal advocate of OpenSaaS for government, calling it \"the future of government innovation.\" He points to [[WordPress]] and Why Unified as a successful example of an OpenSaaS software delivery model that gives customers \"the best of both worlds, and more options. The fact that it is open source means that they can start building their websites by self-hosting WordPress and customizing their website to their heart\u2019s content.

According to Woods, \"Open source provides the escape hatch. In Drupal Gardens, users will be able to press a button and get a source code version of the Drupal code that runs their site along with the data from the database. Then, you can take that code, put it up at one of the hosting companies, and you can do anything that you would like to do.\"<ref>{{cite magazine\n  |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2010/11/09/a-new-open-source-model-for-saas/\n  |title = A New Open-Source Model For SaaS\n  |magazine = Forbes\n  |date = 9 November 2010\n  |first = Dan\n  |last = Woods\n  |accessdate = 21 September 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==Adoption drivers==\nSeveral important changes to the software market and technology landscape have facilitated the acceptance and growth of SaaS solutions:\n* The growing use of web-based [[user interface]]s by applications, along with the proliferation of associated practices (e.g., [[web design]]), continuously decreased the need for traditional client-server applications. Consequently, traditional software vendor's investment in software based on [[fat client]]s has become a disadvantage (mandating ongoing support), opening the door for new software vendors offering a [[user experience]] perceived as more \"modern\".\n* The standardization of web page technologies ([[HTML]], [[JavaScript]], [[CSS]]), the increasing popularity of [[web development]] as a practice, and the introduction and ubiquity of [[web application framework]]s like [[Ruby on Rails]] or [[Laravel]] ([[PHP]]) gradually reduced the cost of developing new SaaS solutions, and enabled new solution providers to come up with competitive solutions, challenging traditional vendors.\n* The increasing penetration of [[broadband Internet access]] enabled remote centrally hosted applications to offer speed comparable to on-premises software.\n* The standardization of the [[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]] protocol as part of the web stack provided universally available lightweight [[computer security|security]] that is sufficient for most everyday applications.\n* The introduction and wide acceptance of lightweight [[system integration|integration]] [[communications protocol|protocol]]s such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and SOAP enabled affordable integration between SaaS applications (residing in the cloud) with internal applications over wide area networks and with other SaaS applications.\n\n== Adoption challenges ==\nSome limitations slow down the acceptance of SaaS and prohibit it from being used in some cases:\n* Because data is stored on the vendor's servers, data security becomes an issue.<ref name= Forrester>{{cite web |url = http://community.forrester.com/message/10906 |title = SaaS And The Everlasting Security Concerns | work = Community |publisher = [[Forrester Research]] |date = 20 December 2010 |accessdate = 24 April 2011 |first = Miroslaw |last = Lisserman}}</ref>\n* SaaS applications are hosted in the cloud, far away from the application users. This introduces latency into the environment; for example, the SaaS model is not suitable for applications that demand response times in the milliseconds ([[Online transaction processing|OLTP]]).\n* Multitenant architectures, which drive cost efficiency for SaaS solution providers, limit customization of applications for large clients, inhibiting such applications from being used in scenarios (applicable mostly to large enterprises) for which such customization is necessary.\n* Some business applications require access to or integration with customer's current data. When such data are large in volume or sensitive (e.g. end-users' personal information), integrating them with remotely hosted software can be costly or risky, or can conflict with data governance regulations.\n* Constitutional search/seizure warrant laws do not protect all forms of SaaS dynamically stored data. The end result is that a link is added to the chain of security where access to the data, and, by extension, misuse of these data, are limited only by the assumed honesty of third parties or government agencies able to access the data on their own recognizance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arthur |first=Charles |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/dec/14/chrome-os-richard-stallman-warning |title=Google's ChromeOS means losing control of the data, warns GNU founder Richard Stallman | work = The Guardian | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | date= 2010-12-14 |accessdate= 2012-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Why Richard Stallman Takes No Shine to Chrome |url= http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Why-Richard-Stallman-Takes-No-Shine-to-Chrome-71469.html |work=Linux Insider |last= Adhikari |first=Richard |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate= 2015-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Stallman |first= Richard|title= Who does that server really serve? |url= https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html |publisher=[[GNU]] Project | work = [[Boston Review]] |accessdate=15 January 2012 |date= 2011-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Hill|first= Benjamin Mako |title= Show Me the Code|url= http://revealingerrors.com/show_me_the_code |work= Revealing Errors |accessdate= 15 January 2012 |authorlink= Benjamin Mako Hill|date= 1 Feb 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|last= Assange |first= Julian | location= London |date= April 9, 2011|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|accessdate= 15 January 2012 |subjectlink= Julian Assange |url= http://rt.com/news/wikileaks-revelations-assange-interview/ | title = Wikileaks revelations |quote= Facebook, Google, Yahoo \u2013 all these major US organizations have built-in interfaces for US intelligence.

In 2010, ''Forbes'' contributor Dan Woods noted that Drupal Gardens, a web hosting platform based on the [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Drupal]] [[content management system]], is a \"new open-source model for SaaS\".

Obtaining the code is relatively simple, as it is an integration of existing extensions, plug-ins, templates, etc.  Actual customizations are rare, and usually quickly replaced by more standard publicly available extensions.

Starting in that decade, [[IBM]] and other [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] providers conducted a [[service bureau]] business, often referred to as [[time-sharing]] or [[utility computing]]. Such services included offering [[computing]] power and [[database]] storage to banks and other large organizations from their worldwide [[data center]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=OECD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWOQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=Such+services+included+offering+computing+power+and+database+storage+to+banks+and+other+large+organizations+from+their+worldwide+data+centers.&source=bl&ots=yxEkd3FOCk&sig=ACfU3U2hLxkm54ah0uyPY-omMPE5dTMzqQ&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRubL74NvnAhXsoFsKHQ8XCwMQ6AEwAXoECBQQAQ#v=onepage&q=Such%20services%20included%20offering%20computing%20power%20and%20database%20storage%20to%20banks%20and%20other%20large%20organizations%20from%20their%20worldwide%20data%20centers.&f=false|title=OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy, Action 1 - 2015 Final Report|date=2015-10-05|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-24104-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the Internet during the 1990s brought about a new class of [[centralized computing]], called [[application service provider]]s (ASP). ASPs provided businesses with the service of hosting and managing specialized business applications, with the goal of reducing costs through central administration and through the solution provider's specialization in a particular business application. Two of the world's pioneers and largest ASPs were USI, which was headquartered in the Washington, DC area, and Futurelink Corporation, headquartered in [[Irvine, California]].<ref>{{cite web|last= Gaw |first= Jonathan | date = Oct 20, 1999 |title= Ladouceur Named CEO of FutureLink|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/20/business/fi-24175 |work= Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\nSoftware as a Service essentially extends the idea of the ASP model. The term ''software as a service'' (SaaS), however, is commonly used in more specific settings:\n\n* While most initial ASP's focused on managing and hosting third-party [[independent software vendor]]s' software, {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} SaaS vendors typically develop and manage their own software.\n* Whereas many initial ASPs offered more traditional [[client-server model|client-server]] applications, which require installation of software on users' [[personal computer]]s, SaaS solutions of today rely predominantly [[Web application|on the Web]] and only requires a web browser to use.\n* Whereas the [[software architecture]] used by most initial ASPs mandated maintaining a separate instance of the application for each business, {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} SaaS solutions normally utilize a [[multitenancy|multitenant]] architecture, in which the application serves multiple businesses and users, and partitions its data accordingly.\n\nThe acronym first appeared in the goods and services description of a [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] [[trademark]], filed on September 23, 1985.<ref>{{Cite journal\n |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73559543&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch \n |title=USPTO Service Mark\n |publisher=USPTO\n |location=[[Alexandria, VA]] \n}}</ref>\n\nDbaaS ([[database as a service]]) has emerged as a sub-variety of SaaS,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last          = Ferrari\n| first         = Elena\n| title         = Access Control in Data Management Systems\n| url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=sfEXMcvWzyoC\n| accessdate    = 2012-02-13\n| series        = Synthesis Lectures on Data Management\n| year          = 2010\n| publisher     = Morgan & Claypool Publishers\n| isbn          = 978-1-60845-375-7\n| page          = 77\n| quote         = [...] a new emerging option is represented by the Database as a Service (DbaaS) paradigm [...].

However, as the market has grown, SaaS and managed service players have been forced to try to redefine their role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.compubase.net/The-year-of-Cloud-adoption-by-the-Channel_a188.html |title=The year of Cloud adoption by the Channel |publisher=compuBase |accessdate=February 13, 2013|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Pricing ==\nUnlike traditional software, which is conventionally sold as a [[perpetual license]] with an up-front cost (and an optional ongoing support fee), SaaS providers generally price applications using a subscription fee, most commonly a monthly fee or an annual fee.<ref>{{cite web |title=Software as a Service (SaaS) Definition and Solutions |url=http://www.cio.com/article/109704/Software_as_a_Service_SaaS_Definition_and_Solutions |work=CIO |last=Levinson |first=Meridith |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2015-03-24}}</ref> Consequently, the initial setup cost for SaaS is typically lower than the equivalent enterprise software. SaaS vendors typically price their applications based on some usage parameters, such as the number of users using the application. However, because in a SaaS environment customers' data reside with the SaaS vendor, opportunities also exist to charge per transaction, event, or other units of value, such as the number of processors required.<ref name=\"box.com\">{{cite web|url=https://bvp.box.com/shared/static/05d7zb2zi64q7rbv1opl.pdf|title=Software as a Service Pricing Strategies|date=July 2013|author=Byron Deeter and Ryan Jung}}</ref>\n\nThe relatively low cost for [[Provisioning#User provisioning|user provisioning]] (i.e., setting up a new customer) in a multitenant environment enables some SaaS vendors to offer applications using the [[freemium]] model.<ref name=\"box.com\"/> In this model, a free service is made available with limited functionality or scope, and fees are charged for enhanced functionality or larger scope.<ref name=\"box.com\"/> Some other SaaS applications are completely free to users, with revenue being derived from alternative sources such as advertising.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jain|first=Shalin|title=Pricing your SaaS Application|url=http://tenmiles.com/blog/2010/04/pricing-your-saas-application/|work=Tenmiles Blog}}</ref>\n\nA key driver of SaaS growth is SaaS vendors' ability to provide a price that is competitive with on-premises software. This is consistent with the traditional rationale for outsourcing IT systems, which involves applying [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]] to application operation, i.e., an outside service provider may be able to offer better, cheaper, more reliable applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/build-vs-buy-know-buy-software-build-01755435|title=Build vs. Buy: How to Know When to Buy Software or Build It Yourself|website=Business 2 Community|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe vast majority of SaaS solutions are based on a [[Multitenancy|multitenant]] architecture.  With this model, a single [[software versioning|version]] of the application, with a single [[computer configuration|configuration]] ([[personal computer hardware|hardware]], [[computer network|network]], [[operating system]]), is used for all customers (\"tenants\"). To support [[scalability]], the application can be installed on multiple machines (called [[horizontal scaling]]). In some cases, a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers access to pre-release versions of the applications (e.g., a [[beta version]]) for [[Software testing|testing]] purposes. This is contrasted with traditional software, where multiple physical copies of the software \u2014 each potentially of a different version, with a potentially different configuration, and often customized \u2014 are installed across various customer sites.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hacig\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f |first1=Hakan |last2=Balakrishna |first2=R.

In other words, like traditional enterprise software, a single customer can alter the set of configuration options (a.k.a. [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s) that affect its functionality and [[look-and-feel]]. Each customer may have its own settings (or: parameter values) for the configuration options. The application can be customized to the degree it was designed for based on a set of predefined configuration options.\n\nFor example, to support customers' common need to change an application's look-and-feel so that the application appears to be having the customer's [[brand]] (or\u2014if so desired\u2014[[co-branding|co-branded]]), many SaaS applications let customers provide (through a [[self-service]] interface or by working with application provider staff) a custom logo and sometimes a set of custom colors. The customer cannot, however, change the [[page layout]] unless such an option was designed for.\n\n===Accelerated feature delivery===\nSaaS applications are often updated more frequently than traditional software,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.gartner.com/guy-creese/2010/05/18/saas-vs-software-the-development-cycle-for-saas-is-usually-not-always-faster/ |title = SaaS vs. Software: The Release Cycle for SaaS Is Usually (Not Always) Faster |work = Blog |publisher = Gartner |date = 18 May 2010 |first = Guy |last = Creese |accessdate = 24 April 2011}}</ref> in many cases on a weekly or monthly basis. This is enabled by several factors:\n* The application is hosted centrally, so an update is decided and executed by the provider, not by customers.\n* The application only has a single configuration, making development testing faster.\n* The application vendor does not have to expend resources updating and maintaining backdated versions of the software, because there is only a single version.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.saasmarket.in/pages/Benefits_of_SaaS |title = Benefits of SaaS |work = SaaSMarket |date = 10 December 2016 |accessdate = 10 December 2016\n}}</ref> \n* The application vendor has access to all customer data, expediting [[software design|design]] and [[regression testing]].\n* The solution provider has access to user behavior within the application (usually via [[web analytics]]), making it easier to identify areas worthy of improvement.\n\nAccelerated feature delivery is further enabled by [[agile software development]] methodologies.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.devx.com/SaaS/Article/36357/0/page/1 |title = Jumping to SaaS? Take Agile Software Development Along with You |work = DevX |publisher = QuinStreet |date = 8 January 2008 |accessdate = 24 April 2011 |first = Eric | last = Kuhnen}}</ref> Such methodologies, which have evolved in the mid-1990s, provide a set of [[software development tool]]s and practices to support frequent software releases.\n\n===Open integration protocols===\nBecause SaaS applications cannot access a company's internal systems (databases or internal services), they predominantly offer integration protocols<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cimpl.com/bid/205831/The-Arguments-for-Software-as-a-Service-SaaS|title=The Arguments for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)|last=Cimpl|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref> and [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) that operate over a [[wide area network]]. Typically, these are protocols based on [[HTTP]], [[REST]], and [[SOAP]].\n\nThe ubiquity of SaaS applications and other Internet services and the standardization of their API technology has spawned the development of [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]s, which are lightweight applications that combine data, presentation and functionality from multiple services, creating a compound service. Mashups further differentiate SaaS applications from on-premises software as the latter cannot be easily integrated outside a company's  [[firewall (computing)|firewall]].\n\n===Collaborative (and \"social\") functionality===\nInspired by the success of [[online social network]]s and other so-called ''[[web 2.0]]'' functionality, many SaaS applications offer features that let their users [[collaboration|collaborate]] and [[information sharing|share information]].\n\nFor example, many [[project management]] applications delivered in the SaaS model offer\u2014in addition to traditional project planning functionality\u2014collaboration features letting users comment on tasks and plans and share documents within and outside an organization. Several other SaaS applications let users vote on and offer new feature ideas.\n\nAlthough some collaboration-related functionality is also integrated into on-premises software, (implicit or explicit) collaboration between users or different customers is only possible with centrally hosted software.\n\n===OpenSaas===\n'''OpenSaaS''' refers to software as a service (SaaS) based on [[Open-source software|open source]] code. Similar to SaaS applications, Open SaaS is a web-based application that is hosted, supported and maintained by a service provider. While the roadmap for Open SaaS applications is defined by its community of users, upgrades and product enhancements are managed by a central provider. The term was coined in 2011 by [[Dries Buytaert]], creator of the [[Drupal]] content management framework.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url = http://buytaert.net/acquia-product-strategy-and-vision\n  |title = Acquia product strategy and vision\n  |publisher = Dries Buytaert weblog\n  |date = 24 January 2011\n  |first = Dries\n  |last = Buytaert\n  |accessdate = 5 October 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nAndrew Hoppin, a former Chief Information Officer for the [[New York State Senate]], has been a vocal advocate of OpenSaaS for government, calling it \"the future of government innovation.\" He points to [[WordPress]] and Why Unified as a successful example of an OpenSaaS software delivery model that gives customers \"the best of both worlds, and more options.

According to Woods, \"Open source provides the escape hatch. In Drupal Gardens, users will be able to press a button and get a source code version of the Drupal code that runs their site along with the data from the database. Then, you can take that code, put it up at one of the hosting companies, and you can do anything that you would like to do.\"<ref>{{cite magazine\n  |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2010/11/09/a-new-open-source-model-for-saas/\n  |title = A New Open-Source Model For SaaS\n  |magazine = Forbes\n  |date = 9 November 2010\n  |first = Dan\n  |last = Woods\n  |accessdate = 21 September 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==Adoption drivers==\nSeveral important changes to the software market and technology landscape have facilitated the acceptance and growth of SaaS solutions:\n* The growing use of web-based [[user interface]]s by applications, along with the proliferation of associated practices (e.g., [[web design]]), continuously decreased the need for traditional client-server applications. Consequently, traditional software vendor's investment in software based on [[fat client]]s has become a disadvantage (mandating ongoing support), opening the door for new software vendors offering a [[user experience]] perceived as more \"modern\".\n* The standardization of web page technologies ([[HTML]], [[JavaScript]], [[CSS]]), the increasing popularity of [[web development]] as a practice, and the introduction and ubiquity of [[web application framework]]s like [[Ruby on Rails]] or [[Laravel]] ([[PHP]]) gradually reduced the cost of developing new SaaS solutions, and enabled new solution providers to come up with competitive solutions, challenging traditional vendors.\n* The increasing penetration of [[broadband Internet access]] enabled remote centrally hosted applications to offer speed comparable to on-premises software.\n* The standardization of the [[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]] protocol as part of the web stack provided universally available lightweight [[computer security|security]] that is sufficient for most everyday applications.\n* The introduction and wide acceptance of lightweight [[system integration|integration]] [[communications protocol|protocol]]s such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and SOAP enabled affordable integration between SaaS applications (residing in the cloud) with internal applications over wide area networks and with other SaaS applications.\n\n== Adoption challenges ==\nSome limitations slow down the acceptance of SaaS and prohibit it from being used in some cases:\n* Because data is stored on the vendor's servers, data security becomes an issue.<ref name= Forrester>{{cite web |url = http://community.forrester.com/message/10906 |title = SaaS And The Everlasting Security Concerns | work = Community |publisher = [[Forrester Research]] |date = 20 December 2010 |accessdate = 24 April 2011 |first = Miroslaw |last = Lisserman}}</ref>\n* SaaS applications are hosted in the cloud, far away from the application users. This introduces latency into the environment; for example, the SaaS model is not suitable for applications that demand response times in the milliseconds ([[Online transaction processing|OLTP]]).\n* Multitenant architectures, which drive cost efficiency for SaaS solution providers, limit customization of applications for large clients, inhibiting such applications from being used in scenarios (applicable mostly to large enterprises) for which such customization is necessary.\n* Some business applications require access to or integration with customer's current data. When such data are large in volume or sensitive (e.g. end-users' personal information), integrating them with remotely hosted software can be costly or risky, or can conflict with data governance regulations.\n* Constitutional search/seizure warrant laws do not protect all forms of SaaS dynamically stored data.

Similar to [[source code escrow]], where critical software [[source code]] is stored with an independent third party, SaaS data escrow applies the same logic to the data within a SaaS application. It allows companies to protect and insure all the data that resides within SaaS applications, protecting against [[data loss]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Develop a Framework for SaaS Application Business Continuity Risk Mitigation |url = http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=1118412 |publisher = Gartner |date = 7 August 2009 |accessdate = 24 April 2011 |first1 = Deborah R |last1 = Wilson |first2 = Alexa |last2 = BonaPart}}</ref>\n\nThere are many and varied reasons for considering SaaS data escrow including concerns about vendor [[bankruptcy]],<ref>{{cite web|last =May|first =Richard | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] |title=Software Escrow whitepaper | publisher = Virtual DCS | url= http://www.virtualdcs.co.uk/files/SoftwareasaServiceandEscrow.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virtualdcs.co.uk/blog/is-escrow-dead|title=Software Escrow: Is Escrow dead?|date=2012-06-14|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref> unplanned service outages, and potential [[data loss]] or corruption.

In 2010, ''Forbes'' contributor Dan Woods noted that Drupal Gardens, a web hosting platform based on the [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Drupal]] [[content management system]], is a \"new open-source model for SaaS\". He added: {{quote|Open source provides the escape hatch. In Drupal Gardens, users will be able to press a button and get a source code version of the Drupal code that runs their site along with the data from the database. Then, you can take that code, put it up at one of the hosting companies, and you can do anything that you would like to do.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2010/11/09/a-new-open-source-model-for-saas/ |title = A New Open-Source Model For SaaS | work = CIO Central | publisher = Forbes |date = 9 November 2010 |first = Dan |last = Woods |accessdate = 21 September 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly, [[MediaWiki]], [[WordPress]] and their many extensions are increasingly used for a wide variety of internal applications as well as public web services.  Obtaining the code is relatively simple, as it is an integration of existing extensions, plug-ins, templates, etc.  Actual customizations are rare, and usually quickly replaced by more standard publicly available extensions. There is additionally no guarantee the software source code obtained through such means accurately reflects the software system it claims to reflect.\n\nAndrew Hoppin, a former Chief Information Officer for the [[New York State Senate]], refers to this combination of SaaS and open source software as [[OpenSaaS]] and points to [[WordPress]] as another successful example of an OpenSaaS software delivery model that gives customers \"the best of both worlds, and more options. The fact that it is open source means that they can start building their websites by self-hosting WordPress and customizing their website to their heart\u2019s content. Concurrently, the fact that WordPress is SaaS means that they don\u2019t have to manage the website at all \u2013 they can simply pay WordPress.com to host it.\"<ref>{{cite web\n  |url = http://opensource.com/government/14/1/opensaas-and-government-innovation |title = OpenSaaS and the future of government innovation |publisher = OpenSource | work = Government |date = 9 January 2014 |first = Andrew |last = Hoppin |accessdate = 21 September 2014 }}</ref> The cloud (or SaaS) model has no physical need for indirect distribution because it is not distributed physically and is deployed almost instantaneously, thereby negating the need for traditional partners and middlemen.\n\n==See also==\n* [[As a service|List of 'as a service' service types]]\n*[[Servicizing]]\n*[[Cloud-based integration]]\n*[[Application service provider]]\n*[[Subscription computing]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist |32em}}\n\n{{Software distribution}}\n{{Cloud computing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Software As A Service}}\n[[Category:As a service]]\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Software delivery methods]]\n[[Category:Software distribution]]\n[[Category:Software industry]]\n", "name_user": "Joana09", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eConfiguration and customization)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"}

The presumed leaders of the two groups have a flashback showing that they were friends when they were young children. During the flashback, photos of the band as young children are shown. Throughout the fight, each group leader attempts to kill the other. As the music video climaxes, the non-clown leader tries to run over the clown leader. However the clown leader notices that the non-clown leader's car (with the non-clown leader inside) has been leaking fuel and drops his cigarette lighter. The car quickly catches fire and the clown leader looks on as his former friend burns and the music video ends.\n\nThe video was loosely inspired by the poem \"Out of Control Fairground\" by [[John Cooper Clarke]]. Turner says he's a fan and gets lyrical inspiration from Clarke. The poem is also printed inside the CD release of \"Fluorescent Adolescent.\" The lines such as \"out of control fairground\" and \"homicidal clowns\" support this. The video was preceded by a warning of violent images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arctic-monkeys.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1821|title=Arctic Monkeys Forum Fan Site - Arctic-Monkeys.com \u2022 View topic - Fluorescent Adolescent Video|website=www.arctic-monkeys.com}}</ref> In an [[MTV]] interview, Turner stated that the music video \"is the best thing we've ever done\" while [[Jamie Cook]]  hailed it as \"...probably one of the best videos in the last, like, 10 years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1561723/20070605/arctic_monkeys.jhtml|title=Arctic Monkeys Say 'Fluorescent' Clip Is Their Favourite Video Yet|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDuring a live performance of the song on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'', the band played the song dressed as clowns, with [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] dressing with the same make-up and clothing as the main clown in the video.\n\nDuring a performance of the song on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Letterman introduced the band by joking that his vinyl copy of \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" had been stolen due to its popularity.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline            = CD, 10\"\n| title1              = Fluorescent Adolescent\n| length1             = 3:03\n| lyrics1             = {{flatlist|\n* [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]]\n* [[Johanna Bennett]]\n}}\n| music1              = [[Arctic Monkeys]]\n| title2              = The Bakery\n| length2             = 2:56\n| lyrics2             = Alex Turner\n| music2              = {{flatlist|\n* Arctic Monkeys\n* [[Miles Kane]]\n}}\n| title3              = Plastic Tramp\n| length3             = 2:53\n| lyrics3             = Alex Turner\n| music3              = {{flatlist|\n* Arctic Monkeys\n* Miles Kane\n}}\n| title4              = Too Much to Ask\n| length4             = 3:05\n| lyrics4             = Alex Turner\n| music4              = Arctic Monkeys\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline            = 7\"\n| title1              = Fluorescent Adolescent\n| length1             = 3:03\n| lyrics1             = {{flatlist|\n* Alex Turner\n* [[Johanna Bennett]]\n}}\n| music1              = Arctic Monkeys\n| title2              = The Bakery\n| length2             = 2:56\n| lyrics2             = Alex Turner\n| music2              = {{flatlist|\n* Arctic Monkeys\n* Miles Kane\n}}\n}}\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n===Chart performance===\nOn downloads alone, \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" charted in the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 55 for the week commencing 25 June 2007.

It describes a woman who dreams of her youth while her current life is unsatisfying and boring. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and was the 83rd best-selling song of 2007 in the United Kingdom. \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" is one of the band's most popular songs, and is frequently performed as a closer to their concerts. [[Kate Nash]] performed a cover of the song on 5 October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvN0O7jkbQI|title=kate nash - fluorescent adolescent|author=casablancasro|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2007|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref> It appears on ''[[Radio 1's Live Lounge \u2013 Volume 3]]''.\n\n==Origin==\nIn an interview with [[The Guardian]], Johanna Bennett said about the song:\n<blockquote>We were on holiday and had cut ourselves off from everything. We were in a really quiet hotel and didn't watch TV or listen to that much music. So as not to drive each other mad we started messing around with these words like a game, singing them to each other. It's great to think that it came from something we did for fun on holiday. It'll always be a good memory for Alex and I. He doesn't usually write lyrics with other people, though I think he enjoyed it.<ref name=\"meaning\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song has received a 9/10 rating from [[Planet Sound]], becoming Arctic Monkeys' first single to do so since \"[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]\".<ref>[http://www.teletext.co.uk/Entertainment/Planet-Sound/Single-Reviews/default.aspx Planet Sound] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614204005/http://www.teletext.co.uk/Entertainment/Planet-Sound/Single-Reviews/default.aspx |date=14 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was filmed in late April 2007 and was directed by ''[[The IT Crowd]]'' star [[Richard Ayoade]]. It features actor [[Stephen Graham]] (who previously appeared on the ''[[Scummy Man]]'' DVD and the \"[[When the Sun Goes Down (Arctic Monkeys song)|When the Sun Goes Down]]\" video) as a clown.<ref name=\"Domino\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dominorecordco.com/site/index.php?page=news&artistID=209|title=Domino - News|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arctic-monkeys.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1808|title=Arctic Monkeys Forum Fan Site - Arctic-Monkeys.com \u2022 View topic - Fluorescent Adolescent Update|website=www.arctic-monkeys.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/20032007/exclusive_arctics_reveal_new_tune|title=Latest Shows, Music, Celebrity, & Entertainment News|publisher=}}</ref> The music video premiered in the UK on 5 June 2007 on [[Channel 4]], and was available online the next day.<ref name=Arctic-Monkeys>{{cite web|url=http://www.arctic-monkeys.com/fluorescent_adolescent.php|title=Arctic-Monkeys|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe music video is based around a fight between a group of clowns and a group of non-clowns at an abandoned warehouse. The presumed leaders of the two groups have a flashback showing that they were friends when they were young children. During the flashback, photos of the band as young children are shown. Throughout the fight, each group leader attempts to kill the other. As the music video climaxes, the non-clown leader tries to run over the clown leader. However the clown leader notices that the non-clown leader's car (with the non-clown leader inside) has been leaking fuel and drops his cigarette lighter. The car quickly catches fire and the clown leader looks on as his former friend burns and the music video ends.\n\nThe video was loosely inspired by the poem \"Out of Control Fairground\" by [[John Cooper Clarke]]. Turner says he's a fan and gets lyrical inspiration from Clarke. The poem is also printed inside the CD release of \"Fluorescent Adolescent.\" The lines such as \"out of control fairground\" and \"homicidal clowns\" support this. The video was preceded by a warning of violent images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arctic-monkeys.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1821|title=Arctic Monkeys Forum Fan Site - Arctic-Monkeys.com \u2022 View topic - Fluorescent Adolescent Video|website=www.arctic-monkeys.com}}</ref> In an [[MTV]] interview, Turner stated that the music video \"is the best thing we've ever done\" while [[Jamie Cook]]  hailed it as \"...probably one of the best videos in the last, like, 10 years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1561723/20070605/arctic_monkeys.jhtml|title=Arctic Monkeys Say 'Fluorescent' Clip Is Their Favourite Video Yet|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDuring a live performance of the song on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'', the band played the song dressed as clowns, with [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] dressing with the same make-up and clothing as the main clown in the video.\n\nDuring a performance of the song on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Letterman introduced the band by joking that his vinyl copy of \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\" had been stolen due to its popularity.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline            = CD, 10\"\n| title1              = Fluorescent Adolescent\n| length1             = 3:03\n| lyrics1             = {{flatlist|\n* [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]]\n* [[Johanna Bennett]]\n}}\n| music1              = [[Arctic Monkeys]]\n| title2              = The Bakery\n| length2             = 2:56\n| lyrics2             = Alex Turner\n| music2              = {{flatlist|\n* Arctic Monkeys\n* [[Miles Kane]]\n}}\n| title3              = Plastic Tramp\n| length3             = 2:53\n| lyrics3             = Alex Turner\n| music3              = {{flatlist|\n* Arctic Monkeys\n* Miles Kane\n}}\n| title4              = Too Much to Ask\n| length4             = 3:05\n| lyrics4             = Alex Turner\n| music4              = Arctic Monkeys\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline            = 7\"\n| title1              = Fluorescent Adolescent\n| length1             = 3:03\n| lyrics1             = {{flatlist|\n* Alex Turner\n* [[Johanna Bennett]]\n}}\n| music1              = Arctic Monkeys\n| title2              = The Bakery\n| length2             = 2:56\n| lyrics2             = Alex Turner\n| music2              = {{flatlist|\n* Arctic Monkeys\n* Miles Kane\n}}\n}}\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n===Chart performance===\nOn downloads alone, \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" charted in the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 55 for the week commencing 25 June 2007.
