The Turkish yufka is similar, but is unleavened and cooked on a griddle, called a saj. Its origins are ancient and it is also known as lava\u015f depending on the region. As in the other countries of this region large batches of this bread are made and stored for long periods. In Turkey they are stored on a board suspended by all four corners from the ceiling.

The thickness of the bread varies depending on how thin it was rolled out. Toasted [[sesame seed]]s and/or [[Poppy (flower)|poppy seeds]] are sometimes sprinkled on before baking.\n[[File:Making of lavash.ogv|thumb|350px|Two women making lavash in a small restaurant in [[Yerevan]], Armenia.]]\nTraditionally the dough is rolled out flat and slapped against the hot walls of a [[tandoor|clay oven]]. While quite flexible when fresh, lavash dries out quickly and becomes brittle and hard. The soft form is easier to use when making wrap sandwiches; however, the dry form can be used for long-term storage (almost one year) and is used instead of leavened bread in [[Eucharist]] traditions by the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. In Armenian villages, the dried lavash is stacked high in layers to be used later, and when the time comes to rehydrate the bread, it is sprinkled with water to make it softer again. In its dry form, left-over lavash is used in Iran to make quick meals after being rehydrated with water, butter and cheese. In Armenia the dried bread is broken up into [[Khash (dish)|khash]]. In Armenia fresh lavash is used to wrap [[khorovats]] and to make wraps with herbs and cheese. In Iran, Turkey and middle-east lavash is used with [[kebab]]s to make [[d\u00fcr\u00fcm]] wraps.

The Turkish yufka is similar, but is unleavened and cooked on a griddle, called a saj. Its origins are ancient and it is also known as lava\u015f depending on the region. As in the other countries of this region large batches of this bread are made and stored for long periods. In Turkey they are stored on a board suspended by all four corners from the ceiling.

The thickness of the bread varies depending on how thin it was rolled out. Toasted [[sesame seed]]s and/or [[Poppy (flower)|poppy seeds]] are sometimes sprinkled on before baking.\n[[File:Making of lavash.ogv|thumb|350px|Two women making lavash in a small restaurant in [[Yerevan]], Armenia.]]\nTraditionally the dough is rolled out flat and slapped against the hot walls of a [[tandoor|clay oven]]. While quite flexible when fresh, lavash dries out quickly and becomes brittle and hard. The soft form is easier to use when making wrap sandwiches; however, the dry form can be used for long-term storage (almost one year) and is used instead of leavened bread in [[Eucharist]] traditions by the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. In Armenian villages, the dried lavash is stacked high in layers to be used later, and when the time comes to rehydrate the bread, it is sprinkled with water to make it softer again. In its dry form, left-over lavash is used in Iran to make quick meals after being rehydrated with water, butter and cheese. In Armenia the dried bread is broken up into [[Khash (dish)|khash]]. In Armenia fresh lavash is used to wrap [[khorovats]] and to make wraps with herbs and cheese. In Iran, Turkey and middle-east lavash is used with [[kebab]]s to make [[d\u00fcr\u00fcm]] wraps.

In [[Federalist No. 46]], Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, \"a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia.\" He argued that state militias \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\" He contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he described as \"afraid to trust the people with arms,\" and assured that \"the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\".<ref name=\"emerson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/emerson.html|title=United States of America v.

Several amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified. For example, the Pennsylvania convention debated fifteen amendments, one of which concerned the right of the people to be armed, another with the militia. The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments.

Ultimately, the Catholic [[James II of England|James&nbsp;II]] was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and his successors, the Protestants [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&nbsp;II]], accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after King Charles II and James&nbsp;II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government,<ref>Bogus, Carl T. \"The Hidden History of the Second Amendment.\" https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/davlr31&id=319&men_tab=srchresults.</ref> and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.<ref group=lower-alpha>From the [[English Civil War]] until the [[Glorious Revolution]] militias occasionally disarmed Catholics, and the King, without Parliament's consent, likewise occasionally disarmed Protestants.

Heller'' (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.<ref>\"They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ... (Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: ... This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment&nbsp;...&nbsp;.

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u201306. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689). This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment. See E. Dumbauld, ''The Bill of Rights and What It Means Today'' 51 (1957); W.

Some in the United States have preferred the \"rights\" argument arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need to have arms for self-defence was not really in question.

Then having all the armed strength at its command, the national government could overwhelm the states. Such a circumstance has never happened, but this amendment would prevent it. The Second Amendment does not give anybody or everybody the right to possess and use firearms. The states may very properly prescribe regulations and permits governing the use of guns within their borders.\"</ref> or prohibiting citizens from arming themselves.<ref name=\"HalbrookHardy\"/> Though it has been argued that the states lost the power to arm their citizens when the power to arm the militia was transferred from the states to the federal government by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the individual right to arm was retained and strengthened by the [[Militia Acts of 1792]] and the similar act of 1795.<ref>US Constitution Article 1 Section 8 To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/elliot/vol3/june14.html |title=Elliots debates |volume=3 |series=Virginia Convention |date=June 14, 1788 |publisher=Teachingamericanhistory.org |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613033414/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/elliot/vol3/june14.html |archivedate=June 13, 2010 |df=dmy-all}} The national government has an exclusive right to provide for arming, organizing, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States.

The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This [[Massachusetts Compromise|compromise]] persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.<ref>Foner and Garraty, p.&nbsp;914. \"The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.\"</ref> The Constitution was declared ratified on June&nbsp;21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpations and arbitrary power of rulers; and it will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.

A right to the privileges and immunities of citizens in any of the several States. Among these is the fundamental and elementary right of suffrage.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like saying \"He filled and kicked the bucket\" to mean \"He filled the bucket and died.\"<ref name=\"District of Columbia v Heller\"/>}}\n\nIn a dissent, joined by justices [[David Souter|Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]], Justice Stevens said:\n\n{{quote |The Amendment's text does justify a different limitation: the \"right to keep and bear arms\" protects only a right to possess and use firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia.

Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

Ultimately, the Catholic [[James II of England|James&nbsp;II]] was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and his successors, the Protestants [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&nbsp;II]], accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after King Charles II and James&nbsp;II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government,<ref>Bogus, Carl T. \"The Hidden History of the Second Amendment.\" https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/davlr31&id=319&men_tab=srchresults.</ref> and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.<ref group=lower-alpha>From the [[English Civil War]] until the [[Glorious Revolution]] militias occasionally disarmed Catholics, and the King, without Parliament's consent, likewise occasionally disarmed Protestants. Malcolm, \"The Role of the Militia,\" pp.&nbsp;139\u201351.</ref> The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James&nbsp;II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms''.</ref> In ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.<ref>\"They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ... (Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: ... This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment&nbsp;...&nbsp;. It was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia.

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u201306. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng.

The following year, at [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|a meeting]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], 12 delegates from five states ([[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[Virginia]]) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the absence of:<ref>Vile, p.&nbsp;19.</ref><ref name=\"Schmidt39\">Schmidt et al., p.&nbsp;39.</ref>\n* interstate arbitration processes to handle quarrels between states;\n* sufficiently trained and armed intrastate security forces to suppress insurrection;\n* a national militia to repel foreign invaders.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the federal Congress and giving that congress the power to raise a standing army.<ref name=\"isbn0-300-09562-7\">Williams, pp.&nbsp;41\u201344.</ref> [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article 1, Section 8]] of the Constitution codified these changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States by doing the following:<ref>{{cite web |last=Story |first=Joseph |title=Commentaries on the Constitution |at=2:\u00a7\u00a7 904\u201325, 927\u201330, 946\u201352, 954\u201370, 972\u201376, 988 |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |work=The Founders Constitution |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309235955/http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n* provide and maintain a navy;\n* make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;\n* provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n* provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n\nSome representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers, because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power.

Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This [[Massachusetts Compromise|compromise]] persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.<ref>Foner and Garraty, p.&nbsp;914. \"The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.\"</ref> The Constitution was declared ratified on June&nbsp;21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it.

In the context of such legal theories and elsewhere, it is important to understand the language of the Constitution in terms of what that language meant to the people who wrote and ratified the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interp.html |title=Theories of Constitutional Interpretation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216131951/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interp.html |archive-date=2011-12-16 |df=dmy-all |editor=Linder, Doug |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School |access-date=2011-12-11 |quote=article cites Robert Bork: \"If the Constitution is law, then presumably its meaning, like that of all other law, is the meaning the lawmakers were understood to have intended.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe Second Amendment was relatively uncontroversial at the time of its ratification.<ref>Garry Wills, ''A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government,'' Simon and Schuster, 1999, p. 252.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

A right to the privileges and immunities of citizens in any of the several States. Among these is the fundamental and elementary right of suffrage. The Representatives to the national and State legislatures must be chosen by the people, the citizens (Section 2). Consequently, the citizens must choose them, and have a right to choose them.

A right to just compensation for private property legally taken for public use. 8. A right to participate in all rights retained by, or reserved to, the people.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like saying \"He filled and kicked the bucket\" to mean \"He filled the bucket and died.\"<ref name=\"District of Columbia v Heller\"/>}}\n\nIn a dissent, joined by justices [[David Souter|Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]], Justice Stevens said:\n\n{{quote |The Amendment's text does justify a different limitation: the \"right to keep and bear arms\" protects only a right to possess and use firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia.

The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model.\n\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include ''United States v. Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule.

Neither ''United States v. Cruikshank'', 92 U.S. 542, nor ''Presser v. Illinois'', 116 U.S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. ''United States v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. pp.&nbsp;47\u201354.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another.\n\n<blockquote>Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. ... Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\"<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]] has been a vocal critic of ''Heller''.

The court noted that it had, prior to ''Heller'', identified the Second Amendment as providing an individual right to bear arms, and had already, likewise, determined that restrictions on felon ownership of firearms did not violate this right.

It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on March 2, 1997. In the episode, Marge and Homer leave Lisa to babysit Bart and Maggie. Annoyed that his younger sister is his babysitter, Bart does everything he can to annoy her. When Bart is injured, Lisa must find him medical attention without spoiling her reputation as a good babysitter.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Dan Greaney]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. The script was written to focus on the relationship between Bart and Lisa and the episode has further been used{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} to discuss the difficulties in letting children babysit themselves. The episode received mostly positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nInspired by ''[[The Baby-Sitters Club]]'' series of novels, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] decides to become a babysitter, but no one takes her seriously because of her age. When [[Maude Flanders|Maude]] is taken hostage in Lebanon, [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] must leave suddenly to get her released. In his haste, he agrees to let Lisa babysit [[Rod and Todd Flanders|Rod and Todd]]. Ned puts out the good word for Lisa, who experiences a business boom.\n\nInspired by the success of [[Baltimore]]'s [[Inner Harbor|revamped wharf]], the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] Squidport reopens and throws a gala. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] attend, leaving Lisa to babysit [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Bart is upset that his younger sister is his babysitter; Lisa thinks his childish antics warrant it. Bart torments Lisa by having a giant [[submarine sandwich]] delivered, hiring [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] for a bachelor party, claiming that Lisa saw a [[UFO]], dialing {{nobr|9-1-1}} for a \"sisterectomy\", and feeding Maggie coffee ice cream for dinner.\n\nBart's pranks anger Lisa so much that she lunges at him, causing him to fall down the stairs, dislocating his shoulder and causing a large bump on his head. Bart realizes if Lisa fails to take him to a nearby hospital, her reputation as a babysitter will be ruined. To make his condition worse, Bart locks himself in his room and repeatedly hits his head on the door, eventually knocking himself unconscious. \n\nLisa tries to call for an ambulance, but the {{nobr|9-1-1}} operator refuses to assist her due to Bart's earlier prank calls. Lisa considers asking [[Dr. Hibbert]] for help, but realizes that would ruin her reputation as a babysitter. Instead she takes Bart to [[Dr. Nick Riviera]]'s clinic in a wheelbarrow, bringing Maggie along in a [[pet carrier]] because the coffee ice cream has overstimulated her. Lisa is unable to see the doctor due to a long queue in the waiting room.\n\nFrantic, Lisa tries to wheel Bart and Maggie to the hospital. She loses control of the wheelbarrow and it rolls down a cliff into a muddy river &mdash; in front of aghast onlookers at the Squidport. The crowd assumes Lisa is on drugs, has murdered Bart, and is about to drown the caged Maggie. Lisa reveals none of the crowd's suspicions are true, but her reputation is ruined.\n\nLater Bart, whose injuries have been treated, apologizes to Lisa for causing the ordeal and ruining her babysitting business. She forgives him, but feels bad for being called the \"World's Worst Babysitter\". Much to her delight, she receives babysitting requests from Dr. Hibbert and Ned Flanders because they cannot find any other sitters.\n\n==Production and themes==\n[[File:USS-Constellation-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|The Squidport was inspired by waterfront renovations such as [[Harborplace]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].]]\nThe episode was directed by [[Jim Reardon]] and written by [[Dan Greaney]].<ref name=\"bbc\"/> Like numerous preceding episodes, \"My Sister, My Sitter\" deals with the relationship between Bart and Lisa.

It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on March 2, 1997. In the episode, Marge and Homer leave Lisa to babysit Bart and Maggie. Annoyed that his younger sister is his babysitter, Bart does everything he can to annoy her. When Bart is injured, Lisa must find him medical attention without spoiling her reputation as a good babysitter.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Dan Greaney]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. The script was written to focus on the relationship between Bart and Lisa and the episode has further been used{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} to discuss the difficulties in letting children babysit themselves. The episode received mostly positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nInspired by ''[[The Baby-Sitters Club]]'' series of novels, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] decides to become a babysitter, but no one takes her seriously because of her age. When [[Maude Flanders|Maude]] is taken hostage in Lebanon, [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] must leave suddenly to get her released. In his haste, he agrees to let Lisa babysit [[Rod and Todd Flanders|Rod and Todd]]. Ned puts out the good word for Lisa, who experiences a business boom.\n\nInspired by the success of [[Baltimore]]'s [[Inner Harbor|revamped wharf]], the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] Squidport reopens and throws a gala. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] attend, leaving Lisa to babysit [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Bart is upset that his younger sister is his babysitter; Lisa thinks his childish antics warrant it. Bart torments Lisa by having a giant [[submarine sandwich]] delivered, hiring [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] for a bachelor party, claiming that Lisa saw a [[UFO]], dialing {{nobr|9-1-1}} for a \"sisterectomy\", and feeding Maggie coffee ice cream for dinner.\n\nBart's pranks anger Lisa so much that she lunges at him, causing him to fall down the stairs, dislocating his shoulder and causing a large bump on his head. Bart realizes if Lisa fails to take him to a nearby hospital, her reputation as a babysitter will be ruined. To make his condition worse, Bart locks himself in his room and repeatedly hits his head on the door, eventually knocking himself unconscious. \n\nLisa tries to call for an ambulance, but the {{nobr|9-1-1}} operator refuses to assist her due to Bart's earlier prank calls. Lisa considers asking [[Dr. Hibbert]] for help, but realizes that would ruin her reputation as a babysitter. Instead she takes Bart to [[Dr. Nick Riviera]]'s clinic in a wheelbarrow, bringing Maggie along in a [[pet carrier]] because the coffee ice cream has overstimulated her. Lisa is unable to see the doctor due to a long queue in the waiting room.\n\nFrantic, Lisa tries to wheel Bart and Maggie to the hospital. She loses control of the wheelbarrow and it rolls down a cliff into a muddy river &mdash; in front of aghast onlookers at the Squidport. The crowd assumes Lisa is on drugs, has murdered Bart, and is about to drown the caged Maggie. Lisa reveals none of the crowd's suspicions are true, but her reputation is ruined.\n\nLater Bart, whose injuries have been treated, apologizes to Lisa for causing the ordeal and ruining her babysitting business. She forgives him, but feels bad for being called the \"World's Worst Babysitter\". Much to her delight, she receives babysitting requests from Dr. Hibbert and Ned Flanders because they cannot find any other sitters.\n\n==Production and themes==\n[[File:USS-Constellation-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|The Squidport was inspired by waterfront renovations such as [[Harborplace]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].]]\nThe episode was directed by [[Jim Reardon]] and written by [[Dan Greaney]].<ref name=\"bbc\"/> Like numerous preceding episodes, \"My Sister, My Sitter\" deals with the relationship between Bart and Lisa.

During one particular risky robbery heist, Leo breaks the window at a jewellery store only to have his wrists broken by a gate falling. He is soon caught and brought to prison to serve his term. Throughout his stay, Leo does not reveal who he is working for to the authorities but instead serves his time, angered by Gus for running out on him during the robbery.\n\nWhen Leo is released, he returns to Gus to obtain a job. Gus harshly rebuffs him and points out how Leo\u2019s injured wrists would prevent him from working as a thief. This leads Leo to seek complete vengeance against Gus. He decides to frame Gus for murder by stealing his gun and murdering the getaway driver (now working as a cab driver) who had also abandoned him during the abortive raid. He manages to provide himself with an alibi to avoid any prosecution. During this scheme he meets Carol Dane (Howard), who is unaware of his true nature, and the two begin a romance. Later, he confronts Gus with the understanding that if he does not give Leo money, Leo will hand over the gun to the police.\n\nAfter Gus gives Leo his money, he contacts Gregory Lang (Lom), whom he is actually working under. Gregory is an antiques dealer who hired Gus to steal jewelry and art pieces for him. Meanwhile, Leo learns that Detective Inspector Rogers is investigating the murder case. He attempts to assure Rogers that he is attempting to live a life away from crime, but Rogers continues to question Leo\u2019s character and whereabouts during the night of the murder.\n\nThings begin to go downhill when Leo and Gregory learn that it was actually Gregory\u2019s gun that was used rather than Gus\u2019s. Gregory becomes upset and has his companion plot to murder Gus while forcefully threatening Leo. Leo\u2019s wrists are crushed again, but he and Gus reach a deal for Leo to bring back the gun and steal a jewel. All the while, Rogers uncovers more and more clues.\n\nWhen Leo steals the jewel and brings back the gun to Gregory, a gunfight ensues, leaving Gregory dead. As Leo jumps on the train to run away with Carol, she confronts him about his lies. Soon after, Rogers arrives after finally learning that Leo murdered the cab driver. He prepares to apprehend Leo, but Leo tries to jump out of the train window only to have the window slam shut on his wrists.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[William Hartnell]] as Leo Martin  \n*[[Raymond Lovell]] as Gus Loman  \n*[[Joyce Howard]] as Carol Dane  \n*[[Robert Beatty]] as Detective Inspector Rogers  \n*[[Herbert Lom]] as Gregory Lang  \n*[[Alan Wheatley]] as Noel Penn  \n*[[Cyril Smith (actor)|Cyril Smith]] as Detective Sergeant Charlie Weeks  \n*[[Elsie Wagstaff]] as Mrs. Wilkins  \n*[[Ian Fleming (actor)|Ian Fleming]] as Prison governor  \n*[[Wally Patch]] as Joe Fisher (garage manager)  \n*[[Ian McLean (actor)|Ian McLean]] as Detective Mason\n*[[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as Caretaker\n\n==Reception==\n''Appointment with Crime'' was the 12th most popular film at the British box office in 1946 after ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'', ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'', ''[[Piccadilly Incident]]'', ''[[The Captive Heart]]'', ''[[Road to Utopia]]'', ''[[Caravan (1946 film)|Caravan]]'', ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Away]]'', ''[[The Corn Is Green (1945 film)|The Corn is Green]]'', ''[[Gilda]]'', ''[[The House on 92nd Street]]'' and ''[[The Overlanders (film)|The Overlanders]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood Sneaks In 15 Films on '25 Best' List of Arty Britain|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=15 Jan 1947|page= 2}}</ref>\n\n===Critical===\nThe ''[[Radio Times]]'' called it a \"solid [[Film noir|noir]],\" and rated it 3/5 stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/k79fwm/appointment-with-crime/|title=Appointment with Crime \u2013 review &#124; cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0039158|title=Appointment with Crime}}\n* {{Amg movie|2713|Appointment with Crime}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=appointment_with_crime|title=Appointment with Crime}}\n\n[[Category:1946 films]]\n[[Category:1940s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Harlow]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:British gangster films]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2012}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Appointment with Crime\n| caption        = \n| image\t=\tAppointment with Crime FilmPoster.jpeg\n| director       = [[John Harlow (director)|John Harlow]]\n| producer       = [[Louis H.
