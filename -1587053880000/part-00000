The {{convert|52.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} RER E line travels between Paris and eastern suburbs, with all trains serving the stations in central Paris, before branching out towards the ends of the line.{{RER E}}\nThe line runs from the western terminus [[Haussmann - Saint-Lazare Station|Haussmann - Saint-Lazare]] (E1) to the eastern termini [[Chelles - Gournay Station|Chelles - Gournay]] (E2) and [[Tournan Station|Tournan]] (E4). It is operated by [[SNCF]]. \n\nOriginally referred to as the Est Ouest Liaison Express or EOLE (English: East West Express Link), RER E is the newest line in the system opening in 1999, with the extension in 2003, and further extensions to the west currently under construction (in 2022 to Nanterre-La Folie, in 2024 to [[Mantes-la-Jolie station|Mantes-la-Jolie]]).\n\n==History==\n[[File:RER-E Haussmann 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Train arriving at [[Haussmann - Saint-Lazare Station|Haussmann - Saint-Lazare]] on the RER&nbsp;E.]]\n[[File:RER-E Magenta.jpg|thumb|250px|Station [[Magenta Station|Magenta]] on the RER E]]\n\nRER E opened on 14 July 1999 between Haussmann - Saint-Lazare and Chelles - Gournay. The construction included a {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between Haussmann \u2013 St-Lazare and [[Magenta (Paris RER)|Magenta]] (which serves [[Gare de l'Est]] and [[Gare du Nord]]).\n\nThe line was first extended with a new branch from [[Noisy-le-Sec Station|Noisy-le-Sec]] to [[Villiers-sur-Marne - Le Plessis-Tr\u00e9vise Station|Villiers-sur-Marne]] on 30 August 1999. This branch was extended to Tournan on 14 December 2003.\n\nOn 13 December 2015, [[Rosa Parks (Paris RER)|Rosa Parks]] station opened in the [[19th arrondissement of Paris]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stif.info/ouverture-de-la-gare-rosa-parks-sur-la-ligne-e-du-rer.html | title = RER E: Ouverture de la gare Rosa Parks sur la ligne E du RER | publisher = STIF | date = December 2015 | accessdate = 2015-12-13 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151214195640/http://stif.info/ouverture-de-la-gare-rosa-parks-sur-la-ligne-e-du-rer.html | archivedate = 14 December 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Extension==\n[[File:Carte rer e ouest.png|thumb|Map of the extension to Mantes-la-Jolie]]\nRER E is to be extended from Haussmann - Saint-Lazare to [[La D\u00e9fense Station|La D\u00e9fense]], from where it will take over the branch of [[RER A]] to [[Nanterre]], [[Sartrouville]] and [[Poissy]].

The term has also been applied to a number of revolutions elsewhere, including in the Middle East and the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, dating from the 1980s to the 2010s. Some observers (such as [[Justin Raimondo]] and [[Michael Lind]]) have called the events a [[revolutionary wave]], the origins of which can be traced back to the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] (also known as the Yellow Revolution) in the [[Philippines]].\n\nParticipants in the colour revolutions have mostly used [[nonviolent resistance]], also called [[civil resistance]]{{citation needed}}. Such methods as demonstrations, [[general strike|strikes]] and interventions have been intended protest against governments seen as corrupt and/or authoritarian and to advocate democracy and they have also created strong pressure for change. These movements generally adopted a specific colour or flower as their symbol. The colour revolutions are notable for the important role of [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs) and particularly [[Student activism|student activists]] in organising creative non-violent resistance {{citation needed}}.\n\nSuch movements have had a measure of success as for example in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]'s [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Bulldozer Revolution]] (2000), in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s [[Rose Revolution]] (2003) and in [[Ukraine]]'s [[Orange Revolution]] (2004).

A peaceful demonstration by students (mostly from [[Charles University]]) was attacked by the police \u2013 and in time contributed to the collapse of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Yet the roots of the pacifist floral imagery may go even further back to the non-violent [[Carnation Revolution]] of Portugal in April 1974, which is associated with the colour carnation because [[carnation]]s were worn, and the 1986 [[People Power Revolution|Yellow Revolution]] in the Philippines where demonstrators offered peace flowers to military personnel manning armoured tanks.\n\n===Student movements===\nThe first of these was [[Otpor!]] (\"Resistance!\") in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was founded at [[Belgrade University]] in October 1998 and began protesting against Milo\u0161evic' during the [[Kosovo War]].

Many of its members were arrested or beaten by the police. Despite this, during the presidential campaign in September 2000, Otpor launched its \"[[Gotov je]]\" (He's finished) campaign that galvanised Serbian discontent with Milo\u0161evic' and resulted in his defeat.\n\nMembers of Otpor have inspired and trained members of related student movements including [[Kmara]] in Georgia, Pora in Ukraine, [[Zubr (political organization)|Zubr]] in Belarus and [[MJAFT!]] in Albania.

The term has also been applied to a number of revolutions elsewhere, including in the Middle East and the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, dating from the 1980s to the 2010s. Some observers (such as [[Justin Raimondo]] and [[Michael Lind]]) have called the events a [[revolutionary wave]], the origins of which can be traced back to the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] (also known as the Yellow Revolution) in the [[Philippines]].\n\nParticipants in the colour revolutions have mostly used [[nonviolent resistance]], also called [[civil resistance]]. Such methods as demonstrations, [[general strike|strikes]] and interventions have been intended protest against governments seen as corrupt and/or authoritarian and to advocate democracy and they have also created strong pressure for change. These movements generally adopted a specific colour or flower as their symbol. The colour revolutions are notable for the important role of [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs) and particularly [[Student activism|student activists]] in organising creative non-violent resistance.\n\nSuch movements have had a measure of success as for example in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]'s [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Bulldozer Revolution]] (2000), in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s [[Rose Revolution]] (2003) and in [[Ukraine]]'s [[Orange Revolution]] (2004). In most but not all cases, massive street protests followed disputed elections or requests for fair elections and led to the resignation or overthrow of leaders considered by their opponents to be [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. Some events have been called \"colour revolutions\", but are different from the above cases in certain basic characteristics. Examples include Lebanon's [[Cedar Revolution]] (2005) and [[Kuwait]]'s Blue Revolution (2005).\n\nGovernment figures in Russia, such as Defense Minister [[Sergei Shoigu]] and Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]], have claimed that colour revolutions are externally fuelled acts with a clear goal to influence the internal affairs that destabilise the economy,<ref>(RUS) \"\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d: \u043c\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445 \u041e\u0414\u041a\u0411.\" [https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2876790 vesti.ru], 12 April 2017</ref> conflict with the law and represent a new form of warfare.<ref>Gorenburg, Dmitry, \"Countering Color Revolutions: Russia\u2019s New Security Strategy and its Implications for U.S. Policy\", [http://russiamil.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/countering-color-revolutions-russias-new-security-strategy-and-its-implications-for-u-s-policy/ Russian Military Reform], 15 September 2014</ref><ref>Flintoff, Corey, [https://www.npr.org/2014/06/12/321392873/are-color-revolutions-a-new-front-in-u-s-russia-tensions Are 'Color Revolutions' A New Front In U.S.-Russia Tensions?], NPR, 12 June 2014</ref> President [[Vladimir Putin]] said that Russia must prevent colour revolutions: \"We see what tragic consequences the wave of so-called colour revolutions led to.

A peaceful demonstration by students (mostly from [[Charles University]]) was attacked by the police \u2013 and in time contributed to the collapse of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Yet the roots of the pacifist floral imagery may go even further back to the non-violent [[Carnation Revolution]] of Portugal in April 1974, which is associated with the colour carnation because [[carnation]]s were worn, and the 1986 [[People Power Revolution|Yellow Revolution]] in the Philippines where demonstrators offered peace flowers to military personnel manning armoured tanks.\n\n===Student movements===\nThe first of these was [[Otpor!]] (\"Resistance!\") in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was founded at [[Belgrade University]] in October 1998 and began protesting against Milo\u0161evic' during the [[Kosovo War]]. Most of them were already veterans of anti-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 demonstrations such as the [[1996\u20131997 protests in Serbia|1996\u201397 protests]] and the [[March 9, 1991 protest|9 March 1991 protest]]. Many of its members were arrested or beaten by the police. Despite this, during the presidential campaign in September 2000, Otpor launched its \"[[Gotov je]]\" (He's finished) campaign that galvanised Serbian discontent with Milo\u0161evic' and resulted in his defeat.\n\nMembers of Otpor have inspired and trained members of related student movements including [[Kmara]] in Georgia, Pora in Ukraine, [[Zubr (political organization)|Zubr]] in Belarus and [[MJAFT!]] in Albania.

It is one of the author's first self-described ''roman durs'' or \"hard novels\" to distinguish it from his ''romans populaires'' or \"popular novels,\" which are primarily mysteries that usually feature his famous [[Inspector Maigret]] character.\n\nIn a larger context, the novel deals with French attitudes towards [[Africa]]ns and the French [[colonialism|colonial]] experience. ''Coup de lune'' has much in common with the [[Noir fiction#Noir fiction|noir fiction]] subgenre of [[hardboiled]] detective fiction, and could be described as being a \"colonial noir\" story, though arguably there are also some [[existentialism|existential]] elements present in the narrative. In his introduction to the [[New York Review Books]] edition, [[Norman Rush]] finds certain parallels between this work and [[Journey to the End of the Night]] by [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]].\n\nThe novel is divided into thirteen chapters and is written using the [[third person limited]] narrative voice.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story concerns Joseph Timar, a sensitive young [[France|Frenchman]], who travels from [[La Rochelle]] to [[Libreville]] in [[Gabon]] to work at a job his [[uncle]] has arranged for him at SACOVA, a [[logging]] business. Upon arriving, he discovers the job is not available; unsure of what to do, he finds temporary residence at a local [[hotel]] where he ends up spending his time drinking and playing [[billiards]] with a group of hotel regulars: an assortment of loggers and minor government officials. After the first night of his stay, Timar awakens to an unexpected sexual encounter with Ad\u00e8le, the proprietor's wife. Shortly thereafter, a black servant, Thomas, is found murdered and Ad\u00e8le's ailing husband Eug\u00e8ne finally dies of [[snail fever]].\n\nThe night before Eug\u00e8ne's [[funeral]], using the pretence of leaving Ad\u00e8le alone to grieve, the regulars convince Timar to come with them on a late night jaunt to a native village. Here the group picks up African women, one of whom is married, but whose husband seems used to his wife being treated as a [[whore]] by the white colonials. The group drives to a clearing in woods and a drunken party ensues. Timar stands by while the others steal the women's clothing and drive off laughing.\n\nAfter the funeral, Ad\u00e8le convinces Timar to use his uncle's influence to acquire a [[Concession (contract)|concession]] for the two of them for which she will provide the [[financial capital|capital]]. Despite a growing suspicion that Ad\u00e8le is being less than honest with him, Timar agrees in the heat of his passion for her. The details are worked out, the uncle's letter arrives, and the two begin the journey by [[riverboat]] to their new territory. They pause at a village where Ad\u00e8le inexplicably disappears into a native hut for a time before returning. Timar contracts [[dengue fever]] along the way, and spends the rest of the trip in a state of [[delirium]]. Some time later, Timar is still suffering, and Ad\u00e8le decides to bring him back to Libreville for treatment in a boat manned by Gabon tribesmen. He lies in the bottom of the boat, semi-delirious while the tribesmen row, and the return is a blur to him.  Back in Libreville, still weak and intermittently incoherent, Timar learns that a village man is to be charged with the servant Thomas's murder on the basis of eye-witness accounts. Timar later learns that Ad\u00e8le's village stop going upriver was to bribe the witness, who will testify at the trial and convict the innocent villager of Thomas's murder. Because Ad\u00e8le is the one bribing the witness, Timar realizes that she was the murderer, and he discovers that Ad\u00e8le did it to stop Thomas's blackmailing her. Thomas had threatened to tell Ad\u00e8le's husband about her adulteries with Timar and a half-dozen other men, all of whom, including the police commissioner, are now helping Ad\u00e8le get the innocent villager convicted so that they may continue their relationships with her.  Timar becomes further unhinged by all of this knowledge, and now completely helpless, is put on a ship headed back to France, muttering incoherently to himself as the ship leaves the port.\n\n==English language editions==\nThere are two [[English language|English]] translations of ''Coup de Lune'', the first by [[Stuart Gilbert]] has been included in two anthologies: ''In Two Latitudes'' ([[George Routledge]], 1942; [[Penguin Books]], 1952) and ''African Trio'' ([[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], 1979).

However, his spell at the club lasted just half a season, with only four [[Premier League]] appearances before he signed, in January 1997, with [[Italy]]'s [[Udinese Calcio]].\n\nDue to persisting injuries during the most part of his career, Genaux retired at just 29, after having returned to Standard for a final season.

He seemed poised to be the successor of [[Eric Gerets]] in the ''Diables Rouges'', although he was not picked up for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nGenaux became a regular fixture in the following years, but Belgium failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1996]].

Charleroi S.C.|R. Charleroi SC]], Genaux began his professional career aged 17 at [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], where he helped to win one [[Belgian Cup]] and achieved two [[Belgian Pro League|Pro League]] runner-up places.\n\nIn 1996 Genaux moved to England, joining [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. However, his spell at the club lasted just half a season, with only four [[Premier League]] appearances before he signed, in January 1997, with [[Italy]]'s [[Udinese Calcio]].\n\nDue to persisting injuries during the most part of his career, Genaux retired at just 29, after having returned to Standard for a final season. Afterwards he moved into coaching, starting with the youths at [[R.A.A. Louvi\u00e9roise]] and [[R.C.S.

He seemed poised to be the successor of [[Eric Gerets]] in the ''Diables Rouges'', although he was not picked up for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nGenaux became a regular fixture in the following years, but Belgium failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1996]].

The season was also marked with controversy however, as in the second half of the season, Milan had a goal by [[Sulley Muntari]] disallowed in a key match against title rivals Juventus at the [[San Siro]], after they had already been leading 1\u20130; the match eventually ended in a 1\u20131 draw.<ref name=relationship/> Along with [[Adriano Galliani]], Allegri drew criticism for his decision to sell veteran deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo to Juventus, after excluding him from the starting eleven the previous season, and deeming him to be a surplus due to his age; Pirlo went on to play a key role in Juventus's victorious Serie A title.<ref name=relationship/>\n\nOn 13 January 2012, Allegri agreed to extend his contract with Milan to the end of 2013\u201314 season. On 5 June 2012, Allegri stated that he intends to coach for only 10 more years and plans to retire at the age of 55 due to the fact that coaching contains a high level of stress and anxiety. He also said that he hopes to coach the Italian national side before he retires. With the departure and retirement of several of the club's key players, Milan struggled at the beginning of the 2012\u201313 season, and had only collected 8 points from their first 7 games, putting Allegri in danger of getting fired early on.<ref name=relationship/> Despite all the criticism from the critics, Milan stuck with Allegri and he managed to get the best out of some younger players including [[Stephan El Shaarawy]], Milan's home-grown player [[Mattia De Sciglio]] and later on [[Mario Balotelli]]. Allegri managed to steer the Rossoneri from 16th place to a 3rd-place finish at the end of the season, with an epic 2\u20131 comeback victory away to [[A.C. Siena|Siena]]. The result gave Milan a spot in the playoff round for the [[2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League|2013\u201314 Champions League]] campaign.<ref name=relationship/>\n\nOn 1 June 2013, club president [[Silvio Berlusconi]] confirmed Allegri to remain as the manager of Milan, despite numerous speculations that he would be given the sack. On 31 December 2013, Allegri confirmed he would leave the club at the end of the season, telling ''Gazzetta dello Sport'': \"Of course this is my last Christmas at A.C. Milan\". However, Milan reported that Allegri and his staff were relieved of their duties with immediate effect on 13 January 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/news/breaking_news_show/52094 |publisher=AC Milan |accessdate=13 January 2014 |date=13 January 2014 |title=A.C.

Under Allegri, Juventus became slightly less aggressive and intense in their pressing off the ball while their playing style became more patient and focussed on keeping possession and gaining territorial advantage in order to conserve energy, tactics which he had previously used while at Milan. Although Allegri's team was still effective at winning the ball in midfield and scoring from counter-attacks, the club's attacking play on the ball usually involved a slower build-up, which mainly consisted of short passes, and fewer long balls from [[Andrea Pirlo|Pirlo]] and [[Leonardo Bonucci|Bonucci]].<ref name=stamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/60374/allegri%E2%80%99s-stamp-bianconeri|title=Allegri\u2019s stamp on the Bianconeri|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Luca Cetta|date=28 December 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=imagination>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/54899/%E2%80%98more-imagination-allegri%E2%80%99|title=More imagination with Allegri|publisher=Football Italia|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/news/show/144150|title=THE NUMBERS GAME|publisher=A.C.

The switch to a four-man back-line also allowed Allegri to rotate several players, such as centre-backs [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Andrea Barzagli]] and Leonardo Bonucci as well as right-backs [[Dani Alves]] and [[Stephan Lichtsteiner]], while centre-forward Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 was deployed in a deeper, wider role as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or attacking midfielder on the left flank\u2014this new position utilised the Croatian's work-rate, intelligence, hold-up play and ability to cover for teammates making overlapping runs, in particular those of left-back [[Alex Sandro]] while Mand\u017euki\u0107's height and ability in the air also enabled him to function essentially as a \"[[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|target man]]\" in wider areas.\n\nJuventus's tactical versatility was demonstrated by their ability to switch between the 3\u20135\u20132 and 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formations during matches; this trait was particularly evident in the team's first leg fixture of the Champions League semi-final against [[A.S. Monaco|Monaco]]. Ahead of the match, Allegri fielded Dani Alves as a right-sided wing-back in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation in lieu of Cuadrado and reverted to the team's trademark back-three composed of Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini. When in possession, Juventus kept the ball and played it out from the back and usually attacked with a [[Formation (association football)#3\u20136\u20131|3\u20132\u20134\u20131]], [[Formation (association football)#3\u20134\u20133|3\u20134\u20133]] or 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation as Dani Alves often made offensive overlapping runs behind the opposition's defence, essentially acting as a winger, which created difficulties for Monaco's back-line while Barzagli moved out wide to cover for the Brazilian, functioning as a makeshift right-back. When defending behind the ball, the team reverted to an organised 3\u20135\u20132 or [[Formation (association football)#5\u20133\u20132|5\u20133\u20132 formation]], which was difficult for Monaco to break down, courtesy of the strength of Juventus's defensive trio, who were dubbed \"the [[BBC (disambiguation)|BBC]]\" in the media, a reference to the defenders' initials\u2014Juventus's defensive solidity ensured that the club only conceded three goals en route to the 2017 Champions League final and also allowed the Turin side to create goalscoring opportunities from swift, sudden and efficient counter-attacks after winning back possession. Juventus ended the season by capturing their third consecutive domestic double, which included an unprecedented Italian record sixth consecutive league title; and also reached the Champions League final for the second time in three years, losing out 4\u20131 to defending champions Real Madrid.<ref name=\"Galatasaray go for Mandzukic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/99125/galatasaray-go-mandzukic|title=Galatasaray go for Mandzukic|publisher=Football Italia|date=2 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/97325/audacious-juve-new-norm|title=Audacious Juve the new norm|publisher=Football Italia| first = Nick | last = Valerio|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/95794/west-ham-want-mandzukic-zaza|title=West Ham want Mandzukic for Zaza|publisher=Football Italia|date=17 December 2016|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/10659388/who-could-tottenham-hotspur-target-in-january|title=Who could Tottenham Hotspur target in January?|publisher=Sky Sports|date=6 November 2016|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Mandzukic proving worth to Juventus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/club/juventus/111/blog/post/3013358/mario-mandzukic-proving-worth-to-juventus-and-max-allegri-yet-again|title=Mario Mandzukic proving worth to Juventus and Max Allegri yet again|publisher=ESPN FC|first = Mina | last = Rzouki |date=6 December 2016|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/97804/juventus-cant-forget-3-5-2|title=Juventus can't forget 3\u20135\u20132|publisher=Football Italia| first = Gaby | last = McKay|date=2 February 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acmilan.com/en/news/first-team/2017-03-08/opponents-under-the-microscope-juventus|title= OPPONENTS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE: JUVENTUS |publisher=A.C.

After beginning his managerial career in 2003 with several smaller Italian sides, he later played a key role in [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]]'s rise through the lower Italian divisions and subsequently led [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] to their best Serie A finish in nearly 15 years, winning the [[Panchina d'Oro]] Award for best Serie A coach in [[2008\u201309 Serie A|2009]]. His performances as head coach of Cagliari earned him a move to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in 2010, where he remained until January 2014; in the [[2010\u201311 Serie A|2010\u201311 season]], Allegri helped Milan to their first Serie A title since the 2003\u201304 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/05/07/milan.serie.a.champions/index.html|title=Milan crowned Serie A champions after Roma draw|work=[[CNN News]]|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter joining Juventus in 2014, he won four consecutive domestic [[Double (association football)|doubles]] between 2015 and 2018, the only coach to achieve this feat in the top 5 European leagues.\n\n== Club career ==\nAfter spending the earlier part of his career in the lower leagues, including his hometown club [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], Allegri joined [[Pescara Calcio|Pescara]] in 1991. A talented and creative player, he established himself in midfield as [[Giovanni Galeone]]'s side won promotion to [[Serie A]] in 1992. Allegri was an outstanding performer for Pescara in Serie A. Despite the side's relegation in last place, there was no shortage of goals and Allegri scored an impressive 12 goals from midfield. He moved on to [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and then [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] before returning to Pescara. Brief spells at [[A.C.

Following an impressive season with them, Allegri was called to head [[U.S. Grosseto F.C.|Grosseto]], then in [[Serie C1]], but his experience with the ''biancazzurri'' proved not to be as successful as with Aglianese and he was ultimately sacked shortly after the beginning of the 2006\u201307 Serie C1 season.

A semi-final [[Coppa Italia]] knockout at the hands of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] followed by a quarter-final [[2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] knockout at the hands of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] left Milan fighting on only one front towards the end of the season\u2014the [[Scudetto]]. Even that was to be lost, however, with the ''Rossoneri'' finishing in second place to Juventus and therefore qualifying for [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League|next season's Champions League group stage]]. The season was also marked with controversy however, as in the second half of the season, Milan had a goal by [[Sulley Muntari]] disallowed in a key match against title rivals Juventus at the [[San Siro]], after they had already been leading 1\u20130; the match eventually ended in a 1\u20131 draw.<ref name=relationship/> Along with [[Adriano Galliani]], Allegri drew criticism for his decision to sell veteran deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo to Juventus, after excluding him from the starting eleven the previous season, and deeming him to be a surplus due to his age; Pirlo went on to play a key role in Juventus's victorious Serie A title.<ref name=relationship/>\n\nOn 13 January 2012, Allegri agreed to extend his contract with Milan to the end of 2013\u201314 season. On 5 June 2012, Allegri stated that he intends to coach for only 10 more years and plans to retire at the age of 55 due to the fact that coaching contains a high level of stress and anxiety. He also said that he hopes to coach the Italian national side before he retires. With the departure and retirement of several of the club's key players, Milan struggled at the beginning of the 2012\u201313 season, and had only collected 8 points from their first 7 games, putting Allegri in danger of getting fired early on.<ref name=relationship/> Despite all the criticism from the critics, Milan stuck with Allegri and he managed to get the best out of some younger players including [[Stephan El Shaarawy]], Milan's home-grown player [[Mattia De Sciglio]] and later on [[Mario Balotelli]]. Allegri managed to steer the Rossoneri from 16th place to a 3rd-place finish at the end of the season, with an epic 2\u20131 comeback victory away to [[A.C. Siena|Siena]].

management ==\nAllegri has been praised for his tactical intelligence and his ability to build effectively upon [[Antonio Conte]]'s successful tactics and winning mentality as Juventus's manager, albeit in a less rigorous manner. He initially continued to use Conte's trademark [[Formation (association football)#3\u20135\u20132|3\u20135\u20132 formation]], but later switched to a four-man back-line, in particular in the UEFA Champions League. Under Allegri, Juventus became slightly less aggressive and intense in their pressing off the ball while their playing style became more patient and focussed on keeping possession and gaining territorial advantage in order to conserve energy, tactics which he had previously used while at Milan. Although Allegri's team was still effective at winning the ball in midfield and scoring from counter-attacks, the club's attacking play on the ball usually involved a slower build-up, which mainly consisted of short passes, and fewer long balls from [[Andrea Pirlo|Pirlo]] and [[Leonardo Bonucci|Bonucci]].<ref name=stamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/60374/allegri%E2%80%99s-stamp-bianconeri|title=Allegri\u2019s stamp on the Bianconeri|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Luca Cetta|date=28 December 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=imagination>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/54899/%E2%80%98more-imagination-allegri%E2%80%99|title=More imagination with Allegri|publisher=Football Italia|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/news/show/144150|title=THE NUMBERS GAME|publisher=A.C.

The switch to a four-man back-line also allowed Allegri to rotate several players, such as centre-backs [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Andrea Barzagli]] and Leonardo Bonucci as well as right-backs [[Dani Alves]] and [[Stephan Lichtsteiner]], while centre-forward Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 was deployed in a deeper, wider role as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or attacking midfielder on the left flank\u2014this new position utilised the Croatian's work-rate, intelligence, hold-up play and ability to cover for teammates making overlapping runs, in particular those of left-back [[Alex Sandro]] while Mand\u017euki\u0107's height and ability in the air also enabled him to function essentially as a \"[[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|target man]]\" in wider areas.\n\nJuventus's tactical versatility was demonstrated by their ability to switch between the 3\u20135\u20132 and 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formations during matches; this trait was particularly evident in the team's first leg fixture of the Champions League semi-final against [[A.S. Monaco|Monaco]]. Ahead of the match, Allegri fielded Dani Alves as a right-sided wing-back in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation in lieu of Cuadrado and reverted to the team's trademark back-three composed of Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini. When in possession, Juventus kept the ball and played it out from the back and usually attacked with a [[Formation (association football)#3\u20136\u20131|3\u20132\u20134\u20131]], [[Formation (association football)#3\u20134\u20133|3\u20134\u20133]] or 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation as Dani Alves often made offensive overlapping runs behind the opposition's defence, essentially acting as a winger, which created difficulties for Monaco's back-line while Barzagli moved out wide to cover for the Brazilian, functioning as a makeshift right-back.
