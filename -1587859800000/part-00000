McDevitt trophy by the Veteran Athletes of Philadelphia. The Bulldogs reached postseason play for the first time in 1958, and the team's first victory in postseason play came the following year when the Bulldogs made it to the [[1959 National Invitation Tournament|NIT Quarterfinals]].

For the game between Butler and DePauw, Butler senior John F. Stone compiled the rules by combining association (soccer) rules with eastern intercollegiate rules to form the western intercollegiate rules, which were published by Charles Mayer of Indianapolis. Butler won the game by a score of four goals to one.\n\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in three Division II playoff games, the last in 1991 when it lost to eventual national champion Pittsburg State 26\u201316. The Bulldogs saw their greatest success in football over the course of 60 seasons from 1934 to 1994 when Bulldog football teams won 31 conference championships, including seven straight Indiana Collegiate Conference titles from 1934 to 1940, league titles in 1946, 1947, 1952, 1953, and seven straight from 1958 to 1964, all under [[Tony Hinkle]].\n\nFollowing the move from the College Division to NCAA Division II, Butler won 4 straight conference championships from 1972 to 1975, along with another one in 1977, all under the guidance of Bill Sylvester, Sr.  Ashland joined Butler and fellow ICC members to form the Heartland Collegiate Conference, in which Butler won league titles in 1983, 1985, and three straight from 1987 to 1989, under coach Bill Lynch. The Bulldogs also went the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1983 and 1988.\n\nButler and fellow HCC member schools joined with the Great Lakes Valley Conference to form the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference (now the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference). Butler added back to back league titles in 1991 and 1992 with Bob Bartlameo at the helm, including a trip to the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1991. The following season, Butler and member school Valparaiso moved up to NCAA Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) under the guidance of Ken LaRose to join with Dayton, Drake, Evansville, and San Diego to form the [[Pioneer Football League]], in which Butler still competes. Butler capped its decade of dominance, seven league titles in ten years with three playoff berths, by winning another conference championship in 1994. The Dawgs were led by the great Arnold Mickens who broke numerous NCAA Division I rushing records, including eight straight 200 yard performances during the campaign.\n\nThe Bulldogs, led by Coach Jeff Voris, won the 2009 Pioneer Football League title by compiling a 7\u20131 league record and an 11\u20131 season overall. The conference title run included a come-from-behind 25\u201324 victory over Pioneer League preseason favorite San Diego, a 31\u201328 road win at Dayton (who also finished with a 7\u20131 league record), and a 20\u201317 title-clinching victory over Drake.\n\nThe Pioneer Football League title earned the Bulldogs a berth in the Gridiron Classic. It was Butler's first postseason appearance since 1991 when they were still a Division-II football program. Butler defeated Central Connecticut State 28\u201323 to win the Gridiron Classic in Indianapolis. In 2012 the Bulldogs were able to rattle of 7 consecutive league victories to secure the share of the PFL Championship. This is the third PFL Championship for the Dawgs, and its second in the last four years. In 2013, Butler became the first PFL team to compete in the FCS playoffs after the conference was given an automatic invitation, losing in the first round to [[2013 Tennessee State Tigers football team|Tennessee State]].\n\n====Postseason====\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The helmet trophy was created to further intensify the rivalry between these two teams. A group of Butler players, along with their head coach, Jeff Voris, came up with the idea for the helmet. After Valparaiso head coach Stacey Adams agreed to play for the helmet, Butler equipment manager John Harding put the helmet together.\n\nThe white helmet is mounted on a hardwood plaque and features each team's logo on respective sides of the helmet. A gold plate is added each year to commemorate the winner and score of the contest. Currently, Butler holds a 9\u20133 series lead when playing for the Hoosier Helmet. Both Butler and Valparaiso compete in the NCAA FCS (formerly division 1-AA), non-scholarship Pioneer Football League.\n\n===Track & field===\n\n====Butler Relays====\nThe Butler Relays were a prestigious American Track and Field competition, founded by track coach Herman Phillips who won three NCAA quartermile championships and was a member of the 1928 U.S. Olympic 1,600 meter gold medal relay team.\n\nThe event annually showcased 350\u2013400 athletes representing 20\u201330 colleges and universities.  From an attendance of 3,500, the games grew to attract over 10,000 spectators to Butler (Hinkle) Fieldhouse each March.  The college's fraternities and sororities vied in yearly ticket sales, parade float, house decoration, and Relay Queen competitions.  The University Division \"Governor's Cup\" went to each year's victor, with Indiana University claiming the inaugural trophy in 1933 and the University of Notre Dame taking the final prize in 1942.  The University of Michigan captured the eight intervening awards.  Butler claimed the College Division \"Mayor's Trophy\" between 1938 and 1941.  In addition to the participation of legendary American Olympians Jesse Owens, Glenn Cunningham, Ralph Metcalfe, and IU's Don Lash, the Butler Relays saw ten world records set or tied during the meet's decade-long run.\n\nWhen Phillips became head track and field coach at Purdue University in 1938, Lawrence Holmes directed the relays for one year.  Butler alumnus and former world two mile (3&nbsp;km) record holder Ray Sears staged the games from 1939 until the fieldhouse was dedicated to military use in 1942.  The Butler Relays were not reinstituted after World War II because of the expense and the basketball program's influence over fieldhouse scheduling.\n\n===Soccer===\n{{main|Butler Bulldogs men's soccer|Butler Bulldogs women's soccer}}\nMen's soccer at Butler began in 1989, and the women's team was added in 1991.  In the program's 20-year history, the men's soccer team has made five post-season appearances, acquiring a 3\u20135 record in post-season play.  The Bulldogs' last post-season appearance was in 2009. Butler's men's soccer qualified for the NCAA Tournament in 1995, 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2009, reaching the round of 16 in 1995 and 1998. Butler won the Horizon League (formerly MCC) tournament title in 1995, 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2010. They also won or shared the regular season title seven times, including 1994, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010. The 1998 squad enjoyed national rankings as high as #8 in the country and the 2010 squad was ranked as high as #5 in the final National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) poll.<ref>[http://www.butlersports.com/sports/m-soccer/2010-11/releases/113010aab Butler Posts Record-Breaking Season] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708105400/http://www.butlersports.com/sports/m-soccer/2010-11/releases/113010aab |date=2011-07-08 }}, [[Butler University]] \u2013 The Official Athletics Site, retrieved 2011-Mar-3</ref> The Bulldogs won the 2016 Big East Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Butler wins the 2016 BIG EAST Championship! |url=http://www.bigeast.com/news/2016/11/13/MSOC_1113162224.aspx|publisher=Big East|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\n{{main|Butler Bulldogs baseball}}\nThe Butler baseball team has been led since 2017 by Head Coach [[Dave Schrage]].

Here, he is memorialized with his famous phrase, ''\"[[The Butler Way]]\"''.]]\nIt was clear from the earliest days that athletics was destined to play a major role in shaping Butler University. When the school moved to its current Fairview campus location, two of the first structures completed were a 15,000-seat fieldhouse and a 36,000-seat football stadium.\n\n===Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl===\n{{main|Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl}}\nThe football stadium, which came to be known as the Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl (known as the Butler Bowl until 2017), was built in 1927. The original stadium had seating for 36,000 and hosted games versus the likes of the Four Horsemen from Notre Dame and Red Grange from Illinois. The Bowl was downsized to a 20,000-seat stadium in 1955 with the addition of the Hilton U. Brown Theatre, and is the home field for Butler football and soccer today. A 2006 renovation of the stadium included seating for 7,500, larger sidelines, and field turf, allowing it to host football, soccer, and other events. The new Student Apartment Housing overlooks the stadium on the east end, with the original seating on the west side of the stadium. A new press box and new seating on the west end and additional seating on the east end of the Bowl have been completed for the 2010 fall season. New lighting was completed in 2011 and was utilized for the first time during the 2012 season. New seating and the new entrance on the south end of the stadium were completed in time for the 2013 season. The new student hill is now located on the north end of the stadium.\n\n===Hinkle Fieldhouse===\n{{main|Hinkle Fieldhouse}}\nThe fieldhouse, which was the largest of its kind when it was completed in 1928 and remained the largest in the U.S. for several decades, is a historical landmark. The Butler Fieldhouse, which was renamed [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] in 1966, came to symbolize not only Butler athletics, but also Indiana \"[[Hoosier Hysteria]].\" From its opening in 1928 until 1971, the building became the combined home of Butler basketball and the final rounds of the [[Indiana High School Athletic Association]]'s basketball tournament. The legends of Indiana basketball, from [[Oscar Robertson]] to [[George McGinnis]] to [[Larry Bird]], all played in the Fieldhouse at one time or another.\n\nIn 1954, Butler Fieldhouse hosted the historic final when [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|Milan High School]] (enrollment 161) defeated [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]] Central High School (enrollment over 1,600) to win the state title. The state final depicted in the 1986 movie ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'', loosely based on the Milan Miracle story, was shot in Hinkle Fieldhouse.\n\n===Varsity Field===\nOther facilities include Varsity Field, which serves as one of the homes of the Butler men's and women's soccer teams. A natural grass field, the complex gives the soccer teams a unique advantage in being able to play games and have practices on both the artificial surface of the Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl and the natural surface of Varsity Field.\nVarsity Field features a covered area for both team benches, an elevated press box, a storage area for equipment and seating along the southern sideline for up to 500 spectators. The soccer teams are also able to take advantage of the practice fields located north of the main field.\n\n===Bulldog Park===\nBulldog Park is the home of Butler's baseball program.  It has a capacity of 500 spectators.  Formerly both a baseball field and football practice facility, the park was converted to a baseball-only facility in the 1990s.  Its dimensions are 330&nbsp;ft. down the foul lines, 370&nbsp;ft. to the gaps, and 400&nbsp;ft. to center field.<ref name=bulldogpark>{{cite web|title=Bulldog Park |url=http://www.butlersports.com/information/facilities/bulldog_park |work=ButlerSports.com |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218020636/http://butlersports.com/information/facilities/bulldog_park |archivedate=2011-12-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Butler Softball Field===\nThe Butler softball team calls the Butler Softball Field home, located adjacent to the Holcomb Gardens across the Inland Waterway Canal. The field is a part of a larger athletic field complex that features Varsity Field (the alternate field for both the men's and women's soccer teams), the outdoor tennis courts and intramural softball and soccer fields.\nThe field features brick dugouts for both the home and visiting benches, a bullpen area and batting cages located down the first base line out of play and spectator seating for up to 500 people. The field's outfield dimensions extend to {{convert|200|ft|m}} from foul pole to foul pole.\n\nA minor renovation during the winter of 2007 saw new dirt added to the infield and regraded for a more consistent playing surface.\n\n===The Butler Bubble===\nThe Butler Bubble is home to the Bulldog men's and women's tennis teams and is used as an indoor practice facility for the Butler baseball, football and soccer teams. All of the Butler tennis teams' home matches during the winter and early spring take place inside the bubble, which is located behind Hinkle Fieldhouse off of 52nd Street. The Bubble was originally constructed at the far west end of the Hinkle Fieldhouse parking lot, but was relocated to along the right field line of Bulldog Park after the original plot was broke for the construction of the new Health and Recreation Complex in the summer of 2005. The Bubble houses four hard-surface tennis courts as well as additional room for storage of equipment for both tennis teams. The bubble itself is supported by higher air pressure inside and is permanently fixed over the courts.\n\n===Davey Track and Field===\nSituated next adjacent to Bulldog Park as a part of the Davey Athletic Complex, the Davey Track & Field is used primarily by the Butler track & field teams and the football team for practices but is also utilized by the other athletics programs for conditioning.\n\n===Butler Health & Rec. Center===\nButler University broke ground on its new, {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Health and Recreation Complex (HRC) in June 2005. The HRC offers many new services to students, faculty and staff, while expanding others presently available. In addition to being the headquarters for Butler's department of recreation, the HRC also houses Counseling and Consultation Services, Health Education and Health Services, making it a true wellness center on campus. Since opening Aug 30, 2006, over 250,000 participants have enjoyed it so far.\n\n==Paul D. \"Tony\" Hinkle==\nWhile the Fieldhouse provided a nationally acclaimed setting for Butler athletics, it was [[Tony Hinkle|Paul D. \"Tony\" Hinkle]], credited with inventing the orange basketball, who brought national recognition to the school as a coach and athletic administrator. He came to Butler in 1921 and remained with the University until his death in 1992. Hinkle served as a teacher, coach and athletic administrator for nearly half a century and compiled more than 1,000 victories with the school's football, basketball and baseball teams. The Bulldogs have carried on the winning traditions set forth by Hinkle. In the past decade, Butler teams have captured 26 conference championships (in four different leagues). The Bulldogs have made appearances in NCAA National Championship Tournaments in men's and women's basketball, men's soccer, volleyball, men's cross country, lacrosse, and baseball. Butler won the James J. McCafferty trophy, awarded annually by the conference for all-sports excellence based on conference championship points, five times, including three-straight from 1996\u201397 to 1998\u201399 and back-to-back years in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303.\n\n==Butler mascots==\nButler University was originally founded as North Western Christian University by Ovid Butler in 1855.  He choose \"Christians\" as the school mascot.  Sometime after the school had been renamed in honor of its founder, Butler was suffering a poor football season in 1919.  As losses mounted, people grew wary of the \"Christians\" nickname.  Before a big game against the rival Franklin \"Baptists\", the Butler Collegian was trying to conceive of a way to fire people up when \"Shimmy\", a bulldog owned by one of the fraternities, wandered into their office.  Shimmy inspired cartoonist George Dickson to draw a bulldog labeled \"Butler\" taking a bite out of [[John The Baptist]].  Butler lost the game, but the nickname \"Bulldogs\" stuck.\n\nEventually, the bulldog was selected as the official mascot of the university.  For many years, Butler had unofficial live bulldog mascots that kept by various fraternities.  In 2000, Butler Blue became the school's first official live mascot.  To date, there have been three dogs to carry the name \"Blue\", the university's primary color; a fourth will assume mascot duties after the end of the 2019\u201320 school year.\n\n*'''[[Butler Blue#Butler Blue I|Butler Blue I]]''' (September 23, 2000 \u2013 May 30, 2014) \u2013 one NCAA Sweet 16 appearance (2003) and two Horizon League McCafferty All-Sports Championships (2002, 2003).

At the same time, Michael Kaltenmark, who became mascot handler when Blue II assumed the role, will retire from the handling role, although he will remain in his regular university job, and continue in a behind-the-scenes role in the mascot program.\n*'''[[Butler Blue#Blue IV|Butler Blue IV]]''' (October 30, 2019 \u2013 ) \u2013 Announced as Trip's successor on January 22, 2020 and unveiled to the public two days later.

For the game between Butler and DePauw, Butler senior John F. Stone compiled the rules by combining association (soccer) rules with eastern intercollegiate rules to form the western intercollegiate rules, which were published by Charles Mayer of Indianapolis. Butler won the game by a score of four goals to one.\n\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in three Division II playoff games, the last in 1991 when it lost to eventual national champion Pittsburg State 26\u201316. The Bulldogs saw their greatest success in football over the course of 60 seasons from 1934 to 1994 when Bulldog football teams won 31 conference championships, including seven straight Indiana Collegiate Conference titles from 1934 to 1940, league titles in 1946, 1947, 1952, 1953, and seven straight from 1958 to 1964, all under [[Tony Hinkle]].\n\nFollowing the move from the College Division to NCAA Division II, Butler won 4 straight conference championships from 1972 to 1975, along with another one in 1977, all under the guidance of Bill Sylvester, Sr.  Ashland joined Butler and fellow ICC members to form the Heartland Collegiate Conference, in which Butler won league titles in 1983, 1985, and three straight from 1987 to 1989, under coach Bill Lynch. The Bulldogs also went the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1983 and 1988.\n\nButler and fellow HCC member schools joined with the Great Lakes Valley Conference to form the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference (now the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference). Butler added back to back league titles in 1991 and 1992 with Bob Bartlameo at the helm, including a trip to the NCAA Division II playoffs in 1991. The following season, Butler and member school Valparaiso moved up to NCAA Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) under the guidance of Ken LaRose to join with Dayton, Drake, Evansville, and San Diego to form the [[Pioneer Football League]], in which Butler still competes. Butler capped its decade of dominance, seven league titles in ten years with three playoff berths, by winning another conference championship in 1994. The Dawgs were led by the great Arnold Mickens who broke numerous NCAA Division I rushing records, including eight straight 200 yard performances during the campaign.\n\nThe Bulldogs, led by Coach Jeff Voris, won the 2009 Pioneer Football League title by compiling a 7\u20131 league record and an 11\u20131 season overall. The conference title run included a come-from-behind 25\u201324 victory over Pioneer League preseason favorite San Diego, a 31\u201328 road win at Dayton (who also finished with a 7\u20131 league record), and a 20\u201317 title-clinching victory over Drake.\n\nThe Pioneer Football League title earned the Bulldogs a berth in the Gridiron Classic. It was Butler's first postseason appearance since 1991 when they were still a Division-II football program. Butler defeated Central Connecticut State 28\u201323 to win the Gridiron Classic in Indianapolis. In 2012 the Bulldogs were able to rattle of 7 consecutive league victories to secure the share of the PFL Championship. This is the third PFL Championship for the Dawgs, and its second in the last four years. In 2013, Butler became the first PFL team to compete in the FCS playoffs after the conference was given an automatic invitation, losing in the first round to [[2013 Tennessee State Tigers football team|Tennessee State]].\n\n====Postseason====\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The helmet trophy was created to further intensify the rivalry between these two teams. A group of Butler players, along with their head coach, Jeff Voris, came up with the idea for the helmet. After Valparaiso head coach Stacey Adams agreed to play for the helmet, Butler equipment manager John Harding put the helmet together.\n\nThe white helmet is mounted on a hardwood plaque and features each team's logo on respective sides of the helmet. A gold plate is added each year to commemorate the winner and score of the contest. Currently, Butler holds a 9\u20133 series lead when playing for the Hoosier Helmet. Both Butler and Valparaiso compete in the NCAA FCS (formerly division 1-AA), non-scholarship Pioneer Football League.\n\n===Track & field===\n\n====Butler Relays====\nThe Butler Relays were a prestigious American Track and Field competition, founded by track coach Herman Phillips who won three NCAA quartermile championships and was a member of the 1928 U.S. Olympic 1,600 meter gold medal relay team.\n\nThe event annually showcased 350\u2013400 athletes representing 20\u201330 colleges and universities.  From an attendance of 3,500, the games grew to attract over 10,000 spectators to Butler (Hinkle) Fieldhouse each March.  The college's fraternities and sororities vied in yearly ticket sales, parade float, house decoration, and Relay Queen competitions.  The University Division \"Governor's Cup\" went to each year's victor, with Indiana University claiming the inaugural trophy in 1933 and the University of Notre Dame taking the final prize in 1942.  The University of Michigan captured the eight intervening awards.  Butler claimed the College Division \"Mayor's Trophy\" between 1938 and 1941.  In addition to the participation of legendary American Olympians Jesse Owens, Glenn Cunningham, Ralph Metcalfe, and IU's Don Lash, the Butler Relays saw ten world records set or tied during the meet's decade-long run.\n\nWhen Phillips became head track and field coach at Purdue University in 1938, Lawrence Holmes directed the relays for one year.  Butler alumnus and former world two mile (3&nbsp;km) record holder Ray Sears staged the games from 1939 until the fieldhouse was dedicated to military use in 1942.  The Butler Relays were not reinstituted after World War II because of the expense and the basketball program's influence over fieldhouse scheduling.\n\n===Soccer===\n{{main|Butler Bulldogs men's soccer|Butler Bulldogs women's soccer}}\nMen's soccer at Butler began in 1989, and the women's team was added in 1991.

Butler softball plays at the Butler Softball Field as their home field. Butler has never won a conference championship.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{cite web |title=Butler Athletics |url=http://www.butlersports.com/sports/w-softbl/index |website=Butler |publisher=Butler University |accessdate=7 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326221307/http://butlersports.com/sports/w-softbl/index |archivedate=26 March 2015 }}</ref> As of April 7, 2015 the Bulldogs are ranked 158th in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rankings \u2013 NCAA Womens Softball RPI|url=https://www.ncaa.com/rankings/softball/d1|website=NCAA|publisher=CBS sports|accessdate=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cross country===\nSome of Butler's most notable athletic accomplishments have come in Cross Country. Butler won thirteen Horizon League Championships in Men's Cross Country and twelve Women's Championships.  Both the men and women won the Atlantic 10 Championships in 2012, their lone year in the conference. The Men's team has placed as high as 4th in the nation in recent years, earning a team trophy at the NCAA Division I championships in 2004.  The women also earned an NCAA podium finish, placing 3rd in 2013. Both teams have frequently qualified for nationals in recent years, placing individuals as high as 3rd (Mark Tucker, 2003). All-Americans from the Butler Cross Country Team include Julius Mwangi, Justin Young, Fraser Thompson (a Rhodes Scholar), Mark Tucker, Olly Laws, Andrew Baker, Callum Hawkins, Mara Olson, Katie Clark, Erik Peterson, and Olivia Pratt. Former coach, Joe Franklin, was named NCAA Division I Coach of the Year for leading the Bulldogs to their 2004 4th-place finish.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Butler Bowl7.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Butler Bowl|The Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl]], looking North.]]\n[[File:Hinklefieldhouse5.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Hinkle Fieldhouse]], a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n[[File:BUBaseball.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Bulldog Park]].]]\n[[File:BUSoftball.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Butler Softball Field.]]\n[[File:DaveyComplex.JPG|thumb|right|200px|(Left to right) Davey Track and Field, [[Bulldog Park]], Butler Bubble.]]\n[[File:BUTrack1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Davey Track and Field.]]\n[[File:Davey Athletic.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Welcome sign to the Davey Track and Field.]]\n[[File:Butlerhinkle2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tony Hinkle]] played a huge role in Butler Athletics. Here, he is memorialized with his famous phrase, ''\"[[The Butler Way]]\"''.]]\nIt was clear from the earliest days that athletics was destined to play a major role in shaping Butler University. When the school moved to its current Fairview campus location, two of the first structures completed were a 15,000-seat fieldhouse and a 36,000-seat football stadium.\n\n===Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl===\n{{main|Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl}}\nThe football stadium, which came to be known as the Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl (known as the Butler Bowl until 2017), was built in 1927. The original stadium had seating for 36,000 and hosted games versus the likes of the Four Horsemen from Notre Dame and Red Grange from Illinois. The Bowl was downsized to a 20,000-seat stadium in 1955 with the addition of the Hilton U. Brown Theatre, and is the home field for Butler football and soccer today. A 2006 renovation of the stadium included seating for 7,500, larger sidelines, and field turf, allowing it to host football, soccer, and other events. The new Student Apartment Housing overlooks the stadium on the east end, with the original seating on the west side of the stadium. A new press box and new seating on the west end and additional seating on the east end of the Bowl have been completed for the 2010 fall season. New lighting was completed in 2011 and was utilized for the first time during the 2012 season. New seating and the new entrance on the south end of the stadium were completed in time for the 2013 season. The new student hill is now located on the north end of the stadium.\n\n===Hinkle Fieldhouse===\n{{main|Hinkle Fieldhouse}}\nThe fieldhouse, which was the largest of its kind when it was completed in 1928 and remained the largest in the U.S. for several decades, is a historical landmark. The Butler Fieldhouse, which was renamed [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] in 1966, came to symbolize not only Butler athletics, but also Indiana \"[[Hoosier Hysteria]].\" From its opening in 1928 until 1971, the building became the combined home of Butler basketball and the final rounds of the [[Indiana High School Athletic Association]]'s basketball tournament. The legends of Indiana basketball, from [[Oscar Robertson]] to [[George McGinnis]] to [[Larry Bird]], all played in the Fieldhouse at one time or another.\n\nIn 1954, Butler Fieldhouse hosted the historic final when [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|Milan High School]] (enrollment 161) defeated [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]] Central High School (enrollment over 1,600) to win the state title. The state final depicted in the 1986 movie ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'', loosely based on the Milan Miracle story, was shot in Hinkle Fieldhouse.\n\n===Varsity Field===\nOther facilities include Varsity Field, which serves as one of the homes of the Butler men's and women's soccer teams. A natural grass field, the complex gives the soccer teams a unique advantage in being able to play games and have practices on both the artificial surface of the Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl and the natural surface of Varsity Field.\nVarsity Field features a covered area for both team benches, an elevated press box, a storage area for equipment and seating along the southern sideline for up to 500 spectators. The soccer teams are also able to take advantage of the practice fields located north of the main field.\n\n===Bulldog Park===\nBulldog Park is the home of Butler's baseball program.  It has a capacity of 500 spectators.  Formerly both a baseball field and football practice facility, the park was converted to a baseball-only facility in the 1990s.  Its dimensions are 330&nbsp;ft. down the foul lines, 370&nbsp;ft. to the gaps, and 400&nbsp;ft. to center field.<ref name=bulldogpark>{{cite web|title=Bulldog Park |url=http://www.butlersports.com/information/facilities/bulldog_park |work=ButlerSports.com |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218020636/http://butlersports.com/information/facilities/bulldog_park |archivedate=2011-12-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Butler Softball Field===\nThe Butler softball team calls the Butler Softball Field home, located adjacent to the Holcomb Gardens across the Inland Waterway Canal. The field is a part of a larger athletic field complex that features Varsity Field (the alternate field for both the men's and women's soccer teams), the outdoor tennis courts and intramural softball and soccer fields.\nThe field features brick dugouts for both the home and visiting benches, a bullpen area and batting cages located down the first base line out of play and spectator seating for up to 500 people. The field's outfield dimensions extend to {{convert|200|ft|m}} from foul pole to foul pole.\n\nA minor renovation during the winter of 2007 saw new dirt added to the infield and regraded for a more consistent playing surface.\n\n===The Butler Bubble===\nThe Butler Bubble is home to the Bulldog men's and women's tennis teams and is used as an indoor practice facility for the Butler baseball, football and soccer teams. All of the Butler tennis teams' home matches during the winter and early spring take place inside the bubble, which is located behind Hinkle Fieldhouse off of 52nd Street. The Bubble was originally constructed at the far west end of the Hinkle Fieldhouse parking lot, but was relocated to along the right field line of Bulldog Park after the original plot was broke for the construction of the new Health and Recreation Complex in the summer of 2005. The Bubble houses four hard-surface tennis courts as well as additional room for storage of equipment for both tennis teams. The bubble itself is supported by higher air pressure inside and is permanently fixed over the courts.\n\n===Davey Track and Field===\nSituated next adjacent to Bulldog Park as a part of the Davey Athletic Complex, the Davey Track & Field is used primarily by the Butler track & field teams and the football team for practices but is also utilized by the other athletics programs for conditioning.\n\n===Butler Health & Rec. Center===\nButler University broke ground on its new, {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Health and Recreation Complex (HRC) in June 2005. The HRC offers many new services to students, faculty and staff, while expanding others presently available. In addition to being the headquarters for Butler's department of recreation, the HRC also houses Counseling and Consultation Services, Health Education and Health Services, making it a true wellness center on campus. Since opening Aug 30, 2006, over 250,000 participants have enjoyed it so far.\n\n==Paul D. \"Tony\" Hinkle==\nWhile the Fieldhouse provided a nationally acclaimed setting for Butler athletics, it was [[Tony Hinkle|Paul D. \"Tony\" Hinkle]], credited with inventing the orange basketball, who brought national recognition to the school as a coach and athletic administrator. He came to Butler in 1921 and remained with the University until his death in 1992. Hinkle served as a teacher, coach and athletic administrator for nearly half a century and compiled more than 1,000 victories with the school's football, basketball and baseball teams. The Bulldogs have carried on the winning traditions set forth by Hinkle. In the past decade, Butler teams have captured 26 conference championships (in four different leagues). The Bulldogs have made appearances in NCAA National Championship Tournaments in men's and women's basketball, men's soccer, volleyball, men's cross country, lacrosse, and baseball. Butler won the James J. McCafferty trophy, awarded annually by the conference for all-sports excellence based on conference championship points, five times, including three-straight from 1996\u201397 to 1998\u201399 and back-to-back years in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303.\n\n==Butler mascots==\nButler University was originally founded as North Western Christian University by Ovid Butler in 1855.  He choose \"Christians\" as the school mascot.  Sometime after the school had been renamed in honor of its founder, Butler was suffering a poor football season in 1919.  As losses mounted, people grew wary of the \"Christians\" nickname.  Before a big game against the rival Franklin \"Baptists\", the Butler Collegian was trying to conceive of a way to fire people up when \"Shimmy\", a bulldog owned by one of the fraternities, wandered into their office.  Shimmy inspired cartoonist George Dickson to draw a bulldog labeled \"Butler\" taking a bite out of [[John The Baptist]].  Butler lost the game, but the nickname \"Bulldogs\" stuck.\n\nEventually, the bulldog was selected as the official mascot of the university.  For many years, Butler had unofficial live bulldog mascots that kept by various fraternities.  In 2000, Butler Blue became the school's first official live mascot.  To date, there have been three dogs to carry the name \"Blue\", the university's primary color; a fourth will assume mascot duties after the end of the 2019\u201320 school year.\n\n*'''[[Butler Blue#Butler Blue I|Butler Blue I]]''' (September 23, 2000 \u2013 May 30, 2014) \u2013 one NCAA Sweet 16 appearance (2003) and two Horizon League McCafferty All-Sports Championships (2002, 2003).

Trip had been announced as Blue II's successor on March 9, immediately before the school's last home men's basketball game of the season. Will retire at the end of the 2019\u201320 school year. At the same time, Michael Kaltenmark, who became mascot handler when Blue II assumed the role, will retire from the handling role, although he will remain in his regular university job, and continue in a behind-the-scenes role in the mascot program.\n*'''[[Butler Blue#Future|Butler Blue IV]]''' (October 30, 2019 \u2013 ) \u2013 Announced as Trip's successor on January 22, 2020 and unveiled to the public two days later. Kaltenmark's role as mascot handler will be taken over by Butler alumnus and employee Evan Krauss.\n\nIn addition to \"Blue,\" a person in bulldog costume also performs as \"Hink\" for various Butler University athletic and university events.\n\n==Conference affiliation==\nButler first joined a [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conference in 1932 when the men's basketball team joined the [[Missouri Valley Conference]]. Other sports joined conferences in later years. On May 2, 2012, it was made official that Butler would join the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] beginning in the 2013 season.<ref>[http://www.atlantic10.com/genrel/050212aaa.html Butler joins Atlantic 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504235443/http://www.atlantic10.com/genrel/050212aaa.html |date=2012-05-04 }}</ref>  However, the timeline was later shortened so that the Bulldogs will begin competition beginning in the 2012 season.<ref>[http://www.butlersports.com/releases/052912aaa Butler Will Begin Play in the Atlantic 10 In 2012\u201313] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601170436/http://www.butlersports.com/releases/052912aaa |date=2012-06-01 }}, Butler University:  The Official Athletics Site, published 2012-05-29</ref>  On August 1, 2012, Butler announced it joined the [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]] for women's golf following the school's split with the Horizon League, where the Bulldogs won all but two of the conference's championships in the sport.<ref>{{cite web|title=Butler Joins MAAC For Women's Golf |url=http://www.butlersports.com/sports/w-golf/2012-13/releases/080112aaa |work=Butler Sports |publisher=Butler University |accessdate=5 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419003515/http://www.butlersports.com/sports/w-golf/2012-13/releases/080112aaa |archivedate=19 April 2015 }}</ref>  On March 20, 2013, the Butler administration announced that the school would join the [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment#Catholic 7|reconfigured]] [[Big East Conference|Big East]],<ref name=\"Big East\"/> and moved to the new conference on July 1, 2013.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Years !!

The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely [[ghee]] to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, [[coriander]], or [[tamarind]]. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in ''[[chaat]]'', along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yogurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''[[chaat masala]]''\n\nIn [[Delhi]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Uttarakhand]], a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.\n\nIn [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Jharkhand]], ''shingadas'' (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.\n\nUsually, Samosas are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in ''chaat'', along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called ''mangsher shingara'' (mutton shingara) and ''macher shingara'' (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as ''narkel er shingara'' (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with ''[[khoya]]'' and dipped in sugar syrup.\n\n[[File:Vegetable Samosa.jpg|thumb|Vegetable samosa]]\nIn [[Hyderabad, India]], a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as ''[[lukhmi]]'', is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.\n\nIn the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], and [[Tamil Nadu]], samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese ''chamu\u00e7as'', with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc. It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in [[South India]] are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables.\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Samosas, snack food at Wikipedia's 16th Birthday celebration in Chittagong (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi samosas, snack food]]\n\nBoth flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in [[Bangladesh]]. A [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (''shingara'') and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The ''shingara'' is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a ''somosa'' or ''somucha'', and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.\n\n====Nepal====\nSamosas are called ''singadas'' in the eastern zone of [[Nepal]]; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in [[Nepalese cuisine]]. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.\n\n====Pakistan====\nSamosas of various types are available all over [[Pakistan]]. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern [[Sindh]] province and in the eastern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], especially the city of [[Lahore]], are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, samosas of [[Karachi]] are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from [[Faisalabad]] are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called ''kaghazi samosa'' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1}}}}; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a [[wonton]] or [[spring roll]] wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]). \nSweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.\n\nAnother Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas ([[Chaat|channa chaat]]), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. \n\nIn Pakistan, samosa's are a staple iftaar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of [[Ramadan|Ramzan]].\n\n==== Maldives ====\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in [[Maldivian cuisine]] are known as ''bajiyaa''. They are filled with a mixture including [[fish]] or [[tuna]] and onions.<ref>[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''[https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ Eating on the Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328214604/https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ |date=28 March 2020 }}'', [[Himal Southasian]], Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69-91 {{ISSN|1012-9804}}</ref>\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n\n====Burma====\n[[File:Burmese style samusa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]]-style ''samusa'' are flat and triangular, and usually smaller than their Indian counterparts.]]\n\nSamosas are called ''samusas'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and are an extremely popular snack in [[Burma]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nThe types of samosas in Indonesia are called ''samosa''\u2014usually, samosas are served as snack with sambal.

The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely [[ghee]] to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, [[coriander]], or [[tamarind]]. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in ''[[chaat]]'', along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yogurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''[[chaat masala]]''\n\nIn [[Delhi]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Uttarakhand]], a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.\n\nIn [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Jharkhand]], ''shingadas'' (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.\n\nUsually, Samosas are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in ''chaat'', along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called ''mangsher shingara'' (mutton shingara) and ''macher shingara'' (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as ''narkel er shingara'' (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with ''[[khoya]]'' and dipped in sugar syrup.\n\n[[File:Vegetable Samosa.jpg|thumb|Vegetable samosa]]\nIn [[Hyderabad, India]], a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as ''[[lukhmi]]'', is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.\n\nIn the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], and [[Tamil Nadu]], samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese ''chamu\u00e7as'', with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc. It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in [[South India]] are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables.\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Samosas, snack food at Wikipedia's 16th Birthday celebration in Chittagong (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi samosas, snack food]]\n\nBoth flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in [[Bangladesh]]. A [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (''shingara'') and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The ''shingara'' is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a ''somosa'' or ''somucha'', and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.\n\n====Nepal====\nSamosas are called ''singadas'' in the eastern zone of [[Nepal]]; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in [[Nepalese cuisine]]. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.\n\n====Pakistan====\nSamosas of various types are available all over [[Pakistan]]. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern [[Sindh]] province and in the eastern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], especially the city of [[Lahore]], are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, samosas of [[Karachi]] are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from [[Faisalabad]] are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called ''kaghazi samosa'' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1}}}}; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a [[wonton]] or [[spring roll]] wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]). \nSweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.\n\nAnother Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas ([[Chaat|channa chaat]]), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. \n\nIn Pakistan, samosa's are a staple iftaar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of [[Ramadan|Ramzan]].\n\n==== Maldives ====\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in [[Maldivian cuisine]] are known as ''bajiyaa''. They are filled with a mixture including [[fish]] or [[tuna]] and onions.<ref>[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''[https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ Eating on the Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328214604/https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ |date=28 March 2020 }}'', [[Himal Southasian]], Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69-91 {{ISSN|1012-9804}}</ref>\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n\n====Burma====\n[[File:Burmese style samusa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]]-style ''samusa'' are flat and triangular, and usually smaller than their Indian counterparts.]]\n\nSamosas are called ''samusas'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and are an extremely popular snack in [[Burma]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nThe types of samosas in Indonesia are called ''samosa''\u2014usually, samosas are served as snack with sambal.

The Index was first launched in May 2009, with subsequent reports being released annually. In 2015 it ranked 165 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study was conceived by Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York.\n\nThe 2019 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]] and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], [[South Sudan]], [[Yemen]], and [[Iraq]]  to be the least peaceful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2019-06-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 10 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== International panel ==\nThe international panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:\n\n* [[Kevin P. Clements|Professor Kevin P. Clements]], ''Foundation Chair of Peace and Conflict Studies and Director, National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Otago, New Zealand''\n* [[Sabina Alkire|Dr Sabina Alkire]], ''Director, Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford, United Kingdom''\n* Dr Ian Anthony, ''Research Coordinator and Director of the Programme on Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Sweden''\n* Ms Isabelle Arrandon, ''Director of Research and Deputy Director of Communications & Outreach, International Crisis Group, Belgium''\n* Dr Manuela Mesa, ''Director, Centre for Education and Peace Research (CEIPAZ) and President, Spanish Association for Peace Research (AIPAZ), Madrid, Spain''\n* Mr Nick Grono, ''CEO, The Freedom Fund, United Kingdom''\n* Dr Ekaterina Stepanova, ''Head, Unit on Peace and Conflict Studies, Institute of the World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia''\n\n== Methodology ==\nIn assessing peacefulness, the GPI investigates the extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.\n\nIn 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1\u20135, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1\u20135, to the third decimal point.

The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. \u2018Negative Peace\u2019 which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or \"drivers\", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113\u2013136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.\n* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.\n* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. \n*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours\n* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.\n* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.\n\nStatistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations\u2019 development.\n\n== Global Peace Index rankings (2008\u20132019) ==\nNations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<!-- Note that if you want to update this

The Index was first launched in May 2009, with subsequent reports being released annually. In 2015 it ranked 165 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study was conceived by Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York.\n\nThe 2019 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]] and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], [[South Sudan]], [[Yemen]], and [[Iraq]]  to be the least peaceful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2019-06-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 10 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== International panel ==\nThe international panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:\n\n* [[Kevin P.

It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.\n\nIn 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1\u20135, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1\u20135, to the third decimal point.

The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. \u2018Negative Peace\u2019 which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or \"drivers\", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113\u2013136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.\n* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.\n* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. \n*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours\n* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.\n* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.\n\nStatistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations\u2019 development.\n\n== Global Peace Index rankings (2008\u20132019) ==\nNations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<!-- Note that if you want to update this

Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: \"The GPI continues its pioneering work in drawing the world\u2019s attention to the massive resources we are squandering in violence and conflict. The lives and money wasted in wars, incarcerations, weapons systems, weapons trade, and more, could be directed to ending poverty, promoting education, and protecting the environment.
