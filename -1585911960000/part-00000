He is also the current director of the Spacejunk Art Centers.\n\n== Biography ==\nHe comes from the background of board sports. He was a professional freeride [[snowboarder]] from 1992 to 2003, and he collaborated with the French winter sports brand [[Skis Rossignol|Rossignol]] throughout his entire athletic career. The brand backed him in 2003 when he opened his first Spacejunk art center in [[Grenoble]], France, a place dedicated to exhibiting artists from Board Culture, [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow and Pop Surrealism]].\n\nA specialist in these movements, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Catz opened a second center in 2005 in Bourg-Saint-Maurice - in the Savoie area of France. In 2006 he curated the Art on Foam exhibition, which toured the globe through 2008, inviting twenty-two artists including [[Dave Kinsey]], Lucy McLauchlan, [[Adam Neate]] and Andy Howell.\n\nIn 2007 a third Spacejunk Art Center was born in [[Bayonne]], and in 2009 another in [[Lyon]]. Today Spacejunk exhibits artists from around the world - such as Travis Parr, Will Barras, Jon Fox, Steph COP or Scott Bourne.\n\nSince the beginning of Spacejunk, the art center\u2019s aim is to connect artists and audience, and to make the meeting possible. This aspect of their work has developed even further today with their outreach activities in schools all the way from pre-schools to universities.\n\nIn 2011, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Catz curated the exhibition Les Enfants Terribles, which brought together twelve of the most important artists in the [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] and Pop Surrealist movements from around the world, featuring [[Todd Schorr]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], [[Ray Caesar]], [[Jeff Soto]], Nicolas Thomas, Caia Koopman, [[Victor Castillo]], [[Reg Mombassa]], Od\u00f6, Naoto Hattori, Joe Sorren and [[Robert Crumb]].\n\nIn 2013, he wrote the book \u201cStreet Art Mode d'Emploi\u201d which was published in France. The book was reissued in 2014, at the same time as its English version, \u201cTalk About Street Art\u201d, was released by [[Thames & Hudson]].\n\nIn 2015 an updated version of the book \u201cStreet Art Mode d'Emploi\u201d was released under the title \u201cStreet Art le Guide\u201d, at [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]].\n\nOn October 4, 2014, J\u00e9rome Catz signed the exhibition \u201c#StreetArt\u201d at the Espace Fondation EDF in Paris. Subtitled \"Innovation at the Heart of a Movement\", it explored the use of new technologies by the street artists, and offered a richly documented historical section. A digital catalog was published for the occasion. Among the artists presented were Isaac Cordal, [[Vhils]], C215, Slinkachu, R\u00e9zine, [[Ron English]], [[Zevs (artist)|Zevs]], [[Shepard Fairey]], [[JR (artist)|JR]], Sweza, Truly Design, BenTo, Patrick Suchet and Antonin Fourneau. In five months, the exhibition welcomed 113,228 visitors before being presented from April 24 to August 30 at the EDF Electropolis Museum in Mulhouse.\n\nThis exhibition continued to tour in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]], from September 26 to November 29, 2015 during \u201cRendez-Vous, Festival de la France en Croatia\u201d and as part of the [https://www.artrock.org/ Art Rock festival], from May 10 to 28, 2016 in [[Saint-Brieuc]], France.\n\nIt was also on this occasion that he mounted the exhibition \"Obey to Music, A Visual Tribute to Music by [[Shepard Fairey]]\", at the Mus\u00e9e de Saint-Brieuc with more than 250 original serigraphs by the artist, mainly dating from 1995 to 2012 and presented together for the first time in the world.\n\nIn 2015, he launched the first edition of \u201c[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble_Street_Art_Fest Grenoble Street Art Fest]\u201d, a street art festival held for four weeks in the heart of [[Grenoble]], France. During the second edition the festival took off on the international scene by hosting key artists such as [[Ernest Pignon-Ernest]] (FR), [[Anthony Lister]] (AUS), Augustine Kofie (USA), [[Isaac Cordal]] (Sp), C215, Goin, Will Barras (UK), [[Max Zorn]], Animalitoland, Never Crew, Monkey Bird, Van Hillick Veks, [[Beast (street artist)|Beast]] and many more.\n\nIn 2017 the third edition of \u201cGrenoble Street Art Fest\u201d welcomes international artists such as American How & Nosm, Chinese Daleast, French [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Malland_(Seth)|Seth]], Veks Van Hillick, Monkey Bird, Snek, Goin and many others, the Canadian ZekOne and Ankhone from the collective A'Shop. The first edition of \u201cStreet Art MOVIE Fest\u201d was launched to present cinematographic works and videos dedicated to the discipline of urban arts.\n\nThat same year, he signed the retrospective of the work of the artist [[Shepard Fairey]] for the Department of Herault in [[Montpellier]], France: \u201cObey, the Propaganda Art of Shepard Fairey\u201d in the Pierresvives building designed by [[Zaha Hadid]]. This first retrospective in Europe presented more than 250 works, most of which date from 1996 to 2008.\n\nIn 2018, the fourth edition of the Grenoble Street Art Fest welcomed artists Sainer (Pl), Sebas Velasco (Sp), Pantonio (Ptg), Mademoiselle Maurice (Fr), [[Isaac Cordal]] (Sp), Veks Van Hillik (Fr), Maye & Mommies (Fr), Goin, [[Suiko]] (Jp), Animalitoland (Arg), Cuore (Arg), Lapiz (Ger), Piet Rodriguez (Be), Snek (Fr), Serty31 (Fr), Etien' (Fr), Nesta & Short79 (Fr), Sony (SA), Sampsa and many others among the local street art scene.\n\nIn 2019, the \u201cGrenoble Street Art Fest\u201d changed its name to \u201cStreet Art Fest Grenoble-Alpes\u201d for its 5th edition because, according to J\u00e9rome Catz, \"considering the metropolitan influence of the festival, it seemed important to me to change its name so as not to limit Grenoble to its intramuros\" because from year to year some cities of the agglomeration (Fontaine, Pont-de-Claix and Saint-Martin-d'H\u00e8res) have joined the city of Grenoble to host murals and events. This 5th edition welcomed the star artist [[Shepard Fairey]] (USA), as well as the following artists: Bezt (Pl), Augustine Fofie (USA), Robert Proch (Pl), 1010 (Ger), Dulk1 (Es), Li-Hill (Can), WD (Bali), PichiAvo (Es), Goin, Veks Van Hillik (Fr), Nean (Be), Izzy (Md), [[Beast (street artist)|Beast]] (It), LPVDA (CH), Monk (Be), MC Baldassari (Can), Softtwix (Fr), Juietta XLF (Es), Petite Poissone (Fr), Ekis and Boye (Fr), Imer (Fr), Groek (Fr), Nesta & Short 79 (Fr), Srek & Will ( Fr), Danay (Fr), Snek (Fr), Tawos (Fr).

Much of ''Super Mario RPG''{{'}}s gameplay is outside monster battles and plays like an isometric 3D platformer, in which traditional ''Mario'' elements such as punching floating question blocks from below are prominent. There are no random encounters and as such enemies are visible in the field; a battle ensues only if Mario comes in contact with one. This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles.<ref name=\"ignthomas\" />\n\nThe player controls only [[Mario]] at the journey's beginning. Ultimately, the player gains a party of five characters, though only three members can be used during a battle: Mario is always in the player's party, and the other two characters can be selected before battles. Each of the five characters has a unique set of attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool's abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional [[Time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based battle system]] with the addition of action commands that amplify a move's effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ogasawara |first=Nob |title=Super Mario RPG |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=91 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=47}}</ref> The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, defense, or item usage, which became a mainstay of later ''Mario'' RPGs.<ref name=\"ignthomas\">{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Lucas|title=Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Review|website=IGN|date=September 2, 2008|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/906/906945p1.html|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Characters and setting ===\nThe game world is set in a geographically diverse land, which includes mountains, forests, and bodies of water. Each region has distinct characteristics held by its inhabitants; [[Mushroom Kingdom]] is inhabited by [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]s, Moleville is inhabited by moles, Monstro Town is populated by reformed monsters, Yo'ster Isle is where [[Yoshi]] and his eponymous species reside, and Nimbus Land is an area inhabited by cloud people. [[Bowser (character)#Bowser (character)|Bowser's Castle]] is another prominent location in the game, as it holds the portal to the main antagonist's home world.\n\nAs in most ''Mario'' series games, the main protagonist is Mario, whose initial goal is to rescue [[Princess Peach]] ([[Pseudonym|alias]] Toadstool) from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. However, the story takes on an unusual and very important twist. Soon after the start of his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived. The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy, a robotic blacksmith from an alternate dimension with aspirations of world domination.<ref name=\"Smithy\">''Smithy:'' \"Hurrumph! Better yet...

He reveals that Mallow is not really a tadpole, and says Mallow should join Mario on a quest to find the seven Star Pieces as well as Mallow's real parents.\n\nThe duo travel to Rose Town where they meet a star spirit who has taken control of a silent doll named Geno. After battling the bow-like creature Bowyer, who is immobilizing residents of Rose Town with his arrows, they retrieve another Star Piece. Geno joins Mario and reveals to him the Star Piece is a part of the shattered Star Road, where he normally resides.

There have been calls from all ages, and from young girls, for another character to which they could become attached. Mario was the best, but had not been in an RPG.

Square reported that the game was about 70% complete in October 1995. The developers created the interior elements such as columns, stairways, and exterior elements with advanced computer modeling techniques. Special lighting effects were used to create shadows and reflections that were meant to improve the 3D elements.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scott Pelland|author2=Kent Miller |author3=Terry Munson |author4=Paul Shinoda |date=October 1995|title=Special Features|work=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=Nintendo|issue=77|page=29}}</ref><ref name=\"New Ground\"/> With guidance from Miyamoto, Square developed the game, combining role-playing aspects of previous Square games like ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' with the platforming elements of Nintendo's games. Square's ''Final Fantasy'' series was the model for the battle sequences, while the tradition of ''Super Mario Bros.'' games demanded a lot of action. Mario's ability to jog in eight directions and jump up or down in a three\u2013quarter perspective gave him a (comparatively) large range of motion. At 70% completion, the mix of adventure and action gameplay elements placed it in a category closer to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.<ref name=\"New Ground\"/>\n\nWhen Nintendo of America received a 60% complete version in November, the staff were surprised at the inclusion of an RPG battle system.

It is the first RPG in the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]], the first game in the Mario franchise to allow for gameplay within a 3D environment, and has major elements drawn from Square's RPG franchises along with action-based gameplay reminiscent of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series.\n\n''Super Mario RPG'' was directed by Yoshihiko Maekawa and [[Chihiro Fujioka]] and produced by ''Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. [[Yoko Shimomura]] composed the score, which was released on a [[soundtrack album]] in Japan. The story focuses on [[Mario]] and his party as they seek to eliminate Smithy, who has stolen the seven star pieces of Star Road. The game features turn based combat with a party of up to 3 out of 5 total characters. It was not released in [[PAL region]]s such as Europe.\n\n''Super Mario RPG'' was well-received and particularly praised for its humor and 3D-rendered graphics; it appears on lists of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. It was followed by the ''[[Paper Mario (series)|Paper Mario]]'' and ''[[Mario & Luigi (series)|Mario & Luigi]]'' series, [[spiritual sequel]]s which reuse some gameplay elements. Nintendo published ''Super Mario RPG'' to the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] service in 2008 and the [[Wii U]] Virtual Console service in 2016. It was also re-released with the [[Super NES Classic Edition]] in 2017.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Super Mario RPG battle.png|thumb|left|alt=Horizontal| Mario in a battle against enemy Terrapins in the Bowser's Keep level]]\n\n''Super Mario RPG'' contains token similarities to other Square-developed video games, such as the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, along with a story and gameplay based on the ''Super Mario Bros.'' series of [[platform game]]s.<ref name=\"Fans\">{{Cite journal|author=Scott Pelland|author2=Kent Miller |author3=Terry Munson |author4=Paul Shinoda |date=October 1996|title=Epic Center|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Minoru Arakawa|M.

Much of ''Super Mario RPG''{{'}}s gameplay is outside monster battles and plays like an isometric 3D platformer, in which traditional ''Mario'' elements such as punching floating question blocks from below are prominent. There are no random encounters and as such enemies are visible in the field; a battle ensues only if Mario comes in contact with one. This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles.<ref name=\"ignthomas\" />\n\nThe player controls only [[Mario]] at the journey's beginning. Ultimately, the player gains a party of five characters, though only three members can be used during a battle: Mario is always in the player's party, and the other two characters can be selected before battles. Each of the five characters has a unique set of attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool's abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional [[Time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based battle system]] with the addition of action commands that amplify a move's effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ogasawara |first=Nob |title=Super Mario RPG |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=91 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=47}}</ref> The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, defense, or item usage, which became a mainstay of later ''Mario'' RPGs.<ref name=\"ignthomas\">{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Lucas|title=Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Review|website=IGN|date=September 2, 2008|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/906/906945p1.html|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Characters and setting ===\nThe game world is set in a geographically diverse land, which includes mountains, forests, and bodies of water. Each region has distinct characteristics held by its inhabitants; [[Mushroom Kingdom]] is inhabited by [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]s, Moleville is inhabited by moles, Monstro Town is populated by reformed monsters, Yo'ster Isle is where [[Yoshi]] and his eponymous species reside, and Nimbus Land is an area inhabited by cloud people. [[Bowser (character)#Bowser (character)|Bowser's Castle]] is another prominent location in the game, as it holds the portal to the main antagonist's home world.\n\nAs in most ''Mario'' series games, the main protagonist is Mario, whose initial goal is to rescue [[Princess Peach]] ([[Pseudonym|alias]] Toadstool) from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. However, the story takes on an unusual and very important twist. Soon after the start of his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived.

There have been calls from all ages, and from young girls, for another character to which they could become attached. Mario was the best, but had not been in an RPG.

Square reported that the game was about 70% complete in October 1995. The developers created the interior elements such as columns, stairways, and exterior elements with advanced computer modeling techniques. Special lighting effects were used to create shadows and reflections that were meant to improve the 3D elements.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scott Pelland|author2=Kent Miller |author3=Terry Munson |author4=Paul Shinoda |date=October 1995|title=Special Features|work=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=Nintendo|issue=77|page=29}}</ref><ref name=\"New Ground\"/> With guidance from Miyamoto, Square developed the game, combining role-playing aspects of previous Square games like ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' with the platforming elements of Nintendo's games. Square's ''Final Fantasy'' series was the model for the battle sequences, while the tradition of ''Super Mario Bros.'' games demanded a lot of action. Mario's ability to jog in eight directions and jump up or down in a three\u2013quarter perspective gave him a (comparatively) large range of motion. At 70% completion, the mix of adventure and action gameplay elements placed it in a category closer to ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.<ref name=\"New Ground\"/>\n\nWhen Nintendo of America received a 60% complete version in November, the staff were surprised at the inclusion of an RPG battle system.

Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

Her accolades include four [[Grammy Award]]s, a [[Boston Music Awards|Boston Music Award]], and a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]].\n\nA native of [[Portland, Oregon]], Spalding began playing music professionally in her childhood, performing as a violinist in the Chamber Music Society of Oregon at age five. She was later both self-taught and trained on a number of instruments, including guitar and bass. Her proficiency earned her academic scholarships to [[Portland State University]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]], both of which she attended, studying music.\n\nSpalding released her first album, ''[[Junjo]]'', in 2006 on the Spanish label Avya Musica, after which she signed with the independent American label [[Heads Up International|Heads Up]], who released her 2007 [[Esperanza (Esperanza Spalding album)|self-titled album]]. Her third studio album, ''[[Chamber Music Society]]'' (2010), was a commercial success, charting at number 34 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'', and resulting in Spalding winning her first Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]; Spalding was the first jazz artist to win in this category.<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Floyd |title=Spalding has made history for winning best new artist award|work=[[International Business Times]] |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/112385/20110215/spalding-has-made-history-in-winning-best-new-artist-award.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713001210/http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/112385/20110215/spalding-has-made-history-in-winning-best-new-artist-award.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2011|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> She saw further acclaim for her fourth release, ''[[Radio Music Society]]'' (2012), which earned the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album|Best Jazz Vocal Album]], as well as the track \"City of Roses\" winning for [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals|Best Arrangement, Instrument and Vocals]].\n\nAfter spending the following several years performing as a supporting band player, Spalding released her fifth studio album, a [[funk rock]]-inspired [[concept album]] titled ''[[Emily's D+Evolution]]'', co-produced by [[Tony Visconti]], on [[Concord Records]]. The following year, she released the album ''[[Exposure (Esperanza Spalding album)|Exposure]]'', which was limited to 7,777 copies.

They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]], (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejovi\u0107|1988|p=}}\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.

They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]], (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejovi\u0107|1988|p=}}\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.

The theme tune was by David Pringle, who also wrote opening music for ''[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Fun House (UK game show)|Fun House]]'' and ''[[The Pyramid Game]]''.\n\nTo end the first series, in 1989, the show was presented via satellite from Disneyland, California. Produced by Granada's Field Producer, Brian Thomas, the set was built directly in front of 'Sleeping Beauty Castle', a first for Disney.
