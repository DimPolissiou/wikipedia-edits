It tells about the love between Dongfang Yuechu and Tushan Honghong. Tushan Honghong was the Queen of Tushan. Dongfang Yuechu came from Dongfang family, whose members could use magic kill-spirit fire, Chunzhi Yangyan(\u7eaf\u8d28\u9633\u708e, means pure sun fire). His parents were killed by Huhe Shuangxian(\u864e\u9e64\u53cc\u4ed9, a two-spirits group) so he ran to Tushan and was saved by Tushan Honghong. After that, Tushan was attacked by Jinmian Huoshen(\u91d1\u9762\u706b\u795e, God of fire, real name is Jin Renfeng(\u91d1\u4eba\u51e4)). Jin's Chunzhi Yangyan was so strong that Tushan couldn't fight against him. However, Dongfang Yuechu asked Tushan Honghong to use her hand through his heart and he kissed her immediately. Honghong got strong spirit power from that and finally Jin failed. After the attack. Yuechu used his diluted blood to wash her hands so that she was not afraid of Chunzhi Yangyan. Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival. When Yuechu arrived there, he just saw Honghong walked into an icy cave and sat in front of a dead little Taoist body. Honghong knew he was nearby and said something to him on propose. Then Yuechu knew that she and Rongrong were caught by two Taoists when they were young. But while the elder one sleeping, the little one wanted to save these two fox spirits. Honghong remaineded of something that be told by an elder fox spirit, she just thought the little one would kill her so she uesd her hand through his heart but she understood his real motivation at that moment. The little Taoist told her his thoughts and died soon. Honghong was very guilty and it left a shadow in her heart. She couldn't do what she wanted even couldn't love others. Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it's a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of balck fox spirit showed up. Honghong finally realized his real idea and was moved. Yuechu left Tushan 50 years ago just wanted to achieve her dream, a dream about the peace between humans and spirits. Until this moment, Honghong expressed her love to Yuechu and Yuechu got his magic item, Xukong Zhilei(\u865a\u7a7a\u4e4b\u6cea, means the tears of void) because of his guilt. The Queen really wanted to get it, she seriously hurt Yuechu. But the magic item had been become Yuechu and Honghong's magic item of love continuation in their heart. The Queen couldn't kill them if she wanted the complete item. Honghong started the love continuation , making a wish that meet each other in next life. Dongfang Yuechu was dead and Tushan Honghong lost her spirit power and memory, become Tushan Susu.\n\nIn Tushan Theater, people knew what happened 500 years ago in Bai Yuechu's reincarnation and Tushan Susu. But Tushan was attacked by black fox spirits, Beishan Yaodi(real name is Shi Kuan(\u77f3\u5bbd)) and Tushan Meimei(\u6d82\u5c71\u7f8e\u7f8e, a member of black fox spirits). Tushan Susu became Honghong temporarily but was controlled by Meimei. To save her, Bai and Rongrong came into her dream and finally saw Honghong and Dongfang Yuechu's soul. Susu became back. With the help of Bai and Susu's help, Shi Kuan was back to normal and accepted a girl whose reincarnation was the Princess of Yuyao Guo(\u5fa1\u5996\u56fd) and Shi was her lover in their former life.\n\nAll of spirits in Tushan and people in Yiqi Taoist League wanted Tushan Honghong could really be back, so Tushan Yaya asked Bai to marry Susu. At the wedding ceremony. Bai sightly asked Susu whether she wanted to be a real excellent matchmaker or not. Susu was exhuasted but finally she expressed her real idea that she didn't want to marry, she just wanted to be an excellent matchmaker. Bai kissed her and she bacame Honghong flying away. Yaya wanted to catch her but Bai said if she did that he would die again. \"If you don't force us to marry right now, I can promise you, I will bring her back, and as she becomes the best matchmaker, I'll woo her, and make her truly fall in love with me.\"\n\n== Anime ==\nThe Japanese version was broadcast in [[Tokyo MX]] between 2017-7-1 and 2017-12-16.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://enmusuyouko.com/news-01/|title=\u7e01\u7d50\u3073\u306e\u5996\u72d0\u3061\u3083\u3093-2017\u5e747\u67081\u65e5\u30aa\u30f3\u30a8\u30a2\u958b\u59cb\uff01\uff01 {{!}} \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 \u300c\u7e01\u7d50\u3073\u306e\u5996\u72d0\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300d \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|language=ja|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nSince Zhuye Chapter, the broadcasting rights only belongs to Tencent Video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnKiAqD|title=\u56fd\u6f2b\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300b\"\u7af9\u4e1a\u7bc7\"\u817e\u8baf\u72ec\u5bb6\u5f00\u64ad|website=ent.huanqiu.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Mobile Game ==\nThe game was operated by [[Tencent Game]] Aurora Studios and tested publicly in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.9game.cn/hyxhn/3907653.html|title=\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300b\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u516c\u6d4b \u5168\u5e73\u53f0\u516c\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u516c\u5e03_\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u624b\u6e38_\u4e5d\u6e38\u624b\u673a\u6e38\u620f|website=www.9game.cn|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> It uses [[Unity3D]] as its engine and game type is [[MMORPG]] with traditional Chinese style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/news/510964|title=\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u624b\u6e38\uff1a\u56fd\u6f2b\u98ce\u683c\u7684RPG\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\u8d85\u5f3a\uff01 - \u4e91+\u793e\u533a - \u817e\u8baf\u4e91|website=cloud.tencent.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nWhen Fox Spirit Matchmaker was appeared, it has had a lot of impact, there have high clicks on many major platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/322224170_565158|title=\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u64ad\u653e\u91cf\u7a81\u783450\u4ebf\uff0c\u9605\u6587\u52a8\u753b\u70b9\u51fb\u91cf\u7834\u767e\u4ebf\uff0c\u56fd\u6f2bIP\u664b\u7ea7\u4e0b\u4e00\u7ad9\uff1aIP\u884d\u751f\u6388\u6743\u5e02\u573a_\u4e2d\u56fd|website=www.sohu.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> To enrich Chinese culture industry and improve cultural travel level, Tencent has carried out many multi-faceted cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://k.sina.cn/article_6216747334_1728c094601900j6oe.html|title=\u5e03\u5c40\u5168\u56fd\u3001\u64ac\u52a8\u5168\u7f51\uff0c\u300a\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\u300bIP\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5230\u5e95\u6709\u591a\u5f3a\uff1f|last=sina_mobile|date=2019-05-17|website=k.sina.cn|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, Hangzhou Animation Bus officially joined hands with Tencent Animation to launch No.51 \"pure love bus\".

There are black spots on the head, and the ears are black. Partly fused or broken-up stripes run from the corner of the eyes over the cheek, from the corner of the mouth to the neck, and along the nape to the shoulders. Elongated blotches continue down the spine and form a single median stripe on the loins. Two large blotches of dark dusky-grey hair on the side of the shoulders are each emphasized posteriorly by a dark stripe, which passes on to the foreleg and breaks up into irregular spots. The flanks are marked by dark dusky-grey irregular blotches bordered behind by long, oblique, irregularly curved or looped stripes. These blotches yielding the clouded pattern suggest the English name of the cat. The underparts and legs are spotted, and the tail is marked by large, irregular, paired spots. Its legs are short and stout, and paws broad.

[[Mating]] usually occurs between December and March. Males tend to be very aggressive during sexual encounters and to bite the female on the neck during courtship, severing her vertebrae. With this in mind, male and female compatibility has been deemed extremely important when attempting breeding in captivity. The pair mates multiple times over the course of several days. The male grasps the female by the neck, and the female responds with vocalization that encourages the male to continue. The male then leaves and is not involved in raising the kittens.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Estrus]] lasts six days on average, [[estrous cycle]] averages 30 days.

Experience has taught keepers that introducing pairs of clouded leopards at a young age gives opportunities for the pair to bond and breed successfully. Males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females. Facilities breeding clouded leopards need to provide the female with a secluded, off-exhibit area.<ref name=clssp/>\n\nIn March 2011, two breeding females at the [[Nashville Zoo at Grassmere]] in Nashville, Tennessee, gave birth to three cubs, which were raised by zookeepers.

There are black spots on the head, and the ears are black. Partly fused or broken-up stripes run from the corner of the eyes over the cheek, from the corner of the mouth to the neck, and along the nape to the shoulders. Elongated blotches continue down the spine and form a single median stripe on the loins. Two large blotches of dark dusky-grey hair on the side of the shoulders are each emphasized posteriorly by a dark stripe, which passes on to the foreleg and breaks up into irregular spots. The flanks are marked by dark dusky-grey irregular blotches bordered behind by long, oblique, irregularly curved or looped stripes. These blotches yielding the clouded pattern suggest the English name of the cat. The underparts and legs are spotted, and the tail is marked by large, irregular, paired spots.

[[Mating]] usually occurs between December and March. Males tend to be very aggressive during sexual encounters and to bite the female on the neck during courtship, severing her vertebrae. With this in mind, male and female compatibility has been deemed extremely important when attempting breeding in captivity. The pair mates multiple times over the course of several days. The male grasps the female by the neck, and the female responds with vocalization that encourages the male to continue. The male then leaves and is not involved in raising the kittens.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Estrus]] lasts six days on average, [[estrous cycle]] averages 30 days. After a [[gestation]] period of 93 \u00b1 6 days, females give birth to a litter of one to five, mostly three cubs.<ref name=Nowell1996/>\n\nInitially, the young are blind and helpless, much like the young of many other cats, and weigh from {{convert|140|to|280|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Unlike adults, the kittens' spots are \"solid\" \u2014 completely dark rather than dark rings. The young can see within about 10 days of birth, are active within five weeks, and are fully weaned at around three months of age.

New perspectives}}</ref> The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.\n\nEuropean Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each \"neo\"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765\u20131830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The \"Rococo\" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, \"corrected\" and \"restored\" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.\n\nThe [[Empire style]], a second phase of Neoclassicism in architecture and the [[decorative arts]], had its cultural centre in Paris in the [[Napoleonic era]].\n\n==History==\nNeoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,<ref name=Irwin>{{cite book| title=Neoclassicism A&I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher=Phaidon Press| year=1997| pages=| isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/neoclassicism0000irwi}}</ref> which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.<ref>Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21</ref> While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], demonstrates this especially well.<ref>A recurring theme in Clark: 19-23, 58-62, 69, 97-98 (on Ingres); Honour, 187-190; Novotny, 86-87</ref> The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.<ref name=Lingo>{{cite book |title = Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy and the Greek ideal| last=Lingo| first=Estelle Cecile| publisher = Yale University Press; First Edition|year = 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wlq67ikF0OEC&pg=PA161&dq=Winckelmann+Neoclassicism&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zGxFT-GiPMHWiAKY_dypDg&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Winckelmann%20Neoclassicism&f=false 161]| isbn=978-0-300-12483-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title = Classical Savannah: fine & decorative arts, 1800-1840| last=Talbott | first=Page| publisher = University of Georgia Press |year = 1995| pages = 6| isbn=978-0-8203-1793-9 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], often called \"the father of archaeology\"<ref>{{cite book |title = Culture and values: a survey of the humanities| last=Cunningham, Reich| first= Lawrence S., John J. | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition|year = 2009| pages = 104 | isbn=978-0-495-56877-3}}</ref>]]\n\nThe writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' (\"History of Ancient Art\", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\",<ref>Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted</ref> and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find \"not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone\". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: \"The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients\".<ref>Both quotes from the first pages of \"Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture\"</ref>\n\nWith the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}</ref> \"Neoclassicism\" in each art implies a particular canon of a \"classical\" model.\n\nIn English, the term \"Neoclassicism\" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and \"Neoclassicism\" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.<ref>Honour, 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Anton Raphael Mengs - Das Urteil des Paris (ca. 1757).jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''; circa 1757; oil on canvas; height: 226 cm, width: 295 cm, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio; [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nThe term \"Neoclassical\" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as \"the true style\", \"reformed\" and \"revival\"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.<ref>Honour, 11, 23-25</ref> [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.\n\nNeoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.<ref>Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21</ref>\n\nAs for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much \"Neoclassical\" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally being on the winning side.<ref>Honour, 43-62</ref>\n\n==Painting and printmaking==\n{{see also|Capriccio (art)}}\n[[File:View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus MET DP837542.jpg|thumb|''View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus''; by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]; 1760\u20131778; [[etching]]; size of the entire sheet: 53.8 x 79.2 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\n\nIt is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as \"insipid\" and \"almost entirely uninteresting to us\"\u2014some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],<ref>Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)</ref> by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as \"the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times\".<ref>Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)</ref> The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium<ref>Honour, 113-114</ref>) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once \"fired the artistic youth of Europe\" but are now \"neglected\",<ref>Honour, 14</ref> while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having \"an unctuous softness and tediousness\" by [[Fritz Novotny]].<ref>Novotny, 62</ref>  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. \n[[File:Jacques-Louis David, Le Serment des Horaces.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]''; by [[Jacques-Louis David]]; 1784; oil on canvas; height: 330 cm, width: 425 cm; [[Louvre]]]]\n\nThe work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\".<ref>Novotny, 51-54</ref> Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' (\"Imaginary Prisons\") whose \"oppressive cyclopean architecture\" conveys \"dreams of fear and frustration\".<ref>Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57</ref> The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the \"Gothic\" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.\n\nNeoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].<ref>Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22</ref>\n\nDavid's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.<ref>Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGiovanni Pauolo Panini - Fantasy View with the Pantheon and other Monuments of Ancient Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|''Fantasy view with the Pantheon and other monuments of Ancient Rome'', an example of a [[capriccio (art)|capriccio]]; 1737; oil on canvas; 98.9 x 137.49&nbsp;cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Houston, Texas|Huston]], US)\n\nLarge sculpture gallery built on arches and lit from above . . .

His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.<ref>Novotny, 378\u2013379</ref><ref>Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.<ref>Novotny, 379-384</ref> All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.\n\nAn early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].<ref>Novotny, 384-385</ref> [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,<ref>Novotny, 388-389</ref> with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive \"character heads\" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.<ref>Novotny, 390-392</ref> Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.\n\nSince prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,<ref>Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11</ref> the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Harriet Hosmer]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPoetry and Music by Claude Michel, called Clodion, c. 1774-1778, marble - National Gallery of Art, Washington - DSC08957.JPG|''Poetry and Music''; by [[Claude Michel]], called Clodion; circa 1774\u20131778; marble; [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]])\n\nCupid and Psyche MET DP248228.jpg|''Cupid and Psyche''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1794; plaster; overall: 134.6 \u00d7 151.1 \u00d7 81.3&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArtemisia in Mourning MET DP236931.jpg|''Artemisia in mourning''; by Philipp Jakob Scheffauer; 1794; marble; height: 50.2&nbsp;cm, width: 30&nbsp;cm, depth: 5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCanova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|''Hebe'' by Antonio Canova; 1800\u20131805; marble; height: 158&nbsp;cm; in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)\n\nPerseus with the Head of Medusa MET DP249451.jpg|[[Perseus]] with the head of [[Medusa]]; by Antonio Canova; 1804\u20131806; marble; height: 242.6&nbsp;cm, width: 191.8&nbsp;cm, depth: 102.9&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nPaolina Borghese (Canova).jpg|''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1805\u20131808; marble; [[Galleria Borghese]] (Rome)\n\nFilatrice MET DT6964.jpg|''Filatrice''; by [[Henry Kirke Brown]]; 1850; bronze; 50.8 x 30.5 x 20.3&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nFile:Emotions X.jpg|One of the \"character heads\" of [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] \n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture and the decorative arts==\n{{Main|Neoclassical architecture}}\n[[File:Syon House, Long Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Adam style]], interior of [[Syon House]] in London, designed by [[Robert Adam]] in 1760s]]\n[[File:Etrurisches Zimmer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|\"The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] room\", from [[Potsdam]] (Germany), illustration by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Klose]] in circa 1840]]\n\nNeoclassical art was traditional and new, historical and modern, conservative and progressive all at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alisson Lee|title=Historical dictionary of neoclassical art and architecture.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nNeoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden, Poland and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.\n\nA second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the \"Louis XVI style\", and the second in the styles called \"Directoire\" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built \"[[United States Capitol|capitol]]\" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and \"black basaltes\" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.\n\nIndoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,<ref name=\"Gontar\">Gontar</ref> with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichit\u00e0 di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most \"Roman\" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary.\n\nTechniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Cama\u00efeu|en cama\u00efeu]]'' (\"like cameos\"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of \"Pompeiian red\" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Go\u00fbt grec]]'' (\"Greek style\"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the \"Louis XVI\" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: \"Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another\".<ref>Honour, 110\u2013111, 110 quoted</ref>\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison - Appartement de Jos\u00e9phine 003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,<ref name=\"Gontar\"/> the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] \"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\".<ref>Honour, 171\u2013184, 171 quoted</ref> An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and \"Louis Seize\", or Louis XVI, in France.\n\nNeoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond\u2014a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s \u2014, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.\n\nGothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, \"romantic\" appearance.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCup and cover, made by Louisa Courtauld and George Cowles (1771-72).jpg|Cup with cover; by [[Louisa Courtauld]] and [[George Cowles (silversmith)|George Cowles]]; 1771\u20131772; silver; height: 38.1&nbsp;cm\n\nGiovanni Ottaviani - Plate IX from Loggie di Rafaele nel Vaticano - Google Art Project.jpg|Plate with various ornaments and patterns; 1772\u20131777; brush and watercolor and gouache over etching on white wove paper; [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] (New York City)\n\nRobert and James Adam.

Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette R\u00e9camier]], [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], [[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: \"''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''\" (\"One could not be more sumptuously undressed\"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.<ref>Hunt, 244</ref> Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.\n\nVery light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated\u2014for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.<ref>Hunt, 244-245</ref>  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.\n\nNeoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. Even when David designed a new French \"national costume\" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.\n\nThe trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.\n\nClassically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French \"\u00e0 la Titus\" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,<ref>Hunt, 243</ref> and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''\u00e0 la Titus''.<ref>Rifelj, 35</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Hamilton Palmyra.JPG|''[[James Dawkins (1722-1757)|James Dawkins]] and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'', by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1758)\nFile:Jacques-Louis David Henriette de Verninac 1799.jpg|''[[Madame Raymond de Verninac]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], with clothes and chair in [[Directoire style]]. \"Year 7\": that is, 1798\u201399.\nFile:Jacques-Louis David 016.jpg|''[[Portrait of Madame R\u00e9camier]]'', David, 1800\nFile:Elizabeth Alexeevna with mirror by J.L.Mosnier (1802, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|[[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Elizabeth Alexeievna]], Empress of Russia and no political radical, in 1802\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Later \"Neoclassicisms\"==\n[[File:NatGal.jpg|thumb|The West building (1941) of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, with the East Building (1978) and the [[United States Capitol]] visible behind and to the left]]\n{{Classicism}}\nIn American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890\u20131917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.\n\nConservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as \"reactionary\", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked \"progressive\". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann|\u00c9.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis S\u00fce|S\u00fce]] & [[Andr\u00e9 Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].\n\nThere was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th-century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)\n\nThis literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.\n\n===In music===\n[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music|Classical]] and [[baroque music|Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music|Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed \"classical\" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]].\n\nThe 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino|Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound to which the Neoclassicists aspired. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.\n\n=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]\nIn 1905\u20131914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]\n\nWith the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.\n\nNeoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including \"exported\" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.\n\n===Architecture in the 21st century===\n{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}\n[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]\n\nAfter a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.\n\nAs of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html|title=Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism}}</ref> Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.\n\nFor sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].<ref>[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] \u2013 ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014</ref>\n\nIn the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.\n\nIn Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[American Empire (style)]]\n*[[Antiquization]]\n*[[Nazi architecture]]\n*[[Neoclassical architecture]]\n*[[Neoclassicism in France]]\n*[[Neo-Grec]], the late Greek-Revival style\n*[[1795\u20131820 in Western fashion]]\n*[[Skopje 2014]]\n*[[Stalinist architecture]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''The Romantic Rebellion: Romantic versus Classic Art'', 1976, Omega. {{ISBN|0-86007-718-7}}.\n* [[Hugh Honour|Honour, Hugh]], ''Neo-classicism.

New perspectives}}</ref> The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.\n\nEuropean Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each \"neo\"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765\u20131830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The \"Rococo\" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, \"corrected\" and \"restored\" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.\n\nThe [[Empire style]], a second phase of Neoclassicism in architecture and the [[decorative arts]], had its cultural centre in Paris in the [[Napoleonic era]].\n\n==History==\nNeoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,<ref name=Irwin>{{cite book| title=Neoclassicism A&I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher=Phaidon Press| year=1997| pages=| isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/neoclassicism0000irwi}}</ref> which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.<ref>Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21</ref> While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered.

His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' (\"History of Ancient Art\", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\",<ref>Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted</ref> and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find \"not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone\". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: \"The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients\".<ref>Both quotes from the first pages of \"Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture\"</ref>\n\nWith the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}</ref> \"Neoclassicism\" in each art implies a particular canon of a \"classical\" model.\n\nIn English, the term \"Neoclassicism\" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and \"Neoclassicism\" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.<ref>Honour, 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Anton Raphael Mengs - Das Urteil des Paris (ca. 1757).jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''; circa 1757; oil on canvas; height: 226 cm, width: 295 cm, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio; [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nThe term \"Neoclassical\" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as \"the true style\", \"reformed\" and \"revival\"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.<ref>Honour, 11, 23-25</ref> [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.\n\nNeoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.<ref>Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21</ref>\n\nAs for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much \"Neoclassical\" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally being on the winning side.<ref>Honour, 43-62</ref>\n\n==Painting and printmaking==\n{{see also|Capriccio (art)}}\n[[File:View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus MET DP837542.jpg|thumb|''View of the so-called Temple of Concord with the Temple of Saturn, on the right the Arch of Septimius Severus''; by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]; 1760\u20131778; [[etching]]; size of the entire sheet: 53.8 x 79.2 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\n\nIt is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as \"insipid\" and \"almost entirely uninteresting to us\"\u2014some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],<ref>Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)</ref> by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as \"the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times\".<ref>Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)</ref> The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium<ref>Honour, 113-114</ref>) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once \"fired the artistic youth of Europe\" but are now \"neglected\",<ref>Honour, 14</ref> while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having \"an unctuous softness and tediousness\" by [[Fritz Novotny]].<ref>Novotny, 62</ref>  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. \n[[File:Jacques-Louis David, Le Serment des Horaces.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]''; by [[Jacques-Louis David]]; 1784; oil on canvas; height: 330 cm, width: 425 cm; [[Louvre]]]]\n\nThe work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\".<ref>Novotny, 51-54</ref> Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' (\"Imaginary Prisons\") whose \"oppressive cyclopean architecture\" conveys \"dreams of fear and frustration\".<ref>Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57</ref> The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the \"Gothic\" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.\n\nNeoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].<ref>Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22</ref>\n\nDavid's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.<ref>Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nGiovanni Pauolo Panini - Fantasy View with the Pantheon and other Monuments of Ancient Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|''Fantasy view with the Pantheon and other monuments of Ancient Rome'', an example of a [[capriccio (art)|capriccio]]; 1737; oil on canvas; 98.9 x 137.49 cm; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Houston, Texas|Huston]], US)\n\n\nLarge sculpture gallery built on arches and lit from above . . .

His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.<ref>Novotny, 378\u2013379</ref><ref>Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.<ref>Novotny, 379-384</ref> All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.\n\nAn early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].<ref>Novotny, 384-385</ref> [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,<ref>Novotny, 388-389</ref> with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive \"character heads\" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.<ref>Novotny, 390-392</ref> Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.\n\nSince prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,<ref>Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11</ref> the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Harriet Hosmer]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPoetry and Music by Claude Michel, called Clodion, c. 1774-1778, marble - National Gallery of Art, Washington - DSC08957.JPG|''Poetry and Music''; by [[Claude Michel]], called Clodion; circa 1774-1778; marble; [[National Gallery of Art]] ([[Washington, D.C.]])\n\nCupid and Psyche MET DP248228.jpg|''Cupid and Psyche''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1794; plaster; overall: 134.6 \u00d7 151.1 \u00d7 81.3 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArtemisia in Mourning MET DP236931.jpg|''Artemisia in mourning''; by Philipp Jakob Scheffauer; 1794; marble; height: 50.2 cm, width: 30 cm, depth: 5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCanova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|''Hebe'' by Antonio Canova; 1800-1805; marble; height: 158 cm; in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)\n\nPerseus with the Head of Medusa MET DP249451.jpg|[[Perseus]] with the head of [[Medusa]]; by Antonio Canova; 1804-1806; marble; height: 242.6 cm, width: 191.8 cm, depth: 102.9 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nPaolina Borghese (Canova).jpg|''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]''; by [[Antonio Canova]]; 1805-1808; marble; [[Galleria Borghese]] (Rome)\n\nFilatrice MET DT6964.jpg|''Filatrice''; by [[Henry Kirke Brown]]; 1850; bronze; 50.8 x 30.5 x 20.3 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nFile:Emotions X.jpg|One of the \"character heads\" of [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] \n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture and the decorative arts==\n{{Main|Neoclassical architecture}}\n[[File:Syon House, Long Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Adam style]], interior of [[Syon House]] in London, designed by [[Robert Adam]] in 1760s]]\n[[File:Etrurisches Zimmer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|\"The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] room\", from [[Potsdam]] (Germany), illustration by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Klose]] in circa 1840]]\n\nNeoclassical art was traditional and new, historical and modern, conservative and progressive all at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Palmer|first=Alisson Lee|title=Historical dictionary of neoclassical art and architecture.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nNeoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden, Poland and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.\n\nA second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the \"Louis XVI style\", and the second in the styles called \"Directoire\" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built \"[[United States Capitol|capitol]]\" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and \"black basaltes\" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.\n\nIndoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,<ref name=\"Gontar\">Gontar</ref> with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichit\u00e0 di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most \"Roman\" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. \n\nTechniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Cama\u00efeu|en cama\u00efeu]]'' (\"like cameos\"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of \"Pompeiian red\" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Go\u00fbt grec]]'' (\"Greek style\"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the \"Louis XVI\" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: \"Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another\".<ref>Honour, 110\u2013111, 110 quoted</ref>\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison - Appartement de Jos\u00e9phine 003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,<ref name=\"Gontar\"/> the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] \"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\".<ref>Honour, 171\u2013184, 171 quoted</ref> An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and \"Louis Seize\", or Louis XVI, in France.\n\nNeoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond\u2014a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s \u2014, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.\n\nGothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, \"romantic\" appearance.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCup and cover, made by Louisa Courtauld and George Cowles (1771-72).jpg|Cup with cover; by [[Louisa Courtauld]] and [[George Cowles (silversmith)|George Cowles]]; 1771-1772; silver; height: 38.1 cm\n\nGiovanni Ottaviani - Plate IX from Loggie di Rafaele nel Vaticano - Google Art Project.jpg|Plate with various ornaments and patterns; 1772\u20131777; brush and watercolor and gouache over etching on white wove paper; [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] (New York City)\n\nRobert and James Adam.

Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette R\u00e9camier]], [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], [[Th\u00e9r\u00e9sa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: \"''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''\" (\"One could not be more sumptuously undressed\"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.<ref>Hunt, 244</ref> Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.\n\nVery light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated\u2014for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.<ref>Hunt, 244-245</ref>  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.\n\nNeoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. Even when David designed a new French \"national costume\" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.\n\nThe trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.\n\nClassically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French \"\u00e0 la Titus\" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,<ref>Hunt, 243</ref> and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''\u00e0 la Titus''.<ref>Rifelj, 35</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFile:Hamilton Palmyra.JPG|''[[James Dawkins (1722-1757)|James Dawkins]] and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'', by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1758)\nFile:Jacques-Louis David Henriette de Verninac 1799.jpg|''[[Madame Raymond de Verninac]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], with clothes and chair in [[Directoire style]]. \"Year 7\": that is, 1798\u201399.\nFile:Jacques-Louis David 016.jpg|''[[Portrait of Madame R\u00e9camier]]'', David, 1800\nFile:Elizabeth Alexeevna with mirror by J.L.Mosnier (1802, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|[[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Elizabeth Alexeievna]], Empress of Russia and no political radical, in 1802\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Later \"Neoclassicisms\"==\n[[File:NatGal.jpg|thumb|The West building (1941) of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, with the East Building (1978) and the [[United States Capitol]] visible behind and to the left]]\n{{Classicism}}\nIn American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890\u20131917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.\n\nConservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as \"reactionary\", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked \"progressive\". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann|\u00c9.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis S\u00fce|S\u00fce]] & [[Andr\u00e9 Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].\n\nThere was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th-century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)\n\nThis literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.\n\n===In music===\n[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music | Classical]] and [[baroque music | Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music | Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed \"classical\" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]]. \n\nThe 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino | Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound to which the Neoclassicists aspired. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.\n\n=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]\nIn 1905\u20131914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]\n\nWith the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.\n\nNeoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including \"exported\" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.\n\n===Architecture in the 21st century===\n{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}\n[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]\n\nAfter a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.\n\nAs of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html|title=Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism}}</ref> Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.\n\nFor sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].<ref>[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] \u2013 ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014</ref>\n\nIn the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.\n\nIn Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Adam style]]\n*[[American Empire (style)|American Empire style]]\n*[[Antiquization]]\n*[[Empire (style)|Empire style]]\n*[[Federal architecture]]\n*[[Nazi architecture]]\n*[[1795\u20131820 in Western fashion|Neoclassical-influenced fashions]]\n*[[Neoclassicism in France]]\n*[[Neo-Grec]], the late Greek-Revival style\n*[[New Classical Architecture]]\n*[[Skopje 2014]]\n*[[Stalinist architecture]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''The Romantic Rebellion: Romantic versus Classic Art'', 1976, Omega. {{ISBN|0-86007-718-7}}.\n* [[Hugh Honour|Honour, Hugh]], ''Neo-classicism.

{"title_page": "Immanent critique", "text_new": "'''Immanent critique''' is a method of discussing culture which aims to locate contradictions in society's rules and systems. This method is used in the study of cultural forms in philosophy and the social sciences and humanities. It may be contrasted with \"transcendental\" [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]]  [[critical philosophy]]. Immanent critique further aims to contextualize not only the object of its investigation, but also the [[ideology|ideological]] basis of that object: both the object and the category to which it belongs are shown to be products of a historical process. Immanent critique has its roots in the dialectic of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and the criticisms by [[Karl Marx]]. Today it is strongly associated with the [[critical theory|critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] as well as literary theorists such as [[Fredric Jameson]] who, in his seminal work ''[[The Political Unconscious]]'', explored the idea of an immanent analysis of texts to argue the primacy of political interpretation. [[Roy Bhaskar]] has advocated it as one of the key methodological elements of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]].<ref>Bhaskar, R. (2008) [1975], ''A Realist Theory of Science'' (Routledge 'With a new introduction' edition), Abingdon: Routledge.</ref>\n\nThe purpose of immanent critique is the detection of societal contradictions which suggest possibilities for emancipatory social change. It considers ideas\u2019 role in shaping society, with focus on future emancipatory change. An immanent critique of a value is a discussion of the principles (overt or implicit) the value proposes. It highlights the gaps between what something stands for and what is being done in actual terms. Immanent critique tries to find contradictions and indirectly provide alternatives, without constructing an entirely new theory.\n\nQuoting Marx, Robert J. Antonio writes in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'',\n:\"'Setting out from [[idealism]] ... I hit upon seeking the Idea in the real itself. If formerly the gods had dwelt above the world, they had now become its center.' Marx concluded that immanent principles were necessary weapons in the struggle for progressive social change, because they provide a basis for critique ''within'' historical reality. Later, this immanent grounding became the axis of his emancipatory critique of [[capitalism]].\"<ref>\"Immanent critique as the core of critical theory.\" ''British Journal of Sociology'' Vol. 32, No. 3, p. 333 (1981)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Harvey]], [[Distinguished professor]] of [[Anthropology|anthropology]] and [[Geography|geography]] at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY]],\n\n:\"Critical theory at its most abstract and general level ... begins as a formal 'negativity.'

This method is used in the study of cultural forms in philosophy and the social sciences and humanities. It may be contrasted with \"transcendental\" [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]]  [[critical philosophy]]. Immanent critique further aims to contextualize not only the object of its investigation, but also the [[ideology|ideological]] basis of that object: both the object and the category to which it belongs are shown to be products of a historical process. Immanent critique has its roots in the dialectic of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and the criticisms by [[Karl Marx]]. Today it is strongly associated with the [[critical theory|critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] as well as literary theorists such as [[Fredric Jameson]] who, in his seminal work [[''The Political Unconscious'']], explored the idea of an immanent analysis of texts to argue the primacy of political interpretation. [[Roy Bhaskar]] has advocated it as one of the key methodological elements of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]].<ref>Bhaskar, R.

It considers ideas\u2019 role in shaping society, with focus on future emancipatory change. An immanent critique of a value is a discussion of the principles (overt or implicit) the value proposes. It highlights the gaps between what something stands for and what is being done in actual terms. Immanent critique tries to find contradictions and indirectly provide alternatives, without constructing an entirely new theory.\n\nQuoting Marx, Robert J. Antonio writes in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'',\n:\"'Setting out from [[idealism]] ... I hit upon seeking the Idea in the real itself. If formerly the gods had dwelt above the world, they had now become its center.' Marx concluded that immanent principles were necessary weapons in the struggle for progressive social change, because they provide a basis for critique ''within'' historical reality. Later, this immanent grounding became the axis of his emancipatory critique of [[capitalism]].\"<ref>\"Immanent critique as the core of critical theory.\" ''British Journal of Sociology'' Vol. 32, No. 3, p. 333 (1981)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Harvey]], [[Distinguished professor]] of [[Anthropology|anthropology]] and [[Geography|geography]] at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY]],\n\n:\"Critical theory at its most abstract and general level ... begins as a formal 'negativity.'
