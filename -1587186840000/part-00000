Males and females at Mas\u0142om\u0119cz were found to be more closely related to each other than those at Kowalewko. They also carried fewer samples of U5b, and displayed fewer strong genetic links to the steppe populations than earlier Wielbark samples from Kowalewko.

The genetic makeup of these individuals differed significantly from that of previous populations of the area, being distinguished by showing a higher amount of ancestry from western and northern Europe.

In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths.

These Goths would form the  [[Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]].

Under the second Khalji ruler, [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala-ud-din Khalji]], the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the [[Narmada River]] in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] (1325\u20131351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra]] in central India.

The network consists of eleven lines with a total length of {{convert|311|km|mi|abbr=off}} with 214 stations, which are a mix of underground, at-grade and elevated stations. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains.

Delhi Metro is the world's tenth-largest metro system in terms of length. Delhi Metro was India's second modern public transportation system, which has revolutionised travel by providing a fast, reliable, safe, and comfortable means of transport. The network consists of eleven lines with a total length of {{convert|311|km|mi|abbr=off}} with 214 stations, which are a mix of underground, at-grade and elevated stations. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at Metro stations to further encourage the use of the system. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.\nIt has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi\u2013ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi\u2013ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge.

Besides construction and operation of Delhi Metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail, and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad. The Delhi Metro project was spearheaded by [[Padma Vibhushan]] [[E. Sreedharan]], the Managing Director of DMRC and popularly known as the \"Metro Man\" of India.

The team, along with [[Bengaluru FC|Bengaluru]], entered the [[Indian Super League]] as two new expansion teams. They played their first competitive match on 18 November 2017 while playing their last match of the season on 12 April 2018. The club ended their first Indian Super League campaign in fifth place, thus missing out on the chance to participate in the finals. Jamshedpur also participated in the [[Super Cup (India)|Super Cup]], being eliminated by [[FC Goa|Goa]] in the quarter-finals.\n\nJamshedpur signed former [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager, [[Steve Coppell]], as their first head coach in July. Coppell was in charge of fellow Super League side [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] the [[2016 Indian Super League season|previous season]], leading the side to the [[2016 Indian Super League Final|final]]. India international [[Anas Edathodika]] became Jamshedpur's first player when he was drafted by the club during the [[2017\u201318 ISL Players Draft|players draft]]. Spanish defender [[Tiri (footballer)|Tiri]] was soon signed as the club's first foreign player. Other players recruited included those with previous ISL experience such as [[Sameehg Doutie]], [[Memo (footballer)|Memo]], [[Kervens Belfort]], [[Andr\u00e9 Bikey]], and [[Matheus Gon\u00e7alves]].\n\nThe season started for Jamshedpur with three consecutive draws before earning their first victory away at [[Delhi Dynamos FC|Delhi Dynamos]]. The first half of the season saw Jamshedpur six points off fourth place. During the second half of the season Jamshedpur managed to gain five victories. However a draw and three defeats, including the loss against Goa during their last league stage match, meant that the club would miss out on qualification for the finals. During the Super Cup, Jamshedpur defeated the [[2017\u201318 I-League|I-League]] champions [[Minerva Punjab F.C.|Minerva Punjab]] in the first round before being defeated by [[FC Goa|Goa]] in the quarter-finals.\n\nDuring their inaugural season, every player in the squad played at least one match, whether as a starter or substitute, while as a whole, the club scored 16 goals. Jamshedpur also managed to earn eight clean sheets, with seven of them being won by their number one goalkeeper, [[Subrata Pal]]. [[Matheus Gon\u00e7alves]] ended the campaign as Jamshedpur's top scorer with four goals, all scored in the Indian Super League.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Indian Super League}}\n\nOn 11 May 2017, it was announced by the Indian Super League organizers, [[Football Sports Development]], that they would be inviting bids for new teams to join the league for the upcoming season.<ref name=\"TOI Expansion\">{{cite news|title=Indian Super League to invite bids for new teams|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/indian-super-league-to-invite-bids-for-new-teams/articleshow/58629483.cms|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=Times of India|date=11 May 2017}}</ref> On 12 June, it was officially announced that [[Bengaluru FC]] (for [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]]) and [[Tata Group]] (for [[Jamshedpur]]) had won the bids for the new teams.<ref>{{cite news|title=ISL expanded to 10 teams, Bengaluru FC one of them|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-expanded-to-10-teams-bengaluru-fc-one-of-them/articleshow/59113316.cms|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=Times of India|date=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the expansion bid to enter the [[Indian Super League]], on 14 July 2017, Tata announced that the inaugural head coach for the Jamshedpur franchise would be [[Steve Coppell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Coppell joins Jamshedpur ISL team|url=https://twitter.com/TataSteelLtd/status/885855150321086464|website=Tata Steel (Twitter)}}</ref> Coppell, the [[2016 Indian Super League season|previous ISL season]], had led the [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] to the [[2016 Indian Super League Final|league final]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shukla|first1=Kaushal|title=Kerala Blasters manager Steve Coppell laments cramped schedule after loss|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/isl-2016-final-kerala-blasters-manager-steve-coppell-laments-cramped-schedule-after-loss-3163058.html|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=FirstPost|date=19 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nConstruction on the team for the first season began on 23 July 2017 when Jamshedpur, along with the other nine clubs, took part in the [[2017\u201318 ISL Players Draft]].

The team, along with [[Bengaluru FC|Bengaluru]], entered the [[Indian Super League]] as two new expansion teams. They played their first competitive match on 18 November 2017 while playing their last match of the season on 12 April 2018. The club ended their first Indian Super League campaign in fifth place, thus missing out on the chance to participate in the finals. Jamshedpur also participated in the [[Super Cup (India)|Super Cup]], being eliminated by [[FC Goa|Goa]] in the quarter-finals.\n\nJamshedpur signed former [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager, [[Steve Coppell]], as their first head coach in July. Coppell was in charge of fellow Super League side [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] the [[2016 Indian Super League season|previous season]], leading the side to the [[2016 Indian Super League Final|final]]. India international [[Anas Edathodika]] became Jamshedpur's first player when he was drafted by the club during the [[2017\u201318 ISL Players Draft|players draft]]. Spanish defender [[Tiri (footballer)|Tiri]] was soon signed as the club's first foreign player. Other players recruited included those with previous ISL experience such as [[Sameehg Doutie]], [[Memo (footballer)|Memo]], [[Kervens Belfort]], [[Andr\u00e9 Bikey]], and [[Matheus Gon\u00e7alves]].\n\nThe season started for Jamshedpur with three consecutive draws before earning their first victory away at [[Delhi Dynamos FC|Delhi Dynamos]]. The first half of the season saw Jamshedpur six points off fourth place. During the second half of the season Jamshedpur managed to gain five victories. However a draw and three defeats, including the loss against Goa during their last league stage match, meant that the club would miss out on qualification for the finals. During the Super Cup, Jamshedpur defeated the [[2017\u201318 I-League|I-League]] champions [[Minerva Punjab F.C.|Minerva Punjab]] in the first round before being defeated by [[FC Goa|Goa]] in the quarter-finals.\n\nDuring their inaugural season, every player in the squad played at least one match, whether as a starter or substitute, while as a whole, the club scored 16 goals. Jamshedpur also managed to earn eight clean sheets, with seven of them being won by their number one goalkeeper, [[Subrata Pal]]. [[Matheus Gon\u00e7alves]] ended the campaign as Jamshedpur's top scorer with four goals, all scored in the Indian Super League.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Indian Super League}}\n\nOn 11 May 2017, it was announced by the Indian Super League organizers, [[Football Sports Development]], that they would be inviting bids for new teams to join the league for the upcoming season.<ref name=\"TOI Expansion\">{{cite news|title=Indian Super League to invite bids for new teams|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/indian-super-league-to-invite-bids-for-new-teams/articleshow/58629483.cms|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=Times of India|date=11 May 2017}}</ref> On 12 June, it was officially announced that [[Bengaluru FC]] (for [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]]) and [[Tata Group]] (for [[Jamshedpur]]) had won the bids for the new teams.<ref>{{cite news|title=ISL expanded to 10 teams, Bengaluru FC one of them|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-expanded-to-10-teams-bengaluru-fc-one-of-them/articleshow/59113316.cms|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=Times of India|date=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the expansion bid to enter the [[Indian Super League]], on 14 July 2017, Tata announced that the inaugural head coach for the Jamshedpur franchise would be [[Steve Coppell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Coppell joins Jamshedpur ISL team|url=https://twitter.com/TataSteelLtd/status/885855150321086464|website=Tata Steel (Twitter)}}</ref> Coppell, the [[2016 Indian Super League season|previous ISL season]], had led the [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] to the [[2016 Indian Super League Final|league final]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shukla|first1=Kaushal|title=Kerala Blasters manager Steve Coppell laments cramped schedule after loss|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/isl-2016-final-kerala-blasters-manager-steve-coppell-laments-cramped-schedule-after-loss-3163058.html|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=FirstPost|date=19 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nConstruction on the team for the first season began on 23 July 2017 when Jamshedpur, along with the other nine clubs, took part in the [[2017\u201318 ISL Players Draft]].

It was fought between a [[Swedish_Empire|Swedish]] army under [[Lennart Torstensson]], and an [[Holy_Roman_Empire|Imperial]] force commanded by [[Melchior_von_Hatzfeldt]], each containing around 16,000 men.\n\nThe more mobile and better led Swedes effectively destroyed their opponents, but were unable to take full advantage, and by February 1646, the Imperialists had regained control of Bohemia. \n\nCombined with inconclusive campaigns in the [[Rhineland]] and [[Electorate_of_Saxony|Saxony]], both sides accepted a military solution was no longer possible. Although fighting continued, it increased the urgency of negotiations which led to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. \n\n==Background==\n[[File:Lennart Torstenson, 1603-51 - Nationalmuseum - 40308.tif|thumb|left|upright|Swedish commander [[Lennart Torstensson]]]]\nThe [[Thirty Years War]] began in 1618 when the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] dominated [[Bohemian_Revolt|Bohemian Estates]] offered the [[Kingdom_of_Bohemia|Crown of Bohemia]] to fellow Protestant [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|Frederick of the Palatinate]], rather than conservative [[Catholic_Church|Catholic]] [[Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#Bohemian_revolt|Emperor Ferdinand II]]. Most members of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] remained neutral, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. An army of the [[Catholic_League_(German)#Catholic_League_reestablished|Catholic League]], dominated by Bavarians, then invaded the [[Palatinate_campaign|Palatinate]] and sent Frederick into exile.{{sfn|Spielvogel|2006|p=447}}  \n\nHis replacement by the Catholic [[Maximilian_I,_Elector_of_Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]] changed the nature and extent of the war. It drew in Protestant German states like [[Electorate_of_Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], as well as external powers like [[Denmark-Norway]]. In 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] invaded [[Pomerania]], partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, but also to control the [[Baltic_maritime_trade_(c._1400\u20131800)|Baltic trade]], which provided much of Sweden's income.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1938|pp=385-386}} \n\nEconomic factors meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but conflicted with states within the Empire, including Saxony, and regional rivals, such as Denmark. Most of Sweden's German allies made peace in the 1635 [[Peace_of_Prague_(1635)|Treaty of Prague]]. The war lost its religious nature, becoming a contest between the Empire and Sweden, with Sweden supported by [[Kingdom_of_France|France]] and [[George_I_R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|George R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, Prince of Transylvania]].{{sfn|Setton|1991|pp=80-81}} \n\n[[Ferdinand_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Ferdinand III]], who succeeded his father in 1637, began peace talks in 1643, but ordered his negotiators to delay, pending a 1644 military offensive.{{sfn|H\u00f6belt|2012|p=143}} This was unsuccessful; the Swedes defeated the [[Torstenson_War|Danes]], who had re-entered the war as an Imperial ally, then destroyed an Imperial army in Saxony. Despite victory at [[Battle_of_Freiburg|Freiburg]] in August, the Bavarians under [[Franz von Mercy]] could not prevent French troops capturing [[Philippsburg]], and occupying [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]]. Mercy withdrew into [[Franconia]], establishing winter quarters at [[Heilbronn]].{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=682-683}}  \n\nFor 1645, Swedish commander [[Lennart Torstensson]] proposed a three-part offensive, intended to compel Ferdinand III to agree to terms. While the French kept the Bavarians occupied, the Swedes would advance into Bohemia, where they would be joined by R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. Their combined force would then move against the Imperial capital, [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=128}} \n\nAlthough the two armies in Bohemia were roughly equal in numbers, the Swedes were far better integrated and led. Although often ill, Torstensson was an energetic and experienced commander, supported by capable officers. [[Melchior_von_Hatzfeldt|Hatzfeldt]] was competent, but lacked the ability to control his subordinates, [[Johann_von_G\u00f6tzen]] and [[Johann_von_Werth]].{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=131}} His troops were primarily survivors from defeated armies, many poorly equipped, his best unit being 5,000 veteran Bavarian cavalry under Werth.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=129}}\n\n==Battle==\n{{Location map many|Czech Republic|caption = Bohemia and Moravia, 1645 campaign; lines of march usually followed rivers, essential for carrying supplies|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label = Prague |pos=right  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =05|lon_deg = 14|lon_min = 25\n|label3 = Star\u00e9 Sedlo|pos3=bottom|lat3_deg=49|lat3_min = 40|lon3_deg = 12|lon3_min = 51\n|label4 = Jankov|pos4=right|lat4_deg=49|lat4_min = 39|lon4_deg = 14|lon4_min = 44\n|label5 = Chomutov|pos5=top|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 28|lon5_deg = 13|lon5_min = 25\n|label6 = Brno|pos6=top|lat6_deg=49|lat6_min = 12|lon6_deg = 16|lon6_min = 37\n|label7 = Plze\u0148 |pos7=right| lat7_deg = 49 | lat7_min = 45 | lon7_deg = 13 | lon7_min = 22\n|label8 = Olomouc   |pos8 = right| lat8_deg = 49 | lat8_min = 36 | lon8_deg = 17| lon8_min = 15|\n|label9= T\u00e1bor|pos9 = bottom|lat9_deg = 49 | lat9_min = 25 | lon9_deg = 14 | lon9_min = 39\n}}\nIn late January, Torstensson took advantage of the frozen ground to cross into Bohemia near [[Chomutov]]. The Imperial army  spent the winter near [[Plze\u0148]]; unsure of Swedish intentions, von Hatzfeldt held his position to protect [[Prague]]. On 18 February, the Swedes passed {{convert|18|km|mi}} to the west, and the two sides spent the next three weeks tracking each other along either side of the [[Vltava]] river. In early March, a sudden freeze allowed Torstensson to cross near [[Star\u00e9_Sedlo_(Tachov_District)|Star\u00e9 Sedlo]];  von Hatzfeldt followed, reaching [[T\u00e1bor]] on 4 March, where he made contact with Swedish cavalry. On 5 March, he withdrew to the hills around [[Jankov_(Bene\u0161ov_District)|Jankov]], and prepared for battle the next day.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=131}}     \n\nHatzfeldt had selected a strong position; the hills and woods negated the superior Swedish artillery, his centre was protected by a stream, the right by a steep slope and deep forest. His left was the most vulnerable, with open ground directly to its front, overlooked by a hill to the south, known as 'Kappellhodjen' or Chapel Hill. In a conference the night before, Torstensson and his senior officers recognised the drawbacks, but agreed to an assault; their co-ordinated attack contrasted with command failures among the Imperial generals.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=134}}\n[[Image:Jean, baron de Wert (bgw17 0615).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johann_von_Werth|Werth]], whose Bavarian cavalry charges nearly succeeded in preventing defeat]]\nThe battle consisted of two parts, the first from dawn to midday, the second from early afternoon until nightfall. Around 6:00 am, a Swedish column under [[Robert_Douglas,_Count_of_Skenninge|Robert Douglas]] feinted against the Imperial right, while their main force moved around their left. After ordering G\u00f6tzen to post a detachment on Chapel Hill, Hatzfeldt set off to assess Douglas' move, which he correctly deduced was a diversion. On his return, he discovered G\u00f6tzen had misinterpreted his orders, moving his entire force towards the hill; it became stuck in the woods and broken ground, giving the Swedes time to install artillery and infantry at the crest. After a furious argument, G\u00f6tzen launched a series of attacks, which were repulsed with heavy loss; just after 0915, he was killed, and his troops withdrew.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|pp=135-137}}  \n\nHatzfeldt moved troops from the centre to cover the retreat of G\u00f6tzen's men, but unlike the lighter Swedish guns, their artillery got stuck in the mud, and were captured by [[Arvid Wittenberg]]. Cavalry charges led by Werth kept the Swedes at a safe distance, and the two armies broke contact just before midday. His objective of clearing the road to [[Olomouc]] achieved, and hoping to re-organise his exhausted troops prior to setting off, Torstensson decided to end operations, and allow the Imperials to withdraw.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|pp=138-139}} \n\nHowever, Hatzfeldt felt the Swedes were too close for him to retreat in safety, and opted to hold his position until nightfall. Observing this, Torstensson moved his guns forward and began firing at close range into the helpless Imperial infantry. Werth charged and scattered the Swedish right, before his cavalry stopped to loot the baggage train, capturing Torstensson's wife. The Swedish cavalry reformed and counter-attacked, inflicting heavy casualties; only 1,500 of the 5,000 Bavarians made it back to [[Munich]]. Left isolated, the infantry surrendered, with 4,450 taken prisoner, including Hatzfeldt. In addition, his army suffered 5,000 casualties; less than 3,000 men from the 36 infantry regiments involved were present in Prague a week later. The Swedes had around 4,000 casualties.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=693-695}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhen news of the defeat reached them in Prague, Ferdinand and his brother [[Archduke_Leopold_Wilhelm_of_Austria|Archduke Leopold]] quickly scraped together another army; by early May, Leopold had around 15,000 men. Although it could not match the Swedish veterans, 25 years of constant war had devastated the countryside, and combatants could no longer live off the land. The further the Swedes advanced, the harder it was to secure supplies, and Torstensson decided to establish a base at [[Brno]], held by an Imperial garrison of 1,500 under [[Jean-Louis_Raduit_de_Souches|de Souches]], a French Protestant exile. He was joined by 14,200 Transylvanian troops, largely unpaid and unfed, increasing his supply issue; the besiegers lost over 8,000 men, mostly from disease.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=697}} \n[[Image:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Signing of the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]; by ending hopes of a military solution, the 1645 campaign increased the urgency of these talks]]\nHaving just begun the [[Cretan_War_(1645\u20131669)|Fifth Ottoman-Venetian Cretan War]], the [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottomans]] withdrew support from the Transylvanians in return for Ferdinand renewing the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]].{{sfn |H\u00f6tte|Mihalik|1867 |p=12}} Deprived of Turkish backing, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and Ferdinand agreed the Treaty of Linz, and in August, the Transylvanians and Swedes withdrew from Brno.

By October, he had fewer than 10,000 men facing 20,000 Imperialists; too ill to sit a horse, he retreated into Saxony, where he handed over command to [[Carl_Gustaf_Wrangel|Wrangel]] on 23 December.

It was fought between a [[Swedish_Empire|Swedish]] army under [[Lennart Torstensson]], and an [[Holy_Roman_Empire|Imperial]] force commanded by [[Melchior_von_Hatzfeldt|von Hatzfeldt]], each containing around 16,000 men.\n\nThe more mobile and better led Swedes effectively destroyed their opponents, but were unable to take full advantage, and by February 1646, the Imperialists had regained control of Bohemia. \n\nCombined with inconclusive campaigns in the [[Rhineland]] and [[Electorate_of_Saxony|Saxony]], both sides accepted a military solution was no longer possible. Although fighting continued, it increased the urgency of negotiations which led to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. \n\n==Background==\n[[File:Lennart Torstenson, 1603-51 - Nationalmuseum - 40308.tif|thumb|left|upright|Swedish commander [[Lennart Torstensson]]]]\nThe [[Thirty Years War]] began in 1618 when the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] dominated [[Bohemian_Revolt|Bohemian Estates]] offered the [[Kingdom_of_Bohemia|Crown of Bohemia]] to fellow Protestant [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|Frederick of the Palatinate]], rather than conservative [[Catholic_Church|Catholic]] [[Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#Bohemian_revolt|Emperor Ferdinand II]]. Most members of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] remained neutral, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. An army of the [[Catholic_League_(German)#Catholic_League_reestablished|Catholic League]], dominated by Bavarians, then invaded the [[Palatinate_campaign|Palatinate]] and sent Frederick into exile.{{sfn|Spielvogel|2006|p=447}}  \n\nHis replacement by the Catholic [[Maximilian_I,_Elector_of_Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]] changed the nature and extent of the war. It drew in Protestant German states like [[Electorate_of_Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], as well as external powers like [[Denmark-Norway]]. In 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] invaded [[Pomerania]], partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, but also to control the [[Baltic_maritime_trade_(c._1400\u20131800)|Baltic trade]], which provided much of Sweden's income.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1938|pp=385-386}} \n\nEconomic factors meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but conflicted with states within the Empire, including Saxony, and regional rivals, such as Denmark. Most of Sweden's German allies made peace in the 1635 [[Peace_of_Prague_(1635)|Treaty of Prague]]. The war lost its religious nature, becoming a contest between the Empire and Sweden, supported by [[Kingdom_of_France|France]] and [[George_I_R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|George R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, Prince of Transylvania]].{{sfn|Setton|1991|pp=80-81}} \n\n[[Ferdinand_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Ferdinand III]], who succeeded his father in 1637, began peace talks in 1643, but ordered his negotiators to delay, pending a 1644 military offensive.{{sfn|H\u00f6belt|2012|p=143}} This was unsuccessful; the Swedes defeated the [[Torstenson_War|Danes]], who had re-entered the war as an Imperial ally, then destroyed an Imperial army in Saxony. Despite victory at [[Battle_of_Freiburg|Freiburg]] in August, the Bavarians under [[Franz von Mercy]] could not prevent French troops capturing [[Philippsburg]], and occupying [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]]. Mercy withdrew into [[Franconia]], establishing winter quarters at [[Heilbronn]].{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=682-683}}  \n\nFor 1645, Swedish commander [[Lennart Torstensson]] proposed a three-part offensive, intended to compel Ferdinand III to agree terms. While the French kept the Bavarians occupied, the Swedes would advance into Bohemia, where they would be joined by R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. Their combined force would then move against the Imperial capital, [[Vienna]].{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=128}} \n\nAlthough the two armies in Bohemia were roughly equal in numbers, the Swedes were far better integrated and led. Although often ill, Torstensson was an energetic and experienced commander, supported by capable officers. [[Melchior_von_Hatzfeldt|Hatzfeldt]] was competent, but lacked the ability to control his subordinates, [[Johann_von_G\u00f6tzen|G\u00f6tzen]] and [[Johann_von_Werth|Werth]].{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=131}} His troops were primarily survivors from defeated armies, many poorly equipped, his best unit being 5,000 veteran Bavarian cavalry under Werth.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=129}}\n\n==Battle==\n{{Location map many|Czech Republic|caption = Bohemia and Moravia, 1645 campaign; lines of march usually followed rivers, essential for carrying supplies|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label = Prague |pos=right  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =05|lon_deg = 14|lon_min = 25\n|label3 = Star\u00e9 Sedlo|pos3=bottom|lat3_deg=49|lat3_min = 40|lon3_deg = 12|lon3_min = 51\n|label4 = Jankov|pos4=right|lat4_deg=49|lat4_min = 39|lon4_deg = 14|lon4_min = 44\n|label5 = Chomutov|pos5=top|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 28|lon5_deg = 13|lon5_min = 25\n|label6 = Brno|pos6=top|lat6_deg=49|lat6_min = 12|lon6_deg = 16|lon6_min = 37\n|label7 = Plze\u0148 |pos7=right| lat7_deg = 49 | lat7_min = 45 | lon7_deg = 13 | lon7_min = 22\n|label8 = Olomouc   |pos8 = right| lat8_deg = 49 | lat8_min = 36 | lon8_deg = 17| lon8_min = 15|\n|label9= T\u00e1bor|pos9 = bottom|lat9_deg = 49 | lat9_min = 25 | lon9_deg = 14 | lon9_min = 39\n}}\nIn late January, Torstensson took advantage of the frozen ground to cross into Bohemia near [[Chomutov]]. The Imperial army  spent the winter near [[Plze\u0148]]; unsure of Swedish intentions, von Hatzfeldt held his position to protect [[Prague]]. On 18 February, the Swedes passed {{convert|18|km|mi}} to the west, and the two sides spent the next three weeks tracking each other along either side of the [[Vltava]] river. In early March, a sudden freeze allowed Torstensson to cross near [[Star\u00e9_Sedlo_(Tachov_District)|Star\u00e9 Sedlo]];  von Hatzfeldt followed, reaching [[T\u00e1bor]] on 4 March, where he made contact with Swedish cavalry. On 5 March, he withdrew to the hills around [[Jankov_(Bene\u0161ov_District)|Jankov]], and prepared for battle the next day.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=131}}     \n\nHatzfeldt had selected a strong position; the hills and woods negated the superior Swedish artillery, his centre was protected by a stream, the right by a steep slope and deep forest. His left was the most vulnerable, with open ground directly to its front, overlooked by a hill to the south, known as 'Kappellhodjen' or Chapel Hill. In a conference the night before, Torstensson and his senior officers recognised the drawbacks, but agreed to an assault; their co-ordinated attack contrasted with command failures among the Imperial generals.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|p=134}}\n[[Image:Jean, baron de Wert (bgw17 0615).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johann_von_Werth|Werth]], whose Bavarian cavalry charges nearly succeeded in preventing defeat]]\nThe battle consisted of two parts, the first from dawn to midday, the second from early afternoon until nightfall. Around 6:00 am, a Swedish column under [[Robert_Douglas,_Count_of_Skenninge|Robert Douglas]] feinted against the Imperial right, while their main force moved around their left. After ordering G\u00f6tzen to post a detachment on Chapel Hill, Hatzfeldt set off to assess Douglas' move, which he correctly deduced was a diversion. On his return, he discovered G\u00f6tzen had misinterpreted his orders, moving his entire force towards the hill; it became stuck in the woods and broken ground, giving the Swedes time to install artillery and infantry at the crest. After a furious argument, G\u00f6tzen launched a series of attacks, which were repulsed with heavy loss; just after 0915, he was killed, and his troops withdrew.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|pp=135-137}}  \n\nHatzfeldt moved troops from the centre to cover the retreat of G\u00f6tzen's men, but unlike the lighter Swedish guns, their artillery got stuck in the mud, and were captured by [[Arvid Wittenberg]]. Cavalry charges led by Werth kept the Swedes at a safe distance, and the two armies broke contact just before midday. His objective of clearing the road to [[Olomouc]] achieved, and hoping to re-organise his exhausted troops prior to setting off, Torstensson decided to end operations, and allow the Imperials to withdraw.{{sfn|Guthrie|2003|pp=138-139}} \n\nHowever, Hatzfeldt felt the Swedes were too close for him to retreat in safety, and opted to hold his position until nightfall. Observing this, Torstensson moved his guns forward and began firing at close range into the helpless Imperial infantry. Werth charged and scattered the Swedish right, before his cavalry stopped to loot the baggage train, capturing Torstensson's wife. The Swedish cavalry reformed and counter-attacked, inflicting heavy casualties; only 1,500 of the 5,000 Bavarians made it back to [[Munich]]. Left isolated, the infantry surrendered, with 4,450 taken prisoner, including Hatzfeldt. In addition, his army suffered 5,000 casualties; less than 3,000 men from the 36 infantry regiments involved were present in Prague a week later. The Swedes had around 4,000 casualties.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=693-695}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhen news of the defeat reached them in Prague, Ferdinand and his brother [[Archduke_Leopold_Wilhelm_of_Austria|Archduke Leopold]] quickly scraped together another army; by early May, Leopold had around 15,000 men. Although it could not match the Swedish veterans, 25 years of constant war had devastated the countryside, and combatants could no longer live off the land. The further the Swedes advanced, the harder it was to secure supplies, and Torstensson decided to establish a base at [[Brno]], held by an Imperial garrison of 1,500 under [[Jean-Louis_Raduit_de_Souches|de Souches]], a French Protestant exile. He was joined by 14,200 Transylvanian troops, largely unpaid and unfed, increasing his supply issue; the besiegers lost over 8,000 men, mostly from disease.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=697}} \n[[Image:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Signing of the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]; by ending hopes of a military solution, the 1645 campaign increased the urgency of these talks]]\nHaving just begun the [[Cretan_War_(1645\u20131669)|Fifth Ottoman-Venetian Cretan War]], the [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottomans]] withdrew support from the Transylvanians in return for Ferdinand renewing the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]].{{sfn |H\u00f6tte|Mihalik|1867 |p=12}} Deprived of Turkish backing, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and Ferdinand agreed the Treaty of Linz, and in August, the Transylvanians and Swedes withdrew from Brno.

One of them, Marcusson, is a positive thinker who believes that people are alike all over, even on the Red Planet. The other astronaut, Conrad, has a more cynical view of human interplanetary nature. The impact of landing on Mars is so severe that Marcusson is critically injured. Knowing that he is dying, Marcusson pleads with Conrad to open the door of their ship so he can at least see that for which he has given his life. Conrad refuses, still fearful of what may await outside, and Marcusson dies.\n\nNow alone, Conrad hears a rhythmic sound reverberating upon the ship's hull. Expecting some unnameable evil, his apprehension turns to joy when he opens the hatch and sees [[Martian]]s that indeed appear to be human, have mind-reading abilities and give the impression of being most amicable, especially the beautiful Teenya, who welcomes and reassures him.

Fairman]]'s ''Brothers Beyond the Void'', published in the March 1952 issue of ''Fantastic Adventures '' and also included in [[August Derleth]]'s 1953 anthology collection ''Worlds of Tomorrow''. In this renowned short story, Sam Conrad remains on Earth and it is the lone pilot Marcusson who has the too-close encounter with smaller, more alien Martians. In adapting the tale, Serling made key changes that would deepen the irony and heighten the impact. He installed the apprehensive, defeatist Conrad as the protagonist, easing his fears, only to have them ultimately confirmed, and he presented the Martians as a human-like superior race whose apparent benevolence would make their climactic treachery seem even more shocking, as well as decrease the budget that would have been expended on costumes and makeup.\n\nThe [[Martian]] exteriors are taken from the oversize painted background [[diorama]]s seen in the 1956 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. Additionally, a set of four lights on the wall of the inside of the space ship are reuses of the [[Krell]] power gauges from the same film.\n\nMarcusson is portrayed by [[Paul Comi]], a frequent guest star in TV shows of the 1960s and 1970s, including ''Star Trek''.  His other ''TZ'' work was in the second season's \"[[The Odyssey of Flight 33]]\", where he played the co-pilot, and the fourth season's \"[[The Parallel (The Twilight Zone)|The Parallel]]\".\n\nActor [[Byron Morrow]] twice appeared as an admiral on ''Star Trek''.

A year later, her best friend [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] gets her out during a prison break and tries to convince her that he does not love her. Despite Ivy's support, Harley's attempt to break up with Joker fails after he sweet-talks her into staying with him. The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger. Following a costume change, Harley officially breaks up with Joker and declares her intention to make a name for herself in the criminal underworld.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A High Bar\n| DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo<br>[[Ben Jones (Canadian cartoonist)|Ben Jones]]<br>Frank Marino\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = Believing she has to join the [[Legion of Doom]] to prove herself as a supervillain, Harley attempts to make a big splash by crashing one of their criminal enterprises with Ivy's help. However, they accidentally crash a Bar Mitzvah for [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s nephew, Joshua. When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants. They rush to her apartment to retrieve the antidote and return in time to help Harley fight off the other villains. Using her psychology background, Harley convinces them to stop taking abuse from Joker, forcing the clown prince to leave.

However, she struggles to recruit others to her cause due to her gender and her past association with Joker. After talking with the [[Queen of Fables]], Harley decides she needs other downtrodden villains like her. She starts by recruiting disgraced [[Wonder Woman]] villain [[Doctor Psycho]], who was kicked out of the Legion of Doom by [[Lex Luthor]] for calling her and [[Giganta]] the \"[[Cunt|C word]]\" on national television instead of the \"[[Bitch (slang)|B word]].\" They next recruit Gotham City's shapeshifting thespian extraordinaire [[Clayface]] after meeting him in a bar. For their first heist, Harley decides to rob [[Maxie Zeus]]' Olympic Gold Medals as revenge for insults he made against her during her quest. Despite their initial struggles, they ultimately succeed after brutally beating up Zeus before Harley sells the medals to purchase a nuclear warhead and force the city into naming a highway after her.

Even worse, Robin appears on a talk show and lies about Harley agreeing to be his nemesis. After a failed attempt to get [[Superman]] to be her nemesis by kidnapping [[Lois Lane]], Harley recruits [[King Shark]] into her crew, captures Robin, threatens him into confessing he lied, then reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain to publicly humiliate him. When King Shark goes berserk after smelling blood, Batman arrives and subdues him before getting into a three-way brawl with the arriving Joker, Harley, and Ivy. Joker ends the fight by kidnapping Robin and forcing Batman to pursue them. Much to Ivy's dismay, she and Harley's crew are evicted from their apartment by their cybernetic landlord [[Sy Borgman]].

While trying to find the \"Emergency Exit\" in her subconscious, Harley discovers her indecision comes from the belief her \"origin story\" was not her decision and that she altered her memory to believe that her becoming a villain was Joker's doing. Choosing the moment she broke up with him as her true \"origin story,\" Harley cures herself somewhat. Meanwhile, Borgman finds Harley and her crew's comatose bodies and believes they committed suicide, so he takes them to an abandoned mall to cremate them. At the last minute, everyone wakes up and nearly kill Borgman. Upon seeing the mall however, Harley decides to make it their new lair.

While Harley, Clayface, and King Shark try to recover the hand, Ivy and Psycho seek revenge on an online personality called the Cowled Critic, who slandered them. King Shark is beaten by police officers and sent to prison while Ivy and Psycho learn the Cowled Critic is the latter's estranged son Herman, and makes amends with him. While in a shoot-out with Gordon, Harley discovers the device is a teleporter when it sends her to the [[Batcave]]. Once Harley realizes she had been selfish and ignoring her teammates, she encourages Batman to help stop Gordon after he starts obsessively defending the hand.

They then use the force field device to steal a weather-controlling machine from Kord Industries to ransom the city, but the Queen shows up to steal it for herself. They are interrupted by Jason Praxis, a surviving member of the family with electrical powers who seeks revenge on the Queen for their murder. Harley uses the force field device to protect the Queen, subdue Praxis, and get her to leave.

What's left of the GCPD, with the exception of Gordon, have become outnumbered and unmotivated to restore law and order as various sections of the city have been taken over by the Penguin, the Riddler, Bane, Two-Face, and [[Mr. Freeze]]; who have formed the [[Injustice League]] following the Legion of Doom's destruction. Harley disapproves of their control, especially after they give her a small amount of territory, and attempts to rebel against them; only to get herself captured. Months later, Ivy and the rest of the crew manage to break her out, giving her the chance to murder the Penguin and see that the rest of the Injustice League have taken over the rest of Gotham. Seeing as how she was the one who defeated the Joker, Harley believes she deserves to rule the city and vows to take out all of her rivals.

However, Harley nearly blows her cover after attacking the mascot in front of the tour guide, [[Barbara Gordon]]. Harley and Ivy track down Barbara to kill her before she can warn Riddler, but she tells them she wants to stop him after deducing he was responsible for kidnapping students ever since he took over and that she procured invitations for a party at a fraternity house where the disappearances are happening. Harley and Ivy steal the invitations for themselves and Clayface and successfully enter the party, where they learn that the kidnapped students are being used as human batteries before Riddler captures them. Meanwhile, dissatisfied with doing nothing, Barbara becomes inspired by her father, Commissioner Gordon, to stop Riddler herself. Despite being outnumbered, she manages to take out the generator, subdue Riddler, and free everyone.

During the theft, Ivy starts to question the direction her life is going in, and finds herself under even more pressure as Kite Man tries to steal a ring from the museum and propose to her. To make matters worse, Catwoman betrays them and escapes on her own, leaving them to die until they manage to escape using the flamethrower. After murdering Dr. Trap and heading home, Harley and Ivy help the rest of the crew recapture Riddler, who decides to keep powering the mall due to the benefits that come with it.

A year later, her best friend [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] gets her out during a prison break and tries to convince her that he does not love her. Despite Ivy's support, Harley's attempt to break up with Joker fails after he sweet-talks her into staying with him. The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger. Following a costume change, Harley officially breaks up with Joker and declares her intention to make a name for herself in the criminal underworld.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A High Bar\n| DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo<br>[[Ben Jones (Canadian cartoonist)|Ben Jones]]<br>Frank Marino\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = Believing she has to join the [[Legion of Doom]] to prove herself as a supervillain, Harley attempts to make a big splash by crashing one of their criminal enterprises with Ivy's help. However, they accidentally crash a Bar Mitzvah for [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s nephew, Joshua. When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants. They rush to her apartment to retrieve the antidote and return in time to help Harley fight off the other villains. Using her psychology background, Harley convinces them to stop taking abuse from Joker, forcing the clown prince to leave.

However, she struggles to recruit others to her cause due to her gender and her past association with Joker. After talking with the [[Queen of Fables]], Harley decides she needs other downtrodden villains like her. She starts by recruiting disgraced [[Wonder Woman]] villain [[Doctor Psycho]], who was kicked out of the Legion of Doom by [[Lex Luthor]] for calling her and [[Giganta]] the \"[[Cunt|C word]]\" on national television instead of the \"[[Bitch (slang)|B word]].\" They next recruit Gotham City's shapeshifting thespian extraordinaire [[Clayface]] after meeting him in a bar. For their first heist, Harley decides to rob [[Maxie Zeus]]' Olympic Gold Medals as revenge for insults he made against her during her quest. Despite their initial struggles, they ultimately succeed after brutally beating up Zeus before Harley sells the medals to purchase a nuclear warhead and force the city into naming a highway after her.

Even worse, Robin appears on a talk show and lies about Harley agreeing to be his nemesis. After a failed attempt to get [[Superman]] to be her nemesis by kidnapping [[Lois Lane]], Harley recruits [[King Shark]] into her crew, captures Robin, threatens him into confessing he lied, then reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain to publicly humiliate him. When King Shark goes berserk after smelling blood, Batman arrives and subdues him before getting into a three-way brawl with the arriving Joker, Harley, and Ivy. Joker ends the fight by kidnapping Robin and forcing Batman to pursue them. Much to Ivy's dismay, she and Harley's crew are evicted from their apartment by their cybernetic landlord [[Sy Borgman]].

While trying to find the \"Emergency Exit\" in her subconscious, Harley discovers her indecision comes from the belief her \"origin story\" was not her decision and that she altered her memory to believe that her becoming a villain was Joker's doing. Choosing the moment she broke up with him as her true \"origin story,\" Harley cures herself somewhat. Meanwhile, Borgman finds Harley and her crew's comatose bodies and believes they committed suicide, so he takes them to an abandoned mall to cremate them. At the last minute, everyone wakes up and nearly kill Borgman. Upon seeing the mall however, Harley decides to make it their new lair.

While Harley, Clayface, and King Shark try to recover the hand, Ivy and Psycho seek revenge on an online personality called the Cowled Critic, who slandered them. King Shark is beaten by police officers and sent to prison while Ivy and Psycho learn the Cowled Critic is the latter's estranged son Herman, and makes amends with him. While in a shoot-out with Gordon, Harley discovers the device is a teleporter when it sends her to the [[Batcave]]. Once Harley realizes she had been selfish and ignoring her teammates, she encourages Batman to help stop Gordon after he starts obsessively defending the hand.

They then use the force field device to steal a weather-controlling machine from Kord Industries to ransom the city, but the Queen shows up to steal it for herself. They are interrupted by Jason Praxis, a surviving member of the family with electrical powers who seeks revenge on the Queen for their murder. Harley uses the force field device to protect the Queen, subdue Praxis, and get her to leave.

What's left of the GCPD, with the exception of Gordon, have become outnumbered and unmotivated to restore law and order as various sections of the city have been taken over by the Penguin, the Riddler, Bane, Two-Face, and [[Mr. Freeze]]; who have formed the [[Injustice League]] following the Legion of Doom's destruction. Harley disapproves of their control, especially after they give her a small amount of territory, and attempts to rebel against them; only to get herself captured. Months later, Ivy and the rest of the crew manage to break her out, giving her the chance to murder the Penguin and see that the rest of the Injustice League have taken over the rest of Gotham. Seeing as how she was the one who defeated the Joker, Harley believes she deserves to rule the city and vows to take out all of her rivals.

However, Harley nearly blows her cover after attacking the mascot in front of the tour guide, [[Barbara Gordon]]. Harley and Ivy track down Barbara to kill her before she can warn Riddler, but she tells them she wants to stop him after deducing he was responsible for kidnapping students ever since he took over and that she procured invitations for a party at a fraternity house where the disappearances are happening. Harley and Ivy steal the invitations for themselves and Clayface and successfully enter the party, where they learn that the kidnapped students are being used as human batteries before Riddler captures them. Meanwhile, dissatisfied with doing nothing, Barbara becomes inspired by her father, Commissioner Gordon, to stop Riddler herself. Despite being outnumbered, she manages to take out the generator, subdue Riddler, and free everyone.

During the theft, Ivy starts to question the direction her life is going in, and finds herself under even more pressure as Kite Man tries to steal a ring from the museum and propose to her. To make matters worse, Catwoman betrays them and escapes on her own, leaving them to die until they manage to escape using the flamethrower. After murdering Dr. Trap and heading home, Harley and Ivy help the rest of the crew recapture Riddler, who decides to keep powering the mall due to the benefits that come with it.

A black vertical band (\"pale\") down the centre displayed two silver hawk's bells, between which was a small blue shield displaying a golden sheaf of wheat.  The crest was a black eagle, and the motto ''Prendre sa belle''.  Some time later, the blue shield was removed, and the wheatsheaf was placed directly on the black pale.  In 1957, the wheatsheaf was replaced with a third hawk's bell.  This version of the arms, re-drawn by [[Ivan Mitford-Barberton]], was registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in February 1959.<ref name=og1>Cape of Good Hope ''Official Gazette'' 2957 (6 February 1959).</ref>\n\nThe final version of the arms, as amended by [[Cornelis Pama]] in 1979, replaced the hawk's bells with church bells.<ref name=bel>Strydom, C.J.S.

June 1947).</ref> It later altered the arms, three times, before settling on the final version in 1979.\nThe shield was divided into twelve horizontal bars of red and gold, representing the original village name of \"Twaalfmyl\".  A black vertical band (\"pale\") down the centre displayed two silver hawk's bells, between which was a small blue shield displaying a golden sheaf of wheat.  The crest was a black eagle, and the motto ''Prendre sa belle''.  Some time later, the blue shield was removed, and the wheatsheaf was placed directly on the black pale.  In 1957, the wheatsheaf was replaced with a third hawk's bell.  This version of the arms, re-drawn by [[Ivan Mitford-Barberton]], was registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in February 1959.<ref name=og1>Cape of Good Hope ''Official Gazette'' 2957 (6 February 1959).</ref>\n\nThe final version of the arms, as amended by [[Cornelis Pama]] in 1979, replaced the hawk's bells with church bells.<ref name=bel>Strydom, C.J.S.
