Based on the demo Leshay was able to convince major label Giant Records to imprint his label Play Records and co-market and distribute a Denzil album in the US.

The album was produced, arranged, and mixed by Steve Ennever.\n\nOn 17 February 1994, an acoustic Thomas and Boyd played the pub at the St. Francis Hotel in [[San Francisco]] as part of the 1994 Gavin convention. This, their first show in the US.\n\nReleased on 12 April 1994, ''[[Pub (Denzil album)|Pub]]'' and the single \"Useless\" - was released. \n\nHowever, despite these successes, ''Pub'' never sold in great numbers, frictions between LeShay and Giant ended up standing in the way of continued label support.  By October 1994, the investors in Play Records, Cary Greene and Neil Stein were arrested by the SEC for fraudulent behavior in the world of financial securities which ultimately caused the Play Records funding to cease. Unfortunately, Giant Records confidence in Denzil was shaken enough for them to pass on second option in 1995.\n\nFrictions between Denzil and Steve Ennever were also having an effect on the overall situation. Two days after returning from the US, Steve Ennever decided to part company with Denzil entirely.\n\nEnnever was replaced live with Bournemouth stalwart bass player Martin \"Budgie\" Burden. In mid-January 1995, Thomas, Burden, Boyd and Stacey began an 11 date tour of the UK to support the release of ''Pub'' in the UK on [[BMG Records]] under licence from Giant. Denzil entered the studio immediately afterwards with Stacey as producer to create a series of demos for the next album. The band also filmed a special for [[VH1]] at this time, being interviewed by Robert Sandall.\n\nSandall introduced Denzil to [[Billy Bragg]]'s manager [[Peter Jenner]] who started looking after the band from early 1995. In May 1995 BMG declined to sign Denzil direct to the UK, which effectively left them without a deal. The band was offered a series of small record deals in 1995 and 1996 which were not taken up.

After Julien saves Marguerite from a horse riding incident, their uncle, Abbot, feels uneasiness in the siblings\u2019 relationship. He advises their father, Jean, to send Julien and his older brother, Phillipe, to study abroad on the excuse Marguerite is distracting their education. Six years pass, during which Marguerite refuses to marry and spends her time alone. When Julien and Phillipe return, Marguerite shares a joyous reunion with Julien. Their parents arrange her to be betrothed to Marigny, who is crippled but kind to Marguerite. However, Margurite is uninterested and Julien exhibits jealousy towards Marigny. During dinner with Marigny, Julien excuses himself with Marguerite following him. It is the first time Julien and Marguerite are alone with each other and the attraction is too much to overcome. They try and fight it since they are not willing to admit they are in love. Instead they play an increasingly sexual game that includes trying to make the other shutter and squirm. After being gone for a while, their parents find them partially undressed and punish them for causing Marigny to cancel the engagement. Marguerite later meets with Julien in secret and confesses her love to him but, although he reciprocates, he rejects her. She tries to kiss him but he quickly leaves. Shortly after, Marguerite is married to Lefevre, a wealthy tax collector. When he tries to initiate sex with Marguerite, she locks him out of her bedroom.

Marguerite disguises herself as a man to hide her identity but the authorities receive a tip on their whereabouts. Before they can board a ship to [[England]], they are arrested. At trial, both deny the charges and claim they ran away because Julien helped Marguerite escape from her abusive husband. Their father petitions [[King Henri IV]] to spare his children but the king says he can not tolerate incest and refuses to pardon them.

After Julien saves Marguerite from a horse riding incident, their uncle, Abbot, feels uneasiness in the siblings\u2019 relationship. He advises their father, Jean, to send Julien and his older brother, Phillipe, to study abroad on the excuse Marguerite is distracting their education. Six years pass, during which Marguerite refuses to marry and spends her time alone. When Julien and Phillipe return, Marguerite shares a joyous reunion with Julien. Their parents arrange her to be betrothed to Marigny, who is crippled but kind to Marguerite. However, Margurite is uninterested and Julien exhibits jealousy towards Marigny. During dinner with Marigny, Julien excuses himself with Marguerite following him. It is the first time Julien and Marguerite are alone with each other and the attraction is too much to overcome. They try and fight it since they are not willing to admit they are in love. Instead they play an increasingly sexual game that includes trying to make the other shutter and squirm. After being gone for a while, their parents find them partially undressed and punish them for causing Marigny to cancel the engagement. Marguerite later meets with Julien in secret and confesses her love to him but, although he reciprocates, he rejects her. She tries to kiss him but he quickly leaves. Shortly after, Marguerite is married to Lefevre, a wealthy tax collector. When he tries to initiate sex with Marguerite, she locks him out of her bedroom.

{"title_page": "La Cava Bible", "text_new": "[[File:LaCavaBibleFolio220v.jpg|thumb|Folio 220v of the La Cava Bible]]\nThe '''La Cava Bible''' or '''''Codex Cavensis''''' (Cava de' Tirreni, [[Biblioteca statale del Monumento Nazionale Badia di Cava]], Ms. memb. I) is a 9th-century [[Latin language|Latin]] [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Bible]], which was produced in [[Spain]], probably in the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] during the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]]. The [[manuscript]] is preserved at the abbey of [[La Trinit\u00e0 della Cava]], near [[Cava de' Tirreni]] in [[Campania]], Italy, and contains 330 [[vellum]] folios which measure 320 by 260 mm.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe Bible was signed on folio 166v by a scribe named Danila. The location of the [[scriptorium]] in which Danila worked is not known. However the [[hand]], textual variations, and [[orthography]] indicate that the manuscript was produced in Spain, during the early 9th century.  It is unlikely that such a luxury manuscript could have been produced in the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim-controlled areas]] of the Iberian Peninsula. This makes [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], which was the largest Christian kingdom of the time, the most probable origin of the [[codex]].  Additional evidence of an Asturian origin is provided by the decoration of the manuscript. The [[Cross]] which appears in four locations in the La Cava Bible, is the only explicitly Christian decoration in the manuscript.  Although the form of the Crosses in the La Cava Bible do not appear in other surviving [[Asturian art]], the Cross was emphasized in [[Asturian art|Asturian]] devotional art. For example, both [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso II]] and [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]] commissioned gold crosses, like the [[Victory Cross]] and the [[Cross of the Angels]]. \"Cross of the Resurrection\" was a prominent feature of [[mural]]s at [[San Juli\u00e1n de los Prados]], near Oviedo, [[Asturias]].\n\n==Decoration==\n[[File:LaCavaBibleFolio69r.jpg|thumb|left|Folio 69r of the La Cava Bible]]\nThe decoration of the La Cava Bible is limited to the four crosses mentioned above, frames surrounding [[explicit (publishing)|explicit]]s and titles, and decorated initials. There are two linear, [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] drawn Crosses, one serving as [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] on folio 1 verso, and the other in the introduction to the [[Nevi'im|prophetical books]] on folio 143 recto.  On folio 100 verso the title frame for the [[Psalms]] is in the form of a cross. The text on folio 220 verso, which contains the prefaces by [[Jerome]] used to introduce the [[New Testament]], is written in the form of a cross. This text is written in red, white and yellow [[ink]]s on a blue-stained folio.  There is one other folio stained blue and three folios [[Purple parchment|stained purple]] in this manuscript.  The frames surrounding the explicits and titles are similar in form to frames found in the earliest medieval illuminated books. However, Danila exploited brilliant and contrasting hues of color not found in earlier manuscripts.  The decorated initials include initial types commonly associated with Merovingian illumination. However similar initials also occurred in [[Visigothic script|Visigothic manuscripts]].\n\nIt is likely that Danila copied this manuscript from an earlier, now-lost, Visigothic manuscript.  The title and explicit frames are similar to those found in early manuscripts and the pages written in coloured inks are related to Late Antique manuscripts written in gold and silver on purple-dyed parchment. (For example, see [[Rossano Gospels]]).  However Danila's use of colour was probably not present in the original manuscript and anticipates the use of colour in later Spanish manuscripts.\n\nAlthough Danila may have been aware of [[Merovingian script|Merovingian initials]], it is also equally likely that his initials share in common the models for Merovingian initials. The manuscript gives no indication that Danila was influenced by contemporary [[Carolingian]] illumination. However, Carolingian Bibles produced under the patronage of [[Theodulph of Orleans]], who had Visigothic parentage, do have similar text and organization to that found in the La Cava Bible, something not found in other similar Carolingian manuscripts.\n\n== Text ==\nIt is one of the two most important representatives of the Spanish type of Vulgate text, and in the Old Testament presents a text believed to be derived from very old Italian exemplars.  In the [[Stuttgart Vulgate]] the La Cava Bible stands alongside the [[Codex Amiatinus]] as primary witnesses for almost all the books of the Old Testament. The text of the Gospels shows signs of being a revision, being mingled with Old Latin elements.

{"title_page": "Fabric softener", "text_new": "A '''fabric softener''' (or '''conditioner''') is a [[conditioner (chemistry)|conditioner]] that is typically applied to [[laundry]] during the rinse cycle in a [[washing machine]]. In contrast to [[laundry detergent]]s, fabric softeners may be regarded as a kind of after-treatment laundry aid.<ref name=Ull2/>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nMachine washing puts great mechanical stress on textiles, particularly natural fibers such as cotton and wool. The fibers at the fabric surface are squashed and frayed, and this condition hardens while drying the laundry in air, giving the laundry a harsh feel. Adding a liquid fabric softener to the final rinse (rinse-cycle softener) results in laundry that feels softer.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann| author1=Eduard Smulders | author2=Wolfgang Rybinski | author3=Eric Sung | author4=Wilfried R\u00e4hse | author5=Josef Steber | author6=Frederike Wiebel | author7=Anette Nordskog | title=Laundry Detergents | year=2007 | pages=86\u201387 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a08_315.pub2}}</ref><ref name=Ull2>{{Ullmann| author1=Eduard Smulders |author2=Eric Sung |  title=Laundry Detergents, 2. Ingredients and Products | year=2012 | doi=10.1002/14356007.o15_013}}</ref>\n\nIn the US and UK laundry is mostly dried in mechanical dryers, and the tumbling of the laundry in the dryer has its own softening effect. Therefore, fabric softeners in the US and UK are used rather to impart antistatic properties and a pleasant smell to the laundry. Fabric softeners are usually either in the form of a liquid, which is added to the washing machine during the rinse cycle (either by the machine itself or through use of a [[dispensing ball]]); or as a dryer sheet which is added to the moist laundry at the beginning of the dryer cycle. Liquid fabric softeners can be added manually during the rinse cycle or automatically if the machine has a dispenser designed for this purpose.\n\nFabric softeners coat the surface of a fabric with chemical compounds that are electrically charged, causing threads to \"stand up\" from the surface and thereby imparting a softer and fluffier texture. [[Cationic]] softeners bind by electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged groups on the surface of the fibers and neutralize their charge. The long aliphatic chains then line up towards the outside of the fiber, imparting [[lubricity]].\n\nFabric softeners impart antistatic properties to fabrics, and thus prevent the build-up of electrostatic charges on synthetic fibers, which in turn eliminates fabric cling during handling and wearing, crackling noises, and dust attraction. Also, fabric softeners make fabrics easier to iron and help reduce wrinkles in garments. In addition, they reduce drying times so that energy is saved when softened laundry is tumble-dried. Last but not least, they can also impart a pleasant fragrance to the laundry.<ref name=Ull2/>\n\n== Fabric softeners ==\nEarly cotton softeners were typically based on a water emulsion of [[soap]] and [[olive oil]], [[corn oil]], or [[tallow]] oil.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Softening compounds differ in affinity to various fabrics. Some  work better on [[cellulose]]-based fibers (i.e., cotton), others  have higher affinity to hydrophobic materials like [[nylon]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], [[polyacrylonitrile]], etc. New [[silicone]]-based compounds, such as [[polydimethylsiloxane]], work by lubricating the fibers. Manufacturers use derivatives with amine- or amide-containing functional groups as well. These groups improve the softener's binding to fabrics.\n\nAs softeners are often hydrophobic, they commonly occur in the form of an [[emulsion]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Asim|last2=Choudhury|first2=Roy|date=2017|title=Principles of Textile Finishing|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081006467000060|journal=Woodhead Publishing Series in Textiles|volume=|pages=109-148|via=Science Direct}}</ref> In the early formulations, manufactures used [[soap]]s as [[emulsifier]]s. The emulsions are usually opaque, milky fluids. However, there are also [[microemulsion]]s, where the droplets of the hydrophobic phase are substantially smaller{{Nonspecific|date=August 2011}}. Microemulsions provide the advantage of increased ability of smaller particles to penetrate into the fibers. Manufacturers often use a mixture of cationic and non-ionic surfactants as an emulsifier. Another approach is a polymeric network, an emulsion polymer.\n\nIn addition to fabric softening chemicals, fabric softeners may include acids or bases to maintain optimal [[pH]] for absorption, silicone-based [[anti-foaming agent]]s, emulsion stabilizers, fragrances, and colors.\n\n=== Cationic fabric softeners ===\nRinse-cycle softeners usually contain [[cationic surfactant]]s of the [[quaternary ammonium]] type as the main active ingredient.

In contrast to [[laundry detergent]]s, fabric softeners may be regarded as a kind of after-treatment laundry aid.<ref name=Ull2/>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nMachine washing puts great mechanical stress on textiles, particularly natural fibers such as cotton and wool. The fibers at the fabric surface are squashed and frayed, and this condition hardens while drying the laundry in air, giving the laundry a harsh feel. Adding a liquid fabric softener to the final rinse (rinse-cycle softener) results in laundry that feels softer.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann| author1=Eduard Smulders | author2=Wolfgang Rybinski | author3=Eric Sung | author4=Wilfried R\u00e4hse | author5=Josef Steber | author6=Frederike Wiebel | author7=Anette Nordskog | title=Laundry Detergents | year=2007 | pages=86\u201387 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a08_315.pub2}}</ref><ref name=Ull2>{{Ullmann| author1=Eduard Smulders |author2=Eric Sung |  title=Laundry Detergents, 2. Ingredients and Products | year=2012 | doi=10.1002/14356007.o15_013}}</ref>\n\nIn the US and UK laundry is mostly dried in mechanical dryers, and the tumbling of the laundry in the dryer has its own softening effect. Therefore, fabric softeners in the US and UK are used rather to impart antistatic properties and a pleasant smell to the laundry. Fabric softeners are usually either in the form of a liquid, which is added to the washing machine during the rinse cycle (either by the machine itself or through use of a [[dispensing ball]]); or as a dryer sheet which is added to the moist laundry at the beginning of the dryer cycle. Liquid fabric softeners can be added manually during the rinse cycle or automatically if the machine has a dispenser designed for this purpose.\n\nFabric softeners coat the surface of a fabric with chemical compounds that are electrically charged, causing threads to \"stand up\" from the surface and thereby imparting a softer and fluffier texture. [[Cationic]] softeners bind by electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged groups on the surface of the fibers and neutralize their charge. The long aliphatic chains then line up towards the outside of the fiber, imparting [[lubricity]].\n\nFabric softeners impart antistatic properties to fabrics, and thus prevent the build-up of electrostatic charges on synthetic fibers, which in turn eliminates fabric cling during handling and wearing, crackling noises, and dust attraction. Also, fabric softeners make fabrics easier to iron and help reduce wrinkles in garments. In addition, they reduce drying times so that energy is saved when softened laundry is tumble-dried. Last but not least, they can also impart a pleasant fragrance to the laundry.<ref name=Ull2/>\n\n== Fabric softeners ==\nEarly cotton softeners were typically based on a water emulsion of [[soap]] and [[olive oil]], [[corn oil]], or [[tallow]] oil.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Softening compounds differ in affinity to various fabrics. Some  work better on [[cellulose]]-based fibers (i.e., cotton), others  have higher affinity to hydrophobic materials like [[nylon]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], [[polyacrylonitrile]], etc. New [[silicone]]-based compounds, such as [[polydimethylsiloxane]], work by lubricating the fibers. Manufacturers use derivatives with amine- or amide-containing functional groups as well. These groups improve the softener's binding to fabrics.\n\nAs softeners are often hydrophobic, they commonly occur in the form of an [[emulsion]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the early formulations, manufactures used [[soap]]s as [[emulsifier]]s. The emulsions are usually opaque, milky fluids. However, there are also [[microemulsion]]s, where the droplets of the hydrophobic phase are substantially smaller{{Nonspecific|date=August 2011}}. Microemulsions provide the advantage of increased ability of smaller particles to penetrate into the fibers. Manufacturers often use a mixture of cationic and non-ionic surfactants as an emulsifier. Another approach is a polymeric network, an emulsion polymer.\n\nIn addition to fabric softening chemicals, fabric softeners may include acids or bases to maintain optimal [[pH]] for absorption, silicone-based [[anti-foaming agent]]s, emulsion stabilizers, fragrances, and colors.\n\n=== Cationic fabric softeners ===\nRinse-cycle softeners usually contain [[cationic surfactant]]s of the [[quaternary ammonium]] type as the main active ingredient. Cationic surfactants adhere well to natural fibers (wool, cotton), but less so to synthetic fibers. Cationic softeners are incompatible with [[anionic surfactant]]s in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that the softener be added in the rinse cycle. Fabric softener reduces the absorbency of textiles, which adversely affects the function of towels and [[microfiber cloth]].\n\nFormerly, the active material of most softeners in Europe, the United States, and Japan, were [[ditallowdimethylammonium chloride]] ([[DTDMAC]]) and [[distearyldimethylammonium chloride]] ([[DSDMAC]]).

On the way, he realizes that no murder really occurred; police have laid a trap for him along with Vishnu to make him confess to Jeena's murder \n(which Sunil has in fact committed by actually pushing her down from the balcony as he could not tolerate her mental illness), and they are probably waiting for him at Vishnu's house to try to record him admitting his guilt as evidence and trap him.

Though Chinnan is apprehended, interrogated and eliminated, Chaukidar remains at bay, continuing to spread his influence.

Police suspect Sunil, but they inform him that \"another\" dead body has been found from his villa, and they bring him in early morning for questioning about that \"dead body\". But no questioning happens all day at the station, and instead police keep telling him that the body was that of one of his nurses, Maya, and all evidence of the murder points to him, including his friend Vishnu's testimony. Sunil escapes from the police station and decides to confront Vishnu to prove his innocence. On the way, he realizes that no murder really occurred; police have laid a trap for him along with Vishnu to make him confess to Jeena's murder \n(which Sunil has in fact committed by actually pushing her down from the balcony as he could not tolerate her mental illness), and they are probably waiting for him at Vishnu's house to try to record him admitting his guilt as evidence and trap him.

In series continuity, it is said that in ancient times (about 500 years before the events of the series), the Great Gummis and humans lived peacefully together side by side, but for reasons left undetailed (it is suggested in the episodes ''Light Makes Right'' and ''The Knights of Gummadoon'' that the more malevolent humans craved the magical and mechanical advancements of the Gummi Bears, and threatened them with war and possible [[genocide]]), the Great Gummis were forced to flee and sail across the sea to find a new home. The ancient Great Gummis left behind small, scattered populations of bears to watch over the Gummi cities and warrens, such as the main group of the series, the Gummi-Glen Gummis, to await the time when humans and Gummis could peacefully co-exist so they could then summon the Great Gummis to return home.\n\n====Gummi-Glen====\nThe Gummi-Glen Gummis are a group of Gummis who live in a hollow tree known as Gummi Glen that is the base for a vast complex of tunnels and rooms. They harvest the Gummiberries that grow wild around them in the forest, and produce a powerful juice known as Gummiberry Juice. They hide from humans, with the exception of friends Cavin, a [[page (servant)|page]], and Princess Calla. It is never explained how they are related to each other, although the episode \"[[List of Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears episodes#ep22|Up, Up, and Away]]\" suggests that they are the last remaining ones in Gummi-Glen, and at risk of extinction.\n\n* '''Zummi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Paul Winchell]] in Seasons 1\u20135, [[Jim Cummings]] in Season 6) - Zummi is an aged bear who is the Gummi-Glen Gummis' leader, although he often defers to the more practical Grammi and Gruffi. He is the \"Keeper of Gummi Wisdom\" and later the holder of the Gummi-Medallion which he uses to read his magic book to become the group's [[magic (paranormal)|magician]]. He is forgetful (he is nearly always shown reciting spells from notes instead of from memory) and clumsy, mis-speaking often with [[spoonerisms]], and his spells tend to back-fire. He also has a [[fear of heights]].\n* '''Gruffi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]] in Season 1, [[Corey Burton]] in Seasons 2\u20136) - Gruffi is an old-fashioned bear who prefers to do things \"the Gummi way.\" An extremely skilled craftsman and mechanic, he fixes the old Gummi technology and trap doors, as well as building traps around the Glen to deal with humans and ogres. Gruffi is a perfectionist, which can be his undoing at times. However, at other times, he is respected as the voice of stability and practical solutions when the other Gummis fall into despair.\n* '''Grammi Gummi''' (voiced by [[June Foray]]) - Grammi is another old bear who is the [[matriarch]] of Gummi-Glen. She acts as the group's mother, who cooks, cleans, and is the Gummi who prepares the Gummiberry Juice. She holds the secret recipe. She has an intense rivalry with Gruffi Gummi, and tends to bicker with him. Her cooking is disliked by most of the others, especially Gruffi.\n* '''Tummi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Lorenzo Music]]) - Tummi is an overweight Gummi, stated to be a little younger than Gusto, who enjoys a good meal, and would much rather be eating the Gummiberries than picking them. Of all the Gummi cubs in Gummi Glen, Tummi is the oldest. He has a rather relaxed and easygoing personality, which often gets him caught up in Cubbi's schemes. However and in dangerous situations, Tummi has shown exceptional bravery, and throughout the series, he demonstrates a natural talent as a sailor, gardener, artist and craftsman.\n* '''Sunni Gummi''' (voiced by [[Katie Leigh]]) - Sunni is a [[preadolescence|preteen]] Gummi, who dreams about becoming a princess just like her best friend, the human Princess Calla. Sunni is the most curious about human culture and human fashion, and least concerned with Gummi history. She is the second oldest of the kid Gummis, behind only Tummi Gummi. Later in the series, she is shown to have a crush on Gusto, and becomes close friends with Buddy.\n* '''Cubbi Gummi''' (voiced by Noelle North) - Cubbi is the youngest Gummi-Glen Gummi (according to the official series' bible around the equivalent of an 8-year-old), and dreams of becoming a great Gummi knight. He is impetuous and gets distracted by anything mysterious or exciting, but his open-mindedness oftentimes enables him to find simple solutions to sticky problems. He sometimes dons a mask and becomes a [[vigilante]] known as the '''Crimson Avenger'''. He is best friends with the human Cavin, and he was the first Gummi that Cavin encountered.\n* '''Augustus \"Gusto\" Gummi''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) - Gusto is an artistic, individualist Gummi who was stranded on a deserted island for twelve years with his best friend '''Artie Deco''', a wise-talking [[toucan]]. Tummi and Gruffi were [[shipwreck]]ed on Gusto's island, just as a [[volcano]] was due to erupt and cause the island to sink into the sea. The three bears worked together and brought Gusto home with them to Gummi Glen during season 2. Gruffi tends to argue with Gusto for his outside-the-box thinking, and how much influence he is on Cubbi and Sunni. Gusto lives by himself in a makeshift apartment behind a waterfall, but lives in Gummi Glen when the weather is too harsh.\n* '''Chummi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) - Chummi is an adventurous Gummi who was the youngest member of his group and therefore last surviving Gummi at Gummerset. Cubbi and Cavin stumbled across an unconscious Chummi and his airship (literally a small wooden ship attached to a hot air blimp) which had been brought down by Duke Igthorn's ogres after he saw it fly over his castle in his latest idea to use the airship to capture Dunwyn castle. Chummi was initially excited when he regained consciousness in Gummi Glen as he was under the impression that it housed hundreds of other Gummis. After repairing his airship, he offered to take the Gummi Glen Gummis with him when he left to continue his search for the Great Gummis. Although initially ecstatic and eager to set off, after some thought, the Gummi Glen Gummis decided that they could not abandon their duty to look after Gummi Glen until it was safe for the return of the Great Gummis. After thwarting Igthorn's plot, Cubbi was the last to change his mind and actually set off with Chummi before asking to be let off at the last moment.\n\n====Ursalia====\nLater in the series, the Gummi-Glen Gummis discover the Great Gummies' abandoned city of Ursalia, largely unoccupied until the Barbics, a tribe of rough-and-tough Gummis from Barbic Woods, move there after their home has been destroyed by hostile humans.\n\n* '''Sir Thornberry '''(voiced by [[Walker Edmiston]]) Sir Thornberry is an old Gummi bear knight. He has been the caretaker for Ursalia for 50 years when we meet him. He is brave and honorable, but also somewhat forgetful and clumsy.\n* '''Ursa''' (voiced by [[Pat Musick]]) - Ursa is the female leader of the Barbic Gummis. She leads the Barbics to Ursalia in search of an \"Ultimate Weapon\" that will let the Barbics [[genocide|wipe out]] the human race, but are eventually convinced to live peacefully in Ursalia. She harbors the most animosity towards humans, but does learn to accept Cavin after he and Buddi save her, Gruffi and Sir Thornberry in the Test of Bearhood.\n* '''Gritty''' (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) - Gritty is Ursa's lieutenant and famous as the Barbics' toughest warrior. Cubbi idolizes him at first, but has to work hard to overcome the latter's antipathy toward humans.\n* '''Buddy''' (voiced by [[Dana Hill]]) - Buddy is a teenaged member of the Barbics, about Sunni's age; more gentle and artistic than the rest of his tribe, he enjoys playing the flute.\n* '''Grubbi''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]) - Grubbi is the head chef of the Barbics. He bonds with Grammi after she compliments his cooking.\n\n===Inhabitants of Castle Dunwyn===\n* '''Cavin''' (voiced by [[Christian Jacobs]] in Season 1, Brett Johnson in Season 2, [[David Faustino]] in Season 3, [[Jason Marsden]] in Season 4\u20135 plus \"Tuxford's Turnaround\" in Season 6, [[R. J. Williams|R.J. Williams]] in Season 6) - A 12-year-old boy, one of the main human characters in the series, and one of the few who believe that Gummi Bears exist, is the [[page (servant)|page]] and [[squire]] of Sir Tuxford, of King Gregor's court. Cavin befriends the Gummi Bears in the first episode and shares the same ambition as Cubbi - to become a knight and why he and Cubbi are best friends. Cavin also had a Gummi medallion, given to him by his grandfather, that opened the Great Book of Gummi, the source of all Gummi Bear wisdom. The young squire has a crush on Princess Calla, which is requited.\n* '''Princess Calla''' (voiced by Noelle North) - Princess Calla is the daughter of King Gregor, ruler of Dunwyn and one of the main human characters. She is an adventurous character of considerable talents, and she often drags the dumbstruck Cavin (of whom she is more than a little fond) into story situations. She also befriended the Gummi Bears in due time and is close friends with Sunni. She hates the pomp and circumstance that comes with being royalty while wishing to be more involved in the governance and defense of the realm. Consequently, she tends to be somewhat rebellious at times, often spurning her father's admonishment that \"a princess must set an example for her people\". However, that does not prevent her from exerting her authority as a princess whenever it suits her purpose. She even proved that she needs no protection, as she had surreptitiously trained herself in the use of weapons.\n* '''King Gregor''' (voiced by [[Michael Rye]]<ref name=variety>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Voiceover actor Michael Rye dies at 94, Bridged the generations from radio to videogame work|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118059865|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>) - King Gregor is the ruler of a fictionalized English kingdom named Dunwyn. He is a benevolent, brave ruler and protects his people from villains like Duke Igthorn with the help of Sir Tuxford and his knights. On occasion he has personally commanded knights in combat when leading a charge against ogres. Gregor is unaware of the Gummi Bears' existence or involvement in saving his kingdom many times. (He has actually met the Gummis on certain occasions, but has not caught on to the fact that his secret benefactors were Gummi Bears). His pride and joy is his daughter, Calla, which later includes considerable respect of her previously hidden fighting prowess which he saw first hand when they inadvertently challenged each other in disguise during a test.\n* '''Sir Tuxford''' (voiced by: Bill Scott in Season 1, [[Roger C. Carmel]] in Season 2, [[Brian Cummings]] in Seasons 3\u20136) - Sir Tuxford is the highest ranking knight in King Gregor's court and his trusted friend. He is an older, jolly character, always ready for a fight but perhaps past his prime. Sir Tuxford leads the knights of Castle Dunwyn and is the main force that keeps Duke Igthorn and his ogres away. His catchphrase is often \"I'm sure I don't know, Sire\" when questioned by King Gregor of the present situation. Despite his age and his appearance, Sir Tuxford has apprehended many troublemakers in Dunwyn and done battle with Igthorn and his ogres.\n* '''Unwin '''(voiced by Will Ryan) - A knight squire at Dunwyn. A big bully, loud-mouth, and in reality a coward, who constantly picks on Cavin. He finally gets his dues when Princess Calla bests him at a tournament for the appointment of the princess' royal protector (''\"Girl's Knight Out\"'').\n* '''Sir Gawain''' (voiced by [[Michael Rye]]) - Cavin's grandfather and retired knight, who also originally found the Gummi Medallion which Cavin had been wearing until he gave it to the Gummi bears. When Gawain was about Cavin's age, a local Gummi bear that owned the medallion practically bowled him over in the forest while bouncing along, and lost the medallion, which Gawain found and retrieved. He wore the medallion in his service as a knight, and in his later years passed it on to Cavin. He is highly idealistic and loves to tell moral fables of the ancient Gummis on every suitable occasion. He has met the Bears of Gummi Glen, but he is unaware that Cavin knows them as well. Having been told by Cavin that he had lost the Gummi medallion, when Sir Gawain saw that Zummi was now wearing it, he was glad it was in the right hands. Most likely named for the knight of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] in the [[Arthurian legend]], though it is possible that he is meant to be the same character. (See [[Gawain]])\n* '''Trina''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris]]) - A blind peasant shepherdess who lives in the Dunwyn region with her sheepdog Watcher and befriends Tummi after he hides in her cottage when on the run from the ogres. She shares a common bond with Tummi in that both are chubby due to their love of food and she wishes to cook for Tummi, who is more than happy to accept. She sets traps to throw Duke Igthorn off the track, teaching Tummi that \"disabled does not mean unable\", and invites him to come visit her whenever he wishes.\n* '''Doctor Dexter''' (voiced by [[Andre Stojka]]) - A [[pharmacist]] who feels he is not owning up to his family's proud reputation of medicine. Tummi uses Gummiberry juice in one of his medicines, which results in Dunywn citizens becoming super strong, but attracts Igthorn as well. Doctor Dexter later realizes his concoction can serve as a super [[fertilizer]] and thus achieves success after all.\n* '''Sir Victor Igthorn''' (voiced by Michael Rye) - He is Duke Igthorn's brother and a famous paladin in the realm of Dunwyn. Ashamed of his family's betrayal (which had remained a dark secret for a major part of his life), he has taken the path of justice to atone for their sins. Fortunately, when Victor eventually confessed to stop his brother's blackmailing, he was relieved to learn that at least the Dunwinians do not hold his family relations against him. Sir Victor has become Cavin's idol and friend, but he is unaware of the Gummi Bears' existence. He can take any insult to himself, but not to his steed Destiny, and has the ability to make ladies (including Calla) swoon when he kisses their hands.\n\n===Villains===\n* '''Duke Sigmund Igthorn''' (voiced by [[Michael Rye]]) - The evil, irascible, vengeful and power-crazed ruler of Castle Drekmore is the main villain of the series. He is also the nemesis of the Gummi Bears. He hunts the Gummi Bears with the aid of his ogre army to get in possession of the Gummiberry juice and their other secrets. His constant attempts to conquer Castle Dunwyn fail typically due to the self-overestimation of his tactical skills, the bearishness of his ogres and the intervention of the Gummi Bears. Once the greatest knight of Dunwyn, he was exiled after [[conspiracy (political)|conspiring]] against King Gregor and found refuge in Castle Drekmore. <br />Igthorn has a big \u2013 and alas unrequited \u2013 crush on Lady Bane. Sigmund Igthorn's brother Sir Victor fights wrongdoing as his antithesis. It is implied in some episodes that Igthorn had a father who had also conspired to control Dunwyn and thus raised his son in that mindset.\n** '''Toadwart''', aka '''Toadie''' (voiced by Bill Scott (Season 1), Corey Burton (Seasons 2-6) - The smallest ogre in Drekmore, and Igthorn's [[Illeism|illeistic]] lieutenant. He seems to genuinely like his \"Dukie\" and, as his name suggests, is a fawning and enduring character who bears most of the bullying and punishment brought upon him by the Duke and his fellow ogres. He is the smartest of his kin, who do respect his ability to read and write. He has a cousin named Tadpole (voiced by [[Chuck McCann]]), who is just as diminutive, but more intelligent and bossier. Although Toadwart is largely an enemy, there are rare occasions where he learns the values the Gummis stand for, such as one time when he decides to impersonate the Crimson Avenger and gets taught a serious lesson about personal honor and the means of service to others.\n** '''Ogres''' (Various Voices) - Duke Igthorn's [[shock troops]]. Big and strong, but also extremely naive and clumsy. Their bumbling incompetence often jeopardizes their duke's \"ingenious\" plans, which constantly drives him insane and brings him to the verge of despair. They are organized in way of military rank, and constantly call Igthorn \"Dukie\" (a slang term for [[feces]]), which he loathes.\n*** '''Zook''' and '''Gad''' (both voiced by [[Will Ryan]]) - Zook and Gad are Igthorn's ogre bodyguards. Their names are taken from \"Gadzook!\". Gad (with purple skin and a helmet) and Zook (with green skin and orange hair) hold the rank of [[corporal]] and [[Private (rank)|private]], respectively. Once, when all the ogres were turned into babies for a while, Zook was called \"Snookums\" by Grammi.\n*** '''Umma''' - This was originally Cavin in disguise, but in a later episode Cubbi was captured by an ogre who also has that name.\n* '''Lady Bane''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) - The main evil witch of the series. She is in possession of a Gummi Medallion much like Zummi's, and craves any power she can get her hands on (including the Gummi Bears') for her bid for power. She is served by her jackal-like Troggles and on occasion by Duke Igthorn, whose crush on her she finds very annoying, although she did agree to a dinner date with Igthorn if she figured it would forge an alliance to destroy the Gummis. She is also vain, at one point in addition to expressing anger that she was foiled by the Gummis, that she chipped one of her nails as well. In one episode, it was discovered that she is extremely old, and uses her magic to \"de-age\" herself into an attractive dark-haired sorceress by stealing Sunni's youth until the other Gummis manage to reverse it. The creators of the television program took inspiration for the character from the historical figure of [[Lucrezia Borgia]].\n* '''Troggles''' \u2013 the servants of Lady Bane. A bunch of  jackals dressing like royal guards. They are quite incompetent and stupid, and like the ogres they are incapable of carry out Lady Bane\u00b4s plans. They are a little smarter than the ogres and have the habit of repeating words.\n* '''The Trolls'''- A band of green-skinned and diminutive thieves trying to do their best to better their positions at the expense of other people. They are very skilled in kitbashing and operating mechanical devices (mostly traps and weapons, like a walnut submachine gun). They are eventually captured by King Gregor's knights and remanded to the dungeon in Dunwyn Castle.\n* '''Carpies''' - A race of vulture-like creatures living on the spire-like Carpy Mountain. They capture Sunni twice \u2013 first for her singing talent, then to become their King (or rather, Queen).\n** '''Carpy King''' (voiced by [[Will Ryan]]) - A bullying Carpie who rules the Carpies while striking fear in them. After the Gummi Bears overthrew the Carpy King, he has been succeeded by Bobo the Dodo.\n* '''Flint Shrubwood''' (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) - A wandering bounty hunter in the tradition of Sergeio Leone's \"Man With No Name\". He is hired by Duke Igthorn in the episode, \"For a Few Sovereigns More\" to catch a Gummi Bear for the promised price of 20 gold sovereigns. Shrubwood resembles [[Clint Eastwood]] in appearance, voice, and mannerisms. He is armed with a pair of boomerang launchers and carries a miniature flute on which he plays a 4-note musical cue as he travels.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''King Jean-Claude''' (voiced by [[Hamilton Camp]]) - The father of Princess Marie and the ruler of a fictionalized French kingdom allied to Dunwyn. His kingdom was once besieged by the Marquis de Bouillabaisse in \"May the Best Princess Win.\"\n* '''Princess Marie''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) - The daughter of King Jean-Claude. Originally a spoiled brat, she considered Calla a rival and picked a fight with her on every occasion. However, after both their lives are saved by the Gummi Bears, she mellows considerably and becomes one of Calla's best friends.\n* '''Prince Yen-Moon''' (voiced by [[Keone Young]]) - A prince from the Far East who travels to Dunwyn in search of help from the Gummies in defending his kingdom from a lethal dragon as seen in \"The Magnificent Seven Gummies.\" Using an ancient Gummi Buddha-like statue, the Gummies are able to defeat the dragon by using it as a teleporting device.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears episodes}}\n{{:List of Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears episodes}}\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS===\n====International releases====\nSeveral [[VHS]] cassettes of the series were released internationally.<ref name=\"cortneywilliams1\">{{cite web|url=http://cortneywilliams.com/gummibears/merch_video.html |title=The Great Site of Gummi |publisher=Cortneywilliams.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref><ref name=\"sealvideo1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sealvideo.co.uk/Disney%20List.htm |title=Disney Video List VHS and DVD Disney Videos, Disney home entertainment DVD Video |publisher=Sealvideo.co.uk |accessdate=2013-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610212907/http://www.sealvideo.co.uk/Disney%20List.htm |archive-date=June 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Of those, eight cassettes containing 32 episodes are listed below.

Consequently, it also became the forerunner to Disney's famous [[Disney Afternoon]] timeslot, which gave way to other famous serialized Disney television series, such as ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. Although many of these subsequently-created shows exceeded ''Gummi Bears'' in budget and length, the show is often credited{{who|date=February 2013}} as a sort of [[prototype]] for all of the animation which followed it.\n\nThe show was so successful in the United Kingdom that the episodes \"A New Beginning\" and \"Faster than a Speeding Tummi\" were released as theatrical featurettes there in 1986 and 1987, alongside ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' and a re-release of Disney's ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nOther appearances of Gummi Bears in other media included one appearance of Gruffi Gummi starring in a [[D-TV]] music video of the [[Elvis Presley]] song \"Teddy Bear\" in 1986.\n\nThe show's popularity also led to a re-theming of [[Disneyland]]'s [[Motor Boat Cruise]], along with a small part of Disneyland that became known as \"Disney Afternoon Avenue.\" The Motor Boat Cruise became the \"Motor Boat Cruise to Gummi Glen\" and plywood characters from the show made Gummiberry Juice along the waterway. The Gummi Bears have also been featured as [[meetable character]]s who greet guests in Disney theme parks.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n=== Cameos ===\n* ''[[ALF (TV series)]]'' (1987): In the TV Movie \"Alf Loves a Mystery\", Gummi Bears clips are interspersed.\n* ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' (1991\u20131992): In the episode \"Life, the Negaverse and Everything\", Zummi Gummi appears as a doll.\n* ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (2012): In the episode \"In Bed Surrounded by Loved Ones\", the Gummi Bears hold an intervention for Tummi's gummiberry juice addiction, though are disturbed when it is revealed that he is attracted to Sunni, which disgusts the other Gummi Bears but Tummi counters by pointing out none of them are related which the other Gummi Bears save for Zummi and Tummi where aware of. \n* ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' (2016): In the episode \"Have a Summer\", Adam watches Gummi Bears on a TV.\n* [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|''DuckTales'']] (2017\u2013present): In the episode \"From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2018/06/29/ducktales-exclusive-clip-with-gummi-bears-easter-egg|title=Ducktales Exclusive Clip With Gummi Bears Easter Egg - IGN|via=www.ign.com}}</ref> the Gummi Bears make a cameo while gummiberry juice factors into the episode's plot.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Television|United States|Cartoon|Disney}}\n* [https://movies.disney.com/adventures-of-the-gummi-bears ''Gummi Bears'' page (Walt Disney)]\n* {{bcdb |Walt_Disney_Studios/Television/Disney_s_Adventures_of_the_Gummi_Bears/|Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n* [http://cortneywilliams.com/gummibears/ The Great Site of Gummi] \u2013 large resource of ''Gummi Bears'' information\n* [http://www.ultimatedisney.com/gummibears-volume1.html Volume 1 DVD review with episode guide and Pictures at UltimateDisney.com]\n* {{IMDb title|id= 0088528|title=Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n* {{tv.com show|gummi-bears|Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n* [http://toonopedia.com/gummi.htm Gummi Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Of the series' 65 shows, 30 consisted of two 11-minute cartoons, thereby bringing the series total to 95 distinct episodes overall.

In series continuity, it is said that in ancient times (about 500 years before the events of the series), the Great Gummis and humans lived peacefully together side by side, but for reasons left undetailed (it is suggested in the episodes ''Light Makes Right'' and ''The Knights of Gummadoon'' that the more malevolent humans craved the magical and mechanical advancements of the Gummi Bears, and threatened them with war and possible [[genocide]]), the Great Gummis were forced to flee and sail across the sea to find a new home. The ancient Great Gummis left behind small, scattered populations of bears to watch over the Gummi cities and warrens, such as the main group of the series, the Gummi-Glen Gummis, to await the time when humans and Gummis could peacefully co-exist so they could then summon the Great Gummis to return home.\n\n====Gummi-Glen====\nThe Gummi-Glen Gummis are a group of Gummis who live in a hollow tree known as Gummi Glen that is the base for a vast complex of tunnels and rooms. They harvest the Gummiberries that grow wild around them in the forest, and produce a powerful juice known as Gummiberry Juice. They hide from humans, with the exception of friends Cavin, a [[page (servant)|page]], and Princess Calla. It is never explained how they are related to each other, although the episode \"[[List of Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears episodes#ep22|Up, Up, and Away]]\" suggests that they are the last remaining ones in Gummi-Glen, and at risk of extinction.\n\n* '''Zummi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Paul Winchell]] in Seasons 1\u20135, [[Jim Cummings]] in Season 6) - Zummi is an aged bear who is the Gummi-Glen Gummis' leader, although he often defers to the more practical Grammi and Gruffi. He is the \"Keeper of Gummi Wisdom\" and later the holder of the Gummi-Medallion which he uses to read his magic book to become the group's [[magic (paranormal)|magician]]. He is forgetful (he is nearly always shown reciting spells from notes instead of from memory) and clumsy, mis-speaking often with [[spoonerisms]], and his spells tend to back-fire. He also has a [[fear of heights]].\n* '''Gruffi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]] in Season 1, [[Corey Burton]] in Seasons 2\u20136) - Gruffi is an old-fashioned bear who prefers to do things \"the Gummi way.\" An extremely skilled craftsman and mechanic, he fixes the old Gummi technology and trap doors, as well as building traps around the Glen to deal with humans and ogres. Gruffi is a perfectionist, which can be his undoing at times. However, at other times, he is respected as the voice of stability and practical solutions when the other Gummis fall into despair.\n* '''Grammi Gummi''' (voiced by [[June Foray]]) - Grammi is another old bear who is the [[matriarch]] of Gummi-Glen. She acts as the group's mother, who cooks, cleans, and is the Gummi who prepares the Gummiberry Juice. She holds the secret recipe. She has an intense rivalry with Gruffi Gummi, and tends to bicker with him. Her cooking is disliked by most of the others, especially Gruffi.\n* '''Tummi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Lorenzo Music]]) - Tummi is an overweight Gummi, stated to be a little younger than Gusto, who enjoys a good meal, and would much rather be eating the Gummiberries than picking them. Of all the Gummi cubs in Gummi Glen, Tummi is the oldest. He has a rather relaxed and easygoing personality, which often gets him caught up in Cubbi's schemes. However and in dangerous situations, Tummi has shown exceptional bravery, and throughout the series, he demonstrates a natural talent as a sailor, gardener, artist and craftsman.\n* '''Sunni Gummi''' (voiced by [[Katie Leigh]]) - Sunni is a [[preadolescence|preteen]] Gummi, who dreams about becoming a princess just like her best friend, the human Princess Calla. Sunni is the most curious about human culture and human fashion, and least concerned with Gummi history. She is the second oldest of the kid Gummis, behind only Tummi Gummi. Later in the series, she is shown to have a crush on Gusto, and becomes close friends with Buddy.\n* '''Cubbi Gummi''' (voiced by Noelle North) - Cubbi is the youngest Gummi-Glen Gummi (according to the official series' bible around the equivalent of an 8-year-old), and dreams of becoming a great Gummi knight. He is impetuous and gets distracted by anything mysterious or exciting, but his open-mindedness oftentimes enables him to find simple solutions to sticky problems. He sometimes dons a mask and becomes a [[vigilante]] known as the '''Crimson Avenger'''. He is best friends with the human Cavin, and he was the first Gummi that Cavin encountered.\n* '''Augustus \"Gusto\" Gummi''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) - Gusto is an artistic, individualist Gummi who was stranded on a deserted island for twelve years with his best friend '''Artie Deco''', a wise-talking [[toucan]]. Tummi and Gruffi were [[shipwreck]]ed on Gusto's island, just as a [[volcano]] was due to erupt and cause the island to sink into the sea. The three bears worked together and brought Gusto home with them to Gummi Glen during season 2. Gruffi tends to argue with Gusto for his outside-the-box thinking, and how much influence he is on Cubbi and Sunni. Gusto lives by himself in a makeshift apartment behind a waterfall, but lives in Gummi Glen when the weather is too harsh.\n* '''Chummi Gummi''' (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) - Chummi is an adventurous Gummi who was the youngest member of his group and therefore last surviving Gummi at Gummerset. Cubbi and Cavin stumbled across an unconscious Chummi and his airship (literally a small wooden ship attached to a hot air blimp) which had been brought down by Duke Igthorn's ogres after he saw it fly over his castle in his latest idea to use the airship to capture Dunwyn castle. Chummi was initially excited when he regained consciousness in Gummi Glen as he was under the impression that it housed hundreds of other Gummis. After repairing his airship, he offered to take the Gummi Glen Gummis with him when he left to continue his search for the Great Gummis. Although initially ecstatic and eager to set off, after some thought, the Gummi Glen Gummis decided that they could not abandon their duty to look after Gummi Glen until it was safe for the return of the Great Gummis. After thwarting Igthorn's plot, Cubbi was the last to change his mind and actually set off with Chummi before asking to be let off at the last moment.\n\n====Ursalia====\nLater in the series, the Gummi-Glen Gummis discover the Great Gummies' abandoned city of Ursalia, largely unoccupied until the Barbics, a tribe of rough-and-tough Gummis from Barbic Woods, move there after their home has been destroyed by hostile humans.\n\n* '''Sir Thornberry '''(voiced by [[Walker Edmiston]]) Sir Thornberry is an old Gummi bear knight. He has been the caretaker for Ursalia for 50 years when we meet him. He is brave and honorable, but also somewhat forgetful and clumsy.\n* '''Ursa''' (voiced by [[Pat Musick]]) - Ursa is the female leader of the Barbic Gummis. She leads the Barbics to Ursalia in search of an \"Ultimate Weapon\" that will let the Barbics [[genocide|wipe out]] the human race, but are eventually convinced to live peacefully in Ursalia. She harbors the most animosity towards humans, but does learn to accept Cavin after he and Buddi save her, Gruffi and Sir Thornberry in the Test of Bearhood.\n* '''Gritty''' (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]) - Gritty is Ursa's lieutenant and famous as the Barbics' toughest warrior. Cubbi idolizes him at first, but has to work hard to overcome the latter's antipathy toward humans.\n* '''Buddy''' (voiced by [[Dana Hill]]) - Buddy is a teenaged member of the Barbics, about Sunni's age; more gentle and artistic than the rest of his tribe, he enjoys playing the flute.\n* '''Grubbi''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]) - Grubbi is the head chef of the Barbics. He bonds with Grammi after she compliments his cooking.\n\n===Inhabitants of Castle Dunwyn===\n* '''Cavin''' (voiced by [[Christian Jacobs]] in Season 1, Brett Johnson in Season 2, [[David Faustino]] in Season 3, [[Jason Marsden]] in Season 4\u20135 plus \"Tuxford's Turnaround\" in Season 6, [[R. J. Williams|R.J. Williams]] in Season 6) - A 12-year-old boy, one of the main human characters in the series, and one of the few who believe that Gummi Bears exist, is the [[page (servant)|page]] and [[squire]] of Sir Tuxford, of King Gregor's court. Cavin befriends the Gummi Bears in the first episode and shares the same ambition as Cubbi - to become a knight and why he and Cubbi are best friends. Cavin also had a Gummi medallion, given to him by his grandfather, that opened the Great Book of Gummi, the source of all Gummi Bear wisdom. The young squire has a crush on Princess Calla, which is requited.\n* '''Princess Calla''' (voiced by Noelle North) - Princess Calla is the daughter of King Gregor, ruler of Dunwyn and one of the main human characters. She is an adventurous character of considerable talents, and she often drags the dumbstruck Cavin (of whom she is more than a little fond) into story situations. She also befriended the Gummi Bears in due time and is close friends with Sunni. She hates the pomp and circumstance that comes with being royalty while wishing to be more involved in the governance and defense of the realm. Consequently, she tends to be somewhat rebellious at times, often spurning her father's admonishment that \"a princess must set an example for her people\". However, that does not prevent her from exerting her authority as a princess whenever it suits her purpose. She even proved that she needs no protection, as she had surreptitiously trained herself in the use of weapons.\n* '''King Gregor''' (voiced by [[Michael Rye]]<ref name=variety>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Voiceover actor Michael Rye dies at 94, Bridged the generations from radio to videogame work|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118059865|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>) - King Gregor is the ruler of a fictionalized English kingdom named Dunwyn. He is a benevolent, brave ruler and protects his people from villains like Duke Igthorn with the help of Sir Tuxford and his knights. On occasion he has personally commanded knights in combat when leading a charge against ogres. Gregor is unaware of the Gummi Bears' existence or involvement in saving his kingdom many times. (He has actually met the Gummis on certain occasions, but has not caught on to the fact that his secret benefactors were Gummi Bears). His pride and joy is his daughter, Calla, which later includes considerable respect of her previously hidden fighting prowess which he saw first hand when they inadvertently challenged each other in disguise during a test.\n* '''Sir Tuxford''' (voiced by: Bill Scott in Season 1, [[Roger C. Carmel]] in Season 2, [[Brian Cummings]] in Seasons 3\u20136) - Sir Tuxford is the highest ranking knight in King Gregor's court and his trusted friend. He is an older, jolly character, always ready for a fight but perhaps past his prime. Sir Tuxford leads the knights of Castle Dunwyn and is the main force that keeps Duke Igthorn and his ogres away. His catchphrase is often \"I'm sure I don't know, Sire\" when questioned by King Gregor of the present situation. Despite his age and his appearance, Sir Tuxford has apprehended many troublemakers in Dunwyn and done battle with Igthorn and his ogres.\n* '''Unwin '''(voiced by Will Ryan) - A knight squire at Dunwyn. A big bully, loud-mouth, and in reality a coward, who constantly picks on Cavin. He finally gets his dues when Princess Calla bests him at a tournament for the appointment of the princess' royal protector (''\"Girl's Knight Out\"'').\n* '''Sir Gawain''' (voiced by [[Michael Rye]]) - Cavin's grandfather and retired knight, who also originally found the Gummi Medallion which Cavin had been wearing until he gave it to the Gummi bears. When Gawain was about Cavin's age, a local Gummi bear that owned the medallion practically bowled him over in the forest while bouncing along, and lost the medallion, which Gawain found and retrieved. He wore the medallion in his service as a knight, and in his later years passed it on to Cavin. He is highly idealistic and loves to tell moral fables of the ancient Gummis on every suitable occasion. He has met the Bears of Gummi Glen, but he is unaware that Cavin knows them as well. Having been told by Cavin that he had lost the Gummi medallion, when Sir Gawain saw that Zummi was now wearing it, he was glad it was in the right hands. Most likely named for the knight of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] in the [[Arthurian legend]], though it is possible that he is meant to be the same character. (See [[Gawain]])\n* '''Trina''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris]]) - A blind peasant shepherdess who lives in the Dunwyn region with her sheepdog Watcher and befriends Tummi after he hides in her cottage when on the run from the ogres. She shares a common bond with Tummi in that both are chubby due to their love of food and she wishes to cook for Tummi, who is more than happy to accept. She sets traps to throw Duke Igthorn off the track, teaching Tummi that \"disabled does not mean unable\", and invites him to come visit her whenever he wishes.\n* '''Doctor Dexter''' (voiced by [[Andre Stojka]]) - A [[pharmacist]] who feels he is not owning up to his family's proud reputation of medicine. Tummi uses Gummiberry juice in one of his medicines, which results in Dunywn citizens becoming super strong, but attracts Igthorn as well. Doctor Dexter later realizes his concoction can serve as a super [[fertilizer]] and thus achieves success after all.\n* '''Sir Victor Igthorn''' (voiced by Michael Rye) - He is Duke Igthorn's brother and a famous paladin in the realm of Dunwyn. Ashamed of his family's betrayal (which had remained a dark secret for a major part of his life), he has taken the path of justice to atone for their sins. Fortunately, when Victor eventually confessed to stop his brother's blackmailing, he was relieved to learn that at least the Dunwinians do not hold his family relations against him. Sir Victor has become Cavin's idol and friend, but he is unaware of the Gummi Bears' existence. He can take any insult to himself, but not to his steed Destiny, and has the ability to make ladies (including Calla) swoon when he kisses their hands.\n\n===Villains===\n* '''Duke Sigmund Igthorn''' (voiced by [[Michael Rye]]) - The evil, irascible, vengeful and power-crazed ruler of Castle Drekmore is the main villain of the series. He is also the nemesis of the Gummi Bears. He hunts the Gummi Bears with the aid of his ogre army to get in possession of the Gummiberry juice and their other secrets. His constant attempts to conquer Castle Dunwyn fail typically due to the self-overestimation of his tactical skills, the bearishness of his ogres and the intervention of the Gummi Bears. Once the greatest knight of Dunwyn, he was exiled after [[conspiracy (political)|conspiring]] against King Gregor and found refuge in Castle Drekmore. <br />Igthorn has a big \u2013 and alas unrequited \u2013 crush on Lady Bane. Sigmund Igthorn's brother Sir Victor fights wrongdoing as his antithesis. It is implied in some episodes that Igthorn had a father who had also conspired to control Dunwyn and thus raised his son in that mindset.\n** '''Toadwart''', aka '''Toadie''' (voiced by Bill Scott (Season 1), Corey Burton (Seasons 2-6) - The smallest ogre in Drekmore, and Igthorn's [[Illeism|illeistic]] lieutenant. He seems to genuinely like his \"Dukie\" and, as his name suggests, is a fawning and enduring character who bears most of the bullying and punishment brought upon him by the Duke and his fellow ogres. He is the smartest of his kin, who do respect his ability to read and write. He has a cousin named Tadpole (voiced by [[Chuck McCann]]), who is just as diminutive, but more intelligent and bossier. Although Toadwart is largely an enemy, there are rare occasions where he learns the values the Gummis stand for, such as one time when he decides to impersonate the Crimson Avenger and gets taught a serious lesson about personal honor and the means of service to others.\n** '''Ogres''' (Various Voices) - Duke Igthorn's [[shock troops]]. Big and strong, but also extremely naive and clumsy. Their bumbling incompetence often jeopardizes their duke's \"ingenious\" plans, which constantly drives him insane and brings him to the verge of despair. They are organized in way of military rank, and constantly call Igthorn \"Dukie\" (a slang term for [[feces]]), which he loathes.\n*** '''Zook''' and '''Gad''' (both voiced by [[Will Ryan]]) - Zook and Gad are Igthorn's ogre bodyguards. Their names are taken from \"Gadzook!\". Gad (with purple skin and a helmet) and Zook (with green skin and orange hair) hold the rank of [[corporal]] and [[Private (rank)|private]], respectively. Once, when all the ogres were turned into babies for a while, Zook was called \"Snookums\" by Grammi.\n*** '''Umma''' - This was originally Cavin in disguise, but in a later episode Cubbi was captured by an ogre who also has that name.\n* '''Lady Bane''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) - The main evil witch of the series. She is in possession of a Gummi Medallion much like Zummi's, and craves any power she can get her hands on (including the Gummi Bears') for her bid for power. She is served by her jackal-like Troggles and on occasion by Duke Igthorn, whose crush on her she finds very annoying, although she did agree to a dinner date with Igthorn if she figured it would forge an alliance to destroy the Gummis. She is also vain, at one point in addition to expressing anger that she was foiled by the Gummis, that she chipped one of her nails as well. In one episode, it was discovered that she is extremely old, and uses her magic to \"de-age\" herself into an attractive dark-haired sorceress by stealing Sunni's youth until the other Gummis manage to reverse it. The creators of the television program took inspiration for the character from the historical figure of [[Lucrezia Borgia]].\n* '''Troggles''' \u2013 the servants of Lady Bane. A bunch of  jackals dressing like royal guards. They are quite incompetent and stupid, and like the ogres they are incapable of carry out Lady Bane\u00b4s plans. They are a little smarter than the ogres and have the habit of repeating words.\n* '''The Trolls'''- A band of green-skinned and diminutive thieves trying to do their best to better their positions at the expense of other people. They are very skilled in kitbashing and operating mechanical devices (mostly traps and weapons, like a walnut submachine gun). They are eventually captured by King Gregor's knights and remanded to the dungeon in Dunwyn Castle.\n* '''Carpies''' - A race of vulture-like creatures living on the spire-like Carpy Mountain. They capture Sunni twice \u2013 first for her singing talent, then to become their King (or rather, Queen).\n** '''Carpy King''' (voiced by [[Will Ryan]]) - A bullying Carpie who rules the Carpies while striking fear in them. After the Gummi Bears overthrew the Carpy King, he has been succeeded by Bobo the Dodo.\n* '''Flint Shrubwood''' (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) - A wandering bounty hunter in the tradition of Sergeio Leone's \"Man With No Name\". He is hired by Duke Igthorn in the episode, \"For a Few Sovereigns More\" to catch a Gummi Bear for the promised price of 20 gold sovereigns. Shrubwood resembles [[Clint Eastwood]] in appearance, voice, and mannerisms. He is armed with a pair of boomerang launchers and carries a miniature flute on which he plays a 4-note musical cue as he travels.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''King Jean-Claude''' (voiced by [[Hamilton Camp]]) - The father of Princess Marie and the ruler of a fictionalized French kingdom allied to Dunwyn. His kingdom was once besieged by the Marquis de Bouillabaisse in \"May the Best Princess Win.\"\n* '''Princess Marie''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) - The daughter of King Jean-Claude. Originally a spoiled brat, she considered Calla a rival and picked a fight with her on every occasion. However, after both their lives are saved by the Gummi Bears, she mellows considerably and becomes one of Calla's best friends.\n* '''Prince Yen-Moon''' (voiced by [[Keone Young]]) - A prince from the Far East who travels to Dunwyn in search of help from the Gummies in defending his kingdom from a lethal dragon as seen in \"The Magnificent Seven Gummies.\" Using an ancient Gummi Buddha-like statue, the Gummies are able to defeat the dragon by using it as a teleporting device.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears episodes}}\n{{:List of Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears episodes}}\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS===\n====International releases====\nSeveral [[VHS]] cassettes of the series were released internationally.<ref name=\"cortneywilliams1\">{{cite web|url=http://cortneywilliams.com/gummibears/merch_video.html |title=The Great Site of Gummi |publisher=Cortneywilliams.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}</ref><ref name=\"sealvideo1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sealvideo.co.uk/Disney%20List.htm |title=Disney Video List VHS and DVD Disney Videos, Disney home entertainment DVD Video |publisher=Sealvideo.co.uk |accessdate=2013-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610212907/http://www.sealvideo.co.uk/Disney%20List.htm |archive-date=June 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Of those, eight cassettes containing 32 episodes are listed below.

However, since November 2016 the show has been available on the UK Disney streaming site DisneyLife.\n\nIn Australia, Disney released nine volumes, which have now long been discontinued.

Episodes 1-18 have not been released on DVD in Australia and are only available on the USA Region 1 collection. However, the [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] Australian DVDs do finish off the series and go right up to episode 65 of the series' final two-part double episode adventure.\n\n''Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears'' was one of the few Disney Afternoon shows that did not get a Capcom-created Nintendo game based on it (''Ducktales'', ''Chip n Dale's Rescue Rangers'', ''Darkwing Duck'', ''Talespin'' all did).\n\n=== Video on demand ===\nOn November 12, 2019, the series became available to stream on [[Disney+]].<ref>{{Disney+ series}}</ref>\n\n==Media adaptations==\n\n===Comic strip===\n\n''Gummi Bears'' was adapted into a daily newspaper comic, which ran from September 1, 1986 to April 1, 1989.

Consequently, it also became the forerunner to Disney's famous [[Disney Afternoon]] timeslot, which gave way to other famous serialized Disney television series, such as ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. Although many of these subsequently-created shows exceeded ''Gummi Bears'' in budget and length, the show is often credited{{who|date=February 2013}} as a sort of [[prototype]] for all of the animation which followed it.\n\nThe show was so successful in the United Kingdom that the episodes \"A New Beginning\" and \"Faster than a Speeding Tummi\" were released as theatrical featurettes there in 1986 and 1987, alongside ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' and a re-release of Disney's ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nOther appearances of Gummi Bears in other media included one appearance of Gruffi Gummi starring in a [[D-TV]] music video of the [[Elvis Presley]] song \"Teddy Bear\" in 1986.\n\nThe show's popularity also led to a re-theming of [[Disneyland]]'s [[Motor Boat Cruise]], along with a small part of Disneyland that became known as \"Disney Afternoon Avenue.\" The Motor Boat Cruise became the \"Motor Boat Cruise to Gummi Glen\" and plywood characters from the show made Gummiberry Juice along the waterway. The Gummi Bears have also been featured as [[meetable character]]s who greet guests in Disney theme parks.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n=== Cameos ===\n* ''[[ALF (TV series)]]'' (1987): In the TV Movie \"Alf Loves a Mystery\", Gummi Bears clips are interspersed.\n* ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' (1991\u20131992): In the episode \"Life, the Negaverse and Everything\", Zummi Gummi appears as a doll.\n* ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (2012): In the episode \"In Bed Surrounded by Loved Ones\", the Gummi Bears hold an intervention for Tummi's gummiberry juice addiction, though are disturbed when it is revealed that he is attracted to Sunni, which disgusts the other Gummi Bears but Tummi counters by pointing out none of them are related which the other Gummi Bears save for Zummi and Tummi where aware of. \n* ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' (2016): In the episode \"Have a Summer\", Adam watches Gummi Bears on a TV.\n* [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|''DuckTales'']] (2017\u2013present): In the episode \"From the Confidential Casefiles of Agent 22!\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2018/06/29/ducktales-exclusive-clip-with-gummi-bears-easter-egg|title=Ducktales Exclusive Clip With Gummi Bears Easter Egg - IGN|via=www.ign.com}}</ref> the Gummi Bears have a cameo, the gummiberry juice also factors into the plot of the episode.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Television|United States|Cartoon|Disney}}\n* [https://movies.disney.com/adventures-of-the-gummi-bears ''Gummi Bears'' page (Walt Disney)]\n* {{bcdb |Walt_Disney_Studios/Television/Disney_s_Adventures_of_the_Gummi_Bears/|Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n* [http://cortneywilliams.com/gummibears/ The Great Site of Gummi] \u2013 large resource of ''Gummi Bears'' information\n* [http://www.ultimatedisney.com/gummibears-volume1.html Volume 1 DVD review with episode guide and Pictures at UltimateDisney.com]\n* {{IMDb title|id= 0088528|title=Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n* {{tv.com show|gummi-bears|Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears}}\n* [http://toonopedia.com/gummi.htm Gummi Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

He worked as a trainee buyer at a city centre department store, the Beehive, with schoolmate [[Bev Bevan]].\n\n==Career==\n\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2016}}\nIn February 1969 he started his own folk club, \"The Boggery\", in nearby [[Solihull]] with his friend Les Ward. Carrott performed folk songs and as an [[MC]]. His banter overtook the songs and he became more a comedian than singer. He also worked as a musical agent (with John Starkey, who was his manager from 1974 to 1992), as Fingimigig, managing among others [[Harvey Andrews]]. He toured UK rugby clubs. He recorded an album in 1973 called ''Jasper Carrot \u2013 In the Club'', which he sold from his van. The album contained the original \"Magic Roundabout\", although mainly material used in his next three LPs (such as \"Hare Krishna\", \"Car Insurance\", \"Bastity Chelt\", and \"Hava Nagila\") plus the [[Fred Wedlock]] song \"The Folker\".\n\nHe had a UK Top 5 chart hit in August 1975 with the novelty record \"[[Funky Moped]]\", written by [[Chris Rohmann]] and produced by [[Jeff Lynne]].\n\nBy the late 1970s, Carrott had developed anecdotal sketches which he still performs. Often they purport to be autobiographical; many celebrate the Birmingham accent and culture, including his support of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].\n\nHis live performances were recorded as ''Jasper Carrott Rabbitts on and on and on...'' and ''Carrott in Notts''. Notable hits were \"Bastity Chelt\", a song in [[Spoonerism]], \"The Football Match\" describing a visit to [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]], \"The Nutter on the Bus\" (including the cry ''\"Has anybody seen my camel?\"''), \"The Mole\" (''\"There's only one way to get rid of a mole \u2013 blow its bloody head off!\"'') and \"Zits\" \u2013 an explanation of American slang for spots that brought the word into use in Britain.\n\n[[File:Birmingham Walk of Stars Jasper Carrott.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birmingham Walk of Stars]]]]\nIn 1979 he published ''A Little Zit on the Side'', a humorous autobiography. The follow-up, ''Sweet and Sour Labrador'', mixed sections of stand-up routines with similar autobiographical material, much of it related to his world travels. Carrott was once a comp\u00e8re for the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]], which featured local bands such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and the [[Moody Blues]], with a finale that included [[George Harrison]] from [[the Beatles]]. On 15 September 2007 he was inducted into the [[Birmingham Walk of Stars]] at the Arts Fest 2007 celebrations. The award was presented by the [[Lord Mayor]] of Birmingham. Carrott is the second inductee, following [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Carrott was awarded the [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] by the [[British Comedy Awards]] on 6 December 2008.\n\nHis first appearance on television was a half-hour show for BBC Midlands on 11 August 1975, in a programme about local football called \"The Golden Game\". In 1976, he appeared in ''A Half Hour Mislaid with Jasper Carrott'', recorded at [[Pebble Mill]]. His big break came two years later, when [[Michael Grade]] asked for a pilot programme for [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]. Grade liked it, and five further shows were recorded, which became his first TV series, ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Jasper Carrott]]'', in 1978.<ref>Ed Doolan interviews...Jasper Carrott (a.k.a.The Other Side of Jasper Carrott) (2005) Radio BBC7</ref> This partnership with LWT lasted until 1981; ''The Unrecorded Jasper Carrott'' (1979) and ''Beat the Carrott'' (1981) are the best-known live stand-up performances from his time with LWT.\n\nCarrott moved to the BBC for ''[[Carrott's Lib]]'', a Saturday night comedy broadcast [[Live television|live]], and then a string of BBC shows. The most notable were ''[[Commercial Breakdown|Carrott's Commercial Breakdown]]'', which broadcast weird [[advert]]s from around the world, and the sketch and stand-up shows ''[[Carrott Confidential]]'', ''24 Carrott Gold'', ''The Trial of Jasper Carrott'' and ''[[Canned Carrott]]'', some of which also featured [[Steve Punt]] and [[Hugh Dennis]].\n\nCarrott played Heinrich in the 1987 British comedy film ''[[Jane and the Lost City]]''.<ref name=\"Official\">{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Jasper Carrott: The Official Website|url=http://www.jaspercarrott.com/biography.asp?SiteID=JAS&M=4&PageID=20&CatType=biog|accessdate=15 November 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713091037/http://www.jaspercarrott.com/biography.asp?SiteID=JAS&M=4&PageID=20&CatType=biog|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n''Canned Carrott'' also featured a [[Parody|spoof]] police drama called ''[[The Detectives (1993 TV series)|The Detectives]]'', co-starring [[Robert Powell]], which later was made into a series. From 2002 to 2004, he starred in the sitcom ''[[All About Me]]''. He performed in several of the ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' charity concerts for [[Amnesty International]], and returned to the stage in 2004 at the [[National Indoor Arena]] in Birmingham featuring classic routines from his career. He returned to singing for the musical ''Go Play Up Your Own End'' (written by [[Malcolm Stent]], songs by [[Harvey Andrews]]) in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2005/05/25/go_play_review_feature.shtml|title=Go Play Up Your Own End|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, he staged and appeared in the first ''Jasper Carrott's Rock With Laughter'' concert.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This became a regular at the NEC in Birmingham, usually in December and sometimes alternating with his \"Jasper Carrott's Christmas Crackers\" events, but there have also been a few summer shows too.\n\nIn summer 2007, Carrott hosted the [[Endemol]]-produced game show ''[[Golden Balls]]'' for [[ITV1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenballstvshow.com/about.html|title=About \u2013 Golden Balls TV Show|work=goldenballstvshow.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104044816/http://www.goldenballstvshow.com/about.html|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Promising ratings led to a second series in January 2008.

He worked as a trainee buyer at a city centre department store, the Beehive, with schoolmate [[Bev Bevan]].\n\n==Career==\n\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2016}}\nIn February 1969 he started his own folk club, \"The Boggery\", in nearby [[Solihull]] with his friend Les Ward. Carrott performed folk songs and as an [[MC]]. His banter overtook the songs and he became more a comedian than singer. He also worked as a musical agent (with John Starkey, who was his manager from 1974 to 1992), as Fingimigig, managing among others [[Harvey Andrews]]. He toured UK rugby clubs. He recorded an album in 1973 called ''Jasper Carrot \u2013 In the Club'', which he sold from his van. The album contained the original \"Magic Roundabout\", although mainly material used in his next three LPs (such as \"Hare Krishna\", \"Car Insurance\", \"Bastity Chelt\", and \"Hava Nagila\") plus the [[Fred Wedlock]] song \"The Folker\".\n\nHe had a UK Top 5 chart hit in August 1975 with the novelty record \"[[Funky Moped]]\", written by [[Chris Rohmann]] and produced by [[Jeff Lynne]].\n\nBy the late 1970s, Carrott had developed anecdotal sketches which he still performs. Often they purport to be autobiographical; many celebrate the Birmingham accent and culture, including his support of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].\n\nHis live performances were recorded as ''Jasper Carrott Rabbitts on and on and on...'' and ''Carrott in Notts''. Notable hits were \"Bastity Chelt\", a song in [[Spoonerism]], \"The Football Match\" describing a visit to [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]], \"The Nutter on the Bus\" (including the cry ''\"Has anybody seen my camel?\"''), \"The Mole\" (''\"There's only one way to get rid of a mole \u2013 blow its bloody head off!\"'') and \"Zits\" \u2013 an explanation of American slang for spots that brought the word into use in Britain.\n\n[[File:Birmingham Walk of Stars Jasper Carrott.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birmingham Walk of Stars]]]]\nIn 1979 he published ''A Little Zit on the Side'', a humorous autobiography. The follow-up, ''Sweet and Sour Labrador'', mixed sections of stand-up routines with similar autobiographical material, much of it related to his world travels. Carrott was once a comp\u00e8re for the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]], which featured local bands such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and the [[Moody Blues]], with a finale that included [[George Harrison]] from [[the Beatles]]. On 15 September 2007 he was inducted into the [[Birmingham Walk of Stars]] at the Arts Fest 2007 celebrations. The award was presented by the [[Lord Mayor]] of Birmingham. Carrott is the second inductee, following [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Carrott was awarded the [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] by the [[British Comedy Awards]] on 6 December 2008.\n\nHis first appearance on television was a half-hour show for BBC Midlands on 11 August 1975, in a programme about local football called \"The Golden Game\". In 1976, he appeared in ''A Half Hour Mislaid with Jasper Carrott'', recorded at [[Pebble Mill]]. His big break came two years later, when [[Michael Grade]] asked for a pilot programme for [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]. Grade liked it, and five further shows were recorded, which became his first TV series, ''[[An Audience with...|An Audience with Jasper Carrott]]'', in 1978.<ref>Ed Doolan interviews...Jasper Carrott (a.k.a.The Other Side of Jasper Carrott) (2005) Radio BBC7</ref> This partnership with LWT lasted until 1981; ''The Unrecorded Jasper Carrott'' (1979) and ''Beat the Carrott'' (1981) are the best-known live stand-up performances from his time with LWT.\n\nCarrott moved to the BBC for ''[[Carrott's Lib]]'', a Saturday night comedy broadcast [[Live television|live]], and then a string of BBC shows. The most notable were ''[[Commercial Breakdown|Carrott's Commercial Breakdown]]'', which broadcast weird [[advert]]s from around the world, and the sketch and stand-up shows ''[[Carrott Confidential]]'', ''24 Carrott Gold'', ''The Trial of Jasper Carrott'' and ''[[Canned Carrott]]'', some of which also featured [[Steve Punt]] and [[Hugh Dennis]].\n\nCarrott played Heinrich in the 1987 British comedy film ''[[Jane and the Lost City]]''.<ref name=\"Official\">{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Jasper Carrott: The Official Website|url=http://www.jaspercarrott.com/biography.asp?SiteID=JAS&M=4&PageID=20&CatType=biog|accessdate=15 November 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713091037/http://www.jaspercarrott.com/biography.asp?SiteID=JAS&M=4&PageID=20&CatType=biog|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n''Canned Carrott'' also featured a [[Parody|spoof]] police drama called ''[[The Detectives (1993 TV series)|The Detectives]]'', co-starring [[Robert Powell]], which later was made into a series. From 2002 to 2004, he starred in the sitcom ''[[All About Me]]''. He performed in several of the ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' charity concerts for [[Amnesty International]], and returned to the stage in 2004 at the [[National Indoor Arena]] in Birmingham featuring classic routines from his career. He returned to singing for the musical ''Go Play Up Your Own End'' (written by [[Malcolm Stent]], songs by [[Harvey Andrews]]) in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2005/05/25/go_play_review_feature.shtml|title=Go Play Up Your Own End|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, he staged and appeared in the first ''Jasper Carrott's Rock With Laughter'' concert.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This became a regular at the NEC in Birmingham, usually in December and sometimes alternating with his \"Jasper Carrott's Christmas Crackers\" events, but there have also been a few summer shows too.\n\nIn summer 2007, Carrott hosted the [[Endemol]]-produced game show ''[[Golden Balls]]'' for [[ITV1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenballstvshow.com/about.html|title=About \u2013 Golden Balls TV Show|work=goldenballstvshow.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104044816/http://www.goldenballstvshow.com/about.html|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Promising ratings led to a second series in January 2008.
