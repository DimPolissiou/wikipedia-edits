It was founded in late September 1913 by the Independent Order of [[B'nai B'rith]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[service organization]]. ADL subsequently split from B'nai B'rith and continued as an independent U.S. Section 501(c)(3) nonprofit. In its 2017 annual information Form 990, ADL reported total revenues of just over $70 million, from contributions and grants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdf.guidestar.org/PDF_Images/2017/131/818/2017-131818723-1035a764-9.pdf|title=ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE FORM 990|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\nADL states that its mission is a dual one: \"To stop the defamation of the Jewish people, and to secure justice and fair treatment to all\" via the development of \"new programs, policies and skills to expose and combat whatever holds us back.\"<ref name=\"ADLCharter\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/who-we-are/our-mission|title=Our Mission|website=Anti-Defamation League|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> Opposing [[Antisemitism]] and extremism, ADL describes its \"ultimate goal\" as \"a world in which no group or individual suffers from bias, discrimination or hate.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|website=Anti-Defamation League|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe headquarters of ADL are located in [[New York City]].

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940).

After hours of closed-door debate at the annual national meeting in New York, the proposal was withdrawn.<ref name=\"Woolhouse\" /> The organization ultimately issued a one-sentence statement, saying \"The National Commission of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today, at its annual meeting, decided to take no further action on the issue of the Armenian genocide.\"<ref>http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5162_00.htm</ref>\n\nThe ADL was criticized by many in the Armenian community, including ''The Armenian Weekly'' newspaper, in which writer Michael Mensoian stated:\n\n{{quote|The belated backtracking of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in acknowledging the planned, systematic massacre of 1,500,000 Armenian men, women and children as \"\u2026tantamount to genocide\u2026\" is discouraging. Tantamount means something is equivalent. If it's equivalent, why avoid using the term? For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R.

The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

After hours of closed-door debate at the annual national meeting in New York, the proposal was withdrawn.<ref name=\"Woolhouse\" /> The organization ultimately issued a one-sentence statement, saying \"The National Commission of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today, at its annual meeting, decided to take no further action on the issue of the Armenian genocide.\"<ref>http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/5162_00.htm</ref>\n\nThe ADL was criticized by many in the Armenian community, including ''The Armenian Weekly'' newspaper, in which writer Michael Mensoian stated:\n\n{{quote|The belated backtracking of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in acknowledging the planned, systematic massacre of 1,500,000 Armenian men, women and children as \"\u2026tantamount to genocide\u2026\" is discouraging. Tantamount means something is equivalent. If it's equivalent, why avoid using the term? For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R.

The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

This was rejected by the political representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, who had boycotted the referendum.

Tensions between Croats and Bosniaks increased throughout late 1992, resulting in the [[Croat\u2013Bosniak War]] that escalated in early 1993.{{sfn|Christia|2012|p=172}} The Bosnian War was characterised by bitter fighting, indiscriminate [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] of cities and towns, [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[Wartime sexual violence|systematic mass rape]], mainly perpetrated by Serb,{{sfn|Wood|2013|pp=140, 343}} and to a lesser extent, Croat<ref>[[#Forsythe|Forsythe 2009]], p. 145</ref> and Bosniak<ref name=\"fas.org\">[https://fas.org/irp/cia/product/bosnia_handout.html CIA Report \u2013 \"Ethnic Cleansing\" and Atrocities in Bosnia]</ref> forces. Events such as the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] and the [[Srebrenica massacre]] later became iconic of the conflict.\n\nThe Serbs, although initially militarily superior due to the weapons and resources provided by the JNA, eventually lost momentum as the Bosniaks and Croats allied themselves against the Republika Srpska in 1994 with the creation of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] following the [[Washington agreement]]. Pakistan defied the [[United Nations|UN]]'s ban on supply of arms and airlifted missiles to the Bosnian Muslims, while after the Srebrenica and [[Markale massacre|Markale]] massacres, [[NATO]] intervened in 1995 with [[Operation Deliberate Force]] targeting the positions of the Army of the Republika Srpska, which proved key in ending the war.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Cohen|authorlink=Roger Cohen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/world/conflict-balkans-overview-nato-presses-bosnia-bombing-vowing-make-sarajevo-safe.html|title=Conflict in the Balkans: The overview; NATO presses Bosnia bombing, vowing to make Sarajevo safe|work=The New York Times|date=31 August 1995|accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=To End a War|last=Holbrooke|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Holbrooke|publisher=Modern Library|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/toendwar00holb_0/page/102 102]|isbn=978-0-375-75360-2|oclc=40545454|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/toendwar00holb_0/page/102}}</ref>{{better source|date=August 2017}} The war was brought to an end after the signing of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina in Paris on 14 December 1995.

In Yugoslavia, the national [[communist party]], the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], was losing its ideological potency. Meanwhile, ethnic nationalism experienced a renaissance in the 1980s, after violence broke out in [[Kosovo]].<ref name=Pavkovic>{{cite book|last=Pavkovic|first=Aleksandar|title=The fragmentation of Yugoslavia: nationalism and war in the Balkans|publisher=MacMillan Press|year=1997|page=85|isbn=978-0-312-23084-5}}</ref> While the goal of [[Serbian nationalist]]s was the centralisation of Yugoslavia, other nationalities in Yugoslavia aspired to the federalisation and the decentralisation of the state.<ref name=Crnobanja>{{cite book|last=Crnobrnja|first=Mihailo|title=The Yugoslav drama |publisher=I.B.

Serbia, under newly elected President [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], thus gained control over three out of eight votes in the Yugoslav presidency. With additional votes from Montenegro, Serbia was thus able to heavily influence the decisions of the federal government.

The October 1995 bulletin of the Bosnian Institute for Public Health of the Republic Committee for Health and Social Welfare gave the numbers as 146,340 killed, and 174,914 wounded on the territory under the control of the Bosnian army. Mustafa Imamovic gave a figure of 144,248 perished (including those who died from hunger or exposure), mainly Muslims. The Red Cross and the UNHCR have not, to the best of our knowledge, produced data on the number of persons killed and injured in the course of the war. A November 1995 unclassified CIA memorandum estimated 156,500 civilian deaths in the country (all but 10,000 of them in Muslim- or Croat-held territories), not including the 8,000 to 10,000 then still missing from Srebrenica and Zepa enclaves.

Academics Steven Burg and Paul Shoup argue that:\n\n{{bquote|From the outset, the nature of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was subject to conflicting interpretations. These were rooted not only in objective facts on the ground, but in the political interests of those articulating them.{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}}}\n\nOn the one hand, the war could be viewed as \"a clear-cut case of civil war \u2013 that is, of internal war among groups unable to agree on arrangements for sharing power\".{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}\n\n[[David Campbell (academic)|David Campbell]] is critical of narratives about \"civil war\", which he argues often involve what he terms \"moral levelling\", in which all sides are \"said to be equally guilty of atrocities\", and \"emphasise credible Serb fears as a rationale for their actions\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Metabosnia: Narratives of the Bosnian War|journal=Review of International Studies|first=David|last=Campbell|year=1998|volume=24|issue=2|pages=261\u201381|jstor=20097522|doi=10.1017/S0260210598002617|ref=harv}}<!--|accessdate=25 April 2015--></ref>\n\n{{bquote| In contrast to the civil war explanation, Bosniaks, many Croats, western politicians and human rights organizations claimed that the war was a war of Serbian and Croatian aggression based on the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evo agreement|Kara\u0111or\u0111evo]] and [[Graz agreement]]s, while Serbs often considered it a civil war. {{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}}}\n\nBosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats enjoyed substantial political and military backing from Serbia and Croatia, and the decision to grant Bosnia diplomatic recognition also had implications for the international interpretation of the conflict. As Burg and Shoup state:\n{{bquote| From the perspective of international diplomacy and law...the international decision to recognize the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina and grant it membership in the United Nations provided a basis for defining the war as a case of external aggression by both Serbia and Croatia. With respect to Serbia, the further case could be made that the Bosnian Serb army was under the ''de facto'' command of the Yugoslav army and was therefore an instrument of external aggression. With respect to Croatia, regular Croatian army forces violated the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, lending further evidence in support of the view that this was a case of aggression. {{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}}}\n\n[[Sumantra Bose]], meanwhile, argues that it is possible to characterise the Bosnian War as a civil war, without necessarily agreeing with the narrative of Serb and Croat nationalists. He states that while \"all episodes of severe violence have been sparked by 'external' events and forces, local society too has been deeply implicated in that violence\" and therefore argues that \"it makes relatively more sense to regard the 1992\u201395 conflict in Bosnia as a 'civil war' \u2013 albeit obviously with a vital dimension that is territorially external to Bosnia\".{{sfn|Bose|2002|p=21}}\n\nIn the cases involving [[Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107]] and [[Zdravko Muci\u0107]], the ICTY concluded that the conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was an international one:\n{{bquote| [F]or the period material to this case (1992), the armed forces of the Republika Srpska were to be regarded as acting under the overall control of and on behalf of the FRY (the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

Following a number of violent incidents in early 1992, the war is commonly viewed as having started on 6 April 1992. The war ended on 14 December 1995. The main belligerents were the forces of the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and those of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Serb entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Republika Srpska (1992\u201395)|Republika Srpska]] and [[Herzeg-Bosnia]], which were led and supplied by [[Republic of Serbia (1990\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Croatia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf|title=ICJ: The genocide case: Bosnia v.

Following the [[Slovenia]]n and Croatian secessions from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1991, the multi-ethnic [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] \u2013 which was inhabited by mainly [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Bosniaks]] (44 percent), as well as [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] (32.5 percent) and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Croats]] (17 percent) \u2013 passed a referendum for independence on 29 February 1992. This was rejected by the political representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, who had boycotted the referendum. Following Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of [[independence]] (which gained international recognition) and following  the withdrawal of Alija Izetbegovi\u0107 from the previously signed [[Peace plans proposed before and during the Bosnian War#Carrington\u2013Cutileiro plan|Cutileiro Plan]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~sstedman/2006.readings/lisbon.pdf |title=From Lisbon to Dayton: International Mediation and the Bosnia Crisis|accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref> (which proposed a division of Bosnia into ethnic cantons), the [[Bosnian Serbs]], led by [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]] and supported by the Serbian government of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), mobilised their forces inside Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to secure ethnic Serb territory, then war soon spread across the country, accompanied by [[ethnic cleansing]].\n\nThe conflict was initially between the Yugoslav Army units in Bosnia which later transformed into the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) on the one side, and the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) which was largely composed of Bosniaks, and the Croat forces in the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) on the other side. Tensions between Croats and Bosniaks increased throughout late 1992, resulting in the [[Croat\u2013Bosniak War]] that escalated in early 1993.{{sfn|Christia|2012|p=172}} The Bosnian War was characterised by bitter fighting, indiscriminate [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] of cities and towns, [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[Wartime sexual violence|systematic mass rape]], mainly perpetrated by Serb,{{sfn|Wood|2013|pp=140, 343}} and to a lesser extent, Croat<ref>[[#Forsythe|Forsythe 2009]], p. 145</ref> and Bosniak<ref name=\"fas.org\">[https://fas.org/irp/cia/product/bosnia_handout.html CIA Report \u2013 \"Ethnic Cleansing\" and Atrocities in Bosnia]</ref> forces. Events such as the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] and the [[Srebrenica massacre]] later became iconic of the conflict.\n\nThe Serbs, although initially militarily superior due to the weapons and resources provided by the JNA, eventually lost momentum as the Bosniaks and Croats allied themselves against the Republika Srpska in 1994 with the creation of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] following the [[Washington agreement]]. Pakistan defied the [[United Nations|UN]]'s ban on supply of arms and airlifted missiles to the Bosnian Muslims, while after the Srebrenica and [[Markale massacre|Markale]] massacres, [[NATO]] intervened in 1995 with [[Operation Deliberate Force]] targeting the positions of the Army of the Republika Srpska, which proved key in ending the war.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Cohen|authorlink=Roger Cohen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/world/conflict-balkans-overview-nato-presses-bosnia-bombing-vowing-make-sarajevo-safe.html|title=Conflict in the Balkans: The overview; NATO presses Bosnia bombing, vowing to make Sarajevo safe|work=The New York Times|date=31 August 1995|accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=To End a War|last=Holbrooke|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Holbrooke|publisher=Modern Library|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/toendwar00holb_0/page/102 102]|isbn=978-0-375-75360-2|oclc=40545454|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/toendwar00holb_0/page/102}}</ref>{{better source|date=August 2017}} The war was brought to an end after the signing of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina in Paris on 14 December 1995.

The October 1995 bulletin of the Bosnian Institute for Public Health of the Republic Committee for Health and Social Welfare gave the numbers as 146,340 killed, and 174,914 wounded on the territory under the control of the Bosnian army. Mustafa Imamovic gave a figure of 144,248 perished (including those who died from hunger or exposure), mainly Muslims. The Red Cross and the UNHCR have not, to the best of our knowledge, produced data on the number of persons killed and injured in the course of the war.

Academics Steven Burg and Paul Shoup argue that:\n\n{{bquote|From the outset, the nature of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was subject to conflicting interpretations. These were rooted not only in objective facts on the ground, but in the political interests of those articulating them.{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}}}\n\nOn the one hand, the war could be viewed as \"a clear-cut case of civil war \u2013 that is, of internal war among groups unable to agree on arrangements for sharing power\".{{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}\n\n[[David Campbell (academic)|David Campbell]] is critical of narratives about \"civil war\", which he argues often involve what he terms \"moral levelling\", in which all sides are \"said to be equally guilty of atrocities\", and \"emphasise credible Serb fears as a rationale for their actions\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Metabosnia: Narratives of the Bosnian War|journal=Review of International Studies|first=David|last=Campbell|year=1998|volume=24|issue=2|pages=261\u201381|jstor=20097522|doi=10.1017/S0260210598002617|ref=harv}}<!--|accessdate=25 April 2015--></ref>\n\n{{bquote| In contrast to the civil war explanation, Bosniaks, many Croats, western politicians and human rights organizations claimed that the war was a war of Serbian and Croatian aggression based on the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evo agreement|Kara\u0111or\u0111evo]] and [[Graz agreement]]s, while Serbs often considered it a civil war. {{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}}}\n\nBosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats enjoyed substantial political and military backing from Serbia and Croatia, and the decision to grant Bosnia diplomatic recognition also had implications for the international interpretation of the conflict. As Burg and Shoup state:\n{{bquote| From the perspective of international diplomacy and law...the international decision to recognize the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina and grant it membership in the United Nations provided a basis for defining the war as a case of external aggression by both Serbia and Croatia. With respect to Serbia, the further case could be made that the Bosnian Serb army was under the ''de facto'' command of the Yugoslav army and was therefore an instrument of external aggression. With respect to Croatia, regular Croatian army forces violated the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, lending further evidence in support of the view that this was a case of aggression. {{sfn|Burg|Shoup|2000|pp=169\u2013191}}}}\n\n[[Sumantra Bose]], meanwhile, argues that it is possible to characterise the Bosnian War as a civil war, without necessarily agreeing with the narrative of Serb and Croat nationalists. He states that while \"all episodes of severe violence have been sparked by 'external' events and forces, local society too has been deeply implicated in that violence\" and therefore argues that \"it makes relatively more sense to regard the 1992\u201395 conflict in Bosnia as a 'civil war' \u2013 albeit obviously with a vital dimension that is territorially external to Bosnia\".{{sfn|Bose|2002|p=21}}\n\nIn the cases involving [[Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107]] and [[Zdravko Muci\u0107]], the ICTY concluded that the conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was an international one:\n{{bquote| [F]or the period material to this case (1992), the armed forces of the Republika Srpska were to be regarded as acting under the overall control of and on behalf of the FRY (the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier mailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam.

coronavirus pandemic]], was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier mailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', was critized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam.

The award is given to the winner of a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and playoff between the Bogart Cup champions of the [[Central Canada Hockey League]], the Kent Cup champions of the [[Maritime Junior Hockey League]], La Coupe NAPA Champions of the [[Quebec Junior Hockey League]], and a pre-determined host team.  The winner of the Fred Page Cup moves on to the [[Centennial Cup]], the national Junior A championship.  The trophy was donated by the then-called [[Quebec Provincial Junior Hockey League]] in 1994\u201395.\n\n==History==\nThe first Fred Page Cup was awarded in 1995.  The trophy was donated by the [[Quebec Junior Hockey League|Quebec Provincial Junior A Hockey League]] to create an Eastern Canadian Championship in honour of past [[Hockey Canada|Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] President [[Fred Page]].  The 1995 Championship marked the first time teams outside of the [[maritime provinces]] were allowed to compete for the Eastern Canadian Championship for a berth to the [[Royal Bank Cup|National Championship]].  Now allowed are the maritime champions, the Quebec champions, and the [[Ottawa]] District champions of the [[Central Canada Hockey League]].  Prior to 1995, the Callaghan Cup was the championship trophy of Eastern Canada to be played for by a representative of the maritime provinces.  Early championships were dominated by the [[Island Junior Hockey League (1973\u20131991)|Island Junior Hockey League]].  In the early 1990s, the top teams of the IJHL jumped to the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]].\n\nThe Ottawa Jr. Senators were awarded the 2003 Fred Page Cup in the fall of 2001, but over the summer of 2002, the tournament was awarded the Cornwall Colts instead. This was mostly due to the size of the Jr. Senators arena and the conflict with other groups, therefore the event couldn't be attainable. The [[Nepean Raiders]] surprisingly never bid for the tournament, despite reaching the league finals eight times between 2003 and 2013. The event could not be supported with a low fan-base and reaching an agreement with the city. The 2006 Fred Page Cup was then awarded to [[Pembroke, Ontario]] and the [[Pembroke Lumber Kings]].\n\nTo date,{{when|date=March 2020}} the [[Central Canada Hockey League]] has won the Fred Page Cup seven times, winning the Royal Bank Cup finals once, ([[Pembroke Lumber Kings]]) since its inception in 1996. The [[Quebec Junior Hockey League]] has won the Fred Page Cup only three times, and no team from Quebec have qualified for the Royal Bank Cup finals. The [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]] is the only league to win the Fred Page Cup and have teams win the Royal Bank Cup, as the [[Summerside Capitals]] won in 1997 and the [[Halifax Oland Exports]] won in 2002.\n\nThe 2010 Fred Page Cup was awarded to the [[Brockville Braves]], who also hosted the tournament in 1997. Brockville won the 2010 Fred Page Cup by defeating the Pembroke Lumber Kings 5\u20131. The Braves are the second host team since the 1998\u201399 [[Charlottetown Abbies]], who defeated the CCHL's Hawkesbury Hawks 2\u20130 at the [[Charlottetown Civic Centre]]. The [[Pembroke Lumber Kings]] are the only team to compete in six consecutive Fred Page Cup tournaments from 2006 to 2011, winning the tournament twice in 2007 and 2011, and losing the finals in 2006 and 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the traditional circulation was broken, when [[Dieppe, New Brunswick]], and the Dieppe Commandos were awarded the tournament instead of a team from the [[Central Canada Hockey League]]. Maritime Hockey League champions [[Summerside Western Capitals]] elected to play their Fred Page Cup games in [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island]], but this idea was quickly nixed because of a disagreement from the Quebec Junior Hockey League champion [[Sherbrooke Cougars]].\n\nThe Kanata Stallions were chosen to host the 2012 Fred Page Cup, despite the team's poor performances since re-branding from the Kanata Valley Lasers in 2002. The Stallions managed to qualify for the semi-finals and avoided elimination with an over-time win over their crosstown rivals Nepean Raiders. The Kanata Stallions finished in third place in the tournament.\n\nThe [[Carleton Place Canadians]] became the first team to win back-to-back Fred Page Cup championships during the tournament's inception in 1996. They continued their streak with three straight wins from 2014 to 2016.\n\nThe 2018 tournament was awarded to Ottawa, which made it the second time the tournament was played in the Ottawa area. Pembroke placed a bid, but was passed over in favor of Ottawa.

Following their television work, they began making films, including ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979) and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of [[cult following|cult]] performers from the early editions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' through to more recent [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] trends in television comedy. \"[[wikt:Pythonesque|Pythonesque]]\" has entered the English lexicon as a result.\n\nAt the [[41st British Academy Film Awards]] in 1988, Monty Python received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 1998 they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]]. Many sketches from their TV show and films are well-known and widely quoted. Both ''Holy Grail'' and ''Life of Brian'' are frequently ranked in lists of greatest comedy films. In a 2005 poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors throughout the [[English-speaking world]] to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", three of the six Pythons members were voted to be among the top 50 greatest comedians ever: Cleese at No. 2, Idle at No. 21, and Palin at No. 30.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|work=The Guardian|date=2 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4141019.stm|title=Cook voted 'comedians' comedian'|work=BBC News|date=2 January 2005|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Before ''Flying Circus''==\nJones and Palin met at [[Oxford University]], where they performed together with [[the Oxford Revue]].

At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the [[BBC]], which had been impressed by their work on ''The Frost Report'' and ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on ''How to Irritate People'' and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle\u2014who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name=\"auto\">''The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons''.

Thomas Dunne Books; Orion, 2003</ref>\n\nBy contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography, the origins of ''Monty Python'' lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on ''Do Not Adjust Your Set''; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.<ref>''So, Anyway ...'' by John Cleese; Crown Archetype, London, 2014</ref> According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead on 11 May 1969, following a taping of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' which Cleese and Chapman attended.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCall |first1=Douglas.

They were admirers of the work of [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]] on ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]''\u2014seminal to the British \"[[satire boom]]\"\u2014and had worked on ''Frost'', which was similar in style.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1377417/index.html \"The Roots of Monty Python\"]. BFI Screenonline. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to \"cap\" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the ''Flying Circus'' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in\"\u2014they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).<ref>[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/silliest.php \"The Silliest Interview We've Ever Had / The Silliest Sketch We've Ever Done\"]. MontyPython.net. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, [[Spike Milligan]], whom they had admired on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' (a show the Pythons regard as their biggest influence, which also featured [[Peter Sellers]], whom Cleese called \u201cthe greatest voice man of all time\u201d) recording his groundbreaking BBC series ''[[Q...

Featuring Cleese as a [[bowler hat|bowler-hatted]] [[civil servant]] in a fictitious British government ministry responsible for developing silly walks through [[Grant (money)|grants]], it appears in season 2, episode 1 of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.]]\nAfter much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' called \"Beware of the Elephants\", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style. Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled \"Christmas Cards\", and agreed that it represented \"a way of doing things differently\". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the ''Flying Circus'' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single [[stream-of-consciousness]] (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/> The BBC states, \u201cGilliam's unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.\u201d<ref name=\"Circus profile\">{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |accessdate=24 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWriting started at 9&nbsp;am and finished at 5&nbsp;pm. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a \"writer\", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\n[[file:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_12_46_43_(14415411808).jpg|thumb|left|Gilliam, Palin and Jones performing \u201c[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]\u201d sketch during the 2014 Python reunion. As a sketch writer and creator of the animations, although Gilliam did considerably less acting, he did have some notable sketch roles such as this (Cardinal Fang).]]\nWhile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many \"confrontation\" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as \"The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s\"). Cleese confirmed that \"most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's\".<ref>Wilmut (1980), p. 211</ref> Gilliam's animations ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\nSeveral names for the show were considered before ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was settled upon. Some were ''Owl Stretching Time'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket'', ''Vaseline Review'', and ''Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot''. ''Flying Circus'' stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). ''Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus'' was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' was considered as an affectionate tribute to [[Barry Took]], the man who had brought them together.<ref>{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}</ref> ''Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus'' was suggested, then discarded. The name ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' had the form of ''[[Baron Manfred von Richthofen]]'s [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]'' of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the [[Royal Guardsmen]]'s 1966 song \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as [[flying circus|barnstorming]], where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus \u2013 Four Yorkshiremen |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/02/monty-pythons-flying-circus-four-yorkshiremen.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref>\n\nDiffering, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only \"significance\" was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary ''Live at Aspen'' during the [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]], where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]], the group implied that \"Monty\" was selected (Eric Idle's idea) as a gently mocking tribute to [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery]], a British general of [[World War II]]; requiring a \"slippery-sounding\" surname, they settled on \"Python\". On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name \"Monty\" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, \"Has Monty been in yet?\", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being \"envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Comedy \u2013 Monty Python}}</ref>\n\n===Style of the show===\n''Flying Circus'' popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the [[cold open]], in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements.<ref name=MBC_piece>{{cite web|last=Museum of Broadcast Communications|title=Monty Python's Flying Circus|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/montypython/montypython.htm}}</ref> An example of this is the \"It's\" man: Palin, outfitted in [[Robinson Crusoe]] garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, \"It's&nbsp;...\", only to be then cut off by the [[title sequence]] and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: a golden age of British comedy |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/monty-python-a-golden-age-of-british-comedy-1.371481 |accessdate=20 August 2019 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref> On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's \"anti-silliness\" character of \"[[The Colonel (Monty Python)|the Colonel]]\", who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming \"far too silly\".<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Langley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10948113/Monty-Python-Will-the-wrinkly-revolutionaries-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Monty Python : Will the wrinkly revolutionaries have the last laugh?|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=5 July 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monty python foot.png|thumb|right|[[The Foot of Cupid|Cupid's foot]], as used by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.

Garrison produced the NBC series ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]'', which ran during the summer of 1974.  The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches \"Bicycle Repairman\" and \"The Dull Life of a Stockbroker\". Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences.\n\nIn 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast two 90-minute ''Monty Python'' specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience.  As the judge observed in ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.]]'', where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, \"According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public.\"  Monty Python won the case.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/integrity/Links/Cases/gilliam.html|title=Terry Gilliam et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants-Appellees, v.

''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' was based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. ''Holy Grail'' was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only \u00a3229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as UK music industry entrepreneur [[Tony Stratton-Smith]] (founder and owner of the [[Charisma Records]] label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-06/entertainment/0905050391_1_holy-grail-monty-python-john-goldstone|title=Cue the coconuts: 'Holy Grail' gallops on|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=6 May 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe backers of the film wanted to cut the famous [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] scene (a [[Sam Peckinpah]] send-up in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie.<ref>Interview with John Cleese on Q-The Podcast with host John Ghomeshi, on 16 July 2009</ref> \"Tis but a scratch\" and \"It's just a flesh wound\u2026\" are often quoted.<ref name=\"Python quotes\">{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=18 August 2019 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. and viewers in a [[Channel 4]] poll placed it sixth.<ref name=\"Channel4 comedies\"/>\n\n====''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' (1979)====\n{{Main|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}\nFollowing the success of ''Holy Grail'', reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one.

Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python|Parrot Sketch Not Included]],'' where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds.

Several shows were to be linked with Q&A meetings in various cities. Although all had said yes, Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour. This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening. In 2002, four of the surviving members, bar Cleese, performed \"The Lumberjack Song\" and \"[[Sit on My Face]]\" for [[Concert for George|George Harrison's memorial concert]].

Cleese's feeling was that ''The Meaning of Life'' had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the ''Grail'' and ''Brian'' films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance).

The memoir ''A Liar's Autobiography'' was published in 1980 and details Chapman's journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: \"Nothing&nbsp;... it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie.\" The film uses Chapman's own voice\u2014from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer\u2014and entertainment channel [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] announced the film's release in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats. Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Ben Timlett, and Jeff Simpson, the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length, each in a different style. John Cleese recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman's voice. Michael Palin voiced Chapman's father and Terry Jones voiced his mother. Terry Gilliam voiced Graham's psychiatrist.

He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. Idle wrote the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Spamalot]]'', based on ''Holy Grail''.

''The Life of Python''. p. 40. Pavilion</ref> Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members\u2014in particular Cleese\u2014with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often under-rated. However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian's mother Mandy in ''Life of Brian'', \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\", a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2131880,00.html|title=The last laugh: your favourite 50|work=The Observer|location=UK|first1=Philip|last1=French|first2=Mark|last2=Kermode|first3=Jason|last3=Solomons|first4=Akin|last4=Ojumu|first5=Killian|last5=Fox|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385293/Life-of-Brian-wins-the-vote-for-film's-best-laughter-line.html|title=Life of Brian wins the vote for film's best laughter line|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=19 February 2002|accessdate=21 September 2008|location=London}}</ref> Jones died on 21 January 2020 from complications of dementia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python star Terry Jones dies aged 77 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51209197 |accessdate=22 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Palin|Sir Michael Palin]] attended [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series ''Ripping Yarns'' together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After ''Flying Circus'', Palin hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled ''Michael Palin Diaries 1969\u20131979'', published in 2007.

Occasionally such people have been referred to as the 'seventh Python', in a style reminiscent of [[George Martin]] (or other associates of the Beatles) being dubbed \"the [[Fifth Beatle]]\".  The two collaborators with the most meaningful and plentiful contributions have been [[Neil Innes]] and [[Carol Cleveland]]. Both were present and presented as Associate Pythons at the official Monty Python 25th-anniversary celebrations held in Los Angeles in July 1994.<ref>{{citation |title=Python Comeback |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?/sotcaa/pythonpages/python_press_1990_99.html |accessdate=2007-09-09 |date=3 March 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201010035/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?%2Fsotcaa%2Fpythonpages%2Fpython_press_1990_99.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n[[File:10.18.09CarolClevelandByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carol Cleveland]] (in 2009), commonly called \u201cPython girl\u201d, or \u201cSeventh Python\u201d.<ref name=\"25 sketches\"/>]]\n[[Neil Innes]] is the only non-Python besides [[Douglas Adams]] to be credited with writing material for ''Flying Circus''. He appeared in sketches and the Python films, as well as performing some of his songs in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]''.

He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat [[Bonzo Dog Band]]. He would later portray Ron Nasty of [[the Rutles]] and write all of the Rutles' compositions for ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978), a [[mockumentary]] film co-directed by Idle. By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles \"reunion\" album ''The Rutles: Archaeology'' and Idle's straight-to-DVD ''The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch'', each undertaken without the other's participation. According to an interview with Idle in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back \"too far.

She was originally hired by producer/director [[John Howard Davies]] for just the first five episodes of the ''Flying Circus''.

Her most significant role was the \"best girl\" of the eponymous Lumberjack in \"The Lumberjack Song\", though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland. Booth appeared in a total of six sketches and also played one-off characters in Python feature films ''And Now for Something Completely Different'' and ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Comedy: Connie Booth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/connie_booth_person_page.shtml |accessdate=20 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n[[Douglas Adams]] was \"discovered\" by Chapman when a version of ''Footlights Revue'' (a 1974 BBC2 television show featuring some of Adams' early work) was performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. In Cleese's absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called \"[[Patient Abuse]]\". In the sketch\u2014a satire on mind-boggling bureaucracy\u2014a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill in numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus, Series 4, Episode 6 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031d26j |accessdate=29 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref> He also had two cameo appearances in this season. Firstly, in the episode \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a \"pepperpot\" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (\"Any old iron&nbsp;...\"). Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6150254.stm|title='Lost' gems from the TV archives|agency=BBC News \u2013 Entertainment|access-date=19 August 2019}}</ref> He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.\n\nOther than Carol Cleveland, the only other non-Python to make a significant number of appearances in the ''Flying Circus'' was [[Ian Davidson (scriptwriter)|Ian Davidson]]. He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python. Despite this, Davidson did not appear in any Python-related media subsequent to series 2, though footage of him was shown on the documentary ''[[Python Night \u2013 30 Years of Monty Python]]''.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cce5b11885f24b708cc195c106f497fa \u201cPython Night\u201c].

When the BBC held a \"Python Night\" in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle, who had declined to partake in person (he taped a solo contribution from the US). Izzard hosted ''The Life of Python'' (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in 1998 (released on DVD as ''Live at Aspen''). Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on his style of comedy and Cleese has referred to him as \"the lost Python\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/living-the-dream-eddie-izzard-26586127.html|title=Living the dream: Eddie Izzard|first=Eamon|last=Sweeney|date=27 November 2009|website=The Irish Independent|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeries director of ''Flying Circus'', Ian MacNaughton, is also regularly associated with the group and made a few on-screen appearances in the show and in the film ''And Now for Something Completely Different''.

Following their television work, they began making films, including ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975), ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979) and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of [[cult following|cult]] performers from the early editions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' through to more recent [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] trends in television comedy. \"[[wikt:Pythonesque|Pythonesque]]\" has entered the English lexicon as a result.\n\nAt the [[41st British Academy Film Awards]] in 1988, Monty Python received the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 1998 they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]]. Many sketches from their TV show and films are well-known and widely quoted. Both ''Holy Grail'' and ''Life of Brian'' are frequently ranked in lists of greatest comedy films. In a 2005 poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors throughout the [[English-speaking world]] to find \"The Comedian's Comedian\", three of the six Pythons members were voted to be among the top 50 greatest comedians ever: Cleese at No. 2, Idle at No. 21, and Palin at No. 30.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|work=The Guardian|date=2 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4141019.stm|title=Cook voted 'comedians' comedian'|work=BBC News|date=2 January 2005|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Before ''Flying Circus''==\nJones and Palin met at [[Oxford University]], where they performed together with [[the Oxford Revue]].

Chapman, Cleese, and Idle were members of the Footlights, which at that time also included the future ''[[The Goodies|Goodies]]'' ([[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], [[Bill Oddie]], and [[Graeme Garden]]), and [[Jonathan Lynn]] (co-writer of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'').<ref>Hewison, Robert (1983).

It parodies nostalgic conversations about humble beginnings or difficult childhoods.]]\nFollowing the success of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from December 1967 to May 1969, [[Thames Television]] offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together. At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the [[BBC]], which had been impressed by their work on ''The Frost Report'' and ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Cleese was reluctant to do a [[Double act|two-man show]] for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on ''How to Irritate People'' and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle\u2014who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name=\"auto\">''The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons''.

Thomas Dunne Books; Orion, 2003</ref>\n\nBy contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography, the origins of ''Monty Python'' lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on ''Do Not Adjust Your Set''; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.<ref>''So, Anyway ...'' by John Cleese; Crown Archetype, London, 2014</ref> According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead on 11 May 1969, following a taping of ''Do Not Adjust Your Set'' which Cleese and Chapman attended.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCall |first1=Douglas.

They were admirers of the work of [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]] on ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]''\u2014seminal to the British \"[[satire boom]]\"\u2014and had worked on ''Frost'', which was similar in style.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1377417/index.html \"The Roots of Monty Python\"]. BFI Screenonline. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to \"cap\" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the ''Flying Circus'' series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in\"\u2014they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).<ref>[http://www.montypython.net/scripts/silliest.php \"The Silliest Interview We've Ever Had / The Silliest Sketch We've Ever Done\"]. MontyPython.net. Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, [[Spike Milligan]], whom they had admired on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' (a show the Pythons regard as their biggest influence, which also featured [[Peter Sellers]], whom Cleese called \u201cthe greatest voice man of all time\u201d) recording his groundbreaking BBC series ''[[Q...

Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled \"Christmas Cards\", and agreed that it represented \"a way of doing things differently\". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the ''Flying Circus'' series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single [[stream-of-consciousness]] (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/> The BBC states, \u201cGilliam's unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.\u201d<ref name=\"Circus profile\">{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/ |accessdate=24 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\nWriting started at 9&nbsp;am and finished at 5&nbsp;pm. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a \"writer\", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\n[[file:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_12_46_43_(14415411808).jpg|thumb|left|Gilliam, Palin and Jones performing \u201c[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]\u201d sketch during the 2014 Python reunion. As a sketch writer and creator of the animations, although Gilliam did considerably less acting, he did have some notable sketch roles such as this (Cardinal Fang).]]\nWhile the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many \"confrontation\" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as \"The Man Who Speaks In [[Anagram]]s\"). Cleese confirmed that \"most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's\".<ref>Wilmut (1980), p. 211</ref> Gilliam's animations ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).<ref name=\"Gilliam animation\"/>\n\nSeveral names for the show were considered before ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was settled upon. Some were ''Owl Stretching Time'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket'', ''Vaseline Review'', and ''Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot''. ''Flying Circus'' stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). ''Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus'' was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' was considered as an affectionate tribute to [[Barry Took]], the man who had brought them together.<ref>{{cite news| first= Douglas |last= Martin |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/nyregion/barry-took-73-father-of-monty-python-dies.html |title= Barry Took, 73, Father of Monty Python, Dies| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= 14 April 2002| accessdate= 1 May 2015}}</ref> ''Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus'' was suggested, then discarded. The name ''Baron Von Took's Flying Circus'' had the form of ''[[Baron Manfred von Richthofen]]'s [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|Flying Circus]]'' of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the [[Royal Guardsmen]]'s 1966 song \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as [[flying circus|barnstorming]], where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus \u2013 Four Yorkshiremen |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/02/monty-pythons-flying-circus-four-yorkshiremen.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref>\n\nDiffering, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only \"significance\" was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary ''Live at Aspen'' during the [[The Comedy Festival|US Comedy Arts Festival]], where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the [[American Film Institute]], the group implied that \"Monty\" was selected (Eric Idle's idea) as a gently mocking tribute to [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Lord Montgomery]], a British general of [[World War II]]; requiring a \"slippery-sounding\" surname, they settled on \"Python\". On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name \"Monty\" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, \"Has Monty been in yet?\", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being \"envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Comedy \u2013 Monty Python}}</ref>\n\n===Style of the show===\n''Flying Circus'' popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the [[cold open]], in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements.<ref name=MBC_piece>{{cite web|last=Museum of Broadcast Communications|title=Monty Python's Flying Circus|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/montypython/montypython.htm}}</ref> An example of this is the \"It's\" man: Palin, outfitted in [[Robinson Crusoe]] garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, \"It's&nbsp;...\", only to be then cut off by the [[title sequence]] and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the [[closing credits]] halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar [[History of BBC television idents|globe logo]] used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python: a golden age of British comedy |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/monty-python-a-golden-age-of-british-comedy-1.371481 |accessdate=20 August 2019 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}</ref> On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's \"anti-silliness\" character of \"[[The Colonel (Monty Python)|the Colonel]]\", who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming \"far too silly\".<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Langley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10948113/Monty-Python-Will-the-wrinkly-revolutionaries-have-the-last-laugh.html|title=Monty Python : Will the wrinkly revolutionaries have the last laugh?|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=5 July 2014|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monty python foot.png|thumb|right|[[The Foot of Cupid|Cupid's foot]], as used by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''.

Garrison produced the NBC series ''[[The Dean Martin Comedy World]]'', which ran during the summer of 1974.  The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches \"Bicycle Repairman\" and \"The Dull Life of a Stockbroker\". Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences.\n\nIn 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast two 90-minute ''Monty Python'' specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience.  As the judge observed in ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.]]'', where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, \"According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public.\"  Monty Python won the case.<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/integrity/Links/Cases/gilliam.html|title=Terry Gilliam et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants-Appellees, v.

''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' was based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. ''Holy Grail'' was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only \u00a3229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as UK music industry entrepreneur [[Tony Stratton-Smith]] (founder and owner of the [[Charisma Records]] label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-05-06/entertainment/0905050391_1_holy-grail-monty-python-john-goldstone|title=Cue the coconuts: 'Holy Grail' gallops on|last=Johnson|first=Steve|date=6 May 2009|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe backers of the film wanted to cut the famous [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] scene (a [[Sam Peckinpah]] send-up in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie.<ref>Interview with John Cleese on Q-The Podcast with host John Ghomeshi, on 16 July 2009</ref> \"Tis but a scratch\" and \"It's just a flesh wound\u2026\" are often quoted.<ref name=\"Python quotes\">{{cite news |title=49 of Monty Python's most absurdly funny jokes and quotes |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/49-of-monty-pythons-most-absurdly-funny-jokes-and-quotes/ |accessdate=18 August 2019 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. and viewers in a [[Channel 4]] poll placed it sixth.<ref name=\"Channel4 comedies\"/>\n\n====''Monty Python's Life of Brian'' (1979)====\n{{Main|Monty Python's Life of Brian}}\nFollowing the success of ''Holy Grail'', reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one.

When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby in the stable, and then later on [[Mount of Olives|the Mount]], speaking the [[Beatitudes]]), he is played straight (by actor [[Kenneth Colley]]) and portrayed with respect.

Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python|Parrot Sketch Not Included]],'' where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds.

On 9 October 1999, to commemorate 30 years since the first ''Flying Circus'' television broadcast, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] devoted an evening to Python programmes, including a documentary charting the history of the team, interspersed with new sketches by the Monty Python team filmed especially for the event.<ref name=\"Reunions\"/>\n\nThe surviving Pythons had agreed in principle to perform a live tour of America in 1999. Several shows were to be linked with Q&A meetings in various cities. Although all had said yes, Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour. This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening.

Cleese's feeling was that ''The Meaning of Life'' had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the ''Grail'' and ''Brian'' films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance).

The memoir ''A Liar's Autobiography'' was published in 1980 and details Chapman's journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: \"Nothing&nbsp;... it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie.\" The film uses Chapman's own voice\u2014from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer\u2014and entertainment channel [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] announced the film's release in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats. Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Ben Timlett, and Jeff Simpson, the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length, each in a different style. John Cleese recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman's voice. Michael Palin voiced Chapman's father and Terry Jones voiced his mother. Terry Gilliam voiced Graham's psychiatrist.

He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. Idle wrote the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Spamalot]]'', based on ''Holy Grail''.

''The Life of Python''. p. 40. Pavilion</ref> Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members\u2014in particular Cleese\u2014with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often under-rated. However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian's mother Mandy in ''Life of Brian'', \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\", a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2131880,00.html|title=The last laugh: your favourite 50|work=The Observer|location=UK|first1=Philip|last1=French|first2=Mark|last2=Kermode|first3=Jason|last3=Solomons|first4=Akin|last4=Ojumu|first5=Killian|last5=Fox|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=21 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385293/Life-of-Brian-wins-the-vote-for-film's-best-laughter-line.html|title=Life of Brian wins the vote for film's best laughter line|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=19 February 2002|accessdate=21 September 2008|location=London}}</ref> Jones died on 21 January 2020 from complications of dementia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python star Terry Jones dies aged 77 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51209197 |accessdate=22 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=22 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Palin|Sir Michael Palin]] attended [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series ''Ripping Yarns'' together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After ''Flying Circus'', Palin hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled ''Michael Palin Diaries 1969\u20131979'', published in 2007.

Occasionally such people have been referred to as the 'seventh Python', in a style reminiscent of [[George Martin]] (or other associates of the Beatles) being dubbed \"the [[Fifth Beatle]]\".  The two collaborators with the most meaningful and plentiful contributions have been [[Neil Innes]] and [[Carol Cleveland]]. Both were present and presented as Associate Pythons at the official Monty Python 25th-anniversary celebrations held in Los Angeles in July 1994.<ref>{{citation |title=Python Comeback |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?/sotcaa/pythonpages/python_press_1990_99.html |accessdate=2007-09-09 |date=3 March 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201010035/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/sotcaa/sotcaa_python.html?%2Fsotcaa%2Fpythonpages%2Fpython_press_1990_99.html |archivedate=1 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n[[File:10.18.09CarolClevelandByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carol Cleveland]] (in 2009), commonly called \u201cPython girl\u201d, or \u201cSeventh Python\u201d.<ref name=\"25 sketches\"/>]]\n[[Neil Innes]] is the only non-Python besides [[Douglas Adams]] to be credited with writing material for ''Flying Circus''. He appeared in sketches and the Python films, as well as performing some of his songs in ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]''.

He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat [[Bonzo Dog Band]]. He would later portray Ron Nasty of [[the Rutles]] and write all of the Rutles' compositions for ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978), a [[mockumentary]] film co-directed by Idle. By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles \"reunion\" album ''The Rutles: Archaeology'' and Idle's straight-to-DVD ''The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch'', each undertaken without the other's participation. According to an interview with Idle in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back \"too far.

She was originally hired by producer/director [[John Howard Davies]] for just the first five episodes of the ''Flying Circus''.

Her most significant role was the \"best girl\" of the eponymous Lumberjack in \"The Lumberjack Song\", though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland. Booth appeared in a total of six sketches and also played one-off characters in Python feature films ''And Now for Something Completely Different'' and ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Comedy: Connie Booth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/connie_booth_person_page.shtml |accessdate=20 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n[[Douglas Adams]] was \"discovered\" by Chapman when a version of ''Footlights Revue'' (a 1974 BBC2 television show featuring some of Adams' early work) was performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. In Cleese's absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called \"[[Patient Abuse]]\". In the sketch\u2014a satire on mind-boggling bureaucracy\u2014a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill in numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monty Python's Flying Circus, Series 4, Episode 6 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031d26j |accessdate=29 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref> He also had two cameo appearances in this season. Firstly, in the episode \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a \"pepperpot\" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (\"Any old iron&nbsp;...\"). Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6150254.stm|title='Lost' gems from the TV archives|agency=BBC News \u2013 Entertainment|access-date=19 August 2019}}</ref> He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''.\n\nOther than Carol Cleveland, the only other non-Python to make a significant number of appearances in the ''Flying Circus'' was [[Ian Davidson (scriptwriter)|Ian Davidson]]. He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python. Despite this, Davidson did not appear in any Python-related media subsequent to series 2, though footage of him was shown on the documentary ''[[Python Night \u2013 30 Years of Monty Python]]''.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cce5b11885f24b708cc195c106f497fa \u201cPython Night\u201c].

When the BBC held a \"Python Night\" in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of ''Flying Circus'', the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle, who had declined to partake in person (he taped a solo contribution from the US). Izzard hosted ''The Life of Python'' (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in [[Aspen, Colorado]], in 1998 (released on DVD as ''Live at Aspen''). Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on his style of comedy and Cleese has referred to him as \"the lost Python\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/living-the-dream-eddie-izzard-26586127.html|title=Living the dream: Eddie Izzard|first=Eamon|last=Sweeney|date=27 November 2009|website=The Irish Independent|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeries director of ''Flying Circus'', Ian MacNaughton, is also regularly associated with the group and made a few on-screen appearances in the show and in the film ''And Now for Something Completely Different''.

The circuit has been used for [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] and [[Formula One]] races and has hosted the [[South African Grand Prix]] many times. Among the [[Formula One]] races held at the track the [[1977 South African Grand Prix]] stands out, as it is principally remembered for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of race marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver [[Tom Pryce]]. In recent years, the area surrounding the circuit has developed into a residential and commercial suburb of [[Johannesburg]]. More recently, Kyalami has played host to five rounds of the [[Superbike World Championship]] from 1998 to 2002 and later in 2009 and 2010, the season finale of the [[Superstars Series]] in 2009 and 2010, and the South African round of the [[2008\u201309 A1 Grand Prix season]].\nInternational racing returned to the circuit in November 2019, when it hosted the [[2019 Kyalami 9 Hours]], serving as the season finale of the [[2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge]]. It is scheduled to host the inaugural [[6 Hours of Kyalami]] on 6 February 2021, as part of the [[2020-21 FIA World Endurance Championship]].<ref name=\"prov cal\">{{cite web |title=Monza and Kyalami on 2020-2021 WEC calendar |url=https://www.grandprix247.com/2019/12/12/monza-and-kyalami-on-2020-2021-wec-calendar/ |website=GrandPrix247 |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe original, sweeping circuit was in use from [[1961 Rand Grand Prix|1961]] until political sanctions (due to [[apartheid]] policies) eliminated the [[List of Formula One Grands Prix|Grand Prix]] after the [[1985 South African Grand Prix|1985 race]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cir-069.html|title=Grandprix.com|first=Grandprix.com \u2013 First & fastest: The original online F1 news|last=service|website=grandprix.com}}</ref> When the circuit was rebuilt in the early 1990s as part of a commercial development, Leeukop Bend, the Kink, Pit lane, the start/finish straight, Crowthorne Corner and Barbeque Bend were all eliminated. Jukskei Sweep was heavily modified to create the entrance into the bend before the then newly built Pit lane and start/finish straight. The remaining part of the old fast circuit, modified to a lesser degree were Sunset Bend, Clubhouse Bend and the Esses still incorporated into the current configuration, with the result that the circuit became a narrow, twisty ribbon rather than one of the fastest circuits on the calendar. Formula One abandoned the rebuilt circuit in [[1993 Formula One season|1993]] after just two races on the new layout, caused by a bankruptcy on the part of the promoter.\n\nIt hosted the [[South African motorcycle Grand Prix]] until 1992.\n\nKyalami was changed again with the building of the current pit lane and start/finish straight and later again changes were made, with the addition of a chicane which in turn was removed again for the 2009 World Superbike race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdecarli.it/php/circuit.php?var1=713&var2=2|title=TRACKS: KYALAMI|first=Guido de|last=Carli|website=gdecarli.it}}</ref> Kyalami came under new management and 2008 saw the 50th Anniversary of the 9-Hour revival being held at Kyalami with golden oldies like [[David Piper (racing driver)|David Piper]] and others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motoring.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4722182|title=THREE-HOUR ENDURANCE RACE FOR HISTORIC CARS|date=20 November 2008|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]]|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref> On 6 June 2014, it was announced that Kyalami would be auctioned off on 24 July without reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enca.com/kyalami-race-track-goes-under-hammer|title=Kyalami race track to go under the hammer|first=Bianca|last=Ackroyd|website=enca.com}}</ref> On 24 July 2014, it was auctioned off for R205&nbsp;million.

Barrelling further down the straight at full throttle, the second corner, named '''Crowthorne''' awaits. The typical braking point is around the 100-metre board. A second gear left-handed corner, it tightens before opening up on exit, setting the driver up for turns 3 and 4. The '''Jukskei Sweep''' as these corners were dubbed after the re-design, are a flat-out right-hander followed by a flat-out left handed kink throwing the driver into the braking zone for turn 5. '''Barbeque''' is a second gear left-handed corner which takes the driver onto the line of the classic circuit layout. Utilising the kerb on the exit of Barbeque is necessary as the driver has a short straight to prepare for turn 6. The driver would wait until after the 50-metre board before lifting off the throttle and dipping on the brakes through the quick right-hander known as '''Sunset''', one of only four corners left as they were in the first layout. A short burst of throttle is followed by braking at the 50-metre board for turn 7, '''Clubhouse''', a slow left-hander typically taken in second gear. Once again utilising the exit kerb, the driver barrels down a short straight before braking, again at the 50-metre board, for turn 8. Turns 8 and 9, known as '''The Esses''', are the final corners left over from the first layout. 8 is a medium-speed left hander typically taken in third gear, dipping the driver downhill before the car is flicked right into turn 9. Acceleration is key as the driver rejoins the new layout, going uphill before having to brake roughly 50 metres for the blind tenth corner, known as '''Leeukop'''. The driver typically decelerates and shifts down the gears to second or first gear, meeting the apex of the corner before accelerating through turn 11. The back straight lasts for a few hundred metres before the driver approaches turn 12, a flat-out left hander known as '''Mineshaft'''. Spotting a braking point for turn 13, the first corner of '''The Crocodiles''', can be hard, as it is an off-camber right handed turn which can be taken with several different lines. Turn 14 is little more than the full throttle exit of turn 13, and sets the driver up for turn 15. '''Cheetah''' is a tight right hander which the driver typically only needs to lift off the throttle for. It's important to carry speed through it, before spotting a braking point for the final corner. '''Ingwe''' is a slow left-hander which sends the driver back onto the start-finish straight to complete the lap.<ref name=\"onboard aston\">{{cite web |title=One lap at Kyalami in the Aston GT3 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C39g3GaXtM |website=YouTube |accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==South African Grand Prix==\nFrom [[1967 Formula One Season|1967]] to [[1993 Formula One Season|1993]], Kyalami hosted 21 editions of the South African Grand Prix. Perhaps the most infamous of these was the [[1982 South African Grand Prix|1982 edition]], when the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]] staged a [[Strike action|strike]] in protest of new [[superlicence]] conditions imposed by [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]].\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] became the most successful driver at Kyalami, taking his third victory at the circuit in [[1984 South African Grand Prix|1984]]. [[Alain Prost]], [[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Jackie Stewart]] are the joint second-most successful drivers at the circuit, with two wins each. [[Jody Scheckter]] became the first and only South African driver to win their home race during the [[1975 South African Grand Prix|1975 edition]]. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] are the most successful constructors at the circuit, with four wins each.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Kyalami}}\n*

Among the [[Formula One]] races held at the track the [[1977 South African Grand Prix]] stands out, as it is principally remembered for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of race marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver [[Tom Pryce]]. In recent years, the area surrounding the circuit has developed into a residential and commercial suburb of [[Johannesburg]]. More recently, Kyalami has played host to five rounds of the [[Superbike World Championship]] from 1998 to 2002 and later in 2009 and 2010, the season finale of the [[Superstars Series]] in 2009 and 2010, and the South African round of the [[2008\u201309 A1 Grand Prix season]].\nInternational racing returned to the circuit in November 2019, when it hosted the [[2019 Kyalami 9 Hours]], serving as the season finale of the [[2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge]]. It is scheduled to host the inaugural [[6 Hours of Kyalami]] on 6 February 2021, as part of the [[2020-21 FIA World Endurance Championship]].<ref name=\"prov cal\">{{cite web |title=Monza and Kyalami on 2020-2021 WEC calendar |url=https://www.grandprix247.com/2019/12/12/monza-and-kyalami-on-2020-2021-wec-calendar/ |website=GrandPrix247 |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe original, sweeping circuit was in use from [[1961 Rand Grand Prix|1961]] until political sanctions (due to [[apartheid]] policies) eliminated the [[List of Formula One Grands Prix|Grand Prix]] after the [[1985 South African Grand Prix|1985 race]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cir-069.html|title=Grandprix.com|first=Grandprix.com \u2013 First & fastest: The original online F1 news|last=service|website=grandprix.com}}</ref> When the circuit was rebuilt in the early 1990s as part of a commercial development, Leeukop Bend, the Kink, Pit lane, the start/finish straight, Crowthorne Corner and Barbeque Bend were all eliminated. Jukskei Sweep was heavily modified to create the entrance into the bend before the then newly built Pit lane and start/finish straight. The remaining part of the old fast circuit, modified to a lesser degree were Sunset Bend, Clubhouse Bend and the Esses still incorporated into the current configuration, with the result that the circuit became a narrow, twisty ribbon rather than one of the fastest circuits on the calendar. Formula One abandoned the rebuilt circuit in [[1993 Formula One season|1993]] after just two races on the new layout, caused by a bankruptcy on the part of the promoter.\n\nIt hosted the [[South African motorcycle Grand Prix]] until 1992.\n\nKyalami was changed again with the building of the current pit lane and start/finish straight and later again changes were made, with the addition of a chicane which in turn was removed again for the 2009 World Superbike race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdecarli.it/php/circuit.php?var1=713&var2=2|title=TRACKS: KYALAMI|first=Guido de|last=Carli|website=gdecarli.it}}</ref> Kyalami came under new management and 2008 saw the 50th Anniversary of the 9-Hour revival being held at Kyalami with golden oldies like [[David Piper (racing driver)|David Piper]] and others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motoring.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4722182|title=THREE-HOUR ENDURANCE RACE FOR HISTORIC CARS|date=20 November 2008|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]]|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref> On 6 June 2014, it was announced that Kyalami would be auctioned off on 24 July without reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enca.com/kyalami-race-track-goes-under-hammer|title=Kyalami race track to go under the hammer|first=Bianca|last=Ackroyd|website=enca.com}}</ref> On 24 July 2014, it was auctioned off for R205&nbsp;million.

Barrelling further down the straight at full throttle, the second corner, named '''Crowthorne''' awaits. The typical braking point is around the 100-metre board. A second gear left-handed corner, it tightens before opening up on exit, setting the driver up for turns 3 and 4. The '''Jukskei Sweep''' as these corners were dubbed after the re-design, are a flat-out right-hander followed by a flat-out left handed kink throwing the driver into the braking zone for turn 5. '''Barbeque''' is a second gear left-handed corner which takes the driver onto the line of the classic circuit layout. Utilising the kerb on the exit of Barbeque is necessary as the driver has a short straight to prepare for turn 6. The driver would wait until after the 50-metre board before lifting off the throttle and dipping on the brakes through the quick right-hander known as '''Sunset''', one of only four corners left as they were in the first layout. A short burst of throttle is followed by braking at the 50-metre board for turn 7, '''Clubhouse''', a slow left-hander typically taken in second gear. Once again utilising the exit kerb, the driver barrels down a short straight before braking, again at the 50-metre board, for turn 8. Turns 8 and 9, known as '''The Esses''', are the final corners left over from the first layout. 8 is a medium-speed left hander typically taken in third gear, dipping the driver downhill before the car is flicked right into turn 9. Acceleration is key as the driver rejoins the new layout, going uphill before having to brake roughly 50 metres for the blind tenth corner, known as '''Leeukop'''. The driver typically decelerates and shifts down the gears to second or first gear, meeting the apex of the corner before accelerating through turn 11. The back straight lasts for a few hundred metres before the driver approaches turn 12, a flat-out left hander known as '''Mineshaft'''. Spotting a braking point for turn 13, the first corner of '''The Crocodiles''', can be hard, as it is an off-camber right handed turn which can be taken with several different lines. Turn 14 is little more than the full throttle exit of turn 13, and sets the driver up for turn 15. '''Cheetah''' is a tight right hander which the driver typically only needs to lift off the throttle for. It's important to carry speed through it, before spotting a braking point for the final corner. '''Ingwe''' is a slow left-hander which sends the driver back onto the start-finish straight to complete the lap.<ref name=\"onboard aston\">{{cite web |title=One lap at Kyalami in the Aston GT3 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C39g3GaXtM |website=YouTube |accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==South African Grand Prix==\nFrom [[1967 Formula One Season|1967]] to [[1993 Formula One Season|1993]], Kyalami hosted 21 editions of the South African Grand Prix. Perhaps the most infamous of these was the [[1982 South African Grand Prix|1982 edition]], when the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]] staged a [[Strike action|strike]] in protest of new [[superlicence]] conditions imposed by [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]].\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] became the most successful driver at Kyalami, taking his third victory at the circuit in [[1984 South African Grand Prix|1984]]. [[Alain Prost]], [[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Jackie Stewart]] are the joint second-most successful drivers at the circuit, with two wins each. [[Jody Scheckter]] became the first and only South African driver to win their home race during the [[1975 South African Grand Prix|1975 edition]]. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] are the most successful constructors at the circuit, with four wins each.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Kyalami}}\n* [[Francis Tucker]]\n* [[List of Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit fatalities]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://racingcircuits.info/africa/south-africa/kyalami/#.Vl-wQHarTcs Map and circuit history at RacingCircuits.info]\n*[http://www.kma.org.za Kyalami Marshals Association]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=kyalami,+Gauteng,+South+Africa&sll=-26.275715,28.162251&sspn=0.018163,0.027637&ie=UTF8&ll=-25.997164,28.066893&spn=0.009103,0.013819&t=k&z=16 Satellite picture by Google Maps]\n*[http://www.sportstar.co.za Kyalami Kart Circuit]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051215063625/http://www.shelbycanam.co.za/ Shelby Can-Am]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list1 =\n{{Formula One circuits}}\n{{World Sportscar Championship circuits}}\n{{A1 Grand Prix circuits}}\n{{MotoGP circuits}}\n{{SBK circuits}}\n{{Superstars Series circuits}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Formula One circuits]]\n[[Category:A1 Grand Prix circuits]]\n[[Category:Grand Prix motorcycle circuits]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in South Africa]]\n[[Category:South African Grand Prix]]\n[[Category:South African motorcycle Grand Prix]]\n[[Category:Superbike World Championship circuits]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Johannesburg]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1961]]\n", "name_user": "Kroema", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated Image to a more accurate version", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyalami"}
