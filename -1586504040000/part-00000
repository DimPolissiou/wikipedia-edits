He is Distinguished Scholar and adjunct faculty at [[Tulane University]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nBarry was born in [[Providence, RI]], graduated from [[Brown University]], and entered a Ph.D. program at the [[University of Rochester]] but withdrew from graduate school in the middle of the semester after he received his M.A. \nHe then coached high school and college football, and his first published article appeared in a professional journal for coaches, ''Scholastic Coach''. In the 1970s he began freelancing for magazines and moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]], where he frequently contributed to ''The Washington Post'' Sunday Magazine and was Washington editor of the now-defunct ''Dun's Review'' and ''Dun's Business Month''.\n\n==Literary works==\n\nHis first book, ''The Ambition and the Power: A true story of Washington'', appeared in 1989 and explored the operation of the [[U.S. Congress]], the use of power by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Jim Wright]], and the rise of future Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]]. In 1995 the ''[[New York Times]]'' named it one of the eleven best books ever written on Congress and Washington.\n\nWith [[Steven Rosenberg]], MD, PhD, chief of the Surgery Branch at the [[National Cancer Institute]] and a pioneer in the development of \"immunotherapy\" for cancer\u2014stimulating the immune system to attack cancer\u2014Barry co-authored his second book, ''The Transformed Cell: Unlocking the Mysteries of Cancer'', which was published in 12 languages.\n\nBarry's 1997 book ''Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America'' appeared on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]] and won the 1998 [[Francis Parkman Prize]] from the [[Society of American Historians]] for the year's best book on [[American history]]. In 2005, the [[New York Public Library]] named it one of the fifty best books of all kinds\u2014fiction, nonfiction, and poetry\u2014in the preceding 50 years. His work on water-related issues was recognized by the [[U.S. National Academies of Science]] in its invitation to give the 2006 Abel Wolman Distinguished Lecture on Water Resources; he is the only non-scientist ever to give that lecture.\n\nHis 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza|The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Greatest Plague in History]]'' was also a New York Times Best Seller, and won the 2005 [[Keck Communication Award]] from the [[United States National Academies of Science]] for the year's outstanding book on science or medicine. In 2005 he also won the \"September 11th Award\" from the [[Center for Biodefense and Emerging Pathogens]] at Brown University. He has served on a federal government's Infectious Disease Board of Experts, on the advisory board of MIT's Center for Engineering Fundamentals, and on the advisory committee at [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] for its Center for Refugee and Disaster Response.\n\n==Policymaking==\n\nTwo of his books involved him directly in policy-making. From January 2007 until October 16, 2013, he was a member of the [[Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - East]] (SLFPAE), the levee board responsible for protecting the [[New Orleans]] metro area on the east bank of the Mississippi River. On July 24, 2013, SLFPAE filed a lawsuit against [[Exxon Mobil]], [[BP]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and 94 other oil, gas, and pipeline companies for their role in damage to [[Louisiana]]'s coast. Barry was the chief architect of this suit, and was the authority's spokesperson on it. Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] immediately demanded SLFPAE withdraw the lawsuit. The board was created after [[Hurricane Katrina]] by a constitutional amendment, and its members\u2014unlike members of other levee boards in the state\u2014cannot be removed by the governor without cause. However, when Barry's term on the board expired, Jindal did not reappoint him. The board continues to support the suit, and Barry continues to argue for it, speaking at Rotary Clubs and similar groups throughout Louisiana to generate political support. Nonetheless, in June 2014 the state legislature passed a bill attempting to retroactively kill the lawsuit. Despite a veto urged by Attorney General Buddy Caldwell and 116 law school professors who warned that the bill undermined some of the state's claims against BP for the 2010 spill\u2014and the opinion that the bill did not even kill the lawsuit\u2014Jindal signed the bill, which became Act 544. In August 2014, attorneys for the board filed a motion seeking a partial summary judgment arguing that Act 544 does not apply to the flood authority and that the law is unconstitutional. A state court ruled that flood authority lawyers were correct on both counts; in a separate action, a federal district court dismissed the case. Both lower court rulings are now on appeal, one in the state Supreme Court and one at the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal.\n\nThis work resulted in Barry's induction into [[Delta Omega]], an academic honorary society for public health. He has advised the private sector and local, state, national, and international government officials about preparing for another influenza pandemic.  He has also both advised officials and taken a direct role in preparing for water-related disasters. A resident of New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] he was also named to both the [[Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority]] (SLFPA), which is the levee board overseeing several separate levee districts in the New Orleans area, and the state's [[Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority|Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]], which is responsible for hurricane protection for the entire state.\n\n==Other work==\n\nBarry has written for ''The New York Times'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Time Magazine]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''The Washington Post'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and other publications and frequently appears as a guest commentator on networks in the U.S., including on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]]'', [[PBS]]'s ''[[The News Hour]]'', numerous [[NPR]] shows, and such foreign media as the [[BBC]] and [[Al Jazeera]]. [[Tulane University]] awarded him an honorary doctorate for his contribution to the [[recovery of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina]]. [[Roger Williams University]] also awarded him an honorary doctorate.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://johnmbarry.com/ Barry's website]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/02/magazine/mag-oil-lawsuit.html?_r=2]\n* [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/videos/#104122] [[PBS NewsHour]] story on lawsuit\n* {{C-SPAN|John M Barry}}\n**[http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/10631-1/John+Barry.aspx Interview with Barry on ''The Ambition and the Power''], ''[[Booknotes]]'', January 14, 1990\n**[https://www.c-span.org/video/?182014-2/the-great-influenza Talk by Barry on ''The Great Influenza'', ''The Art of the Memoir'', November 6, 2004]\n*[http://www.nola.com/books/index.ssf/2012/02/john_barry_looks_to_colonial_a.html article on John Barry and his book on Roger Williams], ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', February 6, 2012\n* [http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VFBKLzIwMTIvMDEvMDgjQXIwNjgwMA%3D%3D&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-custom \"Roger Williams is with Us Yet\"], ''[[Providence Journal]]'', Jan 8, 2012\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barry, John M.}}\n[[Category:Johns Hopkins University people]]\n[[Category:People from Providence, Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Brown University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Rochester alumni]]\n[[Category:Tulane University faculty]]\n[[Category:The New York Times writers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1940s births]]\n[[Category:21st-century American historians]]\n[[Category:Separation of church and state in the United States]]\n[[Category:American political writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{BLP primary sources|date=June 2010}}\n{{BLP sources|date=June 2010}}\n}}\n\n'''John M.

{"title_page": "Alphabetical order", "text_new": "{{Hatnote|\"Alphabetization\" redirects here. For the creation of an alphabetic [[writing system]], which in instances of Latin script is called romanization, see [[Romanization]].}}nest,run,son,walk,peon{{short description|System for ordering words, names and phrases}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n'''Alphabetical order''' is a system whereby [[character string]]s are placed in order based on the position of the characters in the conventional ordering of an [[alphabet]]. It is one of the methods of [[collation]]. In mathematics, a [[lexicographical order]] is the generalization of the alphabetical order to other data types, such as [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] of digits or numbers.\n\nWhen applied to strings or [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] that, beside alphabetical characters, may contain also digits, numbers or more elaborate types of elements, the alphabetical order is generally called a [[lexicographical order]].\n\nTo determine which of two strings of characters comes first when arranging in alphabetical order, their first [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order.\n\n[[Capital letter]]s (upper case) are generally considered to be identical to their corresponding lower case letters for the purposes of alphabetical ordering, though conventions may be adopted to handle situations where two strings differ ''only'' in capitalization. Various conventions also exist for the handling of strings containing [[space (symbol)|space]]s, modified letters (such as those with [[diacritic]]s), and non-letter characters such as marks of [[punctuation]].\n\nThe result of placing a set of words or strings in alphabetical order is that all the strings beginning with the same letter are grouped together; and within that grouping all words beginning with the same two-letter sequence are grouped together; and so on. The system thus tends to maximize the number of common initial letters between adjacent words.\n\n==History==\nAlphabetical order was first used in the 1st millennium BC by Northwest Semitic scribes using the [[Abjad]] system.<ref>Reinhard G. Lehmann: \"27-30-22-26. How Many Letters Needs an Alphabet? The Case of Semitic\", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52</ref> The first effective use of alphabetical order as a cataloging device among scholars may have been in ancient Alexandria.<ref>Daly, Lloyd. ''Contributions to the History of Alphabetization in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' Brussels, 1967. p. 25</ref>\n\nThe [[Bible]] is dated to the 6-7th centuries BCE. In the [[Book of Jeremiah]],  the prophet utilizes an [[Atbash]] [[substitution cipher]], based on alphabetical order. Similarly, biblical authors used [[acrostic]]s based on the (ordered) [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\nIn the 1st century BC, Roman writer [[Varro]] compiled alphabetic lists of authors and titles.<ref name=\"O'Hara\">{{cite journal |title=Messapus, Cycnus, and the Alphabetical Order of Vergil's Catalogue of Italian Heroes |last=O'Hara |first=James |year=1989 |jstor=1088539 |volume=43 |pages=35\u201338}}</ref> In the 2nd century CE, [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] wrote an encyclopedic [[epitome]] of the works of [[Verrius Flaccus]], ''[[De verborum significatu]]'', with entries in alphabetic order.<ref name=\"remacle\">{{cite book |url=http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/Festus/m.htm |title=LIVRE XI \u2013 texte latin \u2013 traduction + commentaires}}</ref> In the 3rd century CE, [[Harpocration]] wrote a [[Homer]]ic lexicon alphabetized by all letters.<ref name=\"gibson\">{{cite book |title=Interpreting a classic: Demosthenes and his ancient commentators |last=Gibson |first=Craig |year=2002}}</ref> In the 10th century, the author of the ''[[Suda]]'' used alphabetic order with phonetic variations. In the 14th century, the author of the ''[[Fons memorabilium universi]]'' used a classification, but used alphabetical order within some of the books.<ref name=\"Yeo\">{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedic visions: scientific dictionaries and enlightenment culture |last=Yeo |first=Richard |year=2001 |isbn=0521651913 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bJYm1N8bqgC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1604 [[Robert Cawdrey]] had to explain in ''[[Table Alphabeticall]]'', the first monolingual English dictionary, \"Nowe if the word, which thou art desirous to finde, begin with (a) then looke in the beginning of this Table, but if with (v) looke towards the end.\"<ref name=Cawdrey>{{cite book |url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/ret/cawdrey/cawdrey0.html#reader |title=Robert Cawdrey's \u2013 A Table Alphabetical OBERT (1604)}}</ref>\nAlthough as late as 1803 [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] condemned encyclopedias with \"an arrangement determined by the accident of initial letters\",<ref name=Coleridge>{{cite book |title=Coleridge's Letters, No.507 |url=http://inamidst.com/coleridge/letters/letter507}}</ref> many lists are today based on this principle.\n\n==Ordering in the Latin script==\n\n===Basic order and example===\nThe standard order of the modern [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] is:\n:'''A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z'''\n\nAn example of straightforward alphabetical ordering follows:\n*'''''As; Aster; Astrolabe; Astronomy; Astrophysics; At; Ataman; Attack; Baa'''''\nAnother example:\n*'''''Barnacle; Be; Been; Benefit; Bent'''''\n \nThe above words are ordered alphabetically. ''As'' comes before ''Aster'' because they begin with the same two letters and ''As'' has no more letters after that whereas ''Aster'' does. The next three words come after ''Aster'' because their fourth letter (the first one that differs) is ''r'', which comes after ''e'' (the fourth letter of ''Aster'') in the alphabet. Those words themselves are ordered based on their sixth letters (''l'', ''n'' and ''p'' respectively). Then comes ''At'', which differs from the preceding words in the second letter (''t'' comes after ''s''). ''Ataman'' comes after ''At'' for the same reason that ''Aster'' came after ''As''. ''Attack'' follows ''Ataman'' based on comparison of their third letters, and ''Baa'' comes after all of the others because it has a different first letter.\n\n===Treatment of multiword strings===\nWhen some of the strings being ordered consist of more than one word, i.e., they contain [[space (character)|spaces]] or other separators such as [[hyphen]]s, then two basic approaches may be taken. In the first approach, all strings are ordered initially according to their first  word, as in the sequence:\n*''Oak; Oak Hill; Oak Ridge; Oakley Park; Oakley River''\n*:where all strings beginning with the separate word ''Oak'' precede all those beginning ''Oakley'', because ''Oak'' precedes ''Oakley'' in alphabetical order.\n\nIn the second approach, strings are alphabetized as if they had no spaces, giving the sequence:\n*''Oak; Oak Hill; Oakley Park; Oakley River; Oak Ridge''\n*:where ''Oak Ridge'' now comes after the ''Oakley'' strings, as it would if it were written \"Oakridge\".\n\nThe second approach is the one usually taken in dictionaries, and it is thus often called ''[[dictionary order (disambiguation)|dictionary order]]'' by [[publishing|publishers]]. The first approach has often been used in [[index (publishing)|book indexes]], although each publisher traditionally set its own standards for which approach to use therein; there was no ISO standard for book indexes ([[ISO 999]]) before 1975.\n\n===Special cases===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Modified letters====\nIn French, modified letters (such as those with [[diacritic]]s) are treated the same as the base letter for alphabetical ordering purposes. For example, ''r\u00f4le'' comes between ''rock'' and ''rose'', as if it were written ''role''. However languages that use such letters systematically generally have their own ordering rules. See [[#Language-specific conventions|Language-specific conventions]] below.\n\n====Ordering by surname====\nIn most cultures where [[family name]]s are written after [[given name]]s, it is still desired to sort lists of names (as in telephone directories) by family name first.  In this case, names need to be reordered to be sorted properly.  For example, Juan Hernandes and Brian O'Leary should be sorted as \"Hernandes, Juan\" and \"O'Leary, Brian\" even if they are not written this way.  Capturing this rule in a computer collation algorithm is difficult, and simple attempts will necessarily fail.  For example, unless the algorithm has at its disposal an extensive list of family names, there is no way to decide if \"Gillian Lucille van der Waal\" is \"van der Waal, Gillian Lucille\", \"Waal, Gillian Lucille van der\", or even \"Lucille van der Waal, Gillian\".\n\nOrdering by surname is frequently encountered in academic contexts. Within a single multi-author paper, ordering the authors alphabetically by surname, rather than by other methods such as reverse seniority or subjective degree of contribution to the paper, is seen as a way of \"acknowledg[ing] similar contributions\" or \"avoid[ing] disharmony in collaborating groups\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Teja|last=Tscharntke|first2=Michael E|last2=Hochberg|first3=Tatyana A|last3=Rand|first4=Vincent H|last4=Resh|first5=Jochen|last5=Krauss|title=Author Sequence and Credit for Contributions in Multiauthored Publications|journal=PLoS Biol.|date=January 2007|volume=5|issue=1|pmid=17227141|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050018|pmc=1769438}}</ref> The practice in certain fields of ordering [[citation]]s in bibliographies by the surnames of their authors has been found to create bias in favour of authors with surnames which appear earlier in the alphabet, while this effect does not appear in fields in which bibliographies are ordered chronologically.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://decisionslab.unl.edu/pubs/stevens_duque_2018_SM.pdf|first=Jeffrey R.|last=Stevens|first2=Juan F.|last2=Duque|title=Order Matters: Alphabetizing In-Text Citations Biases Citation Rates|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|year=2018|doi=10.3758/s13423-018-1532-8|lay-url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/22/study-takes-aim-psychologys-practice-ordering-reference-lists-alphabetically|lay-source=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|lay-date=22 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n====''The'' and other common words====\nIf a phrase begins with a very common word (such as \"the\", \"a\" or \"an\" in grammar called articles), that word is sometimes ignored or moved to the end of the phrase, but this is not always the case. For example, the book \"[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]\" might be treated as \"Shining\", or \"Shining, The\" and therefore before the book title \"[[Summer of Sam]]\", although it may also be treated as simply \"The Shining\" and after \"Summer of Sam\". Similarly, \"[[A Wrinkle in Time]]\" might be treated as \"Wrinkle in Time\", \"Wrinkle in Time, A\", or \"A Wrinkle in Time\". All three alphabetization methods are fairly easy to create by algorithm, but many programs rely instead on simple [[lexicographic order]]ing.  Articles generally are ignored when alphabetizing.\n\n====''Mac'' prefixes====\n{{main|Mac and Mc together}}\nThe prefixes ''M''' and ''Mc'' in Irish and Scottish surnames are abbreviations for ''Mac'', and are sometimes alphabetized as if the spelling is ''Mac'' in full. Thus ''McKinley'' might be listed before ''Mackintosh'' (as it would be if it had been spelled out as \"MacKinley\"). Since the advent of computer-sorted lists, this type of alphabetization is less frequently encountered, though it is still used in British telephone directories.\n\n====Ligatures====\n[[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] (two or more letters merged into one symbol) which are not considered distinct letters, such as [[\u00c6]] and [[\u0152]] in English, are typically collated as if the letters were separate\u2014\"\u00e6ther\" and \"aether\" would be ordered the same relative to all other words. This is true even when the ligature is not purely stylistic, such as in [[loanword]]s and brand names.\n\nSpecial rules may need to be adopted to sort strings which vary only by whether two letters are joined by a ligature.\n\n===Treatment of numerals===\n{{main|Lexicographical order}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\nWhen some of the strings contain [[Numerical digit|numeral]]s (or other non-letter characters), various approaches are possible. Sometimes such characters are treated as if they came before or after all the letters of the alphabet. Another method is for numbers to be sorted alphabetically as they would be spelled: for example ''[[1776 (film)|1776]]'' would be sorted as if spelled out \"seventeen seventy-six\", and ''[[24 heures du Mans]]'' as if spelled \"vingt-quatre...\" (French for \"twenty-four\"). When numerals or other symbols are used as special graphical forms of letters, as ''1337'' for [[leet]] or the movie ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (which was stylised as ''Se7en''), they may be sorted as if they were those letters. [[Natural sort order]] orders strings alphabetically, except that multi-digit numbers are treated as a single character and ordered by the value of the number encoded by the digits.\n\n===Language-specific conventions===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}\nLanguages which use an [[extended Latin alphabet]] generally have their own conventions for treatment of the extra letters. Also in some languages certain [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s are treated as single letters for collation purposes. For example, the 29-letter alphabet of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] treats ''\u00f1'' as a basic letter following ''n'', and formerly treated the digraphs ''ch'' and ''ll'' as basic letters following ''c'' and ''l'', respectively. ''Ch'' and ''ll'' are still considered letters, but are now alphabetized as two-letter combinations. (The new alphabetization rule was issued by the [[Royal Spanish Academy]] in 1994.) On the other hand, the digraph ''rr'' follows ''rqu'' as expected, and did so even before the 1994 alphabetization rule.\n\nIn a few cases, such as [[Kiowa alphabet|Kiowa]], the alphabet has been completely reordered.\n\nAlphabetization rules applied in various languages are listed below.\n* In [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], there are eight additional letters to the standard Latin alphabet. Five of them are vowels: i, \u0131, \u00f6, \u00fc, [[\u0259]] and three are consonants: \u00e7, \u015f, \u011f. The alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]], with the same sounds written with the same letters, except for three additional letters: q, x and \u0259 for sounds that do not exist in Turkish. Although all the \"Turkish letters\" are collated in their \"normal\" alphabetical order like in Turkish, the three extra letters are collated arbitrarily after letters whose sounds approach theirs. So, q is collated just after k, x (pronounced like a German ''ch'') is collated just after h and \u0259 (pronounced roughly like an English short ''a'') is collated just after e.\n* In [[Breton language|Breton]], there is no \"c\", \"q\", \"x\" but there are the digraphs \"ch\" and \"c'h\", which are collated between \"b\" and \"d\". For example: \u00ab&nbsp;buzhugenn, chug, c'hoar, daeraouenn&nbsp;\u00bb (earthworm, juice, sister, teardrop).\n* In [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and other related South Slavic languages, the five accented characters and three conjoined characters are sorted after the originals: ..., C, \u010c, \u0106, D, D\u017d, \u0110, E, ..., L, LJ, M, N, NJ, O, ..., S, \u0160, T, ..., Z, \u017d.\n* In [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], accented vowels have secondary collating weight \u2013 compared to other letters, they are treated as their unaccented forms (A-\u00c1, E-\u00c9-\u011a, I-\u00cd, O-\u00d3-\u00d4, U-\u00da-\u016e, Y-\u00dd), but then they are sorted after the unaccented letters (for example, the correct lexicographic order is baa, ba\u00e1, b\u00e1a, bab, b\u00e1b, bac, b\u00e1c, ba\u010d, b\u00e1\u010d). Accented consonants (the ones with [[caron]]) have primary collating weight and are collocated immediately after their unaccented counterparts, with exception of \u010e, \u0147 and \u0164, which have again secondary weight. [[Ch (digraph)|CH]] is considered to be a separate letter and goes between [[H]] and [[I]]. In Slovak, [[Dz (digraph)|DZ]] and [[D\u017d]] are also considered separate letters and are positioned between [[\u010e]] and [[E]] (A-\u00c1-\u00c4-B-C-\u010c-D-\u010e-DZ-D\u017d-E-\u00c9...).\n* In the [[Danish and Norwegian alphabet]]s, the same extra vowels as in Swedish (see below) are also present but in a different order and with different [[glyph]]s (..., X, Y, Z, [[\u00c6]], [[\u00d8]], [[\u00c5]]). Also, \"Aa\" collates as an equivalent to \"\u00c5\". The Danish alphabet has traditionally seen \"W\" as a variant of \"V\", but today \"W\" is considered a separate letter.\n* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] the combination IJ (representing [[IJ (letter)|\u0132]]) was formerly to be collated as Y (or sometimes, as a separate letter Y < IJ < Z), but is currently mostly collated as 2 letters (II < IJ < IK). Exceptions are phone directories; IJ is always collated as Y here because in many Dutch family names Y is used where modern spelling would require IJ. Note that a word starting with ij that is written with a capital I is also written with a capital J, for example, the town [[IJmuiden]], the river [[IJssel]] and the country IJsland ([[Iceland]]).\n* In [[Esperanto]], consonants with [[circumflex]] accents ('''[[c-circumflex|\u0109]]''', '''[[g-circumflex|\u011d]]''', '''[[h-circumflex|\u0125]]''', '''[[j-circumflex|\u0135]]''', '''[[s-circumflex|\u015d]]'''), as well as '''[[u-breve|\u016d]]''' (u with [[breve]]), are counted as separate letters and collated separately (c, \u0109, d, e, f, g, \u011d, h, \u0125, i, j, \u0135 ... s, \u015d, t, u, \u016d, v, z).\n* In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] [[\u00f5]], [[\u00e4]], [[\u00f6]] and [[\u00fc]] are considered separate letters and collate after [[w]]. Letters [[\u0161]], [[z]] and [[\u017e]] appear in loanwords and foreign proper names only and follow the letter [[s]] in the [[Estonian alphabet]], which otherwise does not differ from the basic Latin alphabet.\n* The [[Faroese alphabet]] also has some of the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish extra letters, namely [[\u00c6]] and [[\u00d8]]. Furthermore, the [[Faroese alphabet]] uses the Icelandic eth, which follows the [[D]]. Five of the six vowels [[A]], [[I]], [[O]], [[U]] and [[Y]] can get accents and are after that considered separate letters. The consonants [[C]], [[Q]], [[X]], [[W]] and [[Z]] are not found. Therefore, the first five letters are [[A]], [[\u00c1]], [[B]], [[D]] and [[\u00d0]], and the last five are [[V]], [[Y]], [[\u00dd]], [[\u00c6]], [[\u00d8]]\n* In [[Filipino language|Filipino (Tagalog)]] and other Philippine languages, the letter Ng is treated as a separate letter.  It is pronounced as in sing, ping-pong, etc. By itself, it is pronounced '''nang''', but in general [[Filipino orthography]], it is spelled as if it were two separate letters (n and g).  Also, letter derivatives (such as [[\u00d1]]) immediately follow the base letter.  [[Filipino language|Filipino]] also is written with diacritics, but their use is very rare (except the [[tilde]]).  (Philippine orthography also includes spelling.)\n* The [[Finnish alphabet]] and collating rules are the same as those of Swedish.\n* For [[French language|French]], the ''last'' accent in a given word determines the order.<ref name=unicode10>{{cite web| title=Unicode Technical Standard #10: Unicode collation algorithm| publisher=Unicode, Inc. (unicode.org) |date=20 March 2008| url= https://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/| accessdate=27 August 2008}}</ref>  For example, in French, the following four words would be sorted this way: cote < c\u00f4te < cot\u00e9 < c\u00f4t\u00e9.\n* In [[German alphabet|German]] letters with umlaut ([[\u00c4]], [[\u00d6]], [[\u00dc]]) are treated generally just like their non-umlauted versions; [[\u00df]] is always sorted as ss. This makes the alphabetic order Arg, \u00c4rgerlich, Arm, Assistant, A\u00dflar, Assoziation. For phone directories and similar lists of names, the umlauts are to be collated like the letter combinations \"ae\", \"oe\", \"ue\" because a number of German surnames appear both with umlaut and in the non-umlauted form with \"e\" (M\u00fcller/Mueller). This makes the alphabetic order Udet, \u00dcbelacker, Uell, \u00dclle, Ueve, \u00dcxk\u00fcll, Uffenbach.\n* The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] vowels have accents, umlauts, and double accents, while consonants are written with single, double (digraphs) or triple (trigraph) characters.  In collating, accented vowels are equivalent with their non-accented counterparts and double and triple characters follow their single originals. Hungarian alphabetic order is: '''A=\u00c1''', B, C, '''Cs''', D, '''Dz''', '''Dzs''', '''E=\u00c9''', F, G, '''Gy''', H, '''I=\u00cd''', J, K, L, '''Ly''', M, N, '''Ny''', '''O=\u00d3''', '''\u00d6=\u0150''', P, Q, R, S, '''Sz''', T, '''Ty''', '''U=\u00da''', '''\u00dc=\u0170''', V, W, X, Y, Z, '''Zs'''. (Before 1984, ''dz'' and ''dzs'' were not considered single letters for collation, but two letters each, d+z and d+zs instead.) It means that e.g. ''n\u00e1dcukor'' should precede ''n\u00e1dcsom\u00f3'' (even though ''s'' normally precedes ''u''), since ''c'' precedes ''cs'' in the collation. Difference in vowel length should only be taken into consideration if the two words are otherwise identical (e.g. ''eg\u00e9r, \u00e9ger''). Spaces and hyphens within phrases are ignored in collation. ''Ch'' also occurs as a digraph in certain words but it is not considered as a grapheme on its own right in terms of collation.\n*:A particular feature of Hungarian collation is that contracted forms of double di- and trigraphs (such as {{lang|hu|ggy}} from ''gy&nbsp;+&nbsp;gy'' or {{lang|hu|ddzs}} from ''dzs&nbsp;+&nbsp;dzs'') should be collated as if they were written in full (independently of the fact of the contraction and the elements of the di- or trigraphs). For example, ''kaszin\u00f3'' should precede ''kassza'' (even though the 4th character ''z'' would normally come after ''s'' in the alphabet), because the fourth \"character\" ([[grapheme]]) of the word ''kassza'' is considered a second ''sz'' (decomposing ''ssz'' into ''sz&nbsp;+&nbsp;sz''), which does follow ''i'' (in ''kaszin\u00f3'').<!-- source: 14. c) of the Rules of Hungarian Orthography, cf. [[Hungarian orthography]] -->\n* In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[\u00de]] is added, and D is followed by [[\u00d0]]. Each vowel (A, E, I, O, U, Y) is followed by its correspondent with [[Acute accent|acute]]: \u00c1, \u00c9, \u00cd, \u00d3, \u00da, \u00dd. There is no Z, so the alphabet ends: ... X, Y, \u00dd, [[\u00de]], [[\u00c6]], \u00d6.\n** Both letters were also used by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] scribes who also used the Runic letter [[Wynn]] to represent /w/.\n** [[thorn (letter)|\u00de]] (called thorn; lowercase \u00fe) is also a Runic letter.\n** [[Eth (letter)|\u00d0]] (called eth; lowercase \u00f0) is the letter [[D]] with an added stroke.\n* [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] is ordered on phonetic principles, like the [[Brahmic scripts]], rather than on the historical Latin order.  Vowels come first, then stop consonants ordered from the front to the back of the mouth, and from negative to positive [[voice-onset time]], then the affricates, fricatives, liquids, and nasals:\n:: A, AU, E, I, O, U, B, F, P, V, D, J, T, TH, G, C, K, Q, CH, X, S, Z, L, Y, W, H, M, N\n* In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], specifically Lithuanian letters go after their Latin originals. Another change is that [[Y]] comes just before [[J]]: ... G, H, I, \u012e, Y, J, K...\n* In [[Polish language|Polish]], specifically Polish letters derived from the Latin alphabet are collated after their originals: A, \u0104, B, C, \u0106, D, E, \u0118, ..., L, \u0141, M, N, \u0143, O, \u00d3, P, ..., S, \u015a, T, ..., Z, \u0179, \u017b. The digraphs for collation purposes are treated as if they were two separate letters.\n* In [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]], the collating order is just like in English: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Digraphs and letters with diacritics are not included in the alphabet.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], special characters derived from the Latin alphabet are collated after their originals: A, \u0102, \u00c2, ..., I, \u00ce, ..., S, \u0218, T, \u021a, ..., Z.\n* [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]] treated (until 1994) \"CH\" and \"LL\" as single letters, giving an ordering of ''{{wiktspa|cinco}}, {{wiktspa|credo}}, {{wiktspa|chispa}}'' and ''{{wiktspa|lomo}}, {{wiktspa|luz}}, {{wiktspa|llama}}.'' This is not true any more since in 1994 the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|RAE]] adopted the more conventional usage, and now LL is collated between LK and  LM, and CH between CG and CI. The six characters with diacritics \u00c1, \u00c9, \u00cd, \u00d3, \u00da, \u00dc are treated as the original letters A, E, I, O, U, for example: ''{{wiktspa|radio}}, {{wiktspa|r\u00e1faga}}, {{wiktspa|rana}}, {{wiktspa|r\u00e1pido}}, {{wiktspa|rastrillo}}.'' The only Spanish-specific collating question is [[\u00d1]] ({{wiktspa|e\u00f1e}}) as a different letter collated after N.\n* In the [[Swedish alphabet]], there are three extra [[vowel]]s placed at its end (..., X, Y, Z, [[\u00c5]], [[\u00c4]], [[\u00d6]]), similar to the Danish and Norwegian alphabet, but with different glyphs and a different collating order. The letter \"W\" has been treated as a variant of \"V\", but in the 13th edition of ''[[Svenska Akademiens Ordlista|Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'' (2006) \"W\" was considered a separate letter.\n* In the [[Turkish alphabet]] there are 6 additional letters: \u00e7, \u011f, \u0131, \u00f6, \u015f, and \u00fc (but no q, w, and x). They are collated with \u00e7 after c, \u011f after g, \u0131 ''before'' i, \u00f6 after o, \u015f after s, and \u00fc after u. Originally, when the alphabet was introduced in 1928, \u0131 was collated after i, but the order was changed later so that letters having shapes containing dots, cedilles or other adorning marks always follow the letters with corresponding bare shapes. Note that in Turkish orthography the letter I is the majuscule of dotless \u0131, whereas \u0130 is the majuscule of dotted i.\n* In many [[Turkic languages]] (such as [[Azeri language|Azeri]] or the [[Ya\u00f1alif|Ja\ua791alif]] orthography for [[Tatar language|Tatar]]), there used to be the letter [[Gha]] (\u01a2\u01a3), which came between [[G]] and [[H]]. It is now in disuse.\n* In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]],  there are 7 additional letters: [[\u0103]], [[\u00e2]], [[\u0111]], [[\u00ea]], [[\u00f4]], [[\u01a1]], [[\u01b0]] while [[f]], [[j]], [[w]], [[z]] are absent, even though they are still in some use (like Internet address, foreign loan language). \"f\" is replaced by the combination \"ph\". The same as for \"w\" is \"qu\".\n* In [[Volap\u00fck]] [[\u00e4]], [[\u00f6]] and [[\u00fc]] are counted as separate letters and collated separately (a, \u00e4, b ... o, \u00f6, p ... u, \u00fc, v) while [[q]] and [[w]] are absent.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Midgley |first=Ralph |title=Volap\u00fck to English dictionary |url=http://volap%C3%BCk.com/VoEnDictionary-20100830.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901034151/http://xn--volapk-7ya.com/VoEnDictionary-20100830.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy |access-date=24 September 2019 }}</ref>\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the digraphs CH, DD, FF, NG, LL, PH, RH, and TH are treated as single letters, and each is listed after the first character of the pair (except for NG which is listed after G), producing the order A, B, C, CH, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, NG, H, and so on. It can sometimes happen, however, that word compounding results in the juxtaposition of two letters which do ''not'' form a digraph. An example is the word LLONGYFARCH (composed from LLON + GYFARCH). This results in such an ordering as, for example, LAWR, LWCUS, LLONG, LLOM, LLONGYFARCH (NG is a digraph in LLONG, but not in LLONGYFARCH). The letter combination R+H (as distinct from the digraph RH) may similarly arise by juxtaposition in compounds, although this tends not to produce any pairs in which misidentification could affect the ordering. For the other potentially confusing letter combinations that may occur \u2013 namely, D+D and L+L \u2013 a hyphen is used in the spelling (e.g. AD-DAL, CHWIL-LYS).\n\n==Automation==\n{{more|Collation#Automated collation}}\n[[Collation algorithm]]s (in combination with [[sorting algorithm]]s) are used in computer programming to place strings in alphabetical order. A standard example is the [[Unicode Collation Algorithm]], which can be used to put strings containing any [[Unicode]] symbols into (an extension of) alphabetical order.<ref name=unicode10/> It can be made to conform to most of the language-specific conventions described above by tailoring its default collation table. Several such tailorings are collected in [[Common Locale Data Repository]].\n\n==Similar orderings==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nThe principle behind alphabetical ordering can still be applied in languages that do not strictly speaking use an [[alphabet]] \u2013 for example, they may be written using a [[syllabary]] or [[abugida]] \u2013 provided the symbols used have an established ordering.\n\nFor [[logograph]]ic writing systems, such as Chinese [[hanzi]] or Japanese [[kanji]], the method of [[radical-and-stroke sorting]] is frequently used as a way of defining an ordering on the symbols. Japanese sometimes uses pronunciation order, most commonly with the [[Goj\u016bon]] order but sometimes with the older [[Iroha]] ordering.\n\nIn mathematics, [[lexicographical order]] is a means of ordering sequences in a manner analogous to that used to produce alphabetical order.<ref name=\"BaaderNipkow1999\">{{cite book|author1=Franz Baader|author2=Tobias Nipkow|title=Term Rewriting and All That|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77920-3|pages=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nSome computer applications use a version of alphabetical order that can be achieved using a very simple [[algorithm]], based purely on the [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]] codes for characters. This may have non-standard effects such as placing all capital letters before lower-case ones.

It is one of the methods of [[collation]]. In mathematics, a [[lexicographical order]] is the generalization of the alphabetical order to other data types, such as [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] of digits or numbers.\n\nWhen applied to strings or [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] that, beside alphabetical characters, may contain also digits, numbers or more elaborate types of elements, the alphabetical order is generally called a [[lexicographical order]].\n\nTo determine which of two strings of characters comes first when arranging in alphabetical order, their first [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order.\n\n[[Capital letter]]s (upper case) are generally considered to be identical to their corresponding lower case letters for the purposes of alphabetical ordering, though conventions may be adopted to handle situations where two strings differ ''only'' in capitalization. Various conventions also exist for the handling of strings containing [[space (symbol)|space]]s, modified letters (such as those with [[diacritic]]s), and non-letter characters such as marks of [[punctuation]].\n\nThe result of placing a set of words or strings in alphabetical order is that all the strings beginning with the same letter are grouped together; and within that grouping all words beginning with the same two-letter sequence are grouped together; and so on. The system thus tends to maximize the number of common initial letters between adjacent words.\n\n==History==\nAlphabetical order was first used in the 1st millennium BC by Northwest Semitic scribes using the [[Abjad]] system.<ref>Reinhard G. Lehmann: \"27-30-22-26. How Many Letters Needs an Alphabet? The Case of Semitic\", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52</ref> The first effective use of alphabetical order as a cataloging device among scholars may have been in ancient Alexandria.<ref>Daly, Lloyd. ''Contributions to the History of Alphabetization in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' Brussels, 1967. p. 25</ref>\n\nThe [[Bible]] is dated to the 6-7th centuries BCE. In the [[Book of Jeremiah]],  the prophet utilizes an [[Atbash]] [[substitution cipher]], based on alphabetical order. Similarly, biblical authors used [[acrostic]]s based on the (ordered) [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\nIn the 1st century BC, Roman writer [[Varro]] compiled alphabetic lists of authors and titles.<ref name=\"O'Hara\">{{cite journal |title=Messapus, Cycnus, and the Alphabetical Order of Vergil's Catalogue of Italian Heroes |last=O'Hara |first=James |year=1989 |jstor=1088539 |volume=43 |pages=35\u201338}}</ref> In the 2nd century CE, [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] wrote an encyclopedic [[epitome]] of the works of [[Verrius Flaccus]], ''[[De verborum significatu]]'', with entries in alphabetic order.<ref name=\"remacle\">{{cite book |url=http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/Festus/m.htm |title=LIVRE XI \u2013 texte latin \u2013 traduction + commentaires}}</ref> In the 3rd century CE, [[Harpocration]] wrote a [[Homer]]ic lexicon alphabetized by all letters.<ref name=\"gibson\">{{cite book |title=Interpreting a classic: Demosthenes and his ancient commentators |last=Gibson |first=Craig |year=2002}}</ref> In the 10th century, the author of the ''[[Suda]]'' used alphabetic order with phonetic variations.

''As'' comes before ''Aster'' because they begin with the same two letters and ''As'' has no more letters after that whereas ''Aster'' does. The next three words come after ''Aster'' because their fourth letter (the first one that differs) is ''r'', which comes after ''e'' (the fourth letter of ''Aster'') in the alphabet. Those words themselves are ordered based on their sixth letters (''l'', ''n'' and ''p'' respectively). Then comes ''At'', which differs from the preceding words in the second letter (''t'' comes after ''s''). ''Ataman'' comes after ''At'' for the same reason that ''Aster'' came after ''As''. ''Attack'' follows ''Ataman'' based on comparison of their third letters, and ''Baa'' comes after all of the others because it has a different first letter.\n\n===Treatment of multiword strings===\nWhen some of the strings being ordered consist of more than one word, i.e., they contain [[space (character)|spaces]] or other separators such as [[hyphen]]s, then two basic approaches may be taken. In the first approach, all strings are ordered initially according to their first  word, as in the sequence:\n*''Oak; Oak Hill; Oak Ridge; Oakley Park; Oakley River''\n*:where all strings beginning with the separate word ''Oak'' precede all those beginning ''Oakley'', because ''Oak'' precedes ''Oakley'' in alphabetical order.\n\nIn the second approach, strings are alphabetized as if they had no spaces, giving the sequence:\n*''Oak; Oak Hill; Oakley Park; Oakley River; Oak Ridge''\n*:where ''Oak Ridge'' now comes after the ''Oakley'' strings, as it would if it were written \"Oakridge\".\n\nThe second approach is the one usually taken in dictionaries, and it is thus often called ''[[dictionary order (disambiguation)|dictionary order]]'' by [[publishing|publishers]]. The first approach has often been used in [[index (publishing)|book indexes]], although each publisher traditionally set its own standards for which approach to use therein; there was no ISO standard for book indexes ([[ISO 999]]) before 1975.\n\n===Special cases===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Modified letters====\nIn French, modified letters (such as those with [[diacritic]]s) are treated the same as the base letter for alphabetical ordering purposes. For example, ''r\u00f4le'' comes between ''rock'' and ''rose'', as if it were written ''role''. However languages that use such letters systematically generally have their own ordering rules. See [[#Language-specific conventions|Language-specific conventions]] below.\n\n====Ordering by surname====\nIn most cultures where [[family name]]s are written after [[given name]]s, it is still desired to sort lists of names (as in telephone directories) by family name first.  In this case, names need to be reordered to be sorted properly.  For example, Juan Hernandes and Brian O'Leary should be sorted as \"Hernandes, Juan\" and \"O'Leary, Brian\" even if they are not written this way.  Capturing this rule in a computer collation algorithm is difficult, and simple attempts will necessarily fail.  For example, unless the algorithm has at its disposal an extensive list of family names, there is no way to decide if \"Gillian Lucille van der Waal\" is \"van der Waal, Gillian Lucille\", \"Waal, Gillian Lucille van der\", or even \"Lucille van der Waal, Gillian\".\n\nOrdering by surname is frequently encountered in academic contexts. Within a single multi-author paper, ordering the authors alphabetically by surname, rather than by other methods such as reverse seniority or subjective degree of contribution to the paper, is seen as a way of \"acknowledg[ing] similar contributions\" or \"avoid[ing] disharmony in collaborating groups\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Teja|last=Tscharntke|first2=Michael E|last2=Hochberg|first3=Tatyana A|last3=Rand|first4=Vincent H|last4=Resh|first5=Jochen|last5=Krauss|title=Author Sequence and Credit for Contributions in Multiauthored Publications|journal=PLoS Biol.|date=January 2007|volume=5|issue=1|pmid=17227141|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050018|pmc=1769438}}</ref> The practice in certain fields of ordering [[citation]]s in bibliographies by the surnames of their authors has been found to create bias in favour of authors with surnames which appear earlier in the alphabet, while this effect does not appear in fields in which bibliographies are ordered chronologically.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://decisionslab.unl.edu/pubs/stevens_duque_2018_SM.pdf|first=Jeffrey R.|last=Stevens|first2=Juan F.|last2=Duque|title=Order Matters: Alphabetizing In-Text Citations Biases Citation Rates|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|year=2018|doi=10.3758/s13423-018-1532-8|lay-url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/22/study-takes-aim-psychologys-practice-ordering-reference-lists-alphabetically|lay-source=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|lay-date=22 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n====''The'' and other common words====\nIf a phrase begins with a very common word (such as \"the\", \"a\" or \"an\" in grammar called articles), that word is sometimes ignored or moved to the end of the phrase, but this is not always the case. For example, the book \"[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]\" might be treated as \"Shining\", or \"Shining, The\" and therefore before the book title \"[[Summer of Sam]]\", although it may also be treated as simply \"The Shining\" and after \"Summer of Sam\". Similarly, \"[[A Wrinkle in Time]]\" might be treated as \"Wrinkle in Time\", \"Wrinkle in Time, A\", or \"A Wrinkle in Time\". All three alphabetization methods are fairly easy to create by algorithm, but many programs rely instead on simple [[lexicographic order]]ing.  Articles generally are ignored when alphabetizing.\n\n====''Mac'' prefixes====\n{{main|Mac and Mc together}}\nThe prefixes ''M''' and ''Mc'' in Irish and Scottish surnames are abbreviations for ''Mac'', and are sometimes alphabetized as if the spelling is ''Mac'' in full. Thus ''McKinley'' might be listed before ''Mackintosh'' (as it would be if it had been spelled out as \"MacKinley\"). Since the advent of computer-sorted lists, this type of alphabetization is less frequently encountered, though it is still used in British telephone directories.\n\n====Ligatures====\n[[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] (two or more letters merged into one symbol) which are not considered distinct letters, such as [[\u00c6]] and [[\u0152]] in English, are typically collated as if the letters were separate\u2014\"\u00e6ther\" and \"aether\" would be ordered the same relative to all other words. This is true even when the ligature is not purely stylistic, such as in [[loanword]]s and brand names.\n\nSpecial rules may need to be adopted to sort strings which vary only by whether two letters are joined by a ligature.\n\n===Treatment of numerals===\n{{main|Lexicographical order}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\nWhen some of the strings contain [[Numerical digit|numeral]]s (or other non-letter characters), various approaches are possible. Sometimes such characters are treated as if they came before or after all the letters of the alphabet. Another method is for numbers to be sorted alphabetically as they would be spelled: for example ''[[1776 (film)|1776]]'' would be sorted as if spelled out \"seventeen seventy-six\", and ''[[24 heures du Mans]]'' as if spelled \"vingt-quatre...\" (French for \"twenty-four\"). When numerals or other symbols are used as special graphical forms of letters, as ''1337'' for [[leet]] or the movie ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (which was stylised as ''Se7en''), they may be sorted as if they were those letters. [[Natural sort order]] orders strings alphabetically, except that multi-digit numbers are treated as a single character and ordered by the value of the number encoded by the digits.\n\n===Language-specific conventions===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}\nLanguages which use an [[extended Latin alphabet]] generally have their own conventions for treatment of the extra letters. Also in some languages certain [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s are treated as single letters for collation purposes. For example, the 29-letter alphabet of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] treats ''\u00f1'' as a basic letter following ''n'', and formerly treated the digraphs ''ch'' and ''ll'' as basic letters following ''c'' and ''l'', respectively. ''Ch'' and ''ll'' are still considered letters, but are now alphabetized as two-letter combinations. (The new alphabetization rule was issued by the [[Royal Spanish Academy]] in 1994.) On the other hand, the digraph ''rr'' follows ''rqu'' as expected, and did so even before the 1994 alphabetization rule.\n\nIn a few cases, such as [[Kiowa alphabet|Kiowa]], the alphabet has been completely reordered.\n\nAlphabetization rules applied in various languages are listed below.\n* In [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], there are eight additional letters to the standard Latin alphabet. Five of them are vowels: i, \u0131, \u00f6, \u00fc, [[\u0259]] and three are consonants: \u00e7, \u015f, \u011f. The alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]], with the same sounds written with the same letters, except for three additional letters: q, x and \u0259 for sounds that do not exist in Turkish. Although all the \"Turkish letters\" are collated in their \"normal\" alphabetical order like in Turkish, the three extra letters are collated arbitrarily after letters whose sounds approach theirs. So, q is collated just after k, x (pronounced like a German ''ch'') is collated just after h and \u0259 (pronounced roughly like an English short ''a'') is collated just after e.\n* In [[Breton language|Breton]], there is no \"c\", \"q\", \"x\" but there are the digraphs \"ch\" and \"c'h\", which are collated between \"b\" and \"d\". For example: \u00ab&nbsp;buzhugenn, chug, c'hoar, daeraouenn&nbsp;\u00bb (earthworm, juice, sister, teardrop).\n* In [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and other related South Slavic languages, the five accented characters and three conjoined characters are sorted after the originals: ..., C, \u010c, \u0106, D, D\u017d, \u0110, E, ..., L, LJ, M, N, NJ, O, ..., S, \u0160, T, ..., Z, \u017d.\n* In [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], accented vowels have secondary collating weight \u2013 compared to other letters, they are treated as their unaccented forms (A-\u00c1, E-\u00c9-\u011a, I-\u00cd, O-\u00d3-\u00d4, U-\u00da-\u016e, Y-\u00dd), but then they are sorted after the unaccented letters (for example, the correct lexicographic order is baa, ba\u00e1, b\u00e1a, bab, b\u00e1b, bac, b\u00e1c, ba\u010d, b\u00e1\u010d). Accented consonants (the ones with [[caron]]) have primary collating weight and are collocated immediately after their unaccented counterparts, with exception of \u010e, \u0147 and \u0164, which have again secondary weight. [[Ch (digraph)|CH]] is considered to be a separate letter and goes between [[H]] and [[I]]. In Slovak, [[Dz (digraph)|DZ]] and [[D\u017d]] are also considered separate letters and are positioned between [[\u010e]] and [[E]] (A-\u00c1-\u00c4-B-C-\u010c-D-\u010e-DZ-D\u017d-E-\u00c9...).\n* In the [[Danish and Norwegian alphabet]]s, the same extra vowels as in Swedish (see below) are also present but in a different order and with different [[glyph]]s (..., X, Y, Z, [[\u00c6]], [[\u00d8]], [[\u00c5]]). Also, \"Aa\" collates as an equivalent to \"\u00c5\". The Danish alphabet has traditionally seen \"W\" as a variant of \"V\", but today \"W\" is considered a separate letter.\n* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] the combination IJ (representing [[IJ (letter)|\u0132]]) was formerly to be collated as Y (or sometimes, as a separate letter Y < IJ < Z), but is currently mostly collated as 2 letters (II < IJ < IK). Exceptions are phone directories; IJ is always collated as Y here because in many Dutch family names Y is used where modern spelling would require IJ. Note that a word starting with ij that is written with a capital I is also written with a capital J, for example, the town [[IJmuiden]], the river [[IJssel]] and the country IJsland ([[Iceland]]).\n* In [[Esperanto]], consonants with [[circumflex]] accents ('''[[c-circumflex|\u0109]]''', '''[[g-circumflex|\u011d]]''', '''[[h-circumflex|\u0125]]''', '''[[j-circumflex|\u0135]]''', '''[[s-circumflex|\u015d]]'''), as well as '''[[u-breve|\u016d]]''' (u with [[breve]]), are counted as separate letters and collated separately (c, \u0109, d, e, f, g, \u011d, h, \u0125, i, j, \u0135 ... s, \u015d, t, u, \u016d, v, z).\n* In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] [[\u00f5]], [[\u00e4]], [[\u00f6]] and [[\u00fc]] are considered separate letters and collate after [[w]]. Letters [[\u0161]], [[z]] and [[\u017e]] appear in loanwords and foreign proper names only and follow the letter [[s]] in the [[Estonian alphabet]], which otherwise does not differ from the basic Latin alphabet.\n* The [[Faroese alphabet]] also has some of the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish extra letters, namely [[\u00c6]] and [[\u00d8]]. Furthermore, the [[Faroese alphabet]] uses the Icelandic eth, which follows the [[D]]. Five of the six vowels [[A]], [[I]], [[O]], [[U]] and [[Y]] can get accents and are after that considered separate letters. The consonants [[C]], [[Q]], [[X]], [[W]] and [[Z]] are not found. Therefore, the first five letters are [[A]], [[\u00c1]], [[B]], [[D]] and [[\u00d0]], and the last five are [[V]], [[Y]], [[\u00dd]], [[\u00c6]], [[\u00d8]]\n* In [[Filipino language|Filipino (Tagalog)]] and other Philippine languages, the letter Ng is treated as a separate letter.  It is pronounced as in sing, ping-pong, etc. By itself, it is pronounced '''nang''', but in general [[Filipino orthography]], it is spelled as if it were two separate letters (n and g).  Also, letter derivatives (such as [[\u00d1]]) immediately follow the base letter.  [[Filipino language|Filipino]] also is written with diacritics, but their use is very rare (except the [[tilde]]).  (Philippine orthography also includes spelling.)\n* The [[Finnish alphabet]] and collating rules are the same as those of Swedish.\n* For [[French language|French]], the ''last'' accent in a given word determines the order.<ref name=unicode10>{{cite web| title=Unicode Technical Standard #10: Unicode collation algorithm| publisher=Unicode, Inc. (unicode.org) |date=20 March 2008| url= https://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/| accessdate=27 August 2008}}</ref>  For example, in French, the following four words would be sorted this way: cote < c\u00f4te < cot\u00e9 < c\u00f4t\u00e9.\n* In [[German alphabet|German]] letters with umlaut ([[\u00c4]], [[\u00d6]], [[\u00dc]]) are treated generally just like their non-umlauted versions; [[\u00df]] is always sorted as ss. This makes the alphabetic order Arg, \u00c4rgerlich, Arm, Assistant, A\u00dflar, Assoziation. For phone directories and similar lists of names, the umlauts are to be collated like the letter combinations \"ae\", \"oe\", \"ue\" because a number of German surnames appear both with umlaut and in the non-umlauted form with \"e\" (M\u00fcller/Mueller). This makes the alphabetic order Udet, \u00dcbelacker, Uell, \u00dclle, Ueve, \u00dcxk\u00fcll, Uffenbach.\n* The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] vowels have accents, umlauts, and double accents, while consonants are written with single, double (digraphs) or triple (trigraph) characters.  In collating, accented vowels are equivalent with their non-accented counterparts and double and triple characters follow their single originals. Hungarian alphabetic order is: '''A=\u00c1''', B, C, '''Cs''', D, '''Dz''', '''Dzs''', '''E=\u00c9''', F, G, '''Gy''', H, '''I=\u00cd''', J, K, L, '''Ly''', M, N, '''Ny''', '''O=\u00d3''', '''\u00d6=\u0150''', P, Q, R, S, '''Sz''', T, '''Ty''', '''U=\u00da''', '''\u00dc=\u0170''', V, W, X, Y, Z, '''Zs'''. (Before 1984, ''dz'' and ''dzs'' were not considered single letters for collation, but two letters each, d+z and d+zs instead.) It means that e.g. ''n\u00e1dcukor'' should precede ''n\u00e1dcsom\u00f3'' (even though ''s'' normally precedes ''u''), since ''c'' precedes ''cs'' in the collation. Difference in vowel length should only be taken into consideration if the two words are otherwise identical (e.g. ''eg\u00e9r, \u00e9ger''). Spaces and hyphens within phrases are ignored in collation. ''Ch'' also occurs as a digraph in certain words but it is not considered as a grapheme on its own right in terms of collation.\n*:A particular feature of Hungarian collation is that contracted forms of double di- and trigraphs (such as {{lang|hu|ggy}} from ''gy&nbsp;+&nbsp;gy'' or {{lang|hu|ddzs}} from ''dzs&nbsp;+&nbsp;dzs'') should be collated as if they were written in full (independently of the fact of the contraction and the elements of the di- or trigraphs). For example, ''kaszin\u00f3'' should precede ''kassza'' (even though the 4th character ''z'' would normally come after ''s'' in the alphabet), because the fourth \"character\" ([[grapheme]]) of the word ''kassza'' is considered a second ''sz'' (decomposing ''ssz'' into ''sz&nbsp;+&nbsp;sz''), which does follow ''i'' (in ''kaszin\u00f3'').<!-- source: 14. c) of the Rules of Hungarian Orthography, cf. [[Hungarian orthography]] -->\n* In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[\u00de]] is added, and D is followed by [[\u00d0]]. Each vowel (A, E, I, O, U, Y) is followed by its correspondent with [[Acute accent|acute]]: \u00c1, \u00c9, \u00cd, \u00d3, \u00da, \u00dd. There is no Z, so the alphabet ends: ... X, Y, \u00dd, [[\u00de]], [[\u00c6]], \u00d6.\n** Both letters were also used by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] scribes who also used the Runic letter [[Wynn]] to represent /w/.\n** [[thorn (letter)|\u00de]] (called thorn; lowercase \u00fe) is also a Runic letter.\n** [[Eth (letter)|\u00d0]] (called eth; lowercase \u00f0) is the letter [[D]] with an added stroke.\n* [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] is ordered on phonetic principles, like the [[Brahmic scripts]], rather than on the historical Latin order.  Vowels come first, then stop consonants ordered from the front to the back of the mouth, and from negative to positive [[voice-onset time]], then the affricates, fricatives, liquids, and nasals:\n:: A, AU, E, I, O, U, B, F, P, V, D, J, T, TH, G, C, K, Q, CH, X, S, Z, L, Y, W, H, M, N\n* In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], specifically Lithuanian letters go after their Latin originals. Another change is that [[Y]] comes just before [[J]]: ... G, H, I, \u012e, Y, J, K...\n* In [[Polish language|Polish]], specifically Polish letters derived from the Latin alphabet are collated after their originals: A, \u0104, B, C, \u0106, D, E, \u0118, ..., L, \u0141, M, N, \u0143, O, \u00d3, P, ..., S, \u015a, T, ..., Z, \u0179, \u017b. The digraphs for collation purposes are treated as if they were two separate letters.\n* In [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]], the collating order is just like in English: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Digraphs and letters with diacritics are not included in the alphabet.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], special characters derived from the Latin alphabet are collated after their originals: A, \u0102, \u00c2, ..., I, \u00ce, ..., S, \u0218, T, \u021a, ..., Z.\n* [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]] treated (until 1994) \"CH\" and \"LL\" as single letters, giving an ordering of ''{{wiktspa|cinco}}, {{wiktspa|credo}}, {{wiktspa|chispa}}'' and ''{{wiktspa|lomo}}, {{wiktspa|luz}}, {{wiktspa|llama}}.'' This is not true any more since in 1994 the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|RAE]] adopted the more conventional usage, and now LL is collated between LK and  LM, and CH between CG and CI. The six characters with diacritics \u00c1, \u00c9, \u00cd, \u00d3, \u00da, \u00dc are treated as the original letters A, E, I, O, U, for example: ''{{wiktspa|radio}}, {{wiktspa|r\u00e1faga}}, {{wiktspa|rana}}, {{wiktspa|r\u00e1pido}}, {{wiktspa|rastrillo}}.'' The only Spanish-specific collating question is [[\u00d1]] ({{wiktspa|e\u00f1e}}) as a different letter collated after N.\n* In the [[Swedish alphabet]], there are three extra [[vowel]]s placed at its end (..., X, Y, Z, [[\u00c5]], [[\u00c4]], [[\u00d6]]), similar to the Danish and Norwegian alphabet, but with different glyphs and a different collating order. The letter \"W\" has been treated as a variant of \"V\", but in the 13th edition of ''[[Svenska Akademiens Ordlista|Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'' (2006) \"W\" was considered a separate letter.\n* In the [[Turkish alphabet]] there are 6 additional letters: \u00e7, \u011f, \u0131, \u00f6, \u015f, and \u00fc (but no q, w, and x). They are collated with \u00e7 after c, \u011f after g, \u0131 ''before'' i, \u00f6 after o, \u015f after s, and \u00fc after u. Originally, when the alphabet was introduced in 1928, \u0131 was collated after i, but the order was changed later so that letters having shapes containing dots, cedilles or other adorning marks always follow the letters with corresponding bare shapes. Note that in Turkish orthography the letter I is the majuscule of dotless \u0131, whereas \u0130 is the majuscule of dotted i.\n* In many [[Turkic languages]] (such as [[Azeri language|Azeri]] or the [[Ya\u00f1alif|Ja\ua791alif]] orthography for [[Tatar language|Tatar]]), there used to be the letter [[Gha]] (\u01a2\u01a3), which came between [[G]] and [[H]]. It is now in disuse.\n* In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]],  there are 7 additional letters: [[\u0103]], [[\u00e2]], [[\u0111]], [[\u00ea]], [[\u00f4]], [[\u01a1]], [[\u01b0]] while [[f]], [[j]], [[w]], [[z]] are absent, even though they are still in some use (like Internet address, foreign loan language). \"f\" is replaced by the combination \"ph\". The same as for \"w\" is \"qu\".\n* In [[Volap\u00fck]] [[\u00e4]], [[\u00f6]] and [[\u00fc]] are counted as separate letters and collated separately (a, \u00e4, b ... o, \u00f6, p ... u, \u00fc, v) while [[q]] and [[w]] are absent.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Midgley |first=Ralph |title=Volap\u00fck to English dictionary |url=http://volap%C3%BCk.com/VoEnDictionary-20100830.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901034151/http://xn--volapk-7ya.com/VoEnDictionary-20100830.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy |access-date=24 September 2019 }}</ref>\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the digraphs CH, DD, FF, NG, LL, PH, RH, and TH are treated as single letters, and each is listed after the first character of the pair (except for NG which is listed after G), producing the order A, B, C, CH, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, NG, H, and so on. It can sometimes happen, however, that word compounding results in the juxtaposition of two letters which do ''not'' form a digraph. An example is the word LLONGYFARCH (composed from LLON + GYFARCH). This results in such an ordering as, for example, LAWR, LWCUS, LLONG, LLOM, LLONGYFARCH (NG is a digraph in LLONG, but not in LLONGYFARCH). The letter combination R+H (as distinct from the digraph RH) may similarly arise by juxtaposition in compounds, although this tends not to produce any pairs in which misidentification could affect the ordering. For the other potentially confusing letter combinations that may occur \u2013 namely, D+D and L+L \u2013 a hyphen is used in the spelling (e.g. AD-DAL, CHWIL-LYS).\n\n==Automation==\n{{more|Collation#Automated collation}}\n[[Collation algorithm]]s (in combination with [[sorting algorithm]]s) are used in computer programming to place strings in alphabetical order. A standard example is the [[Unicode Collation Algorithm]], which can be used to put strings containing any [[Unicode]] symbols into (an extension of) alphabetical order.<ref name=unicode10/> It can be made to conform to most of the language-specific conventions described above by tailoring its default collation table. Several such tailorings are collected in [[Common Locale Data Repository]].\n\n==Similar orderings==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nThe principle behind alphabetical ordering can still be applied in languages that do not strictly speaking use an [[alphabet]] \u2013 for example, they may be written using a [[syllabary]] or [[abugida]] \u2013 provided the symbols used have an established ordering.\n\nFor [[logograph]]ic writing systems, such as Chinese [[hanzi]] or Japanese [[kanji]], the method of [[radical-and-stroke sorting]] is frequently used as a way of defining an ordering on the symbols. Japanese sometimes uses pronunciation order, most commonly with the [[Goj\u016bon]] order but sometimes with the older [[Iroha]] ordering.\n\nIn mathematics, [[lexicographical order]] is a means of ordering sequences in a manner analogous to that used to produce alphabetical order.<ref name=\"BaaderNipkow1999\">{{cite book|author1=Franz Baader|author2=Tobias Nipkow|title=Term Rewriting and All That|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77920-3|pages=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nSome computer applications use a version of alphabetical order that can be achieved using a very simple [[algorithm]], based purely on the [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]] codes for characters. This may have non-standard effects such as placing all capital letters before lower-case ones. See [[ASCIIbetical order]].\n\nA [[rhyming dictionary]] is based on sorting words in alphabetical order starting from the last to the first letter of the word.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Collation]]\n*[[Help:Alphabetical order]]\n*[[Sorting]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Chauvin, Yvonne.
