So according to Akilam, Sampooranathevan lived between 1809 and 1833 and Vaikundar then incarnated in the body of Mudisoodum Perumal (Sampooranathevan), living from 1833 to 1851.</ref> at [[Swamithoppe|Poovandanthoppe]].<ref>{{cite web\n  | vauthors =\n | title = Life History of Lord Vaikundar\n | work=Ayyavazhi.org \u2013 Life History\n | url = http://ayyavazhi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=41\n | accessdate =31 January 2008}}</ref> The [[Thuvayal thavasu]] (washing [[penance]]) of 1840 is the origin of Ayyavazhi as an alternative religio-cultural phenomena.<ref>G.

Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 112.</ref> Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', Chapter 5, p. 120</ref> In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as \"told by God\" at several places at different situations to lesser [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], [[saint]]s, etc. whenever asked by them.\n\n[[Neetham]] is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, [[Vinchai to Vaikundar|Vinchai]] is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first ''Vinchai of Tiruchendur'' forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.<ref name=\"Ayyavazhi ethics\" />\n\nTo an extent, the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi]] are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and \"attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness\" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] also.<ref name=\"Dharma for devas\" >Mani Bharathi, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai (Part \u2013 2)''.</ref> It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then.<ref name=\"Dharma for devas\" /> Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force [[kalimayai]] with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] rules the minds of people.\n\nArul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The [[Sivakanta Athikarappatthiram|Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram]] here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially [[circumambulation]]s, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed out of immoral thoughts and acts.\n\n==Religious studies==\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi religious studies}}\n[[File:Tamarai-Namam glossy.png|thumb|left|The Holy [[Symbol of Ayyavazhi]]]]\nIt is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the [[Hindu scriptures]]. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.<ref name=\"G. Patrick, p.119\">G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali', p.119.</ref> It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him.<ref>G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 120\u2013121.</ref> Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.\n\nThe philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on [[Ayyavazhi theology]].<ref>P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnu Mani, ''Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram'', pp. 20\u201321</ref> But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures.<ref name= \"Hindu keys to Akilam\">N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?'', pp.10\u201320.</ref> For example, if the 96 [[tatvas]] are understood, then the [[Kaliyan]] is understood. Therefore, theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam.<ref>N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', pp. 190\u2013191.</ref> However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the [[Hindu]] ideas and concepts.<ref name= \"Hindu keys to Akilam\" /> Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.\n\nOn [[myth]]ical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main [[Hindu mythology|mythology of Hinduism]], including [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], Kantha Purana and [[Vishnu Purana]], but with limited details.<ref>T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p.62.</ref> It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream {{sic}} story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate [[Hindu scriptures]] that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.151.</ref> Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted,<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', p.155.</ref> some are regenerated,<ref name=\"G. Patrick, p.119\"/> while others are rejected.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nGenerally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies.<ref name=\"Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures\" /> But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.<ref name=\"Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures\">''Arisundara Mani'', Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p.

Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493</ref> It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matter as an [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, [[Infinity|infinite]], genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, \"one\", \"absolute\",<ref>M. Winslow (1869), ''A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary'', American Mission Press ([[Madras]]), {{ISBN|81-206-0001-0}}, p. 185</ref> \"the whole which exists\"<ref>V.T. Ramasupramaniyam, ''Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi'', p. 210</ref> and \"the incomparable\";<ref>''Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi'', p. 173.</ref> all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.\n\nNarrating through mythology, The ''Sivam'' and the ''Sakthi'' are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The ''Natham''(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from [[Akilam thirteen]] says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is [[Creation myth|created]] by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more [[monotheism|monotheistic]] rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar.  Vaikundar is a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|turine power]] who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil What Does He Look Like?|date=2012|publisher=Millennial Mind Pub|isbn=978-1589826625|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SD6-YKBqGr0C&dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> was fragmented into six and each fragment took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu role throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called ''Kalimayai'' (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a way<ref>Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 36, \"Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance.\"</ref> that contrasts the [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] definition to Ayyavazhi theology.\n\n==Festivals and rituals==\n[[File:Kodiyetru Thirunal.jpg|thumb|left|The flag hoisting fest during [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in [[Swamithope pathi]].]]\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi festivals|Ayyavazhi rituals}}\nThere are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi.

Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings.<ref>G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 19</ref> Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated.

Ari Sundaramani'', ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayana Urai'', p. 485.</ref> The [[Ayyavazhi religious practices#Wearing of headgear during worship|use of the crown]] reveals that \"all are kings\", visualising an ideology similar to ''advaita''. Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 137.</ref> Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#A distinct language|alternative phrases]] religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.\n\n==Inclusiveness and exclusivity==\n{{Main|Inclusiveness and exclusivity in Ayyavazhi}}\nThe formula of [[Inclusivism|inclusiveness]] and [[Exclusivity (religion)|exclusivity]], as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.\n[[File:Ten Incarnation door.jpg|thumb|left|The door of [[Swamithoppe]] [[Palliyarai]] with the [[Dashavatara|ten avatars of Vishnu]] carved on it]]\nAyyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of [[Allah]] and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism.<ref name = \"Gods in Ayyavazhi\">T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 61\u201365.</ref> It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings.<ref name = \"Gods in Ayyavazhi\" /> But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|cruel nature of his boons]], for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scriptures<ref>Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 30.</ref> had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda [[Avatar]], Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in [[Akilam thirteen]] which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana,<ref name = \"Gods in Ayyavazhi\" /> but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the [[Books of the Bible|Bible composition]]. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is \"it was created with the intention of man and not that of God\".<ref>\"He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention\". \u2013 Akilam5:571</ref> In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like '' 'Accept God; Reject religion' ''.<ref>Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'' p. 470.</ref>\n\nAyyavazhi accepts various [[incarnation]]s in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' ''Hindu'' ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas.<ref>Akilam 12:151 \u2013 \"Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal\"</ref> Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boon]] they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only '' 'Book of Perfection' ''. By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only [[Ayyavazhi scriptures|its own]]. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost ''Kali mayai'' (evil of Kali).<ref>R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp. 114 -116.</ref> The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.<ref name= \"Ayyavazhi belief system\" />\n\n==Mythology==\n\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi mythology}}\nThe mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history \u2013 a past, a present and a future \u2013 meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.<ref>G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, \"A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history \u2013 a past, a present, and a future \u2013 constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts.\"</ref> It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely [[The Santror|Santror]], Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with [[Hindu mythology]]. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.<ref>G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, \"It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.\"</ref>\n\nIt is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of [[Kroni]] through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.<ref>Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Introduction, p. 1.</ref> The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, [[Kaliyan]], is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.<ref>Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula \u22126th&11th Venpaas (a species of verse).</ref>\n\nThe book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of [[Kroni]]. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,<ref>Samuel Zecharia (1826\u20131906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805\u20131855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, p. 201.</ref> Wearing of Headgear during worship,<ref>M.S.S.

It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only [[Narasimha]], Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.\n\n==Santror and Dharma yukam==\n[[File:Borassus shape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borassus|Palmyra]], the tree cursed to provide celestial [[nectar]] in the form of Palm-juice for [[The Santror|Santror]] until the closure of [[Kaliyuga]].]]\n{{Main|The Santror|Dharma Yukam}}\n[[The Santror]] is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.<ref>G.

The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other [[Hindu scriptures]] remained with Divinity. Each of the [[Hindu gods|gods]] referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed.<ref>G.

Kirushnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 63.</ref> In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] and are unhelpful.\n\nThe reason, as stated in [[Akilam]] for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]], there in [[Mount Kailash]], Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds.<ref>T.

Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 321</ref> Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to [[Shaivism]], where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power.<ref>Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 52</ref> Here the ideology changes similar to that of [[Vaishnavism]]. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of [[Kali Yuga]] until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.\n[[File:Kumbas is Swamithope.PNG|thumb|right|The '' 'Tri-Kumbas' '' over the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope]] [[Palliyarai]], symbolizing the presence of [[Hindu trinity|Trinity]] within [[Ayya Vaikundar|Ayya]], revealing his supremacy.]]\nDuring the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|bought as boon]] the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by [[Lakshmi]] and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.<ref>A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 270\u2013271</ref>\n\nAnd from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and [[Brahma]] therefore form a part within Vaikundar.<ref name=\"Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar\" >A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 288\u2013289</ref> This ideology about [[Trimurthi]] (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through [[Vinchai]]s.<ref name=\"Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar\" /> After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal power<ref>A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 290\u2013291</ref>\n\nRegarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures.<ref name=\"Akilathirattu parts\" >G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 119</ref> The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities.<ref name=\"Akilathirattu parts\" /> So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,<ref>N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 427</ref> and so the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharma]] was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.\n\n==Phenomenology==\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi phenomenology}}\n[[File:Prajapathi Adikalar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bala Prajapathi Adikalar|Prajapathi Adikalar]], Last Descendant of the [[Payyan dynasty|Payyan]] family of [[Swamithope pathi]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|title= www.dhyanapeetam.org|accessdate= 20 February 2009|format= Peace Walk (Pada Yatra) by Swamiji \u2013 Tamil Nadu \u2013 12 January 2009 onwards|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303104019/http://dhyanapeetam.org/Web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|archivedate= 3 March 2009|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n''[[Akilam]]'' points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology.<ref>Akilam8:Thiruvasakam \u2013 1 (As per Akilam this Thiruvasakam is written down by Sarasvathi because the previous religious ideas and scripture were destroyed by Kaliyan.)</ref> But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called ''Narayana Swami Pathi'' or ''Narayana Swami Temple'', similar to Hindu [[Vaishnavism]]. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as [[Kali]], [[Hanuman]] and other folk deities in spite of the anti-[[polytheistic]] ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.<ref name= \"Nizal Thangal activities\">Vaikundar Seva Sangham's,''Ayya Vaikundar 170th Avathar-Special Edition'', The activities of Nizhal Thangals, pp. 2\u20134.</ref>\n\nSome followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten [[Avatar]]s of Vishnu as [[Kalki]], while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power.<ref>Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 1, ''\"Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya.\"''</ref> The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today.<ref name= \"Nizal Thangal activities\" /> Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides ''panividais'' for other lesser gods too.<ref name= \"Nizal Thangal activities\" />\n\nThe spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of [[Shamanism]]. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead).<ref name= \"Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai\">R. Shunmugam, ''Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram'', pp. 189\u2013191</ref> The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the [[Palliyarai]].<ref name= \"Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai\" /> Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.<ref>Samithopu Ayya Vaikunda Suvami 172-vathu avathara thina vizha, Thina Malar vazangkum Avathara Thina vizha Sirappu Malar, p. 3, \" ... but it is questionable that how many people know that.

On the contrary, there are no implications in [[Akilam]] or other books of [[Arul Nool]] that Vaikundar himself foretold anything, except in [[Thiruvasakam (Ayyavazhi)|Thiruvasagam 4]], Akilam:12. The common mis-understanding is because, the Akilam and Arul Nool includes hundreds of [[Prophecies]] and the contents of both the books is being divinely revealed to the [[Seedars]] by Vaikundar and the Seedars brought them to the written form. So, instead of the prophecies in both the books being considered that of Seedars it is mis-understood that the prophecies is of Vaikundar. [[Robert Caldwell]], one among the very few historians of the contemporary period (who's views are always overwhelmingly negative on Vaikundar, since himself being a [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] [[Christian missionary]]), too referred to the then belief that seedars (disciples) profess to foretell events.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bergunder|first1=Michael|last2=Frese|first2=Heiko|title=Ritual, caste, and religion in colonial South India|date=2011|publisher=Primus Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-9380607214|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OcEM2IsnA1AC&pg=PA136&dq=Ayya+Vaikundar#v=onepage&q=Ayya%20Vaikundar&f=false|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Social structure==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Swamithoppe pathi .jpg|thumb|right|[[Swamithoppe]] [[Pathi]], religious headquarters of Ayyavazhi]] -->\n{{Main|Structure of Ayyavazhi}}\n[[File:Avatara oorvalam.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Masi Procession from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithope]]]]\n\nAyyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the [[Pathi]]s and [[Nizhal Thangal]]s, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The [[Ayyavazhi rituals|rituals]] are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning.<ref>G.

Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a ''Hindu renaissance''.<ref>T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp.62\u201363.</ref> Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too,<ref>R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp.163\u2013178.</ref> as it brought many social changes there in the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Kerala|keralite]] society during the 19th century.\n\nThe religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as ''\"Path of God\"'' with the phrase ''\"Ayya Vazhi\"''. On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that [[Vaikundar]] unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.<ref name=\"All previous gone awry after Vaikundar\">G.

Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.\n\nRegarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across [[India]], comparatively in less numbers.

Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 112.</ref> Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', Chapter 5, p. 120</ref> In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as \"told by God\" at several places at different situations to lesser [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], [[saint]]s, etc. whenever asked by them.\n\n[[Neetham]] is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, [[Vinchai to Vaikundar|Vinchai]] is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first ''Vinchai of Tiruchendur'' forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.<ref name=\"Ayyavazhi ethics\" />\n\nTo an extent, the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi]] are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and \"attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness\" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] also.<ref name=\"Dharma for devas\" >Mani Bharathi, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai (Part \u2013 2)''.</ref> It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then.<ref name=\"Dharma for devas\" /> Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force [[kalimayai]] with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] rules the minds of people.\n\nArul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The [[Sivakanta Athikarappatthiram|Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram]] here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially [[circumambulation]]s, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed out of immoral thoughts and acts.\n\n==Religious studies==\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi religious studies}}\n[[File:Tamarai-Namam glossy.png|thumb|left|The Holy [[Symbol of Ayyavazhi]]]]\nIt is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the [[Hindu scriptures]]. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.<ref name=\"G. Patrick, p.119\">G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali', p.119.</ref> It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him.<ref>G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 120\u2013121.</ref> Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.\n\nThe philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on [[Ayyavazhi theology]].<ref>P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnu Mani, ''Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram'', pp. 20\u201321</ref> But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures.<ref name= \"Hindu keys to Akilam\">N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?'', pp.10\u201320.</ref> For example, if the 96 [[tatvas]] are understood, then the [[Kaliyan]] is understood. Therefore, theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam.<ref>N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', pp. 190\u2013191.</ref> However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the [[Hindu]] ideas and concepts.<ref name= \"Hindu keys to Akilam\" /> Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.\n\nOn [[myth]]ical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main [[Hindu mythology|mythology of Hinduism]], including [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], Kantha Purana and [[Vishnu Purana]], but with limited details.<ref>T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p.62.</ref> It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream {{sic}} story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate [[Hindu scriptures]] that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.151.</ref> Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted,<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', p.155.</ref> some are regenerated,<ref name=\"G. Patrick, p.119\"/> while others are rejected.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nGenerally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies.<ref name=\"Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures\" /> But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.<ref name=\"Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures\">''Arisundara Mani'', Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. (additional) v. ''To be noted, Whole contents of this book is written including the heavy details to 'mere noted' Akilam concepts from Hindu scriptures.''</ref>\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:The Evolution of Ekam.png|thumb|right|The Evolution \u2013 [[Ekam]] to [[Vaikundar]]]]\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi theology}}\nThe theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other [[monism|monistic]] religions.<ref>V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493</ref> It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matter as an [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, [[Infinity|infinite]], genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, \"one\", \"absolute\",<ref>M. Winslow (1869), ''A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary'', American Mission Press ([[Madras]]), {{ISBN|81-206-0001-0}}, p. 185</ref> \"the whole which exists\"<ref>V.T. Ramasupramaniyam, ''Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi'', p. 210</ref> and \"the incomparable\";<ref>''Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi'', p. 173.</ref> all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.\n\nNarrating through mythology, The ''Sivam'' and the ''Sakthi'' are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The ''Natham''(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from [[Akilam thirteen]] says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is [[Creation myth|created]] by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more [[monotheism|monotheistic]] rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar.  Vaikundar is a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|turine power]] who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil What Does He Look Like?|date=2012|publisher=Millennial Mind Pub|isbn=978-1589826625|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SD6-YKBqGr0C&dq=Ayyavazhi|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> was fragmented into six and each fragment took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu role throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called ''Kalimayai'' (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a way<ref>Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 36, \"Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance.\"</ref> that contrasts the [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] definition to Ayyavazhi theology.\n\n==Festivals and rituals==\n[[File:Kodiyetru Thirunal.jpg|thumb|left|The flag hoisting fest during [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in [[Swamithope pathi]].]]\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi festivals|Ayyavazhi rituals}}\nThere are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi.

Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 137.</ref> Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#A distinct language|alternative phrases]] religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.\n\n==Inclusiveness and exclusivity==\n{{Main|Inclusiveness and exclusivity in Ayyavazhi}}\nThe formula of [[Inclusivism|inclusiveness]] and [[Exclusivity (religion)|exclusivity]], as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.\n[[File:Ten Incarnation door.jpg|thumb|left|The door of [[Swamithoppe]] [[Palliyarai]] with the [[Dashavatara|ten avatars of Vishnu]] carved on it]]\nAyyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of [[Allah]] and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism.<ref name = \"Gods in Ayyavazhi\">T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 61\u201365.</ref> It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings.<ref name = \"Gods in Ayyavazhi\" /> But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|cruel nature of his boons]], for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scriptures<ref>Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 30.</ref> had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda [[Avatar]], Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in [[Akilam thirteen]] which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana,<ref name = \"Gods in Ayyavazhi\" /> but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the [[Books of the Bible|Bible composition]]. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is \"it was created with the intention of man and not that of God\".<ref>\"He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention\". \u2013 Akilam5:571</ref> In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like '' 'Accept God; Reject religion' ''.<ref>Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'' p. 470.</ref>\n\nAyyavazhi accepts various [[incarnation]]s in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' ''Hindu'' ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas.<ref>Akilam 12:151 \u2013 \"Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal\"</ref> Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boon]] they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only '' 'Book of Perfection' ''. By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only [[Ayyavazhi scriptures|its own]]. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost ''Kali mayai'' (evil of Kali).<ref>R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp. 114 -116.</ref> The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.<ref name= \"Ayyavazhi belief system\" />\n\n==Mythology==\n\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi mythology}}\nThe mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history \u2013 a past, a present and a future \u2013 meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.<ref>G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, \"A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history \u2013 a past, a present, and a future \u2013 constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts.\"</ref> It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely [[The Santror|Santror]], Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with [[Hindu mythology]]. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.<ref>G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern agency Chapter 6, p. 151, \"It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.\"</ref>\n\nIt is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of [[Kroni]] through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.<ref>Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, Introduction, p. 1.</ref> The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, [[Kaliyan]], is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.<ref>Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula \u22126th&11th Venpaas (a species of verse).</ref>\n\nThe book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of [[Kroni]]. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,<ref>Samuel Zecharia (1826\u20131906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805\u20131855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, p. 201.</ref> Wearing of Headgear during worship,<ref>M.S.S.

It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only [[Narasimha]], Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.\n\n==Santror and Dharma yukam==\n[[File:Borassus shape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borassus|Palmyra]], the tree cursed to provide celestial [[nectar]] in the form of Palm-juice for [[The Santror|Santror]] until the closure of [[Kaliyuga]].]]\n{{Main|The Santror|Dharma Yukam}}\n[[The Santror]] is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.<ref>G.

The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other [[Hindu scriptures]] remained with Divinity. Each of the [[Hindu gods|gods]] referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed.<ref>G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 214</ref> Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas.<ref>T. Kirushnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 63.</ref> In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] and are unhelpful.\n\nThe reason, as stated in [[Akilam]] for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]], there in [[Mount Kailash]], Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds.<ref>T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundar Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 106</ref> So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan.<ref>N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 315</ref> So [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Brahma]] surrendered all their powers to Vishnu.<ref>N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 321</ref> Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to [[Shaivism]], where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power.<ref>Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 52</ref> Here the ideology changes similar to that of [[Vaishnavism]]. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of [[Kali Yuga]] until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.\n[[File:Kumbas is Swamithope.PNG|thumb|right|The '' 'Tri-Kumbas' '' over the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope]] [[Palliyarai]], symbolizing the presence of [[Hindu trinity|Trinity]] within [[Ayya Vaikundar|Ayya]], revealing his supremacy.]]\nDuring the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|bought as boon]] the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by [[Lakshmi]] and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.<ref>A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 270\u2013271</ref>\n\nAnd from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and [[Brahma]] therefore form a part within Vaikundar.<ref name=\"Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar\" >A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 288\u2013289</ref> This ideology about [[Trimurthi]] (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through [[Vinchai]]s.<ref name=\"Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar\" /> After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal power<ref>A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 290\u2013291</ref>\n\nRegarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures.<ref name=\"Akilathirattu parts\" >G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 119</ref> The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities.<ref name=\"Akilathirattu parts\" /> So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,<ref>N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 427</ref> and so the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharma]] was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.\n\n==Phenomenology==\n{{Main|Ayyavazhi phenomenology}}\n[[File:Prajapathi Adikalar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bala Prajapathi Adikalar|Prajapathi Adikalar]], Last Descendant of the [[Payyan dynasty|Payyan]] family of [[Swamithope pathi]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|title= www.dhyanapeetam.org|accessdate= 20 February 2009|format= Peace Walk (Pada Yatra) by Swamiji \u2013 Tamil Nadu \u2013 12 January 2009 onwards|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303104019/http://dhyanapeetam.org/Web/padayatra2009_kanyakumari_4.asp|archivedate= 3 March 2009|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n''[[Akilam]]'' points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology.<ref>Akilam8:Thiruvasakam \u2013 1 (As per Akilam this Thiruvasakam is written down by Sarasvathi because the previous religious ideas and scripture were destroyed by Kaliyan.)</ref> But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called ''Narayana Swami Pathi'' or ''Narayana Swami Temple'', similar to Hindu [[Vaishnavism]]. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as [[Kali]], [[Hanuman]] and other folk deities in spite of the anti-[[polytheistic]] ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.<ref name= \"Nizal Thangal activities\">Vaikundar Seva Sangham's,''Ayya Vaikundar 170th Avathar-Special Edition'', The activities of Nizhal Thangals, pp. 2\u20134.</ref>\n\nSome followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten [[Avatar]]s of Vishnu as [[Kalki]], while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power.<ref>Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 1, ''\"Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya.\"''</ref> The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today.<ref name= \"Nizal Thangal activities\" /> Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides ''panividais'' for other lesser gods too.<ref name= \"Nizal Thangal activities\" />\n\nThe spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of [[Shamanism]]. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead).<ref name= \"Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai\">R. Shunmugam, ''Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram'', pp. 189\u2013191</ref> The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the [[Palliyarai]].<ref name= \"Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai\" /> Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.<ref>Samithopu Ayya Vaikunda Suvami 172-vathu avathara thina vizha, Thina Malar vazangkum Avathara Thina vizha Sirappu Malar, p. 3, \" ... but it is questionable that how many people know that.

Not even the 2nd defendant who is one of the hereditary high priests in the temple (Swamithope Pathi) and who enjoys the Gurusthanam of the community is able to throw much light on the question, whether there are any essential or fundamental differences between the Narayanaswamy margom (Ayyavazhi) and the Popular Hinduism\"''</ref> All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a religion|as a separate belief]] and instead taken as [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a Hindu sect|a Hindu sect]].\n\nThere is a common belief that Ayya Vaikundar is a [[prophet]] and he had made many prophecies during his earthly years. On the contrary, there are no implications in [[Akilam]] or other books of [[Arul Nool]] that Vaikundar himself foretold anything, except in [[Thiruvasakam (Ayyavazhi)|Thiruvasagam 4]], Akilam:12. The common mis-understanding is because, the Akilam and Arul Nool includes hundreds of [[Prophecies]] and the contents of both the books is being divinely revealed to the [[Seedars]] by Vaikundar and the Seedars brought them to the written form. So, instead of the prophecies in both the books being considered that of Seedars it is mis-understood that the prophecies is of Vaikundar. [[Robert Caldwell]], one among the very few historians of the contemporary period (who's views are always overwhelmingly negative on Vaikundar, since himself being a [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] [[Christian missionary]]), too referred to the then belief that seedars (disciples) profess to foretell events.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bergunder|first1=Michael|last2=Frese|first2=Heiko|title=Ritual, caste, and religion in colonial South India|date=2011|publisher=Primus Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-9380607214|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OcEM2IsnA1AC&pg=PA136&dq=Ayya+Vaikundar#v=onepage&q=Ayya%20Vaikundar&f=false|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Social structure==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Swamithoppe pathi .jpg|thumb|right|[[Swamithoppe]] [[Pathi]], religious headquarters of Ayyavazhi]] -->\n{{Main|Structure of Ayyavazhi}}\n[[File:Avatara oorvalam.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Masi Procession from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithope]]]]\n\nAyyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the [[Pathi]]s and [[Nizhal Thangal]]s, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The [[Ayyavazhi rituals|rituals]] are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning.<ref>G.

Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a ''Hindu renaissance''.<ref>T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp.62\u201363.</ref> Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too,<ref>R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp.163\u2013178.</ref> as it brought many social changes there in the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Kerala|keralite]] society during the 19th century.\n\nThe religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as ''\"Path of God\"'' with the phrase ''\"Ayya Vazhi\"''. On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that [[Vaikundar]] unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.<ref name=\"All previous gone awry after Vaikundar\">G.

He was best known as a pioneer in the field of [[Services marketing|Services Marketing]] among other titles such as author, professor and consultant.  Lovelock was also known for his excellent [[Case study|case studies]].\n\nChristopher Lovelock attained a PhD from [[Stanford University]], publishing his thesis on the topic of \"Marketing Public Transportation\". Lovelock had earlier graduated with an MBA from [[Harvard University]] after arriving in the US in 1967. Lovelock had also obtained a [[Master's degree|Master of Arts]] in Economics and a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Communications from the [[University of Edinburgh]].\n\nLovelock embarked on his academic career serving, most significantly, on the faculty of the [[Harvard Business School]] (USA) for 11 years in addition to other academic appointments at distinguished institutions to include [[University of California]] Berkeley (USA), [[Stanford University]] (USA) and the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] (USA). Lovelock\u2019s other visiting appointments include those at [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]] (Switzerland), [[INSEAD]] (France) and [[University of Queensland]] (Australia). In total, Lovelock had taught in over 30 countries in every continent except Antarctica.\nBesides that of his teaching appointments, Christopher Lovelock was also an author or co-author of numerous books, articles and teaching cases. Lovelock\u2019s last [[Academic publishing|academic publication]], \"Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy 6th edition,\" co-authored together with Jochen Wirtz, has been translated into ten languages. Other books include \"Product Plus\", \"Marketing Challenges\" and \"Public and Nonprofit Marketing\" (the latter two co-authored with Charles Weinberg).\n\nLovelock\u2019s 60 odd articles were also internationally acclaimed. His paper, \"Whither Services Marketing? In Search of a New Paradigm and Fresh Perspectives\" co-written with Evert Gummesson won the Best Services Article Award in the [[American Marketing Association]] and was a finalist for the IBM award for the best article in the Journal of Service Research. For that and other recognitions, Christopher Lovelock was honoured with the prestigious American Marketing Association\u2019s Award for Career Contributions in the Services Discipline.\n\nThe 100 or more teaching cases he wrote were also much heralded. Twice, he won top honours in the [[BusinessWeek]] \"European Case of The Year\" awards. Famous series include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[FedEx]]. The latter, written in the 1970s, gained FedEx the wide exposure of potential clients, indirectly contributing to FedEx\u2019s success today. His teaching cases, revered for their acute insights into marketing challenges, retain their positions on bestsellers\u2019 lists more than a quarter of a century after they were published, displaying a strong relevance even in today\u2019s context.\nMoving to Eastham, [[Cape Cod]], in 1990, Christopher Lovelock became actively involved with his adopted community. Lending his expertise in areas like education, [[health care]], [[Conservation movement|environmental conservation]] and regional transportation, he became an advocate for a variety of issues such as summer traffic to underground utility lines. Most of these can be traced back to pieces found in the Cape Cod Times for which he was an [[Editorial|Op Ed]] or his advisory position for various local organizations.\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
