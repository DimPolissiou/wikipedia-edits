It has never had a park with a long, landscaped approach such as many other houses of its era. Rather it was built within an existing settlement, Chastleton village, which provided many of the services for the house which would otherwise have been attached, such as a laundry, a fishpond and a bakehouse. \n\nSecondly, until its acquisition by the Trust in 1991, it was owned by the same family for nearly 400 years. Its treatment by the Trust was similarly unusual, with a policy of [[Architectural conservation|conservation]] (often called 'controlled decay') rather than [[Building restoration|restoration]], enabling visitors to see the house largely as it was when acquired.<ref name=guide>Nicholas Cooper, Stephen Freer and Jonathan Marsden, ''Chastleton House'', (London: The National Trust (Enterprises), 2001) p. 5.</ref> As a result of the Trust's approach, a large number of the rooms in the house are open to the public.\n\nOf particular note is the Long Gallery, with its [[Vault (architecture)|barrel vaulted ceiling]], with a length {{Convert|72|ft|m}}. This is an impressive feature surviving from the period, although the gallery at [[Montacute House]] in Somerset is of a similar age and at {{convert|172|ft}}, is the longest in England. Like much of the house, the Long Gallery ceiling has been subject to damage. The neglect of the roof for almost two centuries led to the failing of part of the plaster ceiling in the early 1800s, but it was not repaired until 1904\u20131905, when two local men were engaged to make good the losses.<ref name=guide/>\n\nAlso of interest is the impressive Great Chamber. Designed for the entertainment of the most important guests and for the playing of music, the design scheme has its roots in [[Renaissance]] Italy and is the most impressive in the house. The setting out of the panelling shows some inspiration from the classical, as do the painted roundels around the frieze, depicting the twelve prophets of the Old Testament and the twelve Sybils or Prophetesses of Antiquity. Also in the Great Chamber are a set of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] ''[[Fiat]]'' glasses engraved with the Jacobite emblems of roses, oakleaves, and a compass rose, which betray the family's eighteenth-century sympathies. These probably belonged to Henry Jones IV, who was the president of the Gloucestershire Cycle Club, one of the oldest established Jacobite clubs.<ref name=\"Nicholas Cooper 2001 pp. 21-24\">Nicholas Cooper, Stephen Freer and Jonathan Marsden, ''Chastleton House'', (London: The National Trust (Enterprises), 2001) pp. 21-24.</ref>\n\nOther items of interest in the house include the [[Juxon Bible]], which is said to have been used by the chaplain, Bishop Juxon, at the execution of Charles I. Juxon's family lived locally in Long Compton until his family died out in the eighteenth century, when it is thought to have been given to John Jones II because the Jones clan were another family with Jacobite sympathies.<ref name=\"Nicholas Cooper 2001 pp. 21-24\"/>\n\nIn 1919 a number of significant [[tapestries]] were discovered at the house, and were interpreted as evidence for the establishment of a tapestry-weaving venture at the manor house of William Sheldon (d 1570) at [[Barcheston]], near [[Shipston on Stour]], [[Warwickshire]].<ref>[http://www.tapestriescalledsheldon.info/pdfs/NEWPP41Chastletonrevision.pdf \"Tapestries once at Chastleton House and their influence on the image of the tapestries called Sheldon : a re-assessment\" by Hilary L. Turner, at tapestriescalledsheldon.info]</ref> One of these tapestries is currently on display in the Middle Chamber, and another is in the permanent collection of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.\n\n== Chastleton Garden ==\nThe [[Grade II listed]] garden at Chastleton has undergone a number of revisions since the completion of the house in 1612. There is no archaeological evidence of a garden on this site before this date: indeed, the North Garden is split by an old field boundary.\n\nThere is no map or written evidence to suggest how the garden was laid out by Walter Jones in 1612, but the walls that enclose the garden are 17th century, and archaeological evidence that suggests that the garden has been laid out the same way for the last 400 years. It is laid out according to the recommendation proposed by [[Gervase Markham]] in his book ''The English Husbandman'' (1613)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22973/22973-h/22973-h.htm#Chap_F_II|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The English Husbandman: The First Part, by Gervase Markham|work=gutenberg.org|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> \u2013 a fore court to the front of the house, with the base (or bass) court on one side, which included the stables and other farm buildings. The other two sides of the house should be composed of gardens, divided into an orchard, a kitchen garden and a best (or pleasure) garden, planted with more ornamental plants<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\">CC Landscape Management, Chastleton Garden Conservation Plan (Oxfordshire, Chastleton: January 2012).</ref>\n\nAt the time, the Forecourt at Chastleton described the entrance area below the House court (the area directly in front of the house). The House court was raised slightly above the forecourt by a small retaining wall, probably with a balustrade on top. There were likely to be few plants in the front of the house in the early 17th century, with the House Court possibly being paved or having two grass [[plats]] on each side of the central path like the Forecourt.<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\"/>\n\nTo the east of this was the Pleasaunce or Pleasure Garden. This was the Best Garden, which was levelled, but with a viewing terrace along one side which also gave entrance to the church at the opposite end. The design of this garden is not known, but it was almost certainly surrounded by high walls with fruit trees trained against it. The Best Garden was laid out in the circular pattern we see today by Dorothy Whitmore Jones in 1833,<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\"/> although it is suggested that there were already box plants there. Beds were added within the circular hedge in the 1890s or 1900s and then grassed over again by 1972. During the periods of time when money came into the family the planting in this garden was always renewed.\n\n===Birthplace of croquet===\n\nTo the north are terraces, levelled from the sloping ground. There is evidence of a medieval cultivation terrace and the remnants of the old boundary wall of the garden. There was a [[Bowling green|Bowling Green]] on the Middle terrace and the third terrace may also have been the site of the original kitchen garden.<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\"/>\n\nToday, the middle terraces are the site of two [[croquet]] lawns, originally laid out by Walter Whitmore-Jones in the 1860s. His version of the rules of croquet published in ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' in 1865 became definitive, and Chastleton is considered the birthplace of croquet as a competitive sport.<ref name=website>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-chastleton/w-chastleton-house_history.htm|title=Find a place to visit|work=nationaltrust.org.uk|accessdate=22 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202061811/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-chastleton/w-chastleton-house_history.htm#|archive-date=2011-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardensofgreatbritain.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20:chastleton-house&catid=7:oxfordshire&Itemid=2|title=GoGB|author=Super User|work=gardensofgreatbritain.com|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> Equipment is provided by the National Trust and in the summer visitors may play a game of croquet if they wish.\n\nThe Kitchen Garden as it is now was enclosed in 1847 and was formed of the existent garden and from part of the adjoining field.

Also in the Great Chamber are a set of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] ''[[Fiat]]'' glasses engraved with the Jacobite emblems of roses, oakleaves, and a compass rose, which betray the family's eighteenth-century sympathies. These probably belonged to Henry Jones IV, who was the president of the Gloucestershire Cycle Club, one of the oldest established Jacobite clubs.<ref name=\"Nicholas Cooper 2001 pp. 21-24\">Nicholas Cooper, Stephen Freer and Jonathan Marsden, ''Chastleton House'', (London: The National Trust (Enterprises), 2001) pp. 21-24.</ref>\n\nOther items of interest in the house include the [[Juxon Bible]], which is said to have been used by the chaplain, Bishop Juxon, at the execution of Charles I. Juxon\u2019s family lived locally in Long Compton until his family died out in the eighteenth century, when it is thought to have been given to John Jones II because the Jones clan were another family with Jacobite sympathies.<ref name=\"Nicholas Cooper 2001 pp. 21-24\"/>\n\nIn 1919 a number of significant [[tapestries]] were discovered at the house, and were interpreted as evidence for the establishment of a tapestry-weaving venture at the manor house of William Sheldon (d 1570) at [[Barcheston]], near [[Shipston on Stour]], [[Warwickshire]].<ref>[http://www.tapestriescalledsheldon.info/pdfs/NEWPP41Chastletonrevision.pdf \"Tapestries once at Chastleton House and their influence on the image of the tapestries called Sheldon : a re-assessment\" by Hilary L. Turner, at tapestriescalledsheldon.info]</ref> One of these tapestries is currently on display in the Middle Chamber, and another is in the permanent collection of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.\n\n== Chastleton Garden ==\nThe [[Grade II listed]] garden at Chastleton has undergone a number of revisions since the completion of the house in 1612. There is no archaeological evidence of a garden on this site before this date: indeed, the North Garden is split by an old field boundary.\n\nThere is no map or written evidence to suggest how the garden was laid out by Walter Jones in 1612, but the walls that enclose the garden are 17th century and archaeological evidence that suggests that the garden has been laid out the same way for the last 400 years. It is laid out according to the recommendation proposed by [[Gervase Markham]] in his book ''The English Husbandman'' (1613)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22973/22973-h/22973-h.htm#Chap_F_II|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The English Husbandman: The First Part, by Gervase Markham|work=gutenberg.org|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> \u2013 a fore court to the front of the house, with the base (or bass) court on one side, which included the stables and other farm buildings. The other two sides of the house should be composed of gardens, divided into an orchard, a kitchen garden and a best (or pleasure) garden, planted with more ornamental plants<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\">CC Landscape Management, Chastleton Garden Conservation Plan (Oxfordshire, Chastleton: January 2012).</ref>\n\nAt the time, the Forecourt at Chastleton described the entrance area below the House court (the area directly in front of the house). The House court was raised slightly above the forecourt by a small retaining wall, probably with a balustrade on top. There were likely to be few plants in the front of the house in the early 17th century, with the House Court possibly being paved or having two grass [[plats]] on each side of the central path like the Forecourt.<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\"/>\n\nTo the east of this was the Pleasaunce or Pleasure Garden. This was the Best Garden, which was levelled, but with a viewing terrace along one side which also gave entrance to the church at the opposite end. The design of this garden is not known, but it was almost certainly surrounded by high walls with fruit trees trained against it. The Best Garden was laid out in the circular pattern we see today by Dorothy Whitmore Jones in 1833,<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\"/> although it is suggested that there were already box plants there. Beds were added within the circular hedge in the 1890s or 1900s and then grassed over again by 1972. During the periods of time when money came into the family the planting in this garden was always renewed.\n\n===Birthplace of croquet===\n\nTo the north are terraces, levelled from the sloping ground. There is evidence of a medieval cultivation terrace and the remnants of the old boundary wall of the garden. There was a [[Bowling green|Bowling Green]] on the Middle terrace and the third terrace may also have been the site of the original kitchen garden.<ref name=\"CC Landscape Management 2012\"/>\n\nToday, the middle terraces are the site of two [[croquet]] lawns, originally laid out by Walter Whitmore-Jones in the 1860s. His version of the rules of croquet published in ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' in 1865 became definitive, and Chastleton is considered the birthplace of croquet as a competitive sport.<ref name=website>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-chastleton/w-chastleton-house_history.htm|title=Find a place to visit|work=nationaltrust.org.uk|accessdate=22 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202061811/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-chastleton/w-chastleton-house_history.htm#|archive-date=2011-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardensofgreatbritain.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=20:chastleton-house&catid=7:oxfordshire&Itemid=2|title=GoGB|author=Super User|work=gardensofgreatbritain.com|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> Equipment is provided by the National Trust and in the summer visitors may play a game of croquet if they wish.\n\nThe Kitchen Garden as it is now was enclosed in 1847 and was formed of the existent garden and from part of the adjoining field. It was laid out as four plots on one side of a broad path and two on the other side, and the kitchen garden today has been recently rejuvenated to form this pattern as well.\n\n==Film Location==\nChastleton House was used as one of the locations for the 2015 BBC Two television series ''[[Wolf Hall (TV series)|Wolf Hall]]'' and represented '[[Wulfhall|Wolf Hall]],' home of the [[Jane Seymour|Seymours]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1355870235583/|title=Houses packed with history star in Wolf Hall - National Trust|work=nationaltrust.org.uk|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chastleton House}}\n*[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/chastleton-house Chastleton House information at the National Trust].\n\n{{Coord|51.95897|N|1.65214|W|type:landmark_region:GB-OXF_source:enwiki-osgb36(SP2429)|display=title}}<!-- Note: WGS84 lat/long, converted from OSGB36 grid ref -->\n{{Museums and galleries in Oxfordshire}}\n\n[[Category:Country houses in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:National Trust properties in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed houses]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1612]]\n[[Category:1612 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Gloucestershire]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "punct, number fmt", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chastleton_House"}
