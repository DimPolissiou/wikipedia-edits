Levers, Jr. was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1930, the son of Robert L. Levers, Sr., an Englishman with artistic interests, and Gertrude (Burrow) Levers. He attended [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut, and received a B.F.A. in 1952. In the early 1950s he was a teacher at the Whitney Art School in New Haven, Connecticut, and also worked at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York City. Levers married Mary Lou Schlichting in 1954 and they had two daughters and a son. He served as a gunnery officer in the [[United States Navy]] from 1954 to 1957, mostly in the Caribbean during peacetime. After his service in the Navy, he worked at the \"[[Famous Artists School]]\", a correspondence school based in Westport, Connecticut, with what turned out to be an amiable group of artists, the chance to learn how to teach, and a time to further develop his drawing skills. He returned to Yale University, where he studied under [[Josef Albers]] and earned his M.F.A. in 1959 to 1961. A solo exhibition of his work was held at the [[Columbia Museum of Art|Columbia Museum]] in Columbia, South Carolina, in 1959 and his work was included in an exhibition at the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1960. Levers taught at Yale for one year before moving to Texas.<ref name=\"Curlee (2010)\" /><ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /><ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\">Grieder, Terence (1979).

Austin. 432 pp.  {{ISBN|978-1477310083}}</ref>\n\n== Stylistic development, and subjects ==\n'''Early Work 1950-1972:''' Although Levers exhibited extensively in the late 1950s through the early 1970s, his work before 1973 is conspicuously absent from exhibition catalogues after 1973 and his retrospective exhibit in 1991.<ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" /> He drew cartoons for the [[Yale Record]] in the 1950s and is known to have made watercolors of people's homes to help fund his college tuition. His early work has been compared to [[Sidney Dickinson]]'s and described as \"a misty realistic style\".<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> While at Yale, Levers took [[Josef Albers]]' \"Interaction of Color\" course, forming the basis of his concepts on color for the rest of his career and some of his work from the 1950s varied from [[geometric abstraction]] to [[abstract expressionism]]. Ultimately, Levers rejected abstraction in his own art, but he always valued Albers' instruction and liked him personally.<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> After moving to Texas in 1961, the family begin visiting Mexico with some degree of regularity in 1963. He spent much of his sabbatical time in Mexico City  painting and drawing with frequent trips to the [[National Museum of Anthropology]] and other galleries, as well as a trip to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula to view Mayan ruins. However those influence were said to have been \"so deeply absorbed as to be invisible in his art\".<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> On one visit to Mexico City during the 1968 Olympic Games, he witnessed protesting students clash with  riot police, an event that was to influence his work, contributing to a shift toward figurative painting and an exploration of themes in conflict and violence.<ref name=\"Curlee (2010)\" />\n\n'''Mid Period 1973-1982:''' Levers was a consummate draftsman and drawings and watercolors made up a substantial part of his output in the early to mid 1970s. Many pieces from this period (including oil paintings) appear in compartmental and fragmented compositions, sometimes resembling comic strips. However, these strips do not illustrate a clear linear narrative, as one author noted \"Levers' strip-form designs defy attempts to tell their stories: as comic strips they are frustrating.\" <ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" /> Levers' works of the 1970s are populated with figures of combat and conflict like soldiers, rioters, and even hostile [[red-necks]] in overalls. As he had witnessed in Mexico City 's riots, faces are often concealed by gas mask, later diversifying to gas mask tubes attached directly to the faces, red, white and blue erect wind socks, and bazooka barrels, or skulls for heads. Still others have heads that appear to be made of spare parts from ventriloquist's dummies. More often than not these figures are engaged in some short of conflict, running the gamut from wrestling and fist fights to full-scale military battles where exploding artillery fills the air: people engaged in tragicomic exercises in futility. His painting ''The Battle'' (see external links below) from 1979 in the collection of the Museum of Fine Art, Houston is exemplary of his work from this period. Superficially, Levers work can sometimes have vague affinities to [[Surrealism]] or [[Magic Realism]] but neither term can really be applied to his paintings accurately.<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /><ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" />\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s mark a period of maturation in Levers work, in style, technique, subject matter, and content. \"[[Pop art]] and comic strips offered him an initial point of departure in his works of the 1960s; however, by the mid-1970s his references had broadened\".<ref name=\"Greene (2000)\" /> Another author made the analogy \"a composer of songs expanding to oratorio and finally to opera.\" <ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" /> Like [[Goya]], who produced tapestry designs and portraits into his 40s then budded into a master late in life, Levers' work showed a significant growth in his late 40s. \"The consistent development of his style manifests an intellectual power that the humor, earthiness, and fantasy of his subjects might mask for the casual observer.\" <ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" /> Starting about 1979 the predominance of drawings begin to swing to increasing numbers of oil paintings. Faces and heads were increasingly represented with natural features, albeit occasionally masked or hooded.<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> After receiving a National Endowment for the Arts Artists Fellowship, he lived full-time in New York City for a time in 1980\u201381, absorbing the wealth of art in the museums there, particularly the old masters (e.g. [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]] and his  Punchinellos).<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" />\n\n'''Late Work 1983-1992:''' \"''The Destruction of Memorial Stadium'' seems to announce a larger theater of ideas\".<ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" /> Levers stated \"One night I had a dream about [[Memorial Stadium (Austin)|Memorial Stadium]] [University of Texas, Austin] burning down. In  my dream, it had been capable of accommodating a million people, all of whom were scurrying around, many with banners. It was a troubling dream; I had no idea what it meant or why I'd had it, but since I usually make art to find out what I think and feel, I began a painting\".<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /><ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" />''The Destruction of Memorial Stadium'' (1983), a 40 x 50 inch canvas, was accompanied by an entire series of paintings depicting the chaos going on as the monument burned: the artist said \"riots, orgies, the summary execution of the presumed arsonist. . . whole subcultures of bogus, berserk and violent referees doing vaudeville turns\". . . \"By fits and starts this world would be funny and then sad and sometimes both at the same time. I sensed people locked into rituals of behavior - loveable, in way, pitiable in other ways, maybe like all of us.\" <ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" /> The Memorial Stadium series was followed by more interrelated cycles of paintings, apocalyptic metaphors, some with iconic and monumental architecture, ranging from the [[LBJ Presidential Library]] (1985) to the [[Tower of Babel]] (1991), under siege by terrorist and going up in smoke and flames. Another informal series portrays hooded terrorists in bullfighting rings and other arenas ineptly juggling plates and other peculiar activities.<ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" /><ref name=\"Smith et al. (2016)\" />\n\nLevers made his first trip to Europe when he was selected as a US representative for the Venice Biennale in 1984 and later stated \"My purpose was to research Renaissance and Baroque figure painting, make notes and sketches, and return home to begin a series of large paintings involving life-size or nearly life-size figures.\" <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> His subject matter broadened beyond apocalypse and destruction in his later years and other subjects begin to appear in his work e.g.: ''[[Mutatis Mutandis]], Incorporated'' (1984, 72 x 90 inches, oil on canvas) depicts an ominous gust of wind descending on four suited executives; the self-descriptive ''God Creating Animals'' (1989, 60 x 90 inches, oil on canvas); ''Taking Care of Old People'' (1990, 17 x 22 inches, mixed media drawing) recalls some of the symbolist graphic work of [[Odilon Redon]] and [[Alfred Kubin]].<ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" />\n\nIn his 1985 book on contemporary American art, [[Edward Lucie-Smith]] stated \"The presence of a visionary satirist of this quality in the ranks of Texan artists is one of the great surprises of an art scene which is surprising in many other ways as well.\" <ref name=\"Lucie-Smith (1985)\">Lucie-Smith, Edward (1985). American Art Now. William Morrow and Company, Inc. New York, New York. 160 pp. {{ISBN|0-688-05884-1}}</ref> His paintings allude to m\u00eal\u00e9es, violence, and ruin; yet presented absurdly, nearly comical at times, a seemingly incongruous combination with a troubling tone that resonate in his finest work. In one statement from 1980s Levers said \"The work always has a layer of humor, I notice, even when the nominal subject is dead serious. I prefer not to consider this a limitation but instead an opportunity to make the picture richer\". . . \"I hope I live long enough to paint almost all - God forbid absolutely all - the pictures I think I can feel behind my forehead\".<ref name=\"Carlozzi et al.

(1991)\" /> He drew cartoons for the [[Yale Record]] in the 1950s and is known to have made watercolors of people's homes to help fund his college tuition. His early work has been compared to [[Sidney Dickinson]]'s and described as \"a misty realistic style\". <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> While at Yale, Levers took [[Josef Albers]]' \"Interaction of Color\" course, forming the basis of his concepts on color for the rest of his career and some of his work from the 1950s varied from [[Geometric abstraction|geometric abstraction]] to [[abstract expressionism]]. Ultimately, Levers rejected abstraction in his own art, but he always valued Albers' instruction and liked him personally. <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> After moving to Texas in 1961, the family begin visiting Mexico with some degree of regularity in 1963. He spent much of his sabbatical time in Mexico City  painting and drawing with frequent trips to the [[National Museum of Anthropology]] and other galleries, as well as a trip to the Yucatan Peninsula to view Mayan ruins. However those influence were said to have been \"so deeply absorbed as to be invisible in his art\". <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> On one visit to Mexico City during the 1968 Olympic Games, he witnessed protesting students clash with  riot police, an event that was to influence his work, contributing to a shift toward figurative painting and an exploration of themes in conflict and violence. <ref name=\"Curlee (2010)\" />\n\n'''Mid Period 1973-1982:''' Levers was a consummate draftsman and drawings and watercolors made up a substantial part of his output in the early to mid 1970s. Many pieces from this period (including oil paintings) appear in compartmental and fragmented compositions, sometimes resembling comic strips. However, these strips do not illustrate a clear linear narrative, as one author noted \"Levers' strip-form designs defy attempts to tell their stories: as comic strips they are frustrating.\" <ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" /> Levers' works of the 1970s are populated with figures of combat and conflict like soldiers, rioters, and even hostile [[red-necks]] in overalls. As he had witnessed in Mexico City 's riots, faces are often concealed by gas mask, later diversifying to gas mask tubes attached directly to the faces, red, white and blue erect wind socks, and bazooka barrels, or skulls for heads. Still others have heads that appear to be made of spare parts from ventriloquist's dummies. More often than not these figures are engaged in some short of conflict, running the gamut from wrestling and fist fights to full scale military battles where exploding artillery fills the air: people engaged in tragicomic exercises in futility. His painting ''The Battle'' (see external links below) from 1979 in the collection of the Museum of Fine Art, Houston is exemplary of his work from this period. Superficially, Levers work can sometimes have vague affinities to [[Surrealism]] or [[Magic Realism]] but neither term can really be applied to his paintings accurately. <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> <ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" />\n\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s mark a period of maturation in Levers work, in style, technique, subject matter, and content. \"[[Pop art]] and comic strips offered him an initial point of departure in his works of the 1960s; however, by the mid-1970s his references had broadened\". <ref name=\"Greene (2000)\" /> Another author made the analogy \"a composer of songs expanding to oratorio and finally to opera.\" <ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" /> Like [[Goya]], who produced tapestry designs and portraits into his 40s then budded into a master late in life, Levers' work showed a significant growth in his late 40s. \"The consistent development of his style manifests an intellectual power that the humor, earthiness, and fantasy of his subjects might mask for the casual observer.\" <ref name=\"Grieder (1979)\" /> Starting about 1979 the predominance of drawings begin to swing to increasing numbers of oil paintings. Faces and heads were increasingly represented with natural features, albeit occasionally masked or hooded. <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> After receiving a National Endowment for the Arts Artists Fellowship, he lived full time in New York City for a time in 1980-81, absorbing the wealth of art in the museums there, particularly the old masters (e.g. [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]] and his  Punchinellos). <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" />\n\n'''Late Work 1983-1992:''' \"''The Destruction of Memorial Stadium'' seems to announce a larger theater of ideas\". <ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" /> Levers stated \"One night I had a dream about [[Memorial Stadium (Austin)|Memorial Stadium]] [University of Texas, Austin] burning down. In  my dream, it had been capable of accommodating a million people, all of whom were scurrying around, many with banners. It was a troubling dream; I had no idea what it meant or why I'd had it, but since I usually make art to find out what I think and feel, I began a painting\". <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> <ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" />''The Destruction of Memorial Stadium'' (1983), a 40 x 50 inch canvas, was accompanied by an entire series of paintings depicting the chaos going on as the monument burned: the artist said \"riots, orgies, the summary execution of the presumed arsonist. . . whole subcultures of bogus, berserk and violent referees doing vaudeville turns\". . . \"By fits and starts this world would be funny and then sad and sometimes both at the same time. I sensed people locked into rituals of behavior - loveable, in way, pitiable in other ways, maybe like all of us.\" <ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" /> The Memorial Stadium series was followed by more interrelated cycles of paintings, apocalyptic metaphors, some with iconic and monumental architecture, ranging from the [[LBJ Presidential Library]] (1985) to the [[Tower of Babel]] (1991), under siege by terrorist and going up in smoke and flames. Another informal series portrays hooded terrorists in bullfighting rings and other arenas ineptly juggling plates and other peculiar activities. <ref name=\"Meats et al. (1991)\" /> <ref name=\"Smith et al. (2016)\" />\n\nLevers made his first trip to Europe when he was selected as a US representative for the Venice Biennale in 1984 and later stated \"My purpose was to research Renaissance and Baroque figure painting, make notes and sketches, and return home to begin a series of large paintings involving life-size or nearly life-size figures.\" <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> His subject matter broadened beyond apocalypse and destruction in his later years and other subjects begin to appear in his work e.g.: ''[[Mutatis Mutandis]], Incorporated'' (1984, 72 x 90 inches, oil on canvas) depicts an ominous gust of wind descending on four suited executives; the self-descriptive ''God Creating Animals'' (1989, 60 x 90 inches, oil on canvas); ''Taking Care of Old People'' (1990, 17 x 22 inches, mixed media drawing) recalls some of the symbolist graphic work of [[Odilon Redon]] and [[Alfred Kubin]]. <ref name=\"Grieder, Chesney, and Milliken (1995)\" /> \n\nIn his 1985 book on contemporary American art, [[Edward Lucie-Smith]] stated \"The presence of a visionary satirist of this quality in the ranks of Texan artists is one of the great surprises of an art scene which is surprising in many other ways as well.\" <ref name=\"Lucie-Smith (1985)\">Lucie-Smith, Edward (1985). American Art Now. William Morrow and Company, Inc. New York, New York. 160 pp. {{ISBN|0-688-05884-1}}</ref> His paintings allude to m\u00eal\u00e9es, violence, and ruin; yet presented absurdly, nearly comical at times, a seemingly incongruous combination with a troubling tone that resonate in his finest work. In one statement from 1980s Levers said \"The work always has a layer of humor, I notice, even when the nominal subject is dead serious. I prefer not to consider this a limitation but instead an opportunity to make the picture richer\". . . \"I hope I live long enough to paint almost all - God forbid absolutely all - the pictures I think I can feel behind my forehead\". <ref name=\"Carlozzi et al.

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the initial stages of the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. [[Georgios Theotokis]] was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked the hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass spanning some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|miles}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the Metaxas and Rachovo villages. Upon reaching Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguine clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarandaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarandaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]]. The fate of [[Albania]] and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the initial stages of the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. [[Georgios Theotokis]] was the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, including extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchase of new weapons, and the recall of [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912, fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans declared mobilization on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October, with the latter declaring [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked the hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass spanning some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|miles}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the Metaxas and Rachovo villages. Upon reaching Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguine clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarandaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarandaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 field artillery pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which solidified the League's territorial ambitions, granting its members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as [[Crete]]. The fate of [[Albania]] and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=330\u2013332}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Apostolidis |first=Dimitrios |title=\u039f \u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1912-1913|trans-title=The Victorious Greco-Turkish War of 1912-1913|volume=I|publisher=Estia|location=Athens|language=Greek|year=1913|url=https://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/8/d/1/metadata-9272bd94229998ed96a378ab0f986a22_1270023610.tkl|accessdate=13 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Georgios|last1=Christopoulos|first2=Ioannis|last2=Bastias|title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2: \u039d\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf 1881 \u03c9\u03c2 1913|trans-title=History of the Greek Nation: Modern Greece from 1881 until 1913 |volume=XIV |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon|language=Greek|location=Athens|year=1977 |oclc= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dimitracopoulos |first=Anastasios |title=The First Balkan War Through the Pages of Review L'Illustration |year=1992 |publisher=Hellenic Committee of Military History|location=Athens |oclc= 37043754| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Edward |title=Defeat in Detail: The Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912-1913 |year=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport | isbn =978-0-275-97888-4| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kargakos |first=Sarandos| title=\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (1912-1913)|trans-title=Greece in the Balkan Wars (1912-1913)| publisher=Peritechnon|location=Athens| year = 2012 | isbn =978-960-8411-26-5|language=Greek| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Katsikostas |first=Dimitrios |title=\u0397 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 Eydoux|trans-title=The Reorganization of the Armed Forces and the Efforts of the French Military Mission of Eydoux|publisher= Hellenic Army History Directorate |language=Greek|year= 2014 |url=https://dis.army.gr/sites/dis.army.gr/files/unmanaged/pdf/Articles_June14/Greek_French/ANADIORG_ED_APOST_EYDOUX.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2019 | ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{coord|40|04|N|22|03|E|format=dms|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarantaporo 1912}}\n[[Category:Battles of the First Balkan War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1912]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Battles involving Greece]]\n[[Category:1912 in Greece]]\n[[Category:1912 in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Manastir Vilayet]]\n[[Category:Modern history of Thessaly]]\n[[Category:October 1912 events]]\n", "name_user": "Catlemur", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sarantaporo"}

Moreover, Moore saw these terminologies as emphasizing particular features such as digitization approaches, components or delivery methods rather than being fundamentally dissimilar in concept or principle.<ref name=\"Moore\"/> For example, [[m-learning]] ''emphasizes'' mobility, which allows for altered timing, location, accessibility and context of learning; nevertheless, its purpose and conceptual ''principles'' are those of educational technology.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>\n\nIn practice, as technology has advanced, the particular \"narrowly defined\" terminological aspect that was initially emphasized by name has blended into the general field of educational technology.<ref name=\"Moore\"/> Initially, \"virtual learning\" as narrowly defined in a [[semantics|semantic]] sense implied entering an environmental simulation within a [[virtual world]], for example in treating [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.govtech.com/education/Universities-Use-Second-Life-to-Teach.html |title= Universities Use Second Life to Teach Complex Concepts | publisher= [[Government Technology]] |accessdate= 2013-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/50751/ |title=DoD gives PTSD help 'second life' in virtual reality &#124; Article &#124; The United States Army |publisher=Army.mil |accessdate=2013-10-22}}</ref> In practice, a \"virtual education course\" refers to any instructional course in which all, or at least a significant portion, is delivered by the [[Internet]]. \"Virtual\" is used in that broader way to describe a course that is not taught in a classroom face-to-face but through a substitute mode that can conceptually be associated \"virtually\" with classroom teaching, which means that people do not have to go to the physical classroom to learn.

The first all [[multiple choice]], large-scale assessment was the [[Army Alpha]], used to assess the intelligence and more specifically the aptitudes of World War I military recruits. Further large-scale use of technologies was employed in training soldiers during and after WWII using [[film]]s and other mediated materials, such as [[overhead projector]]s. The concept of [[hypertext]] is traced to the description of [[memex]] by Vannevar Bush in 1945.\n\n[[File:Cuisenaire-Rods-2.png|thumb|[[Cuisenaire rods]]]]\n[[Slide projector]]s were widely used during the 1950s in educational institutional settings.

Although internet would not be created for another nine years, students were able to access class information with linked computer terminals. The first online course was offered in 1986 by the Electronic University Network for DOS and Commodore 64 computers. Computer Assisted Learning eventually offered the first online courses with real interaction. In 2002, [[MIT]] began providing online classes free of charge. {{as of|2009}}, approximately 5.5 millions students were taking at least one class online. Currently, one out of three college students takes at least one online course while in college. At [[DeVry University]], out of all students that are earning a bachelor's degree, 80% earn two-thirds of their requirements online. Also in 2014, 2.85 millions students out of 5.8 million students that took courses online, took all of their courses online. From this information, it can be concluded that the number of students taking classes online is on the steady increase.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/promises-and-pitfalls-of-online-education/ | title=Promises and pitfalls of online education| date=2017-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.petersons.com/articles/online-degrees/online-education-history |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319084900/https://www.petersons.com/articles/online-degrees/online-education-history |archive-date=2018-03-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Moldavie - M\u00e9diath\u00e8que et espace multim\u00e9dia.jpg|thumb|Multimedia space Moldova Alliance Fran\u00e7aise.]]\nIn 1971, [[Ivan Illich]] published a hugely influential book called, [[Deschooling Society]], in which he envisioned \"learning webs\" as a model for people to network the learning they needed.

In computer-based training (CBT) or computer-based learning (CBL), the learning interaction was between the student and computer drills or micro-world simulations.\n\nDigitized communication and networking in education started in the mid-1980s. Educational institutions began to take advantage of the new medium by offering distance learning courses using computer networking for information. Early e-learning systems, based on computer-based learning/training often replicated autocratic teaching styles whereby the role of the e-learning system was assumed to be for transferring knowledge, as opposed to systems developed later based on [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL), which encouraged the shared development of knowledge.\n\n[[Videoconferencing]] was an important forerunner to the educational technologies known today. This work was especially popular with [[museum education]]. Even in recent years, videoconferencing has risen in popularity to reach over 20,000 students across the United States and Canada in 2008\u20132009. Disadvantages of this form of educational technology are readily apparent: image and sound quality is often grainy or pixelated; videoconferencing requires setting up a type of mini-television studio within the museum for broadcast, space becomes an issue; and specialised equipment is required for both the provider and the participant.<ref>Crow, W.

[[E-learning (theory)|E-learning theory]] examines these approaches. These theoretical perspectives are grouped into three main theoretical schools or philosophical frameworks: [[behaviorism]], [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] and [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]].\n\n===Behaviorism===\nThis theoretical framework was developed in the early 20th century based on animal learning experiments by [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Edward Thorndike]], [[Edward C. Tolman]], [[Clark L. Hull]], and [[B.F. Skinner]]. Many psychologists used these results to develop theories of human learning, but modern educators generally see [[behaviorism]] as one aspect of a holistic synthesis. Teaching in behaviorism has been linked to training, emphasizing the animal learning experiments. Since behaviorism consists of the view of teaching people how to do something with rewards and punishments, it is related to training people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The activities of teaching|last=Green|first=Thomas|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[B.F.

This form of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] has a primary focus on how learners construct their own meaning from new information, as they interact with reality and with other learners who bring different perspectives. Constructivist learning environments require students to use their prior knowledge and experiences to formulate new, related, and/or adaptive concepts in learning (Termos, 2012<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Termos|first1=Mohamad|title=Does the Classroom Performance System (CPS) Increase Students' Chances for Getting a Good Grade in College Core Courses and Increase Retention?|journal=International Journal of Technologies in Learning|date=2012|volume=19|issue=1|pages=45\u201356|doi=10.18848/2327-0144/cgp/v19i01/49144}}</ref>). Under this framework the role of the teacher becomes that of a facilitator, providing guidance so that learners can construct their own knowledge. Constructivist educators must make sure that the prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught. Jonassen (1997) suggests \"well-structured\" learning environments are useful for novice learners and that \"ill-structured\" environments are only useful for more advanced learners. Educators utilizing a constructivist perspective may emphasize an [[active learning]] environment that may incorporate learner centered [[problem-based learning]], [[project-based learning]], and [[inquiry-based learning]], ideally involving real-world scenarios, in which students are actively engaged in critical thinking activities. An illustrative discussion and example can be found in the 1980s deployment of constructivist cognitive learning in computer literacy, which involved programming as an instrument of learning.<ref name=Rosenberg>{{Cite book|title = The Social Impact of Computers|last = Rosenberg|first = Richard|publisher = Elsevier Academic Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-12-597121-8|location = Amsterdam}}</ref>{{rp|224}} ''LOGO'', a programming language, embodied an attempt to integrate Piagetan ideas with computers and technology.<ref name=Rosenberg/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Book Ends: The Changing Media Environment of American Classrooms|last = Cassidy|first = Margaret|publisher = Hampton Press, Inc.|year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-57273-492-0|location = Cresskill, NJ|pages = 223}}</ref> Initially there were broad, hopeful claims, including \"perhaps the most controversial claim\" that it would \"improve general problem-solving skills\" across disciplines.<ref name=Rosenberg/>{{rp|238}} However, ''LOGO'' programming skills did not consistently yield cognitive benefits.<ref name=Rosenberg/>{{rp|238}} It was \"not as concrete\" as advocates claimed, it privileged \"one form of reasoning over all others,\" and it was difficult to apply the thinking activity to non-''LOGO''-based activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Book Ends: The Changing Media Environment of American Classrooms|last = Cassidy|first = Margaret|publisher = Hampton Press, Inc.|year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-57273-492-0|location = Cresskill, NJ|pages = 224}}</ref> By the late 1980s, ''LOGO'' and other similar programming languages had lost their novelty and dominance and were gradually de-emphasized amid criticisms.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Social Impact of Computers|last = Rosenberg|first = Richard|publisher = Elsevier Academic Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-12-597121-8|location = Amsterdam|pages = 219}}</ref>\n\n==Practice==\n{{see also|Instructional design}}\nThe extent to which e-learning assists or replaces other learning and teaching approaches is variable, ranging on a continuum from none to fully [[World Wide Web|online]] [[distance learning]].<ref name=\"Bates2003\">Bates, A. and Poole, G.

Synchronous learning occurs in real-time, with all participants interacting at the same time, while asynchronous learning is self-paced and allows participants to engage in the exchange of ideas or information without the dependency of other participants\u2032 involvement at the same time.\n\n[[Synchronous learning]] refers to the exchange of ideas and information with one or more participants during the same period. Examples are face-to-face discussion, online real-time live teacher instruction and feedback, Skype conversations, and chat rooms or virtual classrooms where everyone is online and working collaboratively at the same time. Since students are working collaboratively, synchronized learning helps students become more open-minded because they have to actively listen and learn from their peers.  Synchronized learning fosters online awareness and improves many students' writing skills.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Al-Asfour | first1 = A | year = 2012 | title = Online Teaching: Navigating Its Advantages, Disadvantages and Best Practices | url = | journal = Tribal College Journal of American Indian Higher Education | volume = 23 | issue = | page = 3 }}</ref>\n\n[[Asynchronous learning]] may use technologies such as [[learning management system]]s,  [[email]], [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, and [[discussion board]]s, as well as [[World Wide Web|web]]-supported textbooks,<ref>Loutchko, Iouri; Kurbel, Karl; Pakhomov, Alexei: Production and Delivery of Multimedia Courses for Internet Based Virtual Education; The World Congress \"Networked Learning in a Global Environment: Challenges and Solutions for Virtual Education\", Berlin, Germany, May 1&nbsp;\u2013 4, 2002</ref> [[hypertext]] documents,  audio<ref>{{cite web|title=PODCASTS IN EDUCATION: WHAT, WHY AND HOW? |url=http://www.appstate.edu/~koppenhaverd/rcoe/5532/read/podcast/robinson09.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927071851/http://www.appstate.edu/~koppenhaverd/rcoe/5532/read/podcast/robinson09.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> video courses, and [[social networking]] using [[web 2.0]]. At the professional educational level, training may include [[Virtual Operating Room|virtual operating room]]s. Asynchronous learning is beneficial for students who have health problems or who have child care responsibilities.  They have the opportunity to complete their work in a low-stress environment and within a more flexible time frame.<ref name=\"eurodl2007\"/> In ''asynchronous'' online courses, students are allowed the freedom to complete work at their own pace. Being a non-traditional student they can manage their daily life and school with and still have the social aspect. Asynchronous collaborations allow the student to reach out for help when needed and provides helpful guidance depending on how long it takes them to complete the assignment. Many tools used for these courses are but not limited to: videos, class discussions, and group projects. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.schoology.com/blog/asynchronous-learning-definition-benefits-and-example-activities |title = Asynchronous Learning: Definition, Benefits, and Example Activities}}</ref>Through online courses, students can earn their diplomas faster, or repeat failed courses without being in a class with younger students. Students have access to an incredible variety of enrichment courses in online learning, and still participate in college courses, internships, sports, or work and still graduate with their class.\n\n===Linear learning===\nComputer-based training (CBT) refers to self-paced learning activities delivered on a [[computer]] or handheld device such as a tablet or smartphone.  CBT initially delivered content via CD-ROM, and typically presented content linearly, much like reading an online book or manual.<ref name=\"patent\"/>  For this reason, CBT is often used to teach static processes, such as using software or completing mathematical equations.  Computer-based training is conceptually similar to web-based training (WBT) which are delivered via [[Internet]] using a [[web browser]].\n\nAssessing learning in a CBT is often by assessments that can be easily scored by a computer such as multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop, radio button, simulation or other interactive means. Assessments are easily scored and recorded via online software, providing immediate end-user feedback and completion status. Users are often able to print completion records in the form of certificates.<ref name=\"patent\">{{cite web |title=Collaborative asynchronous online learning |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140272893 |publisher=US Patent Office |accessdate=23 March 2019 |date=10 March 2014}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nCBTs provide learning stimulus beyond traditional learning methodology from textbook, manual, or classroom-based instruction.  CBTs can be a good alternative to printed learning materials since rich media, including videos or animations, can be embedded to enhance the learning.<ref name=\"patent\"/>\n\nHelp, CBTs pose some learning challenges.  Typically, the creation of effective CBTs requires enormous resources.  The software for developing CBTs is often more complex than a subject matter expert or teacher is able to use.<ref name=\"patent\"/> The lack of human interaction can limit both the type of content that can be presented and the type of assessment that can be performed, and may need supplementation with online discussion or other interactive elements.\n\n===Collaborative learning===\n{{Main|Computer-supported collaborative learning}}\n[[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL) uses instructional methods designed to encourage or require students to work together on learning tasks, allowing [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].

Each class is recorded and stored on a [[Server (computing)|server]], which allows for instant playback of any class over the course of the school year.  This can be extremely useful for students to retrieve missed material or review concepts for an upcoming exam.  Parents and auditors have the conceptual ability to monitor any classroom to ensure that they are satisfied with the education the learner is receiving.\n\nIn [[higher education]] especially, a [[virtual learning environment]] (VLE) is sometimes combined with a [[management information system]] (MIS) to create a [[managed learning environment]], in which all aspects of a course are handled through a consistent user interface throughout the institution. Physical universities and newer online-only colleges offer select [[academic degree]]s and certificate programs via the Internet. Some programs require students to attend some [[campus]] classes or orientations, but many are delivered completely online.  Several universities offer online student support services, such as online advising and registration, e-counseling, online textbook purchases, student governments and student newspapers.\n\n==== Augmented Reality ====\nAugmented reality (AR) provides students and teachers the opportunity to create layers of digital information, including both virtual world and real world elements, to interact with in real time. An example tool is Lumilo,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holstein|first=Kenneth|last2=Hong|first2=Gena|last3=Tegene|first3=Mera|last4=McLaren|first4=Bruce M.|last5=Aleven|first5=Vincent|date=2018|title=The classroom as a dashboard|journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge - LAK '18|pages=79\u201388|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/3170358.3170377|isbn=9781450364003}}</ref> a mixed-reality smart glass that provides teachers with real-time analytics of every student in the classroom. Prior studies have shown that Lumilo can change classroom dynamics and direct teachers' time and attention to students who require human assistance, such as those who exhibit unproductive persistence or game the system.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Holstein|first=Kenneth|title=Student Learning Benefits of a Mixed-Reality Teacher Awareness Tool in AI-Enhanced Classrooms|date=2018|work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=154\u2013168|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319938424|last2=McLaren|first2=Bruce M.|last3=Aleven|first3=Vincent|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-93843-1_12}}</ref> Using Lumilo, teachers were able to more frequently offer unsolicited help, without having to wait for students to raise their hands.\n\nAR technology plays an important role in the future of the classroom where human / AI co-orchestration takes place seamlessly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sharples|first=Mike|date=November 2013|title=Shared orchestration within and beyond the classroom|journal=Computers & Education|volume=69|pages=504\u2013506|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2013.04.014|issn=0360-1315|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/37464/1/Computers%20and%20Ed%20%27shared%20orchestration%27.pdf}}</ref> Students would switch between individual and collaborative learning dynamically, based on their own learning pace, while teachers, with the help of AR, monitor the classroom and provide necessary interventions in cases where computer systems are not yet designed to handle. In this vision, the technology's role is to enhance, rather than replace, human teachers' capabilities.\n\n===Learning management system===\n{{Main|Learning management system}}\nA [[learning management system]] (LMS) is software used for delivering, tracking and managing training and education. It tracks data about attendance, time on task, and student progress. Educators can post announcements, grade assignments, check on course activity, and participate in class discussions. Students can submit their work, read and respond to discussion questions, and take quizzes.<ref name=\"Courts, B. 2012\"/> An LMS may allow teachers, administrators, students, and permitted additional parties (such as parents, if appropriate) to track various metrics. LMSs range from systems for managing training/educational records to software for distributing courses over the Internet and offering features for online collaboration. The creation and maintenance of comprehensive learning content requires substantial initial and ongoing investments of human labor. Effective translation into other languages and cultural contexts requires even more investment by knowledgeable personnel.<ref name=tarasowa-2013-csedu>{{cite journal|last=Sarasota|first=Darya|author2=Ali Khalid |author3=S\u00f6ren Auer |author4=J\u00f6rg Unbehauen |title=Crowd Learn: Crowd sourcing the Creation of Highly-structured E-Learning Content|journal=5th International Conference on Computer Supported Education CSEDU 2013|year=2013|url=http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2d6735d1e8ca41e72ba1cd2be64aca72e/aksw}}</ref>\n\nInternet-based [[learning management systems]] include [[Canvas Network|Canvas]], [[Blackboard Inc.]] and [[Moodle]]. These types of LMS allow educators to run a learning system partially or fully online, [[asynchronous learning|asynchronously]] or [[synchronous]]ly. Learning Management Systems also offer a non-linear presentation of content and curricular goals, giving students the choice of pace and order of information learned.<ref name=\":4\" /> Blackboard can be used for K-12 education, Higher Education, Business, and Government collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackboard.com |title=Blackboard International &#124; EMEA|publisher=Blackboard.com |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> [[Moodle]] is a free-to-download Open Source Course Management System that provides blended learning opportunities as well as platforms for [[distance learning]] courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moodle.org |title=open-source community-based tools for learning|publisher=Moodle.org |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> [[Eliademy]] is a free cloud-based Course Management System that provides blended learning opportunities as well as platforms for [[distance learning]] courses.\n\n====Learning content management system====\nA [[learning content management system]] (LCMS) is software for author content (courses, reusable content objects). An LCMS may be solely dedicated to producing and publishing content that is hosted on an LMS, or it can host the content itself.  The [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee]] (AICC) specification provides support for content that is hosted separately from the LMS.\n\nA recent trend in LCMSs is to address this issue through [[crowdsourcing]] (cf.[[SlideWiki]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Auer|first=S\u00f6ren|title=First Public Beta of SlideWiki.org|url=http://blog.aksw.org/2013/first-public-beta-of-slidewiki-org/|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>).\n\n====Computer-aided assessment====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n[[Computer aided assessment|Computer-aided assessment]] ([[e-assessment]]) ranges from automated multiple-choice tests to more sophisticated systems. With some systems, feedback can be geared towards a student's specific mistakes or the computer can navigate the student through a series of questions adapting to what the student appears to have learned or not learned. [[Formative assessment]] sifts out the incorrect answers, and these questions are then explained by the teacher. The learner then practices with slight variations of the sifted out questions. The process is completed by [[summative assessment]] using a new set of questions that only cover the topics previously taught.\n\n====Electronic performance support system====\n[[File:Interactive multimedia educational game.jpg|thumb|Interactive [[multimedia]] educational game.]]\nAn electronic performance support system (EPSS) is, according to Barry Raybould, \"a computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on-the-job access to integrated information, advice, and learning experiences\".<ref>Raybould, B. (1991). \"An EPSS Case Study: Prime Computer\". Handout given at the Electronic Performance Support Conference, Atlanta, GA, 1992.</ref>\n\n====Training management system====\nA [[training management system]] or training resource management system is a software designed to optimize instructor-led training management. Similar to an [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), it is a [[back office]] tool which aims at streamlining every aspect of the training process: planning (training plan and budget forecasting), logistics (scheduling and resource management), financials (cost tracking, profitability), reporting, and sales for-profit training providers.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hr.com/en/magazines/training_development_excellence_essentials/march_2017_training_development/technology-enabled-learning-more-than-elearning---_izscecpc.html |title=Technology-enabled learning: More than e-Learning - Part 1: What does technology-enabled training management look like? | publisher=Training Development Excellence Essentials}}</ref> A training management system can be used to schedule instructors, venues and equipment through graphical agendas, optimize resource utilization, create a training plan and track remaining budgets, generate reports and share data between different teams.\n\nWhile training management systems focus on managing [[instructor-led training]], they can complete an LMS. In this situation, an LMS will manage [[e-learning]] delivery and assessment, while a training management system will manage ILT and back-office budget planning, logistic and reporting.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hr.com/en/magazines/training_development_excellence_essentials/april_2017_training_development/instructor-led-training-and-elearning-part-ii-whic_j15w9l2o.html |title=Instructor-Led Training and e-Learning: which technology for which learning delivery? |publisher=Training Development Excellence Essentials}}</ref>\n\n==Standards and ecosystem ==\n===Learning objects===\n{{Main|Learning object}}\n\n===Content===\nContent and design architecture issues include [[pedagogy]] and [[learning object]] re-use. One approach looks at five aspects:<ref>Clark, R. C., Mayer, R. E. (2007). ''eLearning and the Science of Instruction.'' San Francisco: Pfeiffer. {{ISBN|978-0787986834}}</ref>\n* Fact \u2013 unique data (e.g. symbols for Excel formula, or the parts that make up a [[Educational aims and objectives|learning objective]])\n* Concept \u2013 a category that includes multiple examples (e.g. Excel formulas, or the various types/theories of [[instructional design]])\n* Process \u2013 a flow of events or activities (e.g. how a spreadsheet works, or the five phases in ADDIE)\n* Procedure \u2013 step-by-step task (e.g. entering a formula into a spreadsheet, or the steps that should be followed within a phase in ADDIE)\n* Strategic principle \u2013 task performed by adapting guidelines (e.g. doing a financial projection in a spreadsheet, or using a framework for designing learning environments)\n\n====Pedagogical elements====\nPedagogical elements are defined as structures or units of educational material. They are the educational content that is to be delivered. These units are independent of format, meaning that although the unit may be delivered in various ways, the pedagogical structures themselves are '''not''' the textbook, web page, [[videoconferencing|video conference]], [[Podcast]], lesson, assignment, multiple choice question, quiz, discussion group or a case study, all of which are possible methods of delivery.\n\n===Learning objects standards===\nMuch effort has been put into the technical reuse of electronically based teaching materials and in particular creating or re-using [[learning object]]s. These are self-contained units that are properly tagged with keywords, or other [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]], and often stored in an [[XML]] file format. Creating a course requires putting together a sequence of learning objects. There are both proprietary and open, non-commercial and commercial, peer-reviewed repositories of learning objects such as the Merlot repository. [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model]] (SCORM) is a collection of standards and specifications that applies to certain web-based e-learning. Other specifications such as [[Schools Interoperability Framework]] allow for the transporting of [[learning object]]s, or for categorizing metadata ([[Learning object metadata|LOM]]).\n=== Artificial intelligence ===\n{{Main|Artificial intelligence}}\nAs [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) becomes more prominent in this age of [[big data]], it has also been widely adopted in K-12 classrooms. One prominent class of AI-enhanced educational technology is [[intelligent tutoring system]]s (ITSs), designed to provide immediate and personalized feedbacks to students. The incentive to develop ITS comes from educational studies showing that individual tutoring is much more effective than group teaching,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chi|first=Michelene T.H.|last2=Siler|first2=Stephanie A.|last3=Jeong|first3=Heisawn|last4=Yamauchi|first4=Takashi|last5=Hausmann|first5=Robert G.|date=July 2001|title=Learning from human tutoring|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=25|issue=4|pages=471\u2013533|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2504_1|issn=0364-0213}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=BLOOM|first=BENJAMIN S.|date=June 1984|title=The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for Methods of Group Instruction as Effective as One-to-One Tutoring|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=13|issue=6|pages=4\u201316|doi=10.3102/0013189x013006004|issn=0013-189X|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be4834407f8c271c252b11e4ba6ef88184a2f1ea}}</ref> in addition to the need for promoting learning on a larger scale.

Some e-learning environments take place in a traditional classroom, others allow students to attend classes from home or other locations. There are several states that are utilizing virtual school platforms for e-learning across the country that continue to increase. [[Virtual school]] enables students to log into [[synchronous learning]] or [[asynchronous learning]] courses anywhere there is an internet connection.\n\nE-learning is increasingly being utilized by students who may not want to go to traditional brick and mortar schools due to severe allergies or other medical issues, fear of [[school violence]] and [[school bullying]] and students whose parents would like to homeschool but do not feel qualified.<ref>{{cite web|author=publications|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-rise-of-cyber-schools|title=The Rise of Cyber-Schools |publisher=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Online schools create a haven for students to receive a quality education while almost completely avoiding these common problems.

Even though proper use has shown to increase student performances, being distracted would be detrimental. Another disadvantage is increased potential for cheating. Smartphones can be very easy to hide and use inconspicuously, especially if their use is normalized in the classroom. These disadvantages can be managed with strict rules and regulations on mobile phone use.\n\n===Over-stimulation===\nElectronic devices such as cellphones and computers facilitate rapid access to a stream of sources, each of which may receive cursory attention. Michel Rich, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the center on Media and Child Health in Boston, said of the digital generation, \"Their brains are rewarded not for staying on task, but for jumping to the next thing. The worry is we're raising a generation of kids in front of screens whose brains are going to be wired differently.\"<ref name=\"Ritchel, Matt 2010\"/> Students have always faced distractions; computers and cellphones are a particular challenge because the stream of data can interfere with focusing and learning. Although these technologies affect adults too, young people may be more influenced by it as their developing brains can easily become habituated to switching tasks and become unaccustomed to sustaining attention.<ref name=\"Ritchel, Matt 2010\"/> Too much information, coming too rapidly, can overwhelm thinking.<ref>Begley, Sharon.

Technology ultimately comes down to affecting the relations between people, but this notion is obfuscated when technology is treated as an abstract notion devoid of good and evil.  Langdon Winner makes a similar point by arguing that the underdevelopment of the philosophy of technology leaves us with an overly simplistic reduction in our discourse to the supposedly dichotomous notions of the \"making\" versus the \"uses\" of new technologies, and that a narrow focus on \"use\" leads us to believe that all technologies are neutral in moral standing.<ref name=\"Winner, L. 1986\"/>{{rp|ix\u201339}}  These critiques would have us ask not, \"How do we maximize the role or advancement of technology in education?\", but, rather, \"What are the social and human consequences of adopting any particular technology?\"\n\nWinner viewed technology as a \"form of life\" that not only aids human activity, but that also represents a powerful force in reshaping that activity and its meaning.<ref name=\"Winner, L. 1986\"/>{{rp|ix\u201339}} For example, the use of robots in the industrial workplace may increase productivity, but they also radically change the process of production itself, thereby redefining what is meant by \"work\" in such a setting.  In education, standardized testing has arguably redefined the notions of learning and assessment. We rarely explicitly reflect on how strange a notion it is that a number between, say, 0 and 100 could accurately reflect a person's knowledge about the world. According to Winner, the recurring patterns in everyday life tend to become an unconscious process that we learn to take for granted.  Winner writes,\n\n<blockquote>By far the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced.  Because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment, economic investment, and social habit, the original flexibility vanishes for all practical purposes once the initial commitments are made.  In that sense, technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations. (p. 29) </blockquote>\n\nWhen adopting new technologies, there may be one best chance to \"get it right.\" Seymour Papert (p.&nbsp;32) points out a good example of a (bad) choice that has become strongly fixed in social habit and material equipment: our \"choice\" to use the QWERTY keyboard.<ref>{{cite book|author=Papert, S.|year=1980|title=Mindstorms: Children computers and powerful ideas|location=New York, NY|publisher=Basic Books|url=http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PPP240/%CE%92%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1/MNDSTORMS%20Children,%20Computers,%20and%20Powerful%20Ideas.%20Papert.pdf|access-date=2016-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106063306/http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PPP240/%CE%92%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1/MNDSTORMS%20Children,%20Computers,%20and%20Powerful%20Ideas.%20Papert.pdf|archive-date=2015-11-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The QWERTY arrangement of letters on the keyboard was originally chosen, not because it was the most efficient for typing, but because early typewriters were prone to jam when adjacent keys were struck in quick succession.  Now that typing has become a digital process, this is no longer an issue, but the QWERTY arrangement lives on as a social habit, one that is very difficult to change.\n\nNeil Postman endorsed the notion that technology impacts human cultures, including the culture of classrooms, and that this is a consideration even more important than considering the efficiency of a new technology as a tool for teaching.<ref name=\"Postman, N. 1992\"/>  Regarding the computer's impact on education, Postman writes (p.&nbsp;19):\n\n<blockquote>What we need to consider about the computer has nothing to do with its efficiency as a teaching tool.  We need to know in what ways it is altering our conception of learning, and how in conjunction with television, it undermines the old idea of school.</blockquote>There is an assumption that technology is inherently interesting so it must be helpful in education; based on research by Daniel Willingham, that is not always the case.  He argues that it does not necessarily matter what the technological medium is, but whether or not the content is engaging and utilizes the medium in a beneficial way.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Willingham|first=Daniel|date=Summer 2010|title=Have Technology and Multitasking Rewired How Students Learn?|journal=American Educator|volume=Summer 2010|pages=23\u201328}}</ref>\n\n====Digital divide====\n{{Main|Digital divide}}\nThe concept of the [[digital divide]] is a gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not.<ref name=\"Wei, L 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = L. | last2 = Hindman | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Does the Digital Divide Matter More?

Instructors use both types of assessment to understand student progress and learning in the classroom. Technology has helped teachers create better assessments to help understand where students who are having trouble with the material are having issues.\n\nFormative assessment is more difficult, as the perfect form is ongoing and allows the students to show their learning in different ways depending on their [[learning styles]]. Technology has helped some teachers make their formative assessments better, particularly through the use of classroom response systems (CRS).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Beatty|first=Ian D|last2=Gerace|first2=William J|date=Jan 2009|title=Technology-Enhanced Formative Assessment: A Research-Based Pedagogy for Teaching Science with Classroom Response Technology|url=|journal=Journal of Science and Technology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=146|doi=10.1007/s10956-008-9140-4|pmid=|bibcode=2009JSEdT..18..146B}}</ref> A CRS is a tool in which the students each have a handheld device that partners up with the teacher's computer.

It encompasses several potential applications, which may be teacher or student-oriented, including [[educational assessment]] throughout the continuum of learning, such as [[computerized classification test]]ing, [[computerized adaptive testing]], [[Test (student assessment)|student testing]], and [[Grading (education)|grading]] an exam. E-Marking is an examiner led activity closely related to other [[e-assessment]] activities such as e-testing, or e-learning which are student-led. E-marking allows markers to mark a scanned script or online response on a computer screen rather than on paper.\n\nThere are no restrictions to the types of tests that can use e-marking, with e-marking applications designed to accommodate multiple choice, written, and even video submissions for performance examinations. E-marking software is used by individual educational institutions and can also be rolled out to the participating schools of awarding exam organisations. e-marking has been used to mark many well known high stakes examinations, which in the United Kingdom include  [[A levels]] and [[GCSE]] exams, and in the US includes the [[SAT]] test for college admissions. [[Ofqual]] reports that e-marking is the main type of marking used for general qualifications in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) announced that most of the National 5 question papers would be e-marked.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Introduction to E-marking|url=https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/IntroductioneMarkingMFI.pdf|website=SQA|publisher=SQA|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, the [[Odisha]] state government in India announced that it planned to use e-marking for all Plus II papers from 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=State government of India announces that it would be using e-marking for all streams from 2016|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/E-marking-for-all-streams-from-2016/articleshow/47510723.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=15 October 2015|ref=TI}}</ref>\n\n==Analytics==\nThe importance of self-assessment through tools made available on Educational Technology platforms has been growing.

Further large-scale use of technologies was employed in training soldiers during and after WWII using [[film]]s and other mediated materials, such as [[overhead projector]]s.

Although internet would not be created for another nine years, students were able to access class information with linked computer terminals. The first online course was offered in 1986 by the Electronic University Network for DOS and Commodore 64 computers. Computer Assisted Learning eventually offered the first online courses with real interaction. In 2002, [[MIT]] began providing online classes free of charge. {{as of|2009}}, approximately 5.5 millions students were taking at least one class online. Currently, one out of three college students takes at least one online course while in college. At [[DeVry University]], out of all students that are earning a bachelor's degree, 80% earn two-thirds of their requirements online.

In computer-based training (CBT) or computer-based learning (CBL), the learning interaction was between the student and computer drills or micro-world simulations.\n\nDigitized communication and networking in education started in the mid-1980s. Educational institutions began to take advantage of the new medium by offering distance learning courses using computer networking for information. Early e-learning systems, based on computer-based learning/training often replicated autocratic teaching styles whereby the role of the e-learning system was assumed to be for transferring knowledge, as opposed to systems developed later based on [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL), which encouraged the shared development of knowledge.\n\n[[Videoconferencing]] was an important forerunner to the educational technologies known today. This work was especially popular with [[museum education]]. Even in recent years, videoconferencing has risen in popularity to reach over 20,000 students across the United States and Canada in 2008\u20132009. Disadvantages of this form of educational technology are readily apparent: image and sound quality is often grainy or pixelated; videoconferencing requires setting up a type of mini-television studio within the museum for broadcast, space becomes an issue; and specialised equipment is required for both the provider and the participant.<ref>Crow, W.

Computer Science and Information Technology have had a major influence on Cognitive Science theory. The Cognitive concepts of working memory (formerly known as short-term memory) and long-term memory have been facilitated by research and technology from the field of Computer Science. Another major influence on the field of Cognitive Science is [[Noam Chomsky]]. Today researchers are concentrating on topics like [[cognitive load]], [[information processing]], and [[media psychology]]. These theoretical perspectives influence [[instructional design]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=deJong|first=T.|title=Cognitive Load Theory, Educational Research, and Instructional Design: Some Food for Thought|journal=Instructional Science: An International Journal of the Learning Sciences|year=2010|page=38}}</ref>\n\nThere are two separate schools of cognitivism and these are the cognitivist and social cognitivist. The former focuses on the understanding of the thinking or cognitive processes of an individual while the latter includes social processes as influences in learning besides cognition.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Theory and Research for Academic Nurse Educators: Application to Practice|last=Utley|first=Rose|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning LLC|year=2010|isbn=9780763774134|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=23}}</ref> These two schools, however, share the view that learning is more than a behavioral change but as a mental process used by the learner.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Constructivism===\nEducational psychologists distinguish between several types of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]: individual (or psychological) constructivism, such as [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], and [[social constructivism (learning theory)|social constructivism]]. This form of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] has a primary focus on how learners construct their own meaning from new information, as they interact with reality and with other learners who bring different perspectives. Constructivist learning environments require students to use their prior knowledge and experiences to formulate new, related, and/or adaptive concepts in learning (Termos, 2012<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Termos|first1=Mohamad|title=Does the Classroom Performance System (CPS) Increase Students' Chances for Getting a Good Grade in College Core Courses and Increase Retention?|journal=International Journal of Technologies in Learning|date=2012|volume=19|issue=1|pages=45\u201356|doi=10.18848/2327-0144/cgp/v19i01/49144}}</ref>). Under this framework the role of the teacher becomes that of a facilitator, providing guidance so that learners can construct their own knowledge. Constructivist educators must make sure that the prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught. Jonassen (1997) suggests \"well-structured\" learning environments are useful for novice learners and that \"ill-structured\" environments are only useful for more advanced learners. Educators utilizing a constructivist perspective may emphasize an [[active learning]] environment that may incorporate learner centered [[problem-based learning]], [[project-based learning]], and [[inquiry-based learning]], ideally involving real-world scenarios, in which students are actively engaged in critical thinking activities. An illustrative discussion and example can be found in the 1980s deployment of constructivist cognitive learning in computer literacy, which involved programming as an instrument of learning.<ref name=Rosenberg>{{Cite book|title = The Social Impact of Computers|last = Rosenberg|first = Richard|publisher = Elsevier Academic Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-12-597121-8|location = Amsterdam}}</ref>{{rp|224}} ''LOGO'', a programming language, embodied an attempt to integrate Piagetan ideas with computers and technology.<ref name=Rosenberg/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Book Ends: The Changing Media Environment of American Classrooms|last = Cassidy|first = Margaret|publisher = Hampton Press, Inc.|year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-57273-492-0|location = Cresskill, NJ|pages = 223}}</ref> Initially there were broad, hopeful claims, including \"perhaps the most controversial claim\" that it would \"improve general problem-solving skills\" across disciplines.<ref name=Rosenberg/>{{rp|238}} However, ''LOGO'' programming skills did not consistently yield cognitive benefits.<ref name=Rosenberg/>{{rp|238}} It was \"not as concrete\" as advocates claimed, it privileged \"one form of reasoning over all others,\" and it was difficult to apply the thinking activity to non-''LOGO''-based activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Book Ends: The Changing Media Environment of American Classrooms|last = Cassidy|first = Margaret|publisher = Hampton Press, Inc.|year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-57273-492-0|location = Cresskill, NJ|pages = 224}}</ref> By the late 1980s, ''LOGO'' and other similar programming languages had lost their novelty and dominance and were gradually de-emphasized amid criticisms.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Social Impact of Computers|last = Rosenberg|first = Richard|publisher = Elsevier Academic Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-12-597121-8|location = Amsterdam|pages = 219}}</ref>\n\n==Practice==\n{{see also|Instructional design}}\nThe extent to which e-learning assists or replaces other learning and teaching approaches is variable, ranging on a continuum from none to fully [[World Wide Web|online]] [[distance learning]].<ref name=\"Bates2003\">Bates, A. and Poole, G.

Synchronous learning occurs in real-time, with all participants interacting at the same time, while asynchronous learning is self-paced and allows participants to engage in the exchange of ideas or information without the dependency of other participants\u2032 involvement at the same time.\n\n[[Synchronous learning]] refers to the exchange of ideas and information with one or more participants during the same period. Examples are face-to-face discussion, online real-time live teacher instruction and feedback, Skype conversations, and chat rooms or virtual classrooms where everyone is online and working collaboratively at the same time. Since students are working collaboratively, synchronized learning helps students become more open-minded because they have to actively listen and learn from their peers.  Synchronized learning fosters online awareness and improves many students' writing skills.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Al-Asfour | first1 = A | year = 2012 | title = Online Teaching: Navigating Its Advantages, Disadvantages and Best Practices | url = | journal = Tribal College Journal of American Indian Higher Education | volume = 23 | issue = | page = 3 }}</ref>\n\n[[Asynchronous learning]] may use technologies such as [[learning management system]]s,  [[email]], [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, and [[discussion board]]s, as well as [[World Wide Web|web]]-supported textbooks,<ref>Loutchko, Iouri; Kurbel, Karl; Pakhomov, Alexei: Production and Delivery of Multimedia Courses for Internet Based Virtual Education; The World Congress \"Networked Learning in a Global Environment: Challenges and Solutions for Virtual Education\", Berlin, Germany, May 1&nbsp;\u2013 4, 2002</ref> [[hypertext]] documents,  audio<ref>{{cite web|title=PODCASTS IN EDUCATION: WHAT, WHY AND HOW? |url=http://www.appstate.edu/~koppenhaverd/rcoe/5532/read/podcast/robinson09.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927071851/http://www.appstate.edu/~koppenhaverd/rcoe/5532/read/podcast/robinson09.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> video courses, and [[social networking]] using [[web 2.0]]. At the professional educational level, training may include [[Virtual Operating Room|virtual operating room]]s. Asynchronous learning is beneficial for students who have health problems or who have child care responsibilities.  They have the opportunity to complete their work in a low-stress environment and within a more flexible time frame.<ref name=\"eurodl2007\"/> In ''asynchronous'' online courses, students are allowed the freedom to complete work at their own pace. Being a non-traditional student they can manage their daily life and school with and still have the social aspect. Asynchronous collaborations allow the student to reach out for help when needed and provides helpful guidance depending on how long it takes them to complete the assignment. Many tools used for these courses are but not limited to: videos, class discussions, and group projects. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.schoology.com/blog/asynchronous-learning-definition-benefits-and-example-activities |title = Asynchronous Learning: Definition, Benefits, and Example Activities}}</ref>Through online courses, students can earn their diplomas faster, or repeat failed courses without being in a class with younger students. Students have access to an incredible variety of enrichment courses in online learning, and still participate in college courses, internships, sports, or work and still graduate with their class.\n\n===Linear learning===\nComputer-based training (CBT) refers to self-paced learning activities delivered on a [[computer]] or handheld device such as a tablet or smartphone.  CBT initially delivered content via CD-ROM, and typically presented content linearly, much like reading an online book or manual.<ref name=\"patent\"/>  For this reason, CBT is often used to teach static processes, such as using software or completing mathematical equations.  Computer-based training is conceptually similar to web-based training (WBT) which are delivered via [[Internet]] using a [[web browser]].\n\nAssessing learning in a CBT is often by assessments that can be easily scored by a computer such as multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop, radio button, simulation or other interactive means. Assessments are easily scored and recorded via online software, providing immediate end-user feedback and completion status. Users are often able to print completion records in the form of certificates.<ref name=\"patent\">{{cite web |title=Collaborative asynchronous online learning |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140272893 |publisher=US Patent Office |accessdate=23 March 2019 |date=10 March 2014}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nCBTs provide learning stimulus beyond traditional learning methodology from textbook, manual, or classroom-based instruction.  CBTs can be a good alternative to printed learning materials since rich media, including videos or animations, can be embedded to enhance the learning.<ref name=\"patent\"/>\n\nHelp, CBTs pose some learning challenges.  Typically, the creation of effective CBTs requires enormous resources.  The software for developing CBTs is often more complex than a subject matter expert or teacher is able to use.<ref name=\"patent\"/> The lack of human interaction can limit both the type of content that can be presented and the type of assessment that can be performed, and may need supplementation with online discussion or other interactive elements.\n\n===Collaborative learning===\n{{Main|Computer-supported collaborative learning}}\n[[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL) uses instructional methods designed to encourage or require students to work together on learning tasks, allowing [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].

[http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/whiteboard ''Definition: Whiteboard'']. TechTarget.</ref> The initial [[whiteboard]]s, analogous to [[blackboard]]s, date from the late 1950s. The term whiteboard is also used metaphorically to refer to virtual whiteboards in which computer software applications simulate whiteboards by allowing writing or drawing. This is a common feature of [[groupware]] for virtual meeting, collaboration, and instant messaging. [[Interactive whiteboard]]s allow learners and instructors to write on the touch screen. The screen markup can be on either a blank whiteboard or any computer screen content. Depending on permission settings, this visual learning can be interactive and participatory, including writing and manipulating images on the interactive whiteboard.<ref name=Carpenter/>\n\n=== Interactive flat-panel displays ===\nSimilar to the interactive whiteboard is the interactive [[flat-panel display]]. This touch-enabled,high definition display can be wall-mounted and used as a digital presentation surface in classrooms and lecture halls.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} \n\n===Virtual classroom===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2019}}{{Main|Virtual Learning Environment|MUVE}} \nA [[virtual learning environment]] (VLE), also known as a learning platform, simulates a virtual classroom or meetings by simultaneously mixing several communication technologies. [[Web conferencing]] software enables students and instructors to communicate with each other via webcam, microphone, and real-time chatting in a group setting. Participants can raise hands, answer polls or take tests.  Students are able to whiteboard and screencast when given rights by the instructor, who sets permission levels for text notes, microphone rights and mouse control.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farwell | year = 2013 | title = Keeping an Online Class Interesting and Interactive | url = | journal = Distance Learning | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 27\u201332 }}</ref>\n\nA virtual classroom provides the opportunity for students to receive direct instruction from a qualified teacher in an interactive environment.  Learners can have direct and immediate access to their instructor for instant feedback and direction.  The virtual classroom provides a structured schedule of classes, which can be helpful for students who may find the freedom of asynchronous learning to be overwhelming.  In addition, the virtual classroom provides a social learning environment that replicates the traditional \"brick and mortar\" classroom.  Most virtual classroom applications provide a recording feature.  Each class is recorded and stored on a [[Server (computing)|server]], which allows for instant playback of any class over the course of the school year.  This can be extremely useful for students to retrieve missed material or review concepts for an upcoming exam.  Parents and auditors have the conceptual ability to monitor any classroom to ensure that they are satisfied with the education the learner is receiving.\n\nIn [[higher education]] especially, a [[virtual learning environment]] (VLE) is sometimes combined with a [[management information system]] (MIS) to create a [[managed learning environment]], in which all aspects of a course are handled through a consistent user interface throughout the institution. Physical universities and newer online-only colleges offer select [[academic degree]]s and certificate programs via the Internet. Some programs require students to attend some [[campus]] classes or orientations, but many are delivered completely online.  Several universities offer online student support services, such as online advising and registration, e-counseling, online textbook purchases, student governments and student newspapers.\n\n==== Augmented Reality ====\nAugmented reality (AR) provides students and teachers the opportunity to create layers of digital information, including both virtual world and real world elements, to interact with in real time. An example tool is Lumilo,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holstein|first=Kenneth|last2=Hong|first2=Gena|last3=Tegene|first3=Mera|last4=McLaren|first4=Bruce M.|last5=Aleven|first5=Vincent|date=2018|title=The classroom as a dashboard|journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge - LAK '18|pages=79\u201388|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/3170358.3170377|isbn=9781450364003}}</ref> a mixed-reality smart glass that provides teachers with real-time analytics of every student in the classroom. Prior studies have shown that Lumilo can change classroom dynamics and direct teachers' time and attention to students who require human assistance, such as those who exhibit unproductive persistence or game the system.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Holstein|first=Kenneth|title=Student Learning Benefits of a Mixed-Reality Teacher Awareness Tool in AI-Enhanced Classrooms|date=2018|work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=154\u2013168|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319938424|last2=McLaren|first2=Bruce M.|last3=Aleven|first3=Vincent|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-93843-1_12}}</ref> Using Lumilo, teachers were able to more frequently offer unsolicited help, without having to wait for students to raise their hands.\n\nAR technology plays an important role in the future of the classroom where human / AI co-orchestration takes place seamlessly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sharples|first=Mike|date=November 2013|title=Shared orchestration within and beyond the classroom|journal=Computers & Education|volume=69|pages=504\u2013506|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2013.04.014|issn=0360-1315|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/37464/1/Computers%20and%20Ed%20%27shared%20orchestration%27.pdf}}</ref> Students would switch between individual and collaborative learning dynamically, based on their own learning pace, while teachers, with the help of AR, monitor the classroom and provide necessary interventions in cases where computer systems are not yet designed to handle. In this vision, the technology's role is to enhance, rather than replace, human teachers' capabilities.\n\n===Learning management system===\n{{Main|Learning management system}}\nA [[learning management system]] (LMS) is software used for delivering, tracking and managing training and education. It tracks data about attendance, time on task, and student progress. Educators can post announcements, grade assignments, check on course activity, and participate in class discussions. Students can submit their work, read and respond to discussion questions, and take quizzes.<ref name=\"Courts, B. 2012\"/> An LMS may allow teachers, administrators, students, and permitted additional parties (such as parents, if appropriate) to track various metrics. LMSs range from systems for managing training/educational records to software for distributing courses over the Internet and offering features for online collaboration. The creation and maintenance of comprehensive learning content requires substantial initial and ongoing investments of human labor. Effective translation into other languages and cultural contexts requires even more investment by knowledgeable personnel.<ref name=tarasowa-2013-csedu>{{cite journal|last=Sarasota|first=Darya|author2=Ali Khalid |author3=S\u00f6ren Auer |author4=J\u00f6rg Unbehauen |title=Crowd Learn: Crowd sourcing the Creation of Highly-structured E-Learning Content|journal=5th International Conference on Computer Supported Education CSEDU 2013|year=2013|url=http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2d6735d1e8ca41e72ba1cd2be64aca72e/aksw}}</ref>\n\nInternet-based [[learning management systems]] include [[Canvas Network|Canvas]], [[Blackboard Inc.]] and [[Moodle]]. These types of LMS allow educators to run a learning system partially or fully online, [[asynchronous learning|asynchronously]] or [[synchronous]]ly. Learning Management Systems also offer a non-linear presentation of content and curricular goals, giving students the choice of pace and order of information learned.<ref name=\":4\" /> Blackboard can be used for K-12 education, Higher Education, Business, and Government collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackboard.com |title=Blackboard International &#124; EMEA|publisher=Blackboard.com |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> [[Moodle]] is a free-to-download Open Source Course Management System that provides blended learning opportunities as well as platforms for [[distance learning]] courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moodle.org |title=open-source community-based tools for learning|publisher=Moodle.org |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> [[Eliademy]] is a free cloud-based Course Management System that provides blended learning opportunities as well as platforms for [[distance learning]] courses.\n\n====Learning content management system====\nA [[learning content management system]] (LCMS) is software for author content (courses, reusable content objects). An LCMS may be solely dedicated to producing and publishing content that is hosted on an LMS, or it can host the content itself.  The [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee]] (AICC) specification provides support for content that is hosted separately from the LMS.\n\nA recent trend in LCMSs is to address this issue through [[crowdsourcing]] (cf.[[SlideWiki]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Auer|first=S\u00f6ren|title=First Public Beta of SlideWiki.org|url=http://blog.aksw.org/2013/first-public-beta-of-slidewiki-org/|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>).\n\n====Computer-aided assessment====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n[[Computer aided assessment|Computer-aided assessment]] ([[e-assessment]]) ranges from automated multiple-choice tests to more sophisticated systems. With some systems, feedback can be geared towards a student's specific mistakes or the computer can navigate the student through a series of questions adapting to what the student appears to have learned or not learned. [[Formative assessment]] sifts out the incorrect answers, and these questions are then explained by the teacher. The learner then practices with slight variations of the sifted out questions. The process is completed by [[summative assessment]] using a new set of questions that only cover the topics previously taught.\n\n====Electronic performance support system====\n[[File:Interactive multimedia educational game.jpg|thumb|Interactive [[multimedia]] educational game.]]\nAn electronic performance support system (EPSS) is, according to Barry Raybould, \"a computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on-the-job access to integrated information, advice, and learning experiences\".<ref>Raybould, B. (1991). \"An EPSS Case Study: Prime Computer\". Handout given at the Electronic Performance Support Conference, Atlanta, GA, 1992.</ref>\n\n====Training management system====\nA [[training management system]] or training resource management system is a software designed to optimize instructor-led training management. Similar to an [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), it is a [[back office]] tool which aims at streamlining every aspect of the training process: planning (training plan and budget forecasting), logistics (scheduling and resource management), financials (cost tracking, profitability), reporting, and sales for-profit training providers.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hr.com/en/magazines/training_development_excellence_essentials/march_2017_training_development/technology-enabled-learning-more-than-elearning---_izscecpc.html |title=Technology-enabled learning: More than e-Learning - Part 1: What does technology-enabled training management look like? | publisher=Training Development Excellence Essentials}}</ref> A training management system can be used to schedule instructors, venues and equipment through graphical agendas, optimize resource utilization, create a training plan and track remaining budgets, generate reports and share data between different teams.\n\nWhile training management systems focus on managing [[instructor-led training]], they can complete an LMS. In this situation, an LMS will manage [[e-learning]] delivery and assessment, while a training management system will manage ILT and back-office budget planning, logistic and reporting.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hr.com/en/magazines/training_development_excellence_essentials/april_2017_training_development/instructor-led-training-and-elearning-part-ii-whic_j15w9l2o.html |title=Instructor-Led Training and e-Learning: which technology for which learning delivery? |publisher=Training Development Excellence Essentials}}</ref>\n\n==Standards and ecosystem ==\n===Learning objects===\n{{Main|Learning object}}\n\n===Content===\nContent and design architecture issues include [[pedagogy]] and [[learning object]] re-use. One approach looks at five aspects:<ref>Clark, R. C., Mayer, R. E. (2007). ''eLearning and the Science of Instruction.'' San Francisco: Pfeiffer. {{ISBN|978-0787986834}}</ref>\n* Fact \u2013 unique data (e.g. symbols for Excel formula, or the parts that make up a [[Educational aims and objectives|learning objective]])\n* Concept \u2013 a category that includes multiple examples (e.g. Excel formulas, or the various types/theories of [[instructional design]])\n* Process \u2013 a flow of events or activities (e.g. how a spreadsheet works, or the five phases in ADDIE)\n* Procedure \u2013 step-by-step task (e.g. entering a formula into a spreadsheet, or the steps that should be followed within a phase in ADDIE)\n* Strategic principle \u2013 task performed by adapting guidelines (e.g. doing a financial projection in a spreadsheet, or using a framework for designing learning environments)\n\n====Pedagogical elements====\nPedagogical elements are defined as structures or units of educational material. They are the educational content that is to be delivered. These units are independent of format, meaning that although the unit may be delivered in various ways, the pedagogical structures themselves are '''not''' the textbook, web page, [[videoconferencing|video conference]], [[Podcast]], lesson, assignment, multiple choice question, quiz, discussion group or a case study, all of which are possible methods of delivery.\n\n===Learning objects standards===\nMuch effort has been put into the technical reuse of electronically based teaching materials and in particular creating or re-using [[learning object]]s. These are self-contained units that are properly tagged with keywords, or other [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]], and often stored in an [[XML]] file format. Creating a course requires putting together a sequence of learning objects. There are both proprietary and open, non-commercial and commercial, peer-reviewed repositories of learning objects such as the Merlot repository. [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model]] (SCORM) is a collection of standards and specifications that applies to certain web-based e-learning. Other specifications such as [[Schools Interoperability Framework]] allow for the transporting of [[learning object]]s, or for categorizing metadata ([[Learning object metadata|LOM]]).\n=== Artificial intelligence ===\n{{Main|Artificial intelligence}}\nAs [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) becomes more prominent in this age of [[big data]], it has also been widely adopted in K-12 classrooms. One prominent class of AI-enhanced educational technology is [[intelligent tutoring system]]s (ITSs), designed to provide immediate and personalized feedbacks to students. The incentive to develop ITS comes from educational studies showing that individual tutoring is much more effective than group teaching,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chi|first=Michelene T.H.|last2=Siler|first2=Stephanie A.|last3=Jeong|first3=Heisawn|last4=Yamauchi|first4=Takashi|last5=Hausmann|first5=Robert G.|date=July 2001|title=Learning from human tutoring|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=25|issue=4|pages=471\u2013533|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2504_1|issn=0364-0213}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=BLOOM|first=BENJAMIN S.|date=June 1984|title=The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for Methods of Group Instruction as Effective as One-to-One Tutoring|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=13|issue=6|pages=4\u201316|doi=10.3102/0013189x013006004|issn=0013-189X|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/be4834407f8c271c252b11e4ba6ef88184a2f1ea}}</ref> in addition to the need for promoting learning on a larger scale.

Andrew Meltzoff, a surveyor in this study states that the result makes sense, that if the baby's \"alert time\" is spent in front of DVDs and TV, instead of with people speaking, the babies are not going to get the same linguistic experience. Dr. Dimitri Chistakis, another surveyor reported that the evidence is mounting that baby DVDs are of no value and may be harmful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baby DVDs, Videos May Hinder, Not Help, Infants' Language Development|date=August 7, 2007|url=http://www.washington.edu/alumni/uwnewslinks/200709/videos.html|work=UW Press Release|publisher=University of Washington Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215122133/http://www.washington.edu/alumni/uwnewslinks/200709/videos.html|archivedate=February 15, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1650352,00.html|title=Baby Einsteins: Not So Smart After All|date=6 August 2007|magazine=TIME.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882560,00.html|title=TV for Babies: Does It Help or Hurt?|date=3 March 2009|magazine=TIME.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=No television for babies: Why TV is bad for young children|work=Washington Times Communities|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/parenting-first-time-through/2012/jun/8/no_television_for_babies_tv_bad/|date=June 8, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104010241/http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/parenting-first-time-through/2012/jun/8/no_television_for_babies_tv_bad/|archivedate=January 4, 2015|url-status=dead|author=Moret, B.}}</ref>\n\nAdaptive instructional materials tailor questions to each student's ability and calculate their scores, but this encourages students to work individually rather than socially or collaboratively (Kruse, 2013).

Even though proper use has shown to increase student performances, being distracted would be detrimental. Another disadvantage is increased potential for cheating. Smartphones can be very easy to hide and use inconspicuously, especially if their use is normalized in the classroom. These disadvantages can be managed with strict rules and regulations on mobile phone use.\n\n===Over-stimulation===\nElectronic devices such as cellphones and computers facilitate rapid access to a stream of sources, each of which may receive cursory attention. Michel Rich, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the center on Media and Child Health in Boston, said of the digital generation, \"Their brains are rewarded not for staying on task, but for jumping to the next thing. The worry is we're raising a generation of kids in front of screens whose brains are going to be wired differently.\"<ref name=\"Ritchel, Matt 2010\"/> Students have always faced distractions; computers and cellphones are a particular challenge because the stream of data can interfere with focusing and learning. Although these technologies affect adults too, young people may be more influenced by it as their developing brains can easily become habituated to switching tasks and become unaccustomed to sustaining attention.<ref name=\"Ritchel, Matt 2010\"/> Too much information, coming too rapidly, can overwhelm thinking.<ref>Begley, Sharon.

Technology ultimately comes down to affecting the relations between people, but this notion is obfuscated when technology is treated as an abstract notion devoid of good and evil.  Langdon Winner makes a similar point by arguing that the underdevelopment of the philosophy of technology leaves us with an overly simplistic reduction in our discourse to the supposedly dichotomous notions of the \"making\" versus the \"uses\" of new technologies, and that a narrow focus on \"use\" leads us to believe that all technologies are neutral in moral standing.<ref name=\"Winner, L. 1986\"/>{{rp|ix\u201339}}  These critiques would have us ask not, \"How do we maximize the role or advancement of technology in education?\", but, rather, \"What are the social and human consequences of adopting any particular technology?\"\n\nWinner viewed technology as a \"form of life\" that not only aids human activity, but that also represents a powerful force in reshaping that activity and its meaning.<ref name=\"Winner, L. 1986\"/>{{rp|ix\u201339}} For example, the use of robots in the industrial workplace may increase productivity, but they also radically change the process of production itself, thereby redefining what is meant by \"work\" in such a setting.  In education, standardized testing has arguably redefined the notions of learning and assessment. We rarely explicitly reflect on how strange a notion it is that a number between, say, 0 and 100 could accurately reflect a person's knowledge about the world. According to Winner, the recurring patterns in everyday life tend to become an unconscious process that we learn to take for granted.  Winner writes,\n\n<blockquote>By far the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced.  Because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment, economic investment, and social habit, the original flexibility vanishes for all practical purposes once the initial commitments are made.  In that sense, technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations. (p. 29) </blockquote>\n\nWhen adopting new technologies, there may be one best chance to \"get it right.\" Seymour Papert (p.&nbsp;32) points out a good example of a (bad) choice that has become strongly fixed in social habit and material equipment: our \"choice\" to use the QWERTY keyboard.<ref>{{cite book|author=Papert, S.|year=1980|title=Mindstorms: Children computers and powerful ideas|location=New York, NY|publisher=Basic Books|url=http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PPP240/%CE%92%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1/MNDSTORMS%20Children,%20Computers,%20and%20Powerful%20Ideas.%20Papert.pdf|access-date=2016-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106063306/http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PPP240/%CE%92%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1/MNDSTORMS%20Children,%20Computers,%20and%20Powerful%20Ideas.%20Papert.pdf|archive-date=2015-11-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The QWERTY arrangement of letters on the keyboard was originally chosen, not because it was the most efficient for typing, but because early typewriters were prone to jam when adjacent keys were struck in quick succession.  Now that typing has become a digital process, this is no longer an issue, but the QWERTY arrangement lives on as a social habit, one that is very difficult to change.\n\nNeil Postman endorsed the notion that technology impacts human cultures, including the culture of classrooms, and that this is a consideration even more important than considering the efficiency of a new technology as a tool for teaching.<ref name=\"Postman, N. 1992\"/>  Regarding the computer's impact on education, Postman writes (p.&nbsp;19):\n\n<blockquote>What we need to consider about the computer has nothing to do with its efficiency as a teaching tool.  We need to know in what ways it is altering our conception of learning, and how in conjunction with television, it undermines the old idea of school.</blockquote>There is an assumption that technology is inherently interesting so it must be helpful in education; based on research by Daniel Willingham, that is not always the case.  He argues that it does not necessarily matter what the technological medium is, but whether or not the content is engaging and utilizes the medium in a beneficial way.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Willingham|first=Daniel|date=Summer 2010|title=Have Technology and Multitasking Rewired How Students Learn?|journal=American Educator|volume=Summer 2010|pages=23\u201328}}</ref>\n\n====Digital divide====\n{{Main|Digital divide}}\nThe concept of the [[digital divide]] is a gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not.<ref name=\"Wei, L 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = L. | last2 = Hindman | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Does the Digital Divide Matter More?

Technology has helped teachers create better assessments to help understand where students who are having trouble with the material are having issues.\n\nFormative assessment is more difficult, as the perfect form is ongoing and allows the students to show their learning in different ways depending on their [[learning styles]].

It encompasses several potential applications, which may be teacher or student-oriented, including [[educational assessment]] throughout the continuum of learning, such as [[computerized classification test]]ing, [[computerized adaptive testing]], [[Test (student assessment)|student testing]], and [[Grading (education)|grading]] an exam. E-Marking is an examiner led activity closely related to other [[e-assessment]] activities such as e-testing, or e-learning which are student-led. E-marking allows markers to mark a scanned script or online response on a computer screen rather than on paper.\n\nThere are no restrictions to the types of tests that can use e-marking, with e-marking applications designed to accommodate multiple choice, written, and even video submissions for performance examinations. E-marking software is used by individual educational institutions and can also be rolled out to the participating schools of awarding exam organisations. e-marking has been used to mark many well known high stakes examinations, which in the United Kingdom include  [[A levels]] and [[GCSE]] exams, and in the US includes the [[SAT]] test for college admissions.
