This was so that mail could be properly routed to its destination. The mainframes used business rules to correct common misspellings and typographical errors in name and address data, as well as to track customers who had moved, died, gone to prison, married, divorced, or experienced other life-changing events. Government agencies began to make postal data available to a few service companies to cross-reference customer data with the National Change of Address registry [[United States Postal Service|(NCOA)]]. This technology saved large companies millions of dollars in comparison to manual correction of customer data. Large companies saved on postage, as bills and direct marketing materials made their way to the intended customer more accurately. Initially sold as a service, data quality moved inside the walls of corporations, as low-cost and powerful server technology became available.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nCompanies with an emphasis on marketing often focused their quality efforts on name and address information, but data quality is recognized{{by whom|date=May 2015}} as an important property of all types of data. Principles of data quality can be applied to supply chain data, transactional data, and nearly every other category of data found. For example, making supply chain data conform to a certain standard has value to an organization by: 1) avoiding overstocking of similar but slightly different stock; 2) avoiding false stock-out; 3) improving the understanding of vendor purchases to negotiate volume discounts; and 4) avoiding logistics costs in stocking and shipping parts across a large organization.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFor companies with significant research efforts, data quality can include developing [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocols]] for research methods, reducing [[measurement error]], [[bounds checking]] of data, [[cross tabulation]], modeling and [[outlier]] detection, verifying [[data integrity]], etc.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Overview ==\nThere are a number of theoretical frameworks for understanding data quality. A systems-theoretical approach influenced by American pragmatism expands the definition of data quality to include information quality, and emphasizes the inclusiveness of the fundamental dimensions of accuracy and precision on the basis of the theory of science (Ivanov, 1972). One framework, dubbed \"Zero Defect Data\" (Hansen, 1991) adapts the principles of statistical process control to data quality. Another framework seeks to integrate the product perspective (conformance to specifications) and the [[Customer service|service]] perspective (meeting consumers' expectations) (Kahn et al. 2002). Another framework is based in [[semiotics]] to evaluate the quality of the form, meaning and use of the data (Price and Shanks, 2004). One highly theoretical approach analyzes the [[ontological]] nature of [[information systems]] to define data quality rigorously (Wand and Wang, 1996).\n\nA considerable amount of data quality research involves investigating and describing various categories of desirable attributes (or dimensions) of data. Nearly 200 such terms have been identified and there is little agreement in their nature (are these concepts, goals or criteria?), their definitions or measures (Wang et al., 1993). Software engineers may recognize this as a similar problem to \"[[List of system quality attributes|ilities]]\".\n\n[[MIT]] has a Total Data Quality Management program, led by Professor Richard Wang, which produces a large number of publications and hosts a significant international conference in this field (International Conference on Information Quality, ICIQ). This program grew out of the work done by Hansen on the \"Zero Defect Data\" framework (Hansen, 1991).\n\nIn practice, data quality is a concern for professionals involved with a wide range of information systems, ranging from [[data warehousing]] and [[business intelligence]] to [[customer relationship management]] and [[supply chain management]]. One industry study estimated the total cost to the U.S. economy of data quality problems at over U.S. $600 billion per annum (Eckerson, 2002). Incorrect data \u2013 which includes invalid and outdated information \u2013 can originate from different data sources \u2013 through data entry, or [[data migration]] and conversion projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-management.com/issues/20060801/1060128-1.html|title=Liability and Leverage - A Case for Data Quality|publisher=Information Management|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the USPS and PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report stating that 23.6 percent of all U.S. mail sent is incorrectly addressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=509|title=Address Management for Mail-Order and Retail|publisher=Directions Magazine|access-date=2010-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428233613/http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=509|archive-date=2005-04-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOne reason contact data becomes stale very quickly in the average database \u2013 more than 45 million Americans change their address every year.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ribbs.usps.gov/move_update/documents/tech_guides/PUB363.pdf | title=USPS &#124; PostalPro}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, the problem is such a concern that companies are beginning to set up a [[data governance]] team whose sole role in the corporation is to be responsible for data quality. In some{{Who|date=June 2012}} organizations, this [[data governance]] function has been established as part of a larger Regulatory Compliance function - a recognition of the importance of Data/Information Quality to organizations.\n\nProblems with data quality don't only arise from ''incorrect'' data; ''inconsistent'' data is a problem as well. Eliminating [[shadow system|data shadow systems]] and centralizing data in a warehouse is one of the initiatives a company can take to ensure data consistency.\n\nEnterprises, scientists, and researchers are starting to participate within data curation communities to improve the quality of their common data.<ref>E.

A number of vendors make tools for analyzing and repairing poor quality data ''in situ'', service providers can clean the data on a contract basis and consultants can advise on fixing processes or systems to avoid data quality problems in the first place. Most data quality tools offer a series of tools for improving data, which may include some or all of the following:\n\n# [[Data profiling]] - initially assessing the data to understand its current state, often including value distributions\n# Data standardization - a [[business rules engine]] that ensures that data conforms to standards \n# Geocoding - for name and address data. Corrects data to U.S. and Worldwide geographic standards\n# [[Record linkage|Matching or Linking]] - a way to compare data so that similar, but slightly different records can be aligned. Matching may use \"fuzzy logic\" to find duplicates in the data. It often recognizes that \"Bob\" and \"Bbo\" may be the same individual. It might be able to manage \"householding\", or finding links between spouses at the same address, for example. Finally, it often can build a \"best of breed\" record, taking the best components from multiple data sources and building a single super-record.\n# Monitoring - keeping track of data quality over time and reporting variations in the quality of data. Software can also auto-correct the variations based on pre-defined business rules.\n# Batch and Real time - Once the data is initially cleansed (batch), companies often want to build the processes into enterprise applications to keep it clean.\n\nThere are several well-known authors and self-styled experts, with Larry English perhaps the most popular [[guru]]. In addition, [http://iaidq.org/ IQ International - the International Association for Information and Data Quality] was established in 2004 to provide a focal point for professionals and researchers in this field.\n\n[[ISO 8000]] is an international standard for data quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50798|title=ISO/TS 8000-1:2011 Data quality -- Part 1: Overview |publisher=International Organization for Standardization|access-date=8 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Data quality assurance==\nData quality assurance is the process of [[data profiling]] to discover inconsistencies and other anomalies in the data, as well as performing [[data cleansing]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/can-you-trust-quality-your-data|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081434/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/can-you-trust-quality-your-data|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-02-11|title=Can you trust the quality of your data?|publisher=spotlessdata.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edq.com/glossary/data-cleansing/|title=What is Data Cleansing? - Experian Data Quality|date=13 February 2015}}</ref> activities (e.g. removing [[outliers]], missing data interpolation) to improve the data quality.\n\nThese activities can be undertaken as part of [[data warehousing]] or as part of the [[database administration]] of an existing piece of [[application software]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://globletrainings.com/watch-video-tutorial-data-warehousing-lecture-23-download/|title=Lecture 23 Data Quality Concepts Tutorial \u2013 Data Warehousing|publisher=Watch Free Video Training Online|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221155208/http://globletrainings.com/watch-video-tutorial-data-warehousing-lecture-23-download/|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Data quality control==\n'''Data quality control''' is the process of controlling the usage of data for an application or a process. This process is performed both before and after a Data [[Quality Assurance]] (QA) process, which consists of discovery of data inconsistency and correction.\n\nBefore:\n* Restricts inputs\n\nAfter QA process the following statistics are gathered to guide the [[Analytical quality control|Quality Control]] (QC) process:\n* Severity of inconsistency\n* Incompleteness\n* Accuracy\n* Precision\n* Missing / Unknown\n\nThe Data QC process uses the information from the QA process to decide to use the data for analysis or in an application or business process. General example: if a Data QC process finds that the data contains too many errors or inconsistencies, then it prevents that data from being used for its intended process which could cause disruption. Specific example: providing invalid measurements from several sensors to the automatic pilot feature on an aircraft could cause it to crash. Thus, establishing a QC process provides data usage protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Optimum use of data quality==\n\nData Quality (DQ) is a niche area required for the integrity of the data management by covering gaps of data issues. This is one of the key functions that aid data governance by monitoring data to find exceptions undiscovered by current data management operations. Data Quality checks may be defined at attribute level to have full control on its remediation steps.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nDQ checks and business rules may easily overlap if an organization is not attentive of its DQ scope. Business teams should understand the DQ scope thoroughly in order to avoid overlap. Data quality checks are redundant if '''business logic''' covers the same functionality and fulfills the same purpose as DQ. The DQ scope of an organization should be defined in DQ strategy and well implemented. Some data quality checks may be translated into business rules after repeated instances of exceptions in the past.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nBelow are a few areas of data flows that may need perennial DQ checks:\n\n'''Completeness''' and '''precision''' DQ checks on all data may be performed at the point of entry for each mandatory attribute from each source system. Few attribute values are created way after the initial creation of the transaction; in such cases, administering these checks becomes tricky and should be done immediately after the defined event of that attribute's source and the transaction's other core attribute conditions are met.\n\nAll data having attributes referring to ''Reference Data'' in the organization may be validated against the set of well-defined valid values of Reference Data to discover new or discrepant values through the '''validity''' DQ check. Results may be used to update ''Reference Data'' administered under ''Master Data Management (MDM)''.\n\nAll data sourced from a ''third party'' to organization's internal teams may undergo '''accuracy''' (DQ) check against the third party data. These DQ check results are valuable when administered on data that made multiple hops after the point of entry of that data but before that data becomes authorized or stored for enterprise intelligence.\n\nAll data columns that refer to ''Master Data'' may be validated for its '''consistency''' check. A DQ check administered on the data at the point of entry discovers new data for the MDM process, but a DQ check administered after the point of entry discovers the failure (not exceptions) of consistency.\n\nAs data transforms, multiple timestamps and the positions of that timestamps are captured and may be compared against each other and its leeway to validate its value, decay, operational significance against a defined SLA (service level agreement). This '''timeliness''' DQ check can be utilized to decrease data value decay rate and optimize the policies of data movement timeline.\n\nIn an organization complex logic is usually segregated into simpler logic across multiple processes. '''Reasonableness''' DQ checks on such complex logic yielding to a logical result within a specific range of values or static interrelationships (aggregated business rules) may be validated to discover complicated but crucial business processes and outliers of the data, its drift from BAU (business as usual) expectations, and may provide possible exceptions eventually resulting into data issues. This check may be a simple generic aggregation rule engulfed by large chunk of data or it can be a complicated logic on a group of attributes of a transaction pertaining to the core business of the organization. This DQ check requires high degree of business knowledge and acumen. Discovery of reasonableness issues may aid for policy and strategy changes by either business or data governance or both.\n\n'''Conformity''' checks and '''integrity checks''' need not covered in all business needs, it's strictly under the database architecture's discretion.\n\nThere are many places in the data movement where DQ checks may not be required. For instance, DQ check for completeness and precision on not\u2013null columns is redundant for the data sourced from database. Similarly, data should be validated for its accuracy with respect to time when the data is stitched across disparate sources. However, that is a business rule and should not be in the DQ scope.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nRegretfully, from a software development perspective, DQ is often seen as a nonfunctional requirement. And as such, key data quality checks/processes are not factored into the final software solution.

This was so that mail could be properly routed to its destination. The mainframes used business rules to correct common misspellings and typographical errors in name and address data, as well as to track customers who had moved, died, gone to prison, married, divorced, or experienced other life-changing events. Government agencies began to make postal data available to a few service companies to cross-reference customer data with the National Change of Address registry [[United States Postal Service|(NCOA)]]. This technology saved large companies millions of dollars in comparison to manual correction of customer data. Large companies saved on postage, as bills and direct marketing materials made their way to the intended customer more accurately. Initially sold as a service, data quality moved inside the walls of corporations, as low-cost and powerful server technology became available.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nCompanies with an emphasis on marketing often focused their quality efforts on name and address information, but data quality is recognized{{by whom|date=May 2015}} as an important property of all types of data. Principles of data quality can be applied to supply chain data, transactional data, and nearly every other category of data found. For example, making supply chain data conform to a certain standard has value to an organization by: 1) avoiding overstocking of similar but slightly different stock; 2) avoiding false stock-out; 3) improving the understanding of vendor purchases to negotiate volume discounts; and 4) avoiding logistics costs in stocking and shipping parts across a large organization.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFor companies with significant research efforts, data quality can include developing [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocols]] for research methods, reducing [[measurement error]], [[bounds checking]] of data, [[cross tabulation]], modeling and [[outlier]] detection, verifying [[data integrity]], etc.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Overview ==\nThere are a number of theoretical frameworks for understanding data quality. A systems-theoretical approach influenced by American pragmatism expands the definition of data quality to include information quality, and emphasizes the inclusiveness of the fundamental dimensions of accuracy and precision on the basis of the theory of science (Ivanov, 1972). One framework, dubbed \"Zero Defect Data\" (Hansen, 1991) adapts the principles of statistical process control to data quality. Another framework seeks to integrate the product perspective (conformance to specifications) and the [[Customer service|service]] perspective (meeting consumers' expectations) (Kahn et al. 2002). Another framework is based in [[semiotics]] to evaluate the quality of the form, meaning and use of the data (Price and Shanks, 2004). One highly theoretical approach analyzes the [[ontological]] nature of [[information systems]] to define data quality rigorously (Wand and Wang, 1996).\n\nA considerable amount of data quality research involves investigating and describing various categories of desirable attributes (or dimensions) of data. Nearly 200 such terms have been identified and there is little agreement in their nature (are these concepts, goals or criteria?), their definitions or measures (Wang et al., 1993). Software engineers may recognize this as a similar problem to \"[[List of system quality attributes|ilities]]\".\n\n[[MIT]] has a Total Data Quality Management program, led by Professor Richard Wang, which produces a large number of publications and hosts a significant international conference in this field (International Conference on Information Quality, ICIQ). This program grew out of the work done by Hansen on the \"Zero Defect Data\" framework (Hansen, 1991).\n\nIn practice, data quality is a concern for professionals involved with a wide range of information systems, ranging from [[data warehousing]] and [[business intelligence]] to [[customer relationship management]] and [[supply chain management]]. One industry study estimated the total cost to the U.S. economy of data quality problems at over U.S. $600 billion per annum (Eckerson, 2002). Incorrect data \u2013 which includes invalid and outdated information \u2013 can originate from different data sources \u2013 through data entry, or [[data migration]] and conversion projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-management.com/issues/20060801/1060128-1.html|title=Liability and Leverage - A Case for Data Quality|publisher=Information Management|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the USPS and PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report stating that 23.6 percent of all U.S. mail sent is incorrectly addressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=509|title=Address Management for Mail-Order and Retail|publisher=Directions Magazine|access-date=2010-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428233613/http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=509|archive-date=2005-04-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOne reason contact data becomes stale very quickly in the average database \u2013 more than 45 million Americans change their address every year.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ribbs.usps.gov/move_update/documents/tech_guides/PUB363.pdf | title=USPS &#124; PostalPro}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, the problem is such a concern that companies are beginning to set up a [[data governance]] team whose sole role in the corporation is to be responsible for data quality. In some{{Who|date=June 2012}} organizations, this [[data governance]] function has been established as part of a larger Regulatory Compliance function - a recognition of the importance of Data/Information Quality to organizations.\n\nProblems with data quality don't only arise from ''incorrect'' data; ''inconsistent'' data is a problem as well. Eliminating [[shadow system|data shadow systems]] and centralizing data in a warehouse is one of the initiatives a company can take to ensure data consistency.\n\nEnterprises, scientists, and researchers are starting to participate within data curation communities to improve the quality of their common data.<ref>E. Curry, A. Freitas, and S. O'Ri\u00e1in, [http://3roundstones.com/led_book/led-curry-et-al.html \"The Role of Community-Driven Data Curation for Enterprises\"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123161104/http://3roundstones.com/led_book/led-curry-et-al.html |date=2012-01-23 }} in ''Linking Enterprise Data'', D. Wood, Ed. Boston, Mass.: Springer US, 2010, pp. 25-47.</ref>\n\nThe market is going some way to providing data quality assurance. A number of vendors make tools for analyzing and repairing poor quality data ''in situ'', service providers can clean the data on a contract basis and consultants can advise on fixing processes or systems to avoid data quality problems in the first place. Most data quality tools offer a series of tools for improving data, which may include some or all of the following:\n\n# [[Data profiling]] - initially assessing the data to understand its current state, often including value distributions\n# Data standardization - a [[business rules engine]] that ensures that data conforms to standards \n# Geocoding - for name and address data. Corrects data to U.S. and Worldwide geographic standards\n# [[Record linkage|Matching or Linking]] - a way to compare data so that similar, but slightly different records can be aligned. Matching may use \"fuzzy logic\" to find duplicates in the data. It often recognizes that \"Bob\" and \"Bbo\" may be the same individual. It might be able to manage \"householding\", or finding links between spouses at the same address, for example. Finally, it often can build a \"best of breed\" record, taking the best components from multiple data sources and building a single super-record.\n# Monitoring - keeping track of data quality over time and reporting variations in the quality of data. Software can also auto-correct the variations based on pre-defined business rules.\n# Batch and Real time - Once the data is initially cleansed (batch), companies often want to build the processes into enterprise applications to keep it clean.\n\nThere are several well-known authors and self-styled experts, with Larry English perhaps the most popular [[guru]]. In addition, [http://iaidq.org/ IQ International - the International Association for Information and Data Quality] was established in 2004 to provide a focal point for professionals and researchers in this field.\n\n[[ISO 8000]] is an international standard for data quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50798|title=ISO/TS 8000-1:2011 Data quality -- Part 1: Overview |publisher=International Organization for Standardization|access-date=8 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Data quality assurance==\nData quality assurance is the process of [[data profiling]] to discover inconsistencies and other anomalies in the data, as well as performing [[data cleansing]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/can-you-trust-quality-your-data|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081434/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/can-you-trust-quality-your-data|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-02-11|title=Can you trust the quality of your data?|publisher=spotlessdata.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edq.com/glossary/data-cleansing/|title=What is Data Cleansing? - Experian Data Quality|date=13 February 2015}}</ref> activities (e.g. removing [[outliers]], missing data interpolation) to improve the data quality.\n\nThese activities can be undertaken as part of [[data warehousing]] or as part of the [[database administration]] of an existing piece of [[application software]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://globletrainings.com/watch-video-tutorial-data-warehousing-lecture-23-download/|title=Lecture 23 Data Quality Concepts Tutorial \u2013 Data Warehousing|publisher=Watch Free Video Training Online|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221155208/http://globletrainings.com/watch-video-tutorial-data-warehousing-lecture-23-download/|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Data quality control==\n'''Data quality control''' is the process of controlling the usage of data for an application or a process. This process is performed both before and after a Data [[Quality Assurance]] (QA) process, which consists of discovery of data inconsistency and correction.\n\nBefore:\n* Restricts inputs\n\nAfter QA process the following statistics are gathered to guide the [[Analytical quality control|Quality Control]] (QC) process:\n* Severity of inconsistency\n* Incompleteness\n* Accuracy\n* Precision\n* Missing / Unknown\n\nThe Data QC process uses the information from the QA process to decide to use the data for analysis or in an application or business process. General example: if a Data QC process finds that the data contains too many errors or inconsistencies, then it prevents that data from being used for its intended process which could cause disruption. Specific example: providing invalid measurements from several sensors to the automatic pilot feature on an aircraft could cause it to crash. Thus, establishing a QC process provides data usage protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Optimum use of data quality==\n\nData Quality (DQ) is a niche area required for the integrity of the data management by covering gaps of data issues. This is one of the key functions that aid data governance by monitoring data to find exceptions undiscovered by current data management operations. Data Quality checks may be defined at attribute level to have full control on its remediation steps.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nDQ checks and business rules may easily overlap if an organization is not attentive of its DQ scope. Business teams should understand the DQ scope thoroughly in order to avoid overlap. Data quality checks are redundant if '''business logic''' covers the same functionality and fulfills the same purpose as DQ. The DQ scope of an organization should be defined in DQ strategy and well implemented. Some data quality checks may be translated into business rules after repeated instances of exceptions in the past.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nBelow are a few areas of data flows that may need perennial DQ checks:\n\n'''Completeness''' and '''precision''' DQ checks on all data may be performed at the point of entry for each mandatory attribute from each source system. Few attribute values are created way after the initial creation of the transaction; in such cases, administering these checks becomes tricky and should be done immediately after the defined event of that attribute's source and the transaction's other core attribute conditions are met.\n\nAll data having attributes referring to ''Reference Data'' in the organization may be validated against the set of well-defined valid values of Reference Data to discover new or discrepant values through the '''validity''' DQ check. Results may be used to update ''Reference Data'' administered under ''Master Data Management (MDM)''.\n\nAll data sourced from a ''third party'' to organization's internal teams may undergo '''accuracy''' (DQ) check against the third party data. These DQ check results are valuable when administered on data that made multiple hops after the point of entry of that data but before that data becomes authorized or stored for enterprise intelligence.\n\nAll data columns that refer to ''Master Data'' may be validated for its '''consistency''' check. A DQ check administered on the data at the point of entry discovers new data for the MDM process, but a DQ check administered after the point of entry discovers the failure (not exceptions) of consistency.\n\nAs data transforms, multiple timestamps and the positions of that timestamps are captured and may be compared against each other and its leeway to validate its value, decay, operational significance against a defined SLA (service level agreement). This '''timeliness''' DQ check can be utilized to decrease data value decay rate and optimize the policies of data movement timeline.\n\nIn an organization complex logic is usually segregated into simpler logic across multiple processes. '''Reasonableness''' DQ checks on such complex logic yielding to a logical result within a specific range of values or static interrelationships (aggregated business rules) may be validated to discover complicated but crucial business processes and outliers of the data, its drift from BAU (business as usual) expectations, and may provide possible exceptions eventually resulting into data issues. This check may be a simple generic aggregation rule engulfed by large chunk of data or it can be a complicated logic on a group of attributes of a transaction pertaining to the core business of the organization. This DQ check requires high degree of business knowledge and acumen. Discovery of reasonableness issues may aid for policy and strategy changes by either business or data governance or both.\n\n'''Conformity''' checks and '''integrity checks''' need not covered in all business needs, it's strictly under the database architecture's discretion.\n\nThere are many places in the data movement where DQ checks may not be required. For instance, DQ check for completeness and precision on not\u2013null columns is redundant for the data sourced from database. Similarly, data should be validated for its accuracy with respect to time when the data is stitched across disparate sources. However, that is a business rule and should not be in the DQ scope.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nRegretfully, from a software development perspective, DQ is often seen as a nonfunctional requirement. And as such, key data quality checks/processes are not factored into the final software solution.

They were directly associated with human hunting camps in Europe over 30,000 years ago and it is proposed that these were domesticated. They are further proposed to be either a proto-dog and the ancestor of the [[domestic dog]] or an extinct, morphologically and [[Genetic divergence|genetically divergent]] wolf population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOne authority has classified the Paleolithic dog as ''Canis c.f. familiaris''<ref name=bocherens2015/> (where [[Open nomenclature#Usage of open nomenclature|c.f.]] is a [[Latin]] term meaning uncertain, as in ''Canis'' believed to be ''familiaris''). Previously in 1969, a study of ancient mammoth-bone dwellings at the [[Mezine]] paleolithic site in the [[Chernihiv Oblast|Chernigov region]], [[Ukraine]] uncovered 3 possibly domesticated \"short-faced wolves\".<ref name=pidoplichko1969/><ref name=olsen2000/> The specimens were classified as ''Canis lupus domesticus'' (domesticated wolf).<ref name=olsen2000/><ref name=pidoplichko1998/>\n\n==Naming==\nIn 2002, a study looked at 2 fossil skulls of large canids dated at 16,945 [[years before present]] (YBP) that had been found buried 2 metres and 7 metres from what was once a mammoth-bone hut at the [[Upper Paleolithic]] site of Eliseevichi-1 in the [[Bryansk]] region of central Russia, and using an accepted morphologically-based definition of domestication declared them to be \"[[Ice Age]] dogs\".<ref name=sablin2002/> In 2009, another study looked at these 2 early dog skulls in comparison to other much earlier but morphologically similar fossil skulls that had been found across Europe and concluded that the earlier specimens were \"Paleolithic dogs\", which were morphologically and genetically distinct from [[Origin of the domestic dog#Paleobiogeography|Pleistocene wolves]] that lived in Europe at that time.<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]\n\nThe Paleolithic dog was smaller than the Pleistocene wolf ''(Canis c.f. lupus)''<ref name=bocherens2015/> and the extant [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), with a skull size that indicates a dog similar in size to the modern large dog breeds. The Paleolithic dog had a mean body mass of {{convert|36-37|kg|lb|abbr=on}} compared to Pleistocene wolf {{convert|42-44|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and recent European wolf {{convert|41-42|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\nThe earliest sign of domestication in dogs was thought to be the [[neoteny|neotenization]] of skull morphology<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/><ref name=morey1992/> and the shortening of snout length. This leads to tooth crowding, a reduction in tooth size and the number of teeth,<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=turnbull1974/> which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/>\n\nCompared with the Pleistocene and modern wolves, the Paleolithic dog had a shorter skull length, a shorter [[Facial skeleton|viscerocranium]] (face) length, and a wider snout.<ref name=germonpre2009/> It had a wider [[palate]] and wider braincase,<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=morey1992/> relatively short and massive jaws, and a shorter [[carnassial]] length but these were larger than the modern dog and closer to those of the wolf. The [[mandible]] of the Paleolithic dog was more massive compared to the elongated mandible of the wolves and had more crowded [[premolars]], and a hook-like extension in the caudal border of the [[coronoid process of the mandible]]. The snout width was greater than those of both the Pleistocene and modern wolves, and implies well-developed carnassials driven by powerful jaws. In two [[Morphometrics|morphometric analyses]], the nearest dog skull-shape that was similar to the Paleolithic dog was that of the [[Central Asian Shepherd Dog]].<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\n==Diet==\nIn 2015, a study of bone [[collagen]] taken from a number of species found at the 30,000 YBP mammoth-hut site of [[P\u0159edmost\u00ed u P\u0159erova (archeology)|Predmosti]] in the Czech Republic indicted that the Pleistocene wolf ate [[horse]] and possibly mammoth, the Paleolithic dog ate [[reindeer]] and [[muskox]], and the humans ate specifically [[mammoth]]. The study proposes that the Paleolithic dog's diet had been artificially restricted because it was not a diet similar to the Pleistocene wolf. Some remote Arctic tribal people today restrict the diet of their dogs away from what those people prefer to eat.<ref name=bocherens2015/> An analysis of a specimen from the Eliseevichi-1 site on the Russian plain also revealed that the Paleolithic dog ate reindeer.<ref name=bocherens2015b/>\n\nIn 2020, a study of dental microwear on tooth enamel for canine specimens from Predmosti dated 28,500 YBP suggest a higher bone consumption for the proto-dogs compared with wolf specimens. This indicates two morphologically and behaviourally different canine types. The study proposes that the proto-dogs consumed more bone along with other less desirable food scraps within human camps, therefore this may be evidence of early dog domestication.<ref name=Prassack2020/>\n\n==Archaeological evidence==\n\n:''See further [[Megafaunal wolf#Paleoecology|Paleoecology of the time]]''\n\n====Early dog specimens====\nThere are a number of recently discovered specimens which are proposed as being Paleolithic dogs, however their taxonomy is debated. These have been found in either Europe or Siberia and date 40,000-17,000 YBP. They include [[Hohle Fels]] in Germany, [[Goyet Caves]] in Belgium, [[P\u0159edmost\u00ed u P\u0159erova (archeology)|Predmosti]] in the Czech Republic, and four sites in Russia: Razboinichya Cave in the [[Altai Republic]], [[Kostyonki-Borshchyovo archaeological complex|Kostyonki-8]], Ulakhan Sular in the [[Sakha Republic]], and Eliseevichi 1 on the Russian plain. Paw-prints from [[Chauvet Cave]] in France dated 26,000 YBP are suggested as being those of a dog, however these have been challenged as being left by a wolf.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[File:Chauvet\u00b4s cave horses.jpg|thumb|[[Chauvet cave]] artistic depiction of horses dated 30,000 years ago]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Paleolithic dog specimens (taxonomy debated)<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n! scope=\"col\" | Years [[Before Present|BP]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Finding\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 40,000-35,000\n| [[Hohle Fels]], [[Schelklingen]], Germany\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 36,500\n| [[Goyet Caves]], Mozet, Belgium \n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 33,500\n| Razboinichya Cave, [[Altai Mountains]], Central Asia\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 33,500-26,500\n| [[Kostyonki-Borshchyovo archaeological complex]], Voronezh, Russia \n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31,000\n| [[P\u0159edmost\u00ed u P\u0159erova (archeology)|Predmost\u00ed]], Moravia, Czech Republic\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 26,000\n| [[Chauvet Cave]], [[Vallon-Pont-d'Arc]], France \n| Paw-prints\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 17,200\n| Ulakhan Sular, northern [[Yakutia]], Siberia \n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 17,000-16,000\n| Eliseevichi-I site, [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk Region]], Russian Plain, Russia\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n|}\n\nThere are also a number of later proposed Paleolithic dogs whose taxonomy has not been confirmed. These include a number of specimens from Germany (Kniegrotte, Oelknitz, [[Devil's Bridge|Teufelsbrucke]]), Switzerland (Monruz, Kesslerloch, Champre-veyres-Hauterive), and Ukraine ([[Mezine|Mezin]], [[Mezhyrich|Mezhirich]]). A set of specimens dating 15,000-13,500 YBP have been confidently identified as domesticated dogs, based on their morphology and the archaeological sites in which they have been found. These include Spain (Erralla), France ([[Montespan]], Le Morin, Le Closeau, Pont d\u2019Ambon), and Germany ([[Oberkassel, Bonn|Bonn-Oberkassel]]).

There exists two schools of thought.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/> The early domestication theory argues that the relationship commenced once humans moved into the colder parts of Eurasia around 35,000 YBP, which is when the proposed Paleolithic dogs first began to appear.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=germonpre2012/><ref name=shipman2015p167/> Wolves that were adjusting to live with humans may have developed shorter, wider skulls and more steeply-rising foreheads that would make wolf facial expressions easier to interpret.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/> The late domestication theory argues that Paleolithic dogs are an unusual phenotype of wolf and that dogs appeared only when they could be phenotypically distinguishable from the wolf, which is usually based on a reduction in size.<ref name=crockford2012/><ref name=boudadi2014/><ref name=morey2014/><ref name=drake2015/><ref name=morey2015/> This argument maintains that domesticated dogs are more clearly identified when they are associated with human occupation, and those interred side by side with human remains provide the most conclusive evidence,<ref name=boudadi2014/> commencing with the 14,200 years old [[Origin of the domestic dog#Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog|Bonn-Oberkassel dog]].\n\nThe debate centres around ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and if they had entered into cooperation with wolves soon after they moved into Eurasia, and if so when and where did these wolves change into domesticated dogs. In arguing that domestication leads to reduction in size, the late domestication theory ignores that modern horses and pigs are larger than their wild ancestors. It also ignores that if hunter-gathers entered into a hunting relationship with wolves then there would be no need of selection for a reduction in size. A reduction in size would have occurred much later when humans moved into agricultural villages. The late domestication theory does not consider the possibility that humans may have formed a relationship with non-domesticated wolves and that dogs in the early stages of domestication might be indistinguishable from wolves. According to indigenous North Americans, over the past 20,000 years the canids living with them were wolves that could not be distinguished as dogs.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/>\n\nThe problem in attempting to identify when and where domestication occurred is the possibility that the process of domestication occurred in a number of places and at a number of times throughout prehistory.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/> Early dog remains have been found in different parts of the world. This suggests that dog domestication may have taken place in different regions independently by hunter-gatherers, in some cases at the same time<ref name=derr2011p51/> and in other cases at different times,<ref name=spotte2012/> with different wolf subspecies producing different dog lineages.<ref name=morey1994/><ref name=spotte2012/> Therefore, the number of dog domestication events is not known.<ref name=morey2010/> A study of the maternal [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mDNA) shows that dogs fall within 4 mDNA [[clades]],<ref name=thalmann2013/> indicating that dogs are derived from 4 separate lineages and therefore there may not have been a single domestication event.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/>\n\n==Relationship to the domestic dog==\n{{main|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n\nIn 2013, a major [[Mitochondrial DNA]] study has found that divergence times from wolf to dog implies a European origin of the domestic dog dating 18,800-32,100 years ago, which supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and occurred in the context of European hunter-gatherer cultures.<ref name=thalmann2013/>\n\nIn 2009, a study proposed that there was a low frequency of recognized dog skulls in Upper Paleolithic sites because existing specimens had not yet been recognized as dogs. The study looked at the 2 Eliseevichi-1 dog skulls in comparison to much earlier [[Late Pleistocene]] but morphologically similar fossil skulls that had been found across Europe, and proposed the much earlier specimens were Paleolithic dogs that were morphologically and genetically distinct from the Pleistocene wolves living in Europe at that time. The study looked at 117 skulls of recent and fossil large canids. Several skulls of fossil large canids from sites in Belgium, the Ukraine and Russia were examined using [[multivariate analysis]] to look for evidence of the presence of Paleolithic dogs that were separate from Pleistocene wolves. Reference groups included the Eliseevichi-1 prehistoric dogs, recent dogs and wolves. The [[Osteometric points|osteometric analysis]] of the skulls indicated that the Paleolithic dogs fell outside the skull ranges of the Pleistocene wolf group and the modern wolf group, and were closer related to those of the Eliseevichi-1 prehistoric dog group. The fossil large canid from [[Goyet]], Belgium dated at 36,000 YBP was clearly different from the recent wolves, resembling most closely the Eliseevichi-1 prehistoric dogs and suggesting that dog domestication had already started during the [[Aurignacian]]. The two [[Epigravettian]] Mezine, Ukraine and Mezhirich, Ukraine skulls were also identified as being Paleolithic dogs. [[Collagen]] analysis indicated that the Paleolithic dogs associated with human hunter-gatherer camp-sites (Eliseevichi-1, Mezine and Mezhirich) had been specifically eating reindeer, while other predator species in those locations and times had eaten a range of prey.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=shipman2011/>\n\nFurther studies later looked at wolf-like fossils from Paleolithic hunter-gatherer sites across Europe and proposed to have identified Paleolithic dogs at [[Cro-Magnon#P\u0159edmost\u00ed|Predmosti]] (Czech Republic 26,000-27,000 YBP), [[Kostyonki, Voronezh Oblast|Kostenki-8]] (Russia 23,000-27,700 YBP), Kostenki-1 (Russia 22,000-24,000 BP), Kostenki-17 (Russia [[Upper Paleolithic]]) and Verholenskaya (Russia late glacial).<ref name=germonpre2014/> In the human burial zone at the Predmosti site, 3 Paleolithic skulls were found that resemble those of a [[Siberian husky]] but they were larger and heavier than the modern husky. For one skull, \"a large bone fragment is present between the upper and lower incisors that extends several centimetres into the mouth cavity. The size, thickness and shape of the fragment suggest that it could be a fragment of a bone of a large mammal, probably from a mammoth. The position of the bone fragment in the mouth and the articulated state of the lower jaw with the skull indicate that this mammoth bone fragment was inserted artificially into the mouth of the dog post-mortem.\" The morphology of some wolf-like fossils was such that they could not be assigned to either the Pleistocene wolf nor Paleolithic dog groups.<ref name=germonpre2012/>\n\nIt has been proposed that based on the genetic evidence of modern dogs being traced to the ancient wolves of Europe, the archaeological evidence of the Paleolithic dog remains being found at known European hunting camp-sites, their morphology, and [[collagen]] analysis that indicated that their diet had been artificially restricted compared to nearby wolves, that the Paleolithic dog was domesticated. It has also been hypothesized that the Paleolithic dog may have provided the stock from which early dogs arose, or alternatively that they are a type of wolf that is not known to science.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=shipman2011/> In 2016, a study discounted the use of the Paleolithic dogs from the Predmosti site as pack animals.<ref name=germonpre2016/>\n\nThere has been ongoing debate in the scientific press about what the fossil remains of the Paleolithic dog might be, with some commenters declaring them as either wolves or a unique form of wolf. These include a first article proposing the Paleolithic dog,<ref name=germonpre2009/> its refutation,<ref name=crockford2012/> a counter to the refutation,<ref name=germonpre2013/> a second article,<ref name=germonpre2012/> its refutation,<ref name=boudadi2014/> a third article that includes a counter to the refutation,<ref name=germonpre2014/> its refutation,<ref name=morey2014/> a counter to the refutation,<ref name=germonpre2015/> another refutation,<ref name=drake2015/><ref name=morey2015/> support given based on bone collagen analysis,<ref name=bocherens2015/> and the identification of an ancient paleolithic dog in [[Yakutia]].<ref name=germonpre2017/>\n\nAs the ancestor of the dog has not been identified by scientists, this debate continues.\n\n==Two domestication events==\nStudies have suggested that it was possible for multiple primitive forms of the dog to have existed, including in Europe.<ref name=wang2015/> European dog populations had undergone extensive turnover during the last 15,000 years that has erased the genomic signature of early European dogs,<ref name=shannon2015/><ref name=malmstrom2008/> the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture,<ref name=larson2012/> and there was the possibility of past domestication events that had died out or had been largely replaced by more modern dog populations.<ref name=shannon2015/>\n\nIn 2016, a study proposed that dogs may have been domesticated separately in both Eastern and Western Eurasia from two genetically distinct and now extinct wolf populations. East Eurasian dogs then made their way with migrating people to Western Europe between 14,000-6,400 YBP where they partially replaced the dogs of Europe.<ref name=frantz2016/> Two domestication events in Western Eurasia and Eastern Eurasia has recently been found for the domestic pig.<ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=frantz2015/>\n\nAs the taxonomic classification of the \"proto-dog\" Paleolithic dogs as being either dogs or wolves remains controversial, they were excluded from the study.<ref name=frantz2016/>\n\n===Goyet dog===\n:''Genus Canis, species indeterminate''\n\n[[File:Goyet cave canid skull full.png|thumb|Artist's redition of the Goyet dog]]\n\nIn 2009, a study looked at 117 skulls of recent and fossil large canids. None of the 10 canid skulls from the Belgian caves of [[Goyet cave|Goyet]], Trou du Frontel, Trou de Nutons, and Trou de Chaleux could be classified, so the team took as their basic assumption that all of these canid samples were wolves.<ref name=shipman2011/> The DNA sequence of seven of the skulls indicated seven unique haplotypes that represented ancient wolf lineages lost until now. The [[osteometric]] analysis of the skulls showed that one large canid fossil from Goyet was clearly different from recent wolves, resembling most closely the Eliseevichi-1 dogs (15,000 years YBP) and so was identified as a Paleolithic dog.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=rbins2009/> The analysis indicated that the Belgian fossil large canids in general preyed on horse and large bovids.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=germonpre2012/>\n\nIn November 2013, a DNA study sequenced three haplotypes from the ancient Belgium canids (the Goyet dog - Belgium 36,000 YBP cataloged as ''Canis'' species [[Genbank]] [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession number]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KF661079 KF661079], and with Belgium 30,000 YBP [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KF661080 KF661080] and 26,000 years YBP [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KF661078 KF661078] cataloged as ''Canis lupus'') and found they formed the most diverging group. Although the cranial morphology of the Goyet dog has been interpreted as dog-like, its [[mitochondrial DNA]] relation to other canids places it as an ancient sister-group to all modern dogs and wolves rather than a direct ancestor. However, in 2015 three-dimensional [[Morphometrics#Landmark-based geometric morphometrics|geometric morphometric]] analyses indicated this, and the Eliseevichi-1 dog, is more likely from a wolf.<ref name=drake2015/><ref name=machugh2016/> Belgium 26,000 YBP has been found to be uniquely large but was found not to be related to the [[Beringian wolf]]. This Belgium canid clade may represent a phenotypically distinct and not previously recognized population of gray wolf, or the Goyet dog may represent an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs<ref name=thalmann2013/> as there was for domestic pigs.<ref name=frantz2015/> A 2016 review proposed that it most likely represents an extinct morphologically and genetically divergent wolf population.<ref name=machugh2016/>\n\n===Altai dog===\n:''Genus Canis, species indeterminate''\n[[File:Journal.pone.0022821.g001.png|thumb|33,000-year-old skull of a dog-like canid found in the Altai Mountains. It has no direct descendants today.]]\n\nIn 2011, a study looked at the well-preserved 33,000-year-old skull and left [[mandible]] of a dog-like canid that was excavated from Razboinichya Cave in the [[Altai Mountains]] of southern Siberia (Central Asia). The morphology was compared to the skulls and mandibles of large Pleistocene wolves from Predmosti, [[Czech Republic]], dated 31,000 YBP, modern wolves from Europe and North America, and prehistoric [[Greenland]] dogs from the Thule period (1,000 YBP or later) to represent large-sized but unimproved fully domestic dogs. \"The Razboinichya Cave cranium is virtually identical in size and shape to prehistoric Greenland dogs\" and not the ancient nor modern wolves. However, the lower [[carnassial]] tooth fell within the lower range of values for prehistoric wolves and was only slightly smaller than modern European wolves, and the upper carnassial tooth fell within the range of modern wolves. \"We conclude, therefore, that this specimen may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication, i.e. an incipient dog, rather than an aberrant wolf... The Razboinichya Cave specimen appears to be an incipient dog...and probably represents wolf domestication disrupted by the climatic and cultural changes associated with the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]\".<ref name=ovodov2011/>\n\nIn 2007, a mtDNA analysis of extinct eastern [[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]] showed that two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated 30,000 YBP and 28,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP Altai dog had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves,<ref name=leonard2007/> indicating a common maternal ancestor. In 2013, a DNA study of the Altai dog deposited the sequence in [[GenBank]] with a classification of ''Canis lupus familiaris'' (dog). \"The analyses revealed that the unique haplotype of the Altai dog is more closely related to modern dogs and prehistoric New World canids than it is to contemporary wolves... This preliminary analysis affirms the conclusion that the Altai specimen is likely an ancient dog with shallow divergence from ancient wolves. These results suggest a more ancient history of the dog outside of the Middle East or East Asia.\" The haplotype groups closest to the Altai dog included such diverse breeds as the [[Tibetan mastiff]], [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], [[Chinese crested]], [[cocker spaniel]] and [[Siberian husky]].<ref name=druzhkova2013/>\n\nIn November 2013, a study looked at 18 fossil canids and compared these with the complete mitochondrial genome sequences from 49 modern wolves and 77 modern dogs. A more comprehensive analysis of the complete [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] found that the phylogenetic position of the Altai dog as being either dog or wolf was inconclusive and cataloged its sequence as ''Canis species'' [[GenBank]] [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession number]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JX173682 JX173682]. Of four tests, 2 tests showed its sequence to fall within the wolf clade and 2 tests within the dog clade. The sequence strongly suggests a position at the root of a clade uniting two ancient wolf genomes, two modern wolves, as well as two dogs of Scandinavian origin. However, the study does not support its recent common ancestry with the great majority of modern dogs. The study suggests that it may represent an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs<ref name=thalmann2013/> as there was for domestic pigs.<ref name=frantz2015/>\n\nIn 2017, two prominent evolutionary biologists reviewed all of the evidence available on dog divergence and supported the specimens from the Altai mountains as being those of dogs from a lineage that is now extinct and that was derived from a population of small wolves that is also now extinct.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\n{{Further|Beringian wolf}}\n\n==Local unknown wolves==\nEcological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence wolf [[population genetics|genetic population structure]] and cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]].<ref name=carmichael2001/><ref name=carmichael2006/><ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=hofreiter2010/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=perri2016/> Therefore, within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/>\n\nThere are a small number of ''Canis'' remains that have been found at Goyet Cave, Belgium (36,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2009/> Razboinichya Cave, Russia (33,500 YBP)<ref name=ovodov2011/> Kostenki 8, Russia (33,500-26,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2015/> Predmosti, Czech Republic (31,000 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2012/> and Eliseevichi-1, Russia (17,000 YBP).<ref name=sablin2002/> Based on cranial morphometric study of the characteristics thought to be associated with the domestication process, these have been proposed as early Paleolithic dogs.<ref name=germonpre2015/> These characteristics of shortened rostrum, tooth crowding, and absence or rotation of premolars have been documented in both ancient and modern wolves.<ref name=crockford2012/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=boudadi2010/><ref name=dimitrijevic2015/> Rather than representing early dogs, these specimens may represent an extinct morphologically and genetically divergent wolf population.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=larson2012/><ref name=perri2016/>\n\nHowever, regardless of it eventually proving to be either a proto-dog or an unknown species of wolf, the original proposal was that the \"Paleolithic dog\" was domesticated.<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=bocherens2015>{{cite journal|author=Bocherens, H|year=2015|title=Reconstruction of the Gravettian food-web at P\u0159edmost\u00ed I using multi-isotopic tracking (13C, 15N, 34S) of bone collagen| doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2014.09.044|volume=359\u2013360|journal=Quaternary International|pages=211\u2013228}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=bocherens2015b>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.03.018|title=Isotopic tracking of large carnivore palaeoecology in the mammoth steppe|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=117|pages=42\u201371|year=2015|last1=Bocherens|first1=Herv\u00e9}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=boudadi2010>Boudadi-Maligne, M., 2010.

They were directly associated with human hunting camps in Europe over 30,000 years ago and it is proposed that these were domesticated. They are further proposed to be either a proto-dog and the ancestor of the [[domestic dog]] or an extinct, morphologically and [[Genetic divergence|genetically divergent]] wolf population.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOne authority has classified the Paleolithic dog as ''Canis c.f. familiaris''<ref name=bocherens2015/> (where [[Open nomenclature#Usage of open nomenclature|c.f.]] is a [[Latin]] term meaning uncertain, as in ''Canis'' believed to be ''familiaris''). Previously in 1969, a study of ancient mammoth-bone dwellings at the [[Mezine]] paleolithic site in the [[Chernihiv Oblast|Chernigov region]], [[Ukraine]] uncovered 3 possibly domesticated \"short-faced wolves\".<ref name=pidoplichko1969/><ref name=olsen2000/> The specimens were classified as ''Canis lupus domesticus'' (domesticated wolf).<ref name=olsen2000/><ref name=pidoplichko1998/>\n\n==Naming==\nIn 2002, a study looked at 2 fossil skulls of large canids dated at 16,945 [[years before present]] (YBP) that had been found buried 2 metres and 7 metres from what was once a mammoth-bone hut at the [[Upper Paleolithic]] site of Eliseevichi-1 in the [[Bryansk]] region of central Russia, and using an accepted morphologically-based definition of domestication declared them to be \"[[Ice Age]] dogs\".<ref name=sablin2002/> In 2009, another study looked at these 2 early dog skulls in comparison to other much earlier but morphologically similar fossil skulls that had been found across Europe and concluded that the earlier specimens were \"Paleolithic dogs\", which were morphologically and genetically distinct from [[Origin of the domestic dog#Paleobiogeography|Pleistocene wolves]] that lived in Europe at that time.<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]\n\nThe Paleolithic dog was smaller than the Pleistocene wolf ''(Canis c.f. lupus)''<ref name=bocherens2015/> and the extant [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), with a skull size that indicates a dog similar in size to the modern large dog breeds. The Paleolithic dog had a mean body mass of {{convert|36-37|kg|lb|abbr=on}} compared to Pleistocene wolf {{convert|42-44|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and recent European wolf {{convert|41-42|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\nThe earliest sign of domestication in dogs was thought to be the [[neoteny|neotenization]] of skull morphology<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/><ref name=morey1992/> and the shortening of snout length. This leads to tooth crowding, a reduction in tooth size and the number of teeth,<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=turnbull1974/> which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/>\n\nCompared with the Pleistocene and modern wolves, the Paleolithic dog had a shorter skull length, a shorter [[Facial skeleton|viscerocranium]] (face) length, and a wider snout.<ref name=germonpre2009/> It had a wider [[palate]] and wider braincase,<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=morey1992/> relatively short and massive jaws, and a shorter [[carnassial]] length but these were larger than the modern dog and closer to those of the wolf. The [[mandible]] of the Paleolithic dog was more massive compared to the elongated mandible of the wolves and had more crowded [[premolars]], and a hook-like extension in the caudal border of the [[coronoid process of the mandible]]. The snout width was greater than those of both the Pleistocene and modern wolves, and implies well-developed carnassials driven by powerful jaws. In two [[Morphometrics|morphometric analyses]], the nearest dog skull-shape that was similar to the Paleolithic dog was that of the [[Central Asian Shepherd Dog]].<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\n==Diet==\nIn 2015, a study of bone [[collagen]] taken from a number of species found at the 30,000 YBP mammoth-hut site of [[P\u0159edmost\u00ed u P\u0159erova (archeology)|Predmosti]] in the Czech Republic indicted that the Pleistocene wolf ate [[horse]] and possibly mammoth, the Paleolithic dog ate [[reindeer]] and [[muskox]], and the humans ate specifically [[mammoth]]. The study proposes that the Paleolithic dog's diet had been artificially restricted because it was not a diet similar to the Pleistocene wolf. Some remote Arctic tribal people today restrict the diet of their dogs away from what those people prefer to eat.<ref name=bocherens2015/> An analysis of a specimen from the Eliseevichi-1 site on the Russian plain also revealed that the Paleolithic dog ate reindeer.<ref name=bocherens2015b/>\n\nIn 2020, a study of dental microwear on tooth enamel for canine specimens from Predmosti dated 28,500 YBP suggest a higher bone consumption for the proto-dogs compared with wolf specimens. This indicates two morphologically and behaviourally different canine types. The study proposes that the proto-dogs consumed more bone along with other less desirable food scraps within human camps, therefore this may be evidence of early dog domestication.<ref name=Prassack2020/>\n\n==Archaeological evidence==\n\n:''See further [[Megafaunal wolf#Paleoecology|Paleoecology of the time]]''\n\n====Early dog specimens====\nThere are a number of recently discovered specimens which are proposed as being Paleolithic dogs, however their taxonomy is debated. These have been found in either Europe or Siberia and date 40,000-17,000 YBP. They include [[Hohle Fels]] in Germany, [[Goyet Caves]] in Belgium, [[P\u0159edmost\u00ed u P\u0159erova (archeology)|Predmosti]] in the Czech Republic, and four sites in Russia: Razboinichya Cave in the [[Altai Republic]], [[Kostyonki-Borshchyovo archaeological complex|Kostyonki-8]], Ulakhan Sular in the [[Sakha Republic]], and Eliseevichi 1 on the Russian plain. Paw-prints from [[Chauvet Cave]] in France dated 26,000 YBP are suggested as being those of a dog, however these have been challenged as being left by a wolf.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[File:Chauvet\u00b4s cave horses.jpg|thumb|[[Chauvet cave]] artistic depiction of horses dated 30,000 years ago]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Paleolithic dog specimens (taxonomy debated)<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n! scope=\"col\" | Years [[Before Present|BP]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Finding\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 40,000-35,000\n| [[Hohle Fels]], [[Schelklingen]], Germany\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 36,500\n| [[Goyet Caves]], Mozet, Belgium \n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 33,500\n| Razboinichya Cave, [[Altai Mountains]], Central Asia\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 33,500-26,500\n| [[Kostyonki-Borshchyovo archaeological complex]], Voronezh, Russia \n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31,000\n| [[P\u0159edmost\u00ed u P\u0159erova (archeology)|Predmost\u00ed]], Moravia, Czech Republic\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 26,000\n| [[Chauvet Cave]], [[Vallon-Pont-d'Arc]], France \n| Paw-prints\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 17,200\n| Ulakhan Sular, northern [[Yakutia]], Siberia \n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 17,000-16,000\n| Eliseevichi-I site, [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk Region]], Russian Plain, Russia\n| Paleolithic dog\n|-\n|}\n\nThere are also a number of later proposed Paleolithic dogs whose taxonomy has not been confirmed. These include a number of specimens from Germany (Kniegrotte, Oelknitz, [[Devil's Bridge|Teufelsbrucke]]), Switzerland (Monruz, Kesslerloch, Champre-veyres-Hauterive), and Ukraine ([[Mezine|Mezin]], [[Mezhyrich|Mezhirich]]). A set of specimens dating 15,000-13,500 YBP have been confidently identified as domesticated dogs, based on their morphology and the archaeological sites in which they have been found. These include Spain (Erralla), France ([[Montespan]], Le Morin, Le Closeau, Pont d\u2019Ambon), and Germany ([[Oberkassel, Bonn|Bonn-Oberkassel]]).

There exists two schools of thought.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/> The early domestication theory argues that the relationship commenced once humans moved into the colder parts of Eurasia around 35,000 YBP, which is when the proposed Paleolithic dogs first began to appear.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=germonpre2012/><ref name=shipman2015p167/> Wolves that were adjusting to live with humans may have developed shorter, wider skulls and more steeply-rising foreheads that would make wolf facial expressions easier to interpret.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/> The late domestication theory argues that Paleolithic dogs are an unusual phenotype of wolf and that dogs appeared only when they could be phenotypically distinguishable from the wolf, which is usually based on a reduction in size.<ref name=crockford2012/><ref name=boudadi2014/><ref name=morey2014/><ref name=drake2015/><ref name=morey2015/> This argument maintains that domesticated dogs are more clearly identified when they are associated with human occupation, and those interred side by side with human remains provide the most conclusive evidence,<ref name=boudadi2014/> commencing with the 14,200 years old [[Origin of the domestic dog#Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog|Bonn-Oberkassel dog]].\n\nThe debate centres around ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and if they had entered into cooperation with wolves soon after they moved into Eurasia, and if so when and where did these wolves change into domesticated dogs. In arguing that domestication leads to reduction in size, the late domestication theory ignores that modern horses and pigs are larger than their wild ancestors. It also ignores that if hunter-gathers entered into a hunting relationship with wolves then there would be no need of selection for a reduction in size. A reduction in size would have occurred much later when humans moved into agricultural villages. The late domestication theory does not consider the possibility that humans may have formed a relationship with non-domesticated wolves and that dogs in the early stages of domestication might be indistinguishable from wolves. According to indigenous North Americans, over the past 20,000 years the canids living with them were wolves that could not be distinguished as dogs.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/>\n\nThe problem in attempting to identify when and where domestication occurred is the possibility that the process of domestication occurred in a number of places and at a number of times throughout prehistory.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/> Early dog remains have been found in different parts of the world. This suggests that dog domestication may have taken place in different regions independently by hunter-gatherers, in some cases at the same time<ref name=derr2011p51/> and in other cases at different times,<ref name=spotte2012/> with different wolf subspecies producing different dog lineages.<ref name=morey1994/><ref name=spotte2012/> Therefore, the number of dog domestication events is not known.<ref name=morey2010/> A study of the maternal [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mDNA) shows that dogs fall within 4 mDNA [[clades]],<ref name=thalmann2013/> indicating that dogs are derived from 4 separate lineages and therefore there may not have been a single domestication event.<ref name=pierotti2017p83/>\n\n==Relationship to the domestic dog==\n{{main|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n\nIn 2013, a major [[Mitochondrial DNA]] study has found that divergence times from wolf to dog implies a European origin of the domestic dog dating 18,800-32,100 years ago, which supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and occurred in the context of European hunter-gatherer cultures.<ref name=thalmann2013/>\n\nIn 2009, a study proposed that there was a low frequency of recognized dog skulls in Upper Paleolithic sites because existing specimens had not yet been recognized as dogs. The study looked at the 2 Eliseevichi-1 dog skulls in comparison to much earlier [[Late Pleistocene]] but morphologically similar fossil skulls that had been found across Europe, and proposed the much earlier specimens were Paleolithic dogs that were morphologically and genetically distinct from the Pleistocene wolves living in Europe at that time. The study looked at 117 skulls of recent and fossil large canids. Several skulls of fossil large canids from sites in Belgium, the Ukraine and Russia were examined using [[multivariate analysis]] to look for evidence of the presence of Paleolithic dogs that were separate from Pleistocene wolves. Reference groups included the Eliseevichi-1 prehistoric dogs, recent dogs and wolves. The [[Osteometric points|osteometric analysis]] of the skulls indicated that the Paleolithic dogs fell outside the skull ranges of the Pleistocene wolf group and the modern wolf group, and were closer related to those of the Eliseevichi-1 prehistoric dog group. The fossil large canid from [[Goyet]], Belgium dated at 36,000 YBP was clearly different from the recent wolves, resembling most closely the Eliseevichi-1 prehistoric dogs and suggesting that dog domestication had already started during the [[Aurignacian]]. The two [[Epigravettian]] Mezine, Ukraine and Mezhirich, Ukraine skulls were also identified as being Paleolithic dogs. [[Collagen]] analysis indicated that the Paleolithic dogs associated with human hunter-gatherer camp-sites (Eliseevichi-1, Mezine and Mezhirich) had been specifically eating reindeer, while other predator species in those locations and times had eaten a range of prey.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=shipman2011/>\n\nFurther studies later looked at wolf-like fossils from Paleolithic hunter-gatherer sites across Europe and proposed to have identified Paleolithic dogs at [[Cro-Magnon#P\u0159edmost\u00ed|Predmosti]] (Czech Republic 26,000-27,000 YBP), [[Kostyonki, Voronezh Oblast|Kostenki-8]] (Russia 23,000-27,700 YBP), Kostenki-1 (Russia 22,000-24,000 BP), Kostenki-17 (Russia [[Upper Paleolithic]]) and Verholenskaya (Russia late glacial).<ref name=germonpre2014/> In the human burial zone at the Predmosti site, 3 Paleolithic skulls were found that resemble those of a [[Siberian husky]] but they were larger and heavier than the modern husky. For one skull, \"a large bone fragment is present between the upper and lower incisors that extends several centimetres into the mouth cavity. The size, thickness and shape of the fragment suggest that it could be a fragment of a bone of a large mammal, probably from a mammoth. The position of the bone fragment in the mouth and the articulated state of the lower jaw with the skull indicate that this mammoth bone fragment was inserted artificially into the mouth of the dog post-mortem.\" The morphology of some wolf-like fossils was such that they could not be assigned to either the Pleistocene wolf nor Paleolithic dog groups.<ref name=germonpre2012/>\n\nIt has been proposed that based on the genetic evidence of modern dogs being traced to the ancient wolves of Europe, the archaeological evidence of the Paleolithic dog remains being found at known European hunting camp-sites, their morphology, and [[collagen]] analysis that indicated that their diet had been artificially restricted compared to nearby wolves, that the Paleolithic dog was domesticated. It has also been hypothesized that the Paleolithic dog may have provided the stock from which early dogs arose, or alternatively that they are a type of wolf that is not known to science.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=shipman2011/> In 2016, a study discounted the use of the Paleolithic dogs from the Predmosti site as pack animals.<ref name=germonpre2016/>\n\nThere has been ongoing debate in the scientific press about what the fossil remains of the Paleolithic dog might be, with some commenters declaring them as either wolves or a unique form of wolf. These include a first article proposing the Paleolithic dog,<ref name=germonpre2009/> its refutation,<ref name=crockford2012/> a counter to the refutation,<ref name=germonpre2013/> a second article,<ref name=germonpre2012/> its refutation,<ref name=boudadi2014/> a third article that includes a counter to the refutation,<ref name=germonpre2014/> its refutation,<ref name=morey2014/> a counter to the refutation,<ref name=germonpre2015/> another refutation,<ref name=drake2015/><ref name=morey2015/> support given based on bone collagen analysis,<ref name=bocherens2015/> and the identification of an ancient paleolithic dog in [[Yakutia]].<ref name=germonpre2017/>\n\nAs the ancestor of the dog has not been identified by scientists, this debate continues.\n\n==Two domestication events==\nStudies have suggested that it was possible for multiple primitive forms of the dog to have existed, including in Europe.<ref name=wang2015/> European dog populations had undergone extensive turnover during the last 15,000 years that has erased the genomic signature of early European dogs,<ref name=shannon2015/><ref name=malmstrom2008/> the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture,<ref name=larson2012/> and there was the possibility of past domestication events that had died out or had been largely replaced by more modern dog populations.<ref name=shannon2015/>\n\nIn 2016, a study proposed that dogs may have been domesticated separately in both Eastern and Western Eurasia from two genetically distinct and now extinct wolf populations. East Eurasian dogs then made their way with migrating people to Western Europe between 14,000-6,400 YBP where they partially replaced the dogs of Europe.<ref name=frantz2016/> Two domestication events in Western Eurasia and Eastern Eurasia has recently been found for the domestic pig.<ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=frantz2015/>\n\nAs the taxonomic classification of the \"proto-dog\" Paleolithic dogs as being either dogs or wolves remains controversial, they were excluded from the study.<ref name=frantz2016/>\n\n===Goyet dog===\n:''Genus Canis, species indeterminate''\n\n[[File:Goyet cave canid skull full.png|thumb|Artist's redition of the Goyet dog]]\n\nIn 2009, a study looked at 117 skulls of recent and fossil large canids. None of the 10 canid skulls from the Belgian caves of [[Goyet cave|Goyet]], Trou du Frontel, Trou de Nutons, and Trou de Chaleux could be classified, so the team took as their basic assumption that all of these canid samples were wolves.<ref name=shipman2011/> The DNA sequence of seven of the skulls indicated seven unique haplotypes that represented ancient wolf lineages lost until now. The [[osteometric]] analysis of the skulls showed that one large canid fossil from Goyet was clearly different from recent wolves, resembling most closely the Eliseevichi-1 dogs (15,000 years YBP) and so was identified as a Paleolithic dog.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=rbins2009/> The analysis indicated that the Belgian fossil large canids in general preyed on horse and large bovids.<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=germonpre2012/>\n\nIn November 2013, a DNA study sequenced three haplotypes from the ancient Belgium canids (the Goyet dog - Belgium 36,000 YBP cataloged as ''Canis'' species [[Genbank]] [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession number]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KF661079 KF661079], and with Belgium 30,000 YBP [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KF661080 KF661080] and 26,000 years YBP [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KF661078 KF661078] cataloged as ''Canis lupus'') and found they formed the most diverging group. Although the cranial morphology of the Goyet dog has been interpreted as dog-like, its [[mitochondrial DNA]] relation to other canids places it as an ancient sister-group to all modern dogs and wolves rather than a direct ancestor. However, in 2015 three-dimensional [[Morphometrics#Landmark-based geometric morphometrics|geometric morphometric]] analyses indicated this, and the Eliseevichi-1 dog, is more likely from a wolf.<ref name=drake2015/><ref name=machugh2016/> Belgium 26,000 YBP has been found to be uniquely large but was found not to be related to the [[Beringian wolf]]. This Belgium canid clade may represent a phenotypically distinct and not previously recognized population of gray wolf, or the Goyet dog may represent an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs<ref name=thalmann2013/> as there was for domestic pigs.<ref name=frantz2015/> A 2016 review proposed that it most likely represents an extinct morphologically and genetically divergent wolf population.<ref name=machugh2016/>\n\n===Altai dog===\n:''Genus Canis, species indeterminate''\n[[File:Journal.pone.0022821.g001.png|thumb|33,000-year-old skull of a dog-like canid found in the Altai Mountains. It has no direct descendants today.]]\n\nIn 2011, a study looked at the well-preserved 33,000-year-old skull and left [[mandible]] of a dog-like canid that was excavated from Razboinichya Cave in the [[Altai Mountains]] of southern Siberia (Central Asia). The morphology was compared to the skulls and mandibles of large Pleistocene wolves from Predmosti, [[Czech Republic]], dated 31,000 YBP, modern wolves from Europe and North America, and prehistoric [[Greenland]] dogs from the Thule period (1,000 YBP or later) to represent large-sized but unimproved fully domestic dogs. \"The Razboinichya Cave cranium is virtually identical in size and shape to prehistoric Greenland dogs\" and not the ancient nor modern wolves. However, the lower [[carnassial]] tooth fell within the lower range of values for prehistoric wolves and was only slightly smaller than modern European wolves, and the upper carnassial tooth fell within the range of modern wolves. \"We conclude, therefore, that this specimen may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication, i.e. an incipient dog, rather than an aberrant wolf... The Razboinichya Cave specimen appears to be an incipient dog...and probably represents wolf domestication disrupted by the climatic and cultural changes associated with the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]\".<ref name=ovodov2011/>\n\nIn 2007, a mtDNA analysis of extinct eastern [[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]] showed that two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated 30,000 YBP and 28,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP Altai dog had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves,<ref name=leonard2007/> indicating a common maternal ancestor. In 2013, a DNA study of the Altai dog deposited the sequence in [[GenBank]] with a classification of ''Canis lupus familiaris'' (dog). \"The analyses revealed that the unique haplotype of the Altai dog is more closely related to modern dogs and prehistoric New World canids than it is to contemporary wolves... This preliminary analysis affirms the conclusion that the Altai specimen is likely an ancient dog with shallow divergence from ancient wolves. These results suggest a more ancient history of the dog outside of the Middle East or East Asia.\" The haplotype groups closest to the Altai dog included such diverse breeds as the [[Tibetan mastiff]], [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], [[Chinese crested]], [[cocker spaniel]] and [[Siberian husky]].<ref name=druzhkova2013/>\n\nIn November 2013, a study looked at 18 fossil canids and compared these with the complete mitochondrial genome sequences from 49 modern wolves and 77 modern dogs. A more comprehensive analysis of the complete [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] found that the phylogenetic position of the Altai dog as being either dog or wolf was inconclusive and cataloged its sequence as ''Canis species'' [[GenBank]] [[Accession number (bioinformatics)|accession number]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JX173682 JX173682]. Of four tests, 2 tests showed its sequence to fall within the wolf clade and 2 tests within the dog clade. The sequence strongly suggests a position at the root of a clade uniting two ancient wolf genomes, two modern wolves, as well as two dogs of Scandinavian origin. However, the study does not support its recent common ancestry with the great majority of modern dogs. The study suggests that it may represent an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs<ref name=thalmann2013/> as there was for domestic pigs.<ref name=frantz2015/>\n\nIn 2017, two prominent evolutionary biologists reviewed all of the evidence available on dog divergence and supported the specimens from the Altai mountains as being those of dogs from a lineage that is now extinct and that was derived from a population of small wolves that is also now extinct.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\n{{Further|Beringian wolf}}\n\n==Local unknown wolves==\nEcological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence wolf [[population genetics|genetic population structure]] and cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]].<ref name=carmichael2001/><ref name=carmichael2006/><ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=hofreiter2010/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=perri2016/> Therefore, within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/>\n\nThere are a small number of ''Canis'' remains that have been found at Goyet Cave, Belgium (36,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2009/> Razboinichya Cave, Russia (33,500 YBP)<ref name=ovodov2011/> Kostenki 8, Russia (33,500-26,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2015/> Predmosti, Czech Republic (31,000 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2012/> and Eliseevichi-1, Russia (17,000 YBP).<ref name=sablin2002/> Based on cranial morphometric study of the characteristics thought to be associated with the domestication process, these have been proposed as early Paleolithic dogs.<ref name=germonpre2015/> These characteristics of shortened rostrum, tooth crowding, and absence or rotation of premolars have been documented in both ancient and modern wolves.<ref name=crockford2012/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=boudadi2010/><ref name=dimitrijevic2015/> Rather than representing early dogs, these specimens may represent an extinct morphologically and genetically divergent wolf population.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=larson2012/><ref name=perri2016/>\n\nHowever, regardless of it eventually proving to be either a proto-dog or an unknown species of wolf, the original proposal was that the \"Paleolithic dog\" was domesticated.<ref name=germonpre2009/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=bocherens2015>{{cite journal|author=Bocherens, H|year=2015|title=Reconstruction of the Gravettian food-web at P\u0159edmost\u00ed I using multi-isotopic tracking (13C, 15N, 34S) of bone collagen| doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2014.09.044|volume=359\u2013360|journal=Quaternary International|pages=211\u2013228}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=bocherens2015b>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.03.018|title=Isotopic tracking of large carnivore palaeoecology in the mammoth steppe|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=117|pages=42\u201371|year=2015|last1=Bocherens|first1=Herv\u00e9}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=boudadi2010>Boudadi-Maligne, M., 2010.

There are more than 50 discovered [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] settlements. The earliest civilization to inhabit the region were the [[Thracians]]. The remains of the Thracian town Besapara are located in the hills near the provincial capital Pazardzhik. The [[Panagyurishte Treasure]] unearthed near the northern town of the same name is known as one of the finest examples of Thracian art. The 6.164&nbsp;kg of 23-karat gold treasure which consists of nine vessels has been dated back to the 4th and 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC the region became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province and remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the fall of Rome.\n\nMost of the region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the beginning of the 9th century and remained in Bulgarian hands until the fall of the First Empire. With the rise of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] the region once again became part of the country until it was overran by the [[Ottomans]] in the late 14th century. Some of medieval fortresses are [[Tsepina]] near the village of [[Dorkovo]] and [[Krasen (fortress)|Krasen]] in the vicinities of [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]].\n\nThe [[April Uprising]] of 1876 against the Ottoman rule was widely supported within the region and the town of [[Panagyurishte]] became the center of the uprising. The Bulgarian population also rebelled to the south where the Ottoman atrocities culminated in the [[Batak massacre]]. According to the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878 the region was included in the autonomous region [[Eastern Rumelia]] which [[Unification of Bulgaria|united]] with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] on 6 September 1885.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oborishte127.JPG|left|thumb|The village of [[Oborishte]].]]\n\nThe Pazardzhik Province is situated in central part of southern Bulgaria and borders the provinces of [[Plovdiv Province|Plovdiv]], [[Smolyan Province|Smolyan]], [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad]] and [[Sofia Province|Sofia]]. The total area of the region is 4,458&nbsp;km\u00b2 which is 4% of the national territory. Forests account for more than half of the area (57.1%); the arable land is 35.6%, urban territory is 3.3%, rivers and lakes occupy 2.6%, road infrastructure - 0.6% and quarries and mines - 0,4%.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\n[[File:Panagyurishte-library.jpg|thumb|The [[chitalishte]] \"Videlina\" in [[Panagyurishte]].]]\nThe northern parts of the region include the middle ridges of the [[Sredna Gora]] mountain, to the south the relief flattens and forms the western-most parts of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]] and to the south are located the [[Rhodope Mountains]] where most of the forests are situated. The highest point of the region is Savov Vrah at an altitude of 2,306 m while the lowest altitude is around 200 m in the plains of the central area.<ref name=\"of\">[http://www.pz.government.bg/pz/fr_engl.html Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]</ref> The climate is transcontinental with milder winter than northern Bulgaria in the lowlands but with very low temperatures and high snowfall in the mountain areas. The average annual temperature is 11.3&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\nThe province is abundant in [[water resources]], its main [[waterway]] is the river [[Maritsa]] and its [[catchment basin]] includes the [[Topolnitsa River]] and [[Luda Yana River]] from the north and Stara Reka from the south. There are three main reservoirs all situated in the Rhodope Mountains within the municipal limits of [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]] - [[Batak Reservoir]], [[Golyam Beglik]] and [[Shiroka Polyana]]. A fourth large dam lake, the [[Dospat Reservoir]] is only partially in the region. In Sredna Gora to the north is [[Topolnitsa Reservoir]] shared with the Sofia Province and a dam near Panagyurishte which is in initial stages of construction.\n\n==Municipalities==\n[[Image:Pazardzik Oblast map.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of Pazardzik Province]]\nThe Pazardzik province (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, ''oblast'') contains 12 municipalities ({{lang-bg|\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430|translit=obshtina}} - plural: {{lang|bg|\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0438}}, {{transl|bg|obshtini}}).

The \"Batashki Vodnosilov Pat\" is an important hydrocomplex consisting of three hydro power plants- \"Batak\", \"Peshtera\" and \"Aleko\" with combined capacity of around 250 MW. Copper extracting industry is of national and European importance with major mines located around Panagyurishte (Asarel and Medet), [[Elshitsa]], [[Tsar Asen]] and [[Mina Radka]]. Machine building industry is developed in [[Pazardzhik]] (lead acid batteries), [[Panagyurishte]] (optical), [[Velingrad]]. There is flourishing pharmaceutical industry in [[Peshtera]] with more than 1 000 employees in the plant. Paper industry is developed in [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Timber industry is very important in the southern part of the region (the Rhodopes)- [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Peshtera]], [[Rakitovo]] and [[Velingrad]]. The manufacturing of textiles is well developed in [[Pazardzhik]], [[Panagyurishte]] and [[Velingrad]]. There is a huge footwear plant in [[Peshtera]]. Food processing industry is developed in most of the towns.\nAgriculture is also important, especially in the fertile central parts of the region. The most important crops are orchards (apples, plums and strawberries), grapes, wheat, barley, rye and rice.  Livestock breeding is relatively well developed in the mountainous areas.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:BatakChurch.JPG|thumb|left|A church in [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]].]]\nThe province has considerable opportunities to develop mountain and rural tourism, especially in the southern parts where the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains are located. The slopes are covered with dense deciduous and higher up, coniferous forests, dotted with numerous artificial lakes. The largest one is the [[Batak Dam]], on whose shores are built two resorts: ''Tsigov Chark'' and ''Saint Konstantin'' as well as many villas and shrines.  Fish is abundant in the dams, including [[carp]], [[rudd]], [[Rutilus|roach]] [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]], [[perch]], [[zander]] and many others; the mountain streams are rich in [[trout]].  There are spa resorts in [[Velingrad]], [[Strelcha]], [[Banya, Pazardzhik Province|Banya]], [[Varvara, Pazardzhik Province|Varvara]].  The most famous landmarks are located in [[Panagyurishte]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Velingrad]].\n\nImpressive ruins of an ancient basilica (the [[Belovo Basilica]]) rise in the hilly country, close to the town of [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Numerous ruined fortresses are scattered around the province, the most famous of these are [[Tsepina]], and the ramparts near [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]] and [[Strelcha]]. The medieval [[Church of St Demetrius, Patalenitsa|Church of St Demetrius]] in the village of [[Patalenitsa]] has frescoes dating to the 12th\u201313th century.\n\n==Transportation and communications==\nThe road network is not dense.  The [[Trakiya motorway]] runs through the middle of the region. The main railway between [[Sofia]] and [[Plovdiv]] also runs through it.  There are two other railways: to [[Panagyurishte]] and to [[Peshtera]].  There are several military airports. \nAs everywhere in [[Bulgaria]], every town and village in the region is provided with electricity, drinking water and telephone network.  Each town and some villages are provided with Internet connection, and the cellular phone coverage is almost 100%, as most people own GSMs.\nSome of the interconnecting roads, especially higher up the mountain, are currently in a very bad state following heavy downpours in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n*[[List of villages in Pazardzhik Province]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pz.government.bg/news.php Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Pazardzhik Province\n|North     = [[Sofia Province]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Plovdiv Province]]\n|Southeast = [[Smolyan Province]]\n|South     = \n|Southwest = [[Blagoevgrad Province]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = [[Sofia Province]]\n}}\n\n<br/>{{Provinces of Bulgaria}}\n{{Bulgaria topics}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Pazardzhik Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|42|5|N|24|15|E|region:BG|display=title}}\n{{Short description|Province of Bulgaria}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Pazardzhik Province\n| native_name             = \u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u041f\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\n| native_name_lang        = bul<!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"bul\" for Bulgarian.

There are more than 50 discovered [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] settlements. The earliest civilization to inhabit the region were the [[Thracians]]. The remains of the Thracian town Besapara are located in the hills near the provincial capital Pazardzhik. The [[Panagyurishte Treasure]] unearthed near the northern town of the same name is known as one of the finest examples of Thracian art. The 6.164&nbsp;kg of 23-karat gold treasure which consists of nine vessels has been dated back to the 4th and 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC the region became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province and remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the fall of Rome.\n\nMost of the region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the beginning of the 9th century and remained in Bulgarian hands until the fall of the First Empire. With the rise of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] the region once again became part of the country until it was overran by the [[Ottomans]] in the late 14th century. Some of medieval fortresses are [[Tsepina]] near the village of [[Dorkovo]] and [[Krasen (fortress)|Krasen]] in the vicinities of [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]].\n\nThe [[April Uprising]] of 1876 against the Ottoman rule was widely supported within the region and the town of [[Panagyurishte]] became the center of the uprising. The Bulgarian population also rebelled to the south where the Ottoman atrocities culminated in the [[Batak massacre]]. According to the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878 the region was included in the autonomous region [[Eastern Rumelia]] which [[Unification of Bulgaria|united]] with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] on 6 September 1885.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oborishte127.JPG|left|thumb|The village of [[Oborishte]].]]\n\nThe Pazardzhik Province is situated in central part of southern Bulgaria and borders the provinces of [[Plovdiv Province|Plovdiv]], [[Smolyan Province|Smolyan]], [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad]] and [[Sofia Province|Sofia]]. The total area of the region is 4,458&nbsp;km\u00b2 which is 4% of the national territory. Forests account for more than half of the area (57.1%); the arable land is 35.6%, urban territory is 3.3%, rivers and lakes occupy 2.6%, road infrastructure - 0.6% and quarries and mines - 0,4%.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\n[[File:Panagyurishte-library.jpg|thumb|The [[chitalishte]] \"Videlina\" in [[Panagyurishte]].]]\nThe northern parts of the region include the middle ridges of the [[Sredna Gora]] mountain, to the south the relief flattens and forms the western-most parts of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]] and to the south are located the [[Rhodope Mountains]] where most of the forests are situated. The highest point of the region is Savov Vrah at an altitude of 2,306 m while the lowest altitude is around 200 m in the plains of the central area.<ref name=\"of\">[http://www.pz.government.bg/pz/fr_engl.html Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]</ref> The climate is transcontinental with milder winter than northern Bulgaria in the lowlands but with very low temperatures and high snowfall in the mountain areas.

The \"Batashki Vodnosilov Pat\" is an important hydrocomplex consisting of three hydro power plants- \"Batak\", \"Peshtera\" and \"Aleko\" with combined capacity of around 250 MW. Copper extracting industry is of national and European importance with major mines located around Panagyurishte (Asarel and Medet), [[Elshitsa]], [[Tsar Asen]] and [[Mina Radka]]. Machine building industry is developed in [[Pazardzhik]] (lead acid batteries), [[Panagyurishte]] (optical), [[Velingrad]]. There is flourishing pharmaceutical industry in [[Peshtera]] with more than 1 000 employees in the plant. Paper industry is developed in [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Timber industry is very important in the southern part of the region (the Rhodopes)- [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Peshtera]], [[Rakitovo]] and [[Velingrad]]. The manufacturing of textiles is well developed in [[Pazardzhik]], [[Panagyurishte]] and [[Velingrad]]. There is a huge footwear plant in [[Peshtera]]. Food processing industry is developed in most of the towns.\nAgriculture is also important, especially in the fertile central parts of the region. The most important crops are orchards (apples, plums and strawberries), grapes, wheat, barley, rye and rice.  Livestock breeding is relatively well developed in the mountainous areas.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:BatakChurch.JPG|thumb|left|A church in [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]].]]\nThe province has considerable opportunities to develop mountain and rural tourism, especially in the southern parts where the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains are located. The slopes are covered with dense deciduous and higher up, coniferous forests, dotted with numerous artificial lakes. The largest one is the [[Batak Dam]], on whose shores are built two resorts: ''Tsigov Chark'' and ''Saint Konstantin'' as well as many villas and shrines.  Fish is abundant in the dams, including [[carp]], [[rudd]], [[Rutilus|roach]] [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]], [[perch]], [[zander]] and many others; the mountain streams are rich in [[trout]].  There are spa resorts in [[Velingrad]], [[Strelcha]], [[Banya, Pazardzhik Province|Banya]], [[Varvara, Pazardzhik Province|Varvara]].  The most famous landmarks are located in [[Panagyurishte]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Velingrad]].\n\nImpressive ruins of an ancient basilica (the [[Belovo Basilica]]) rise in the hilly country, close to the town of [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Numerous ruined fortresses are scattered around the province, the most famous of these are [[Tsepina]], and the ramparts near [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]] and [[Strelcha]]. The medieval [[Church of St Demetrius, Patalenitsa|Church of St Demetrius]] in the village of [[Patalenitsa]] has frescoes dating to the 12th\u201313th century.\n\n==Transportation and communications==\nThe road network is not dense.  The [[Trakiya motorway]] runs through the middle of the region. The main railway between [[Sofia]] and [[Plovdiv]] also runs through it.  There are two other railways: to [[Panagyurishte]] and to [[Peshtera]].  There are several military airports. \nAs everywhere in [[Bulgaria]], every town and village in the region is provided with electricity, drinking water and telephone network.  Each town and some villages are provided with Internet connection, and the cellular phone coverage is almost 100%, as most people own GSMs.\nSome of the interconnecting roads, especially higher up the mountain, are currently in a very bad state following heavy downpours in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n*[[List of villages in Pazardzhik Province]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pz.government.bg/news.php Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Pazardzhik Province\n|North     = [[Sofia Province]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Plovdiv Province]]\n|Southeast = [[Smolyan Province]]\n|South     = \n|Southwest = [[Blagoevgrad Province]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = [[Sofia Province]]\n}}\n\n<br/>{{Provinces of Bulgaria}}\n{{Bulgaria topics}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Pazardzhik Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePopulation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazardzhik_Province"}

The rifle was designed by German [[small arms]] manufacturer [[Heckler & Koch]] (H&K), and shares design and engineering with their [[Heckler & Koch G36|G36 rifle]].\n\nThe XM8 design was originally part of the [[Objective Individual Combat Weapon program]] (OICW), which was developing a \"smart\" [[grenade launcher]] system with an underslung carbine rifle. The system was unable to meet performance and weight requirements and was eventually canceled. In the aftermath, the two portions of the OICW were separated, resulting in the XM8 and [[XM25 CDTE|XM25]] projects.\n\nAlthough there were high hopes that the XM8 would become the [[United States Army]]'s new standard infantry rifle, the project was put on hold in April 2005, and was [[List of cancelled military projects|formally canceled]] on October 31 of that year. However, the weapon is now in service with [[Royal Malaysian Navy]], [[PASKAL]] special forces.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}\n[[Image:XM8 and Marine.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] weapons instructor presents an XM8 Carbine during the Infantry Operations Chief Symposium in August 2005.]]\nThe U.S. Army's purpose in contracting for this prototype weapon was to provide replacement options for the [[M16 rifle]] after the [[XM29]] program ran into problems.  The goal was a weapon that was cheaper, lighter, and more effective than the M16 and [[M4 carbine|M4]] series of weapons. The XM8 was not just one weapon but a system which could be reconfigured with appropriate parts to be any one of several variants from a short-barreled personal defense weapon to a [[bipod]]-equipped support weapon. It also included an integrated optical sight and IR laser aiming module/illuminator.\n\nThe XM8 was based on the rifle module of [[Alliant Techsystems]]'s [[XM29 OICW]] project, of which the weapon mechanisms were the responsibility of H&K.  Following the indefinite delay of the [[Objective Individual Combat Weapon program]], the U.S. Army requested that the contractors design stand-alone weapons from the XM29's kinetic energy and high explosive modules.\n\nThe first 30 XM8 prototypes were delivered by November 2003 for preliminary testing. Later, at least 200 developmental prototypes were procured. Among the complaints during testing was that the battery life was too low for the weapon's powered sight system and some ergonomics issues. Two other key issues were reducing the weapon's weight and increasing the heat resistance of the hand guard, which would start to melt after firing too many rounds. The main testing was largely completed, and the army pushed for funding for a large field test. However, in 2004 Congress denied $26 million funding for 7,000 rifles to do a wide scale test fielding of the XM8 in 2005. At the time the rifle still had developmental goals that were incomplete, primarily associated with the weapon's weight; the battery life had been extended, and a more heat-resistant plastic hand-guard added. The earliest product brochure lists the target weight for the carbine variant at {{convert|5.7|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}} with the then current prototype at {{convert|6.2|lb|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.  The weight of the carbine prototype had since grown to {{convert|7.5|lb|disp=flip|abbr=on}} according to a brochure released by HK and [[General Dynamics]] in January 2005.\n\n[[Image:XM8.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Army leaders test fire the compact set-up of the XM8 at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in August 2004.]]\nDuring the same period, the army came under pressure from other arms makers to open up the XM8 to competition. The main argument was that the weapon that was being adopted was a substantially different system than for the original competition that ATK and H&K had actually won (see [[XM29]]). Other issues were that the army has a legislated obligation to prefer U.S.-based manufacturers, and that a previous agreement with [[Colt Defense]] required the army to involve Colt in certain small-arms programs. The XM8 program was put on hold in 2004. The exact reason why this happened is a matter of debate; some combination of the aforementioned technical issues, funding restrictions, and outside pressure being involved.\n\nIn 2005, the army issued a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) for the [[OICW]] Increment One family of weapons.  This RFP gave manufacturers six months to develop and deliver prototype weapons with requirements very similar to the XM8 capabilities, but with the addition of a [[squad automatic weapon]] (SAW) configuration. Currently, no XM8 prototypes have been shown that actually match the capabilities of the [[M249 Squad Automatic Weapon|M249]] (e.g. fast barrel replacement, high sustained [[rate of fire]], belt feed).  The OICW Increment One requirement for the SAW includes fast barrel replacement and high sustained rate of fire, but leaves the ammunition feed choice up to the manufacturer.\n\nFunding for the [[M320 grenade launcher]], which is a single-shot under-barrel grenade launcher similar to the [[M203 grenade launcher|M203]] that was originally intended for the XM8, was approved. The launcher is actually heavier than the M203, but does offer some advantages. The XM320 was designed for use with the existing inventory of M16s and M4s and is also compatible with the XM8. It can also be used as a stand-alone weapon.\n\nAs of July 19, 2005, the OICW Increment One RFP was put on an eight-week hold, with an indication given that the program was being restructured as a joint procurement program. On October 31, 2005, the OICW Increment One RFP was cancelled.\n\nIn an article in ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]'', April 26, 2006 (Vol 43, page 30) it is stated that \"The US Army has again delayed the procurement of its future infantry weapons, this time for more than five years, and is working to field two interim guns in the meantime\".\n\n[[General Dynamics]] was involved in latter stages and H&K had plans to produce the rifle at a plant in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Without the advantage of the next-generation combined electronics sight, the XM8 would be both heavier and more expensive than the firearms it was intended to replace.\n\n===Accessories===\nXM8 abandons the standard [[Picatinny rail]] for attachment of weapon accessories, in favor of a new standard referred to as PCAP ('''P'''icatinny '''C'''ombat '''A'''ttachment '''P'''oints), small oval holes on the forward grip. (A variant was designed with MIL-STD-1913 rails &mdash; XM8 R; and some early XM8 prototypes had rails.) PCAP is not backwards compatible with currently fielded attachments that use MIL-STD-1913 rails without using an adapter. The benefit of PCAP, however, is the precision of the accessory's connection with the body of the weapon; accessories utilizing Picatinny rails often need adjustment if they are removed and reattached. Additionally, most standard accessory functionality is built into the XM8.  Where functionality was missing, it was anticipated that accessories would be redesigned to utilize PCAP.

In addition a [[Light machine gun]] with a 100-round dual drum [[Beta C-Mag]] is proposed. Accessories such as [[Red dot sights|optical sights]], a [[grenade launcher]], and a [[bipod]] were integrated using a new system which allows for precision attachment (so that, for example, scopes do not have to be readjusted each time they are attached). Like the M4 and M16, the XM8 was chambered for the standard [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] round and was normally equipped with a 30-round plastic [[box magazine]] also used in the [[H&K G36|G36]].  Although, this meant that the magazine housing was not compatible with M4 and M16's metal [[STANAG magazine]] without using an adaptor. A 100-round dual drum [[Beta C-Mag]] style magazine could also be used.\n\nOne of the XM8's unique features was its modularity.  In addition to attachments mentioned above, this modularity allowed for quick repairs, barrel length changes, and even caliber changes in the field. Along with its basic components, the XM8 would have complemented the [[XM29]], with such features as identical accessory mounts.\n\nThe number and type of variants in the family varied over its lifetime, this overview with three main versions is based from a press release in the early 2000s.\n\n*XM8 compact carbine: {{convert|9|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel, PDW configuration, collapsing stock<ref>http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/01/26/potd-unicorns-exist-hk-xm8-compact-pdw/</ref> or buttcap; [[muzzle velocity]] {{convert|720|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n*XM8 carbine with XM320 grenade launcher: {{convert|12.5|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel; muzzle velocity {{convert|815|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n*Automatic rifle: {{convert|20|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel, muzzle velocity {{convert|916|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n*Designated marksman rifle: {{convert|20|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel, integrated folding bipod, 4X sight, 30/100-round magazine; muzzle velocity {{convert|916|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Gear_051104_XM8,00.html |title=\"The XM-8 Battle Rifle\" at military.com|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref>\n*Light machine gun: heavy {{convert|20|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel with integrated folding bipod, rate of fire 600-750 rpm\n\n==Usage==\nWhile the XM8 fell out of favor with the U.S. Armed Forces, Heckler & Koch sought to market the rifle globally.

The rifle was designed by German [[small arms]] manufacturer [[Heckler & Koch]] (H&K), and shares design and engineering with their [[Heckler & Koch G36|G36 rifle]].\n\nThe XM8 design was originally part of the [[Objective Individual Combat Weapon program]] (OICW), which was developing a \"smart\" [[grenade launcher]] system with an underslung carbine rifle. The system was unable to meet performance and weight requirements and was eventually canceled. In the aftermath, the two portions of the OICW were separated, resulting in the XM8 and [[XM25 CDTE|XM25]] projects.\n\nAlthough there were high hopes that the XM8 would become the [[United States Army]]'s new standard infantry rifle, the project was put on hold in April 2005, and was [[List of cancelled military projects|formally canceled]] on October 31, 2005. However, the weapon is now in service with [[Royal Malaysian Navy]], [[PASKAL]] special forces.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}\n[[Image:XM8 and Marine.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] weapons instructor presents an XM8 Carbine during the Infantry Operations Chief Symposium in August 2005.]]\nThe U.S. Army's purpose in contracting for this prototype weapon was to provide replacement options for the [[M16 rifle]] after the [[XM29]] program ran into problems.  The goal was a weapon that was cheaper, lighter, and more effective than the M16 and [[M4 carbine|M4]] series of weapons. The XM8 was not just one weapon but a system which could be reconfigured with appropriate parts to be any one of several variants from a short-barreled personal defense weapon to a [[bipod]]-equipped support weapon. It also included an integrated optical sight and IR laser aiming module/illuminator.\n\nThe XM8 was based on the rifle module of [[Alliant Techsystems]]'s [[XM29 OICW]] project, of which the weapon mechanisms were the responsibility of H&K.  Following the indefinite delay of the [[Objective Individual Combat Weapon program]], the U.S. Army requested that the contractors design stand-alone weapons from the XM29's kinetic energy and high explosive modules.\n\nThe first 30 XM8 prototypes were delivered by November 2003 for preliminary testing. Later, at least 200 developmental prototypes were procured. Among the complaints during testing was that the battery life was too low for the weapon's powered sight system and some ergonomics issues. Two other key issues were reducing the weapon's weight and increasing the heat resistance of the hand guard, which would start to melt after firing too many rounds. The main testing was largely completed, and the army pushed for funding for a large field test. However, in 2004 Congress denied $26 million funding for 7,000 rifles to do a wide scale test fielding of the XM8 in 2005. At the time the rifle still had developmental goals that were incomplete, primarily associated with the weapon's weight; the battery life had been extended, and a more heat-resistant plastic hand-guard added. The earliest product brochure lists the target weight for the carbine variant at {{convert|5.7|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}} with the then current prototype at {{convert|6.2|lb|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.  The weight of the carbine prototype had since grown to {{convert|7.5|lb|disp=flip|abbr=on}} according to a brochure released by HK and [[General Dynamics]] in January 2005.\n\n[[Image:XM8.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Army leaders test fire the compact set-up of the XM8 at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in August 2004.]]\nDuring the same period, the army came under pressure from other arms makers to open up the XM8 to competition. The main argument was that the weapon that was being adopted was a substantially different system than for the original competition that ATK and H&K had actually won (see [[XM29]]). Other issues were that the army has a legislated obligation to prefer U.S.-based manufacturers, and that a previous agreement with [[Colt Defense]] required the army to involve Colt in certain small-arms programs. The XM8 program was put on hold in 2004. The exact reason why this happened is a matter of debate; some combination of the aforementioned technical issues, funding restrictions, and outside pressure being involved.\n\nIn 2005, the army issued a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) for the [[OICW]] Increment One family of weapons.  This RFP gave manufacturers six months to develop and deliver prototype weapons with requirements very similar to the XM8 capabilities, but with the addition of a [[squad automatic weapon]] (SAW) configuration. Currently, no XM8 prototypes have been shown that actually match the capabilities of the [[M249 Squad Automatic Weapon|M249]] (e.g. fast barrel replacement, high sustained [[rate of fire]], belt feed).  The OICW Increment One requirement for the SAW includes fast barrel replacement and high sustained rate of fire, but leaves the ammunition feed choice up to the manufacturer.\n\nFunding for the [[M320 grenade launcher]], which is a single-shot under-barrel grenade launcher similar to the [[M203 grenade launcher|M203]] that was originally intended for the XM8, was approved. The launcher is actually heavier than the M203, but does offer some advantages. The XM320 was designed for use with the existing inventory of M16s and M4s and is also compatible with the XM8. It can also be used as a stand-alone weapon.\n\nAs of July 19, 2005, the OICW Increment One RFP was put on an eight-week hold, with an indication given that the program was being restructured as a joint procurement program. On October 31, 2005, the OICW Increment One RFP was cancelled.\n\nIn an article in ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]'', April 26, 2006 (Vol 43, page 30) it is stated that \"The US Army has again delayed the procurement of its future infantry weapons, this time for more than five years, and is working to field two interim guns in the meantime\".\n\n[[General Dynamics]] was involved in latter stages and H&K had plans to produce the rifle at a plant in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. H&K was [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British]]-owned at the start of the project, but was later bought back by a group of [[Economy of Germany|German]] investors. Engineering work was done at facilities in the United States and Germany.\n\n===Near cancellation===\n[[Image:Xm8 sideview.jpg|thumb|right|A prototype XM8 carbine - lacking PCAP device on the side rails.

Although, this meant that the magazine housing was not compatible with M4 and M16's metal [[STANAG magazine]] without using an adaptor. A 100-round dual drum [[Beta C-Mag]] style magazine could also be used.\n\nOne of the XM8's unique features was its modularity.  In addition to attachments mentioned above, this modularity allowed for quick repairs, barrel length changes, and even caliber changes in the field. Along with its basic components, the XM8 would have complemented the [[XM29]], with such features as identical accessory mounts.\n\nThe number and type of variants in the family varied over its lifetime, this overview with three main versions is based from a press release in the early 2000s.\n\n*XM8 compact carbine: {{convert|9|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel, PDW configuration, collapsing stock<ref>http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/01/26/potd-unicorns-exist-hk-xm8-compact-pdw/</ref> or buttcap; [[muzzle velocity]] {{convert|720|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n*XM8 carbine with XM320 grenade launcher: {{convert|12.5|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel; muzzle velocity {{convert|815|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n*Automatic rifle: {{convert|20|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel, muzzle velocity {{convert|916|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}\n*Designated marksman rifle: {{convert|20|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel, integrated folding bipod, 4X sight, 30/100-round magazine; muzzle velocity {{convert|916|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Gear_051104_XM8,00.html |title=\"The XM-8 Battle Rifle\" at military.com|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref>\n*Light machine gun: heavy {{convert|20|in|disp=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} barrel with integrated folding bipod, rate of fire 600-750 rpm\n\n==Usage==\nWhile the XM8 fell out of favor with the U.S. Armed Forces, Heckler & Koch sought to market the rifle globally. In the meantime, the [[Malaysian Armed Forces]] expressed interest in using the rifle and by 2007 openly stated its intention to purchase the XM8 rifle.<!-- CITE: TEMPUR  --> By 2010, the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] special unit [[PASKAL]] began using the XM8 along with other Heckler & Koch assault rifles including the [[Heckler & Koch HK416|HK416]] and [[Heckler & Koch G36|G36]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wangguang|first=Lei|date=2015-03-21|title=Langkawi Airshow / PASKAL\u2500  Sea Dragon special warfare/\u862d\u5361\u5a01\u822a\u5c55\uff0fPASKAL\u2500\u5927\u99ac\u6d77\u4e2d\u7279\u6230\u86df\u9f8d|journal=Youth Daily News|language=Chinese|url=http://news.gpwb.gov.tw/news.aspx?ydn=026dTHGgTRNpmRFEgxcbfdIqFnzB9aVI4ooMjsJjzE7nF%2FB8Zoq46mHk2om5r5rtr5MpYgyiakLZLBYFA4KCF4TDr0jjZZda8GJhkWP%2F9d8%3D|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107195051/http://news.gpwb.gov.tw/news.aspx?ydn=026dTHGgTRNpmRFEgxcbfdIqFnzB9aVI4ooMjsJjzE7nF%2FB8Zoq46mHk2om5r5rtr5MpYgyiakLZLBYFA4KCF4TDr0jjZZda8GJhkWP%2F9d8%3D|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-01-07|accessdate=2015-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.gpwb.gov.tw/p/b_F0101/20150321/2320781.jpg |title=From the picture is Royal Malaysian Navy tactical force with HK XM8 Compact Carbine in 2015 Langkawi Airshow |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143200/http://news.gpwb.gov.tw/p/b_F0101/20150321/2320781.jpg |archivedate=2015-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.malaysiandefence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/044_Snapshot.jpg |title=From the picture is Royal Malaysian Navy PASKAL tactical diver team with G36KV, XM8 DMR, HK416, MP7, G36C in 2014 Merdeka Parade at Kuala Lumpur capital |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905220007/http://www.malaysiandefence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/044_Snapshot.jpg |archivedate=2014-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[AN-94]]\n*[[XM29 OICW]]\n*[[XM25 Individual Airburst Weapon System]]\n*[[Heckler & Koch G36]]\n*[[Projectile#Kinetic projectiles|Kinetic projectiles]]\n*[[Kinetic energy penetrator]]\n*[[M320 grenade launcher]]\n*[[Adaptive Combat Rifle]], modular rifle system.\n*[[Beretta ARX160]]\n*[[FN SCAR]]\n*[[Barrett REC7]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|XM8|XM8}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050827001951/http://www.pica.army.mil/PicatinnyPublic/warfighter/archive/03-18-04.asp Picatinny article from 2004 about XM8 (.mil)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050717235737/http://defense-update.com/products/x/XM8.htm Defense-Update.com article on XM8]\n*[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m8-oicw.htm Global Security.org article about XM8]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819082409/http://hksystems.com.au/xm8.htm HKsystems.com overview]\n\n{{HK firearms}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heckler and Koch XM8}}\n[[Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 2003]]\n[[Category:5.56 mm assault rifles]]\n[[Category:Abandoned military projects of the United States]]\n[[Category:Heckler & Koch rifles|XM8]]\n[[Category:Post\u2013Cold War weapons of Germany]]\n[[Category:Trial and research firearms of Germany]]\n[[Category:Modular firearms]]\n", "name_user": "TheNamelessIndividual", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_XM8"}
