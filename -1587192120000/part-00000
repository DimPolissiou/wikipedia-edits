The film tells the story of [[Jack Torrance]], an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the [[Southern Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]]. Wintering over with Jack are his wife, [[Wendy Torrance]] and young son, [[Danny Torrance]]. Danny possesses \"the shining\", psychic abilities that enable him to see into the hotel's horrific past. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel, placing his wife and son in danger. [[Jack Nicholson]] stars as Jack Torrance, [[Shelley Duvall]] stars as Wendy Torrance and [[Danny Lloyd]] stars as Danny Torrance.\n\nThe film was released in the [[United States]] on May 23, 1980, by [[Warner Bros.]] Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. Critical opinion has become more favorable and it is now widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential horror films ever made]] and has become a staple of pop culture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40|title='Jurassic Park,' 'Shining' added to National Film Registry|date=2018-12-12|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Doctor Sleep'' (2019) ===\n{{Main|Doctor Sleep (2019 film)}}\n\n''Doctor Sleep'' is a 2019 American [[supernatural horror film]] based on the [[Doctor Sleep (novel)|2013 novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen King]], a sequel to King's 1977 novel ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. The film, which also serves as a direct sequel to the [[The Shining (film)|film adaptation]] of ''The Shining'', directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], is set several decades after the events of the 1980 film. The film follows an older version of [[Danny Torrance]], a man with psychic abilities who struggles with childhood trauma. Danny must protect a young girl with similar powers from a cult known as The True Knot, who prey on children with powers to remain immortal. [[Ewan McGregor]] stars as Danny Torrance.\n\n''Doctor Sleep'' was released in the United States on November 8, 2019.

Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with ''Barry Lyndon''{{'}}s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.\"<ref>LoBrutto, Vincent, \"Stanley Kubrick, A Biography,\" (1997), p. 412</ref>\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".<ref name=\"Duncan, Paul 2003 9\">{{citation|author=Duncan, Paul|title=Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films|page=9|year=2003|publisher=Taschen GmbH|isbn=978-3836527750}}</ref>\n\n==== Casting ====\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included [[Robert De Niro]] (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month),<ref>[[Robert De Niro]] (speaking about which films scared him), [[B105 FM]] interview on September 20, 2007</ref> [[Robin Williams]], and [[Harrison Ford]], all of whom met with [[Stephen King]]'s disapproval.<ref>[[Stephen King]], [[B105 FM]] on November 21, 2007</ref> In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period. These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson's and Shelley Duvall's speech patterns.<ref>LoBrutto, p. 420</ref>\n\n==== Filming ====\nHaving chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had [[Set construction|sets constructed]] on soundstages at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|EMI Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], England. Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]. To enable him to shoot the scenes in chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production.

The film tells the story of [[Jack Torrance]], an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the [[Southern Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]]. Wintering over with Jack are his wife, [[Wendy Torrance]] and young son, [[Danny Torrance]]. Danny possesses \"the shining\", psychic abilities that enable him to see into the hotel's horrific past. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel, placing his wife and son in danger. [[Jack Nicholson]] stars as Jack Torrance, [[Shelley Duvall]] stars as Wendy Torrance and [[Danny Lloyd]] stars as Danny Torrance.\n\nThe film was released in the [[United States]] on May 23, 1980, by [[Warner Bros.]] Reactions to the film at the time of its release were mixed; Stephen King criticized the film due to its deviations from the novel. Critical opinion has become more favorable and it is now widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential horror films ever made]] and has become a staple of pop culture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40|title='Jurassic Park,' 'Shining' added to National Film Registry|date=2018-12-12|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Doctor Sleep'' (2019) ===\n{{Main|Doctor Sleep (2019 film)}}\n\n''Doctor Sleep'' is a 2019 American [[supernatural horror film]] based on the [[Doctor Sleep (novel)|2013 novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen King]], a sequel to King's 1977 novel ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.

Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with ''Barry Lyndon''{{'}}s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test team, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s when the side changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side under the successive captaincies of [[Frank Worrell]] and [[Garfield Sobers|Gary Sobers]].\n\nBy the late 1970s, the West Indies led by [[Clive Lloyd]] had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a reputation they retained throughout the 1980s.<ref>Until June 2001 there was no official ranking of Test nations, with the unofficial epithet of \"World champions\" being decided by acclaim based on recent results.

Victory in the 2004 Champions Trophy and a runner-up showing in the 2006 Champions Trophy left some hopeful, but it was not until the inception of [[Twenty20]] cricket that the West Indies began to regain a place among the cricketing elite and among cricket fans, as they developed ranks of players capable of taking over games with their power hitting, including [[Chris Gayle]], [[Kieron Pollard]], [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Lendl Simmons]], [[Andre Russell]] and [[Carlos Brathwaite]]. They beat Australia and then host Sri Lanka in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|2012 World Twenty20]] to win their first ICC world championship since the 1979 World Cup and then bested England to win the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20|2016 World Twenty20]], making them the first team to win the World Twenty20 twice. As an added bonus, the West Indies also became the first to win both the men's and women's World Twenty20 on the same day, as the women's team beat three-time defending champion Australia for their first ICC world title immediately beforehand.\n\n==Flag and anthem==\n[[File:WestIndiesCricketFlagPre1999.svg|thumb|Former flag of the West Indies cricket team used until 1999.

However, as the West Indies represent a number of independent states and dependencies, there is no natural choice of flag.

Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test team, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s when the side changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side under the successive captaincies of [[Frank Worrell]] and [[Garfield Sobers|Gary Sobers]].\n\nBy the late 1970s, the West Indies led by [[Clive Lloyd]] had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a reputation they retained throughout the 1980s.<ref>Until June 2001 there was no official ranking of Test nations, with the unofficial epithet of \"World champions\" being decided by acclaim based on recent results.

Victory in the 2004 Champions Trophy and a runner-up showing in the 2006 Champions Trophy left some hopeful, but it was not until the inception of [[Twenty20]] cricket that the West Indies began to regain a place among the cricketing elite and among cricket fans, as they developed ranks of players capable of taking over games with their power hitting, including [[Chris Gayle]], [[Kieron Pollard]], [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Lendl Simmons]], [[Andre Russell]] and [[Carlos Brathwaite]]. They beat Australia and then host Sri Lanka in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|2012 World Twenty20]] to win their first ICC world championship since the 1979 World Cup and then bested England to win the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20|2016 World Twenty20]], making them the first team to win the World Twenty20 twice.

It was the only Test ground in South America (until the use of Providence), and the only one below sea level and with its own moat (to prevent the pitch from frequent flooding). It has a capacity of around 22,000. It is remembered for the Pitch Invasion during an April 1999, One Day International between Australia and the West Indies, with Australia needing 3 runs to tie and 4 to win off the last ball, a full scale pitch invasion, resulted in the match being deemed a tie, due to the stumps having been stolen before the West Indian team could effect a run out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/AUS_IN_WI/SCORECARDS/AUS_WI_ODI5_21APR1999_CI_MR.html |title=Bourda First Test |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201194206/http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/AUS_IN_WI/SCORECARDS/AUS_WI_ODI5_21APR1999_CI_MR.html |archive-date=1 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*[[Sabina Park]] \u2013 [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]] (52/38/3): Sabina Park first hosted a Test match in 1930.

Three Test triple centuries have been scored on this ground: Chris Gayle's 317 in 2005, and Brian Lara's world record scores of 375 in 1994 and 400 not out in 2004. The historic stadium was removed from the roster of grounds hosting international matches in June 2006, to make way for the island's new cricket stadium, being constructed 3 miles outside the capital city expected to be completed in time for its hosting of matches for Cricket World Cup 2007.

In [[basin and range topography]], wadis trend along basin axes at the terminus of fans. Permanent channels do not exist, due to lack of continual water flow. Wadis have [[braided stream]] patterns because of the deficiency of water and the abundance of [[sediment]]s. Water percolates down into the stream bed, causing an abrupt loss of energy and resulting in vast deposition. Wadis may develop dams of sediment that change the stream patterns in the next [[flash flood]].\n\nWind also causes sediment deposition. When wadi sediments are underwater or moist, wind sediments are deposited over them. Thus, wadi sediments contain both wind and water sediments.\n\n==Sediments and sedimentary structures==\nWadi sediments may contain a range of material, from gravel to mud, and the sedimentary structures vary widely. Thus, wadi sediments are the most diagnostic of all desert environments.\n\nFlash floods result from severe energy conditions and can result in a wide range of sedimentary structures, including ripples and common plane beds. Gravels commonly display imbrications, and mud drapes show desiccation cracks. Wind activity also generates sedimentary structures, including large-scale cross-stratification and wedge-shaped cross-sets. A typical wadi sequence consists of alternating units of wind and water sediments; each unit ranging from about {{convert|10|\u2013|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

Wadis, as drainage courses, are formed by water, but are distinguished from river valleys or gullies in that surface water is intermittent or ephemeral. Wadis are generally dry year round, except after a rain. The desert environment is characterized by sudden but infrequent heavy rainfall, often resulting in [[flash flood]]s. Crossing wadis at certain times of the year can be dangerous as a result.\n\nWadis tend to be associated with centers of human population because sub-surface water is sometimes available in them.

With an effective range of about {{convert|12|mi|km}}, it was introduced as a radar [[beam riding|beam-riding]] missile and then it was improved to a [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active radar guided]] missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the [[F3H Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]], but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in its [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and early [[U.S. Air Force]] versions. The F-4 carried up to four AIM-7s in built-in recesses under its belly.\n\nAlthough designed for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, because of poor performance against fighters over North Vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. Together with the short-range, infrared-guided [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], they replaced the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well. A disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching [[fighter plane]] at a time. Also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in [[air-to-air combat]].\n\nAn active-radar variant called the Sparrow II was developed to address these drawbacks, but the U.S. Navy pulled out of the project in 1956.  The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], which took over development in the hopes of using the missile to arm their prospective [[CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor, soon followed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|title=Raytheon AIM/RIM-7 Sparrow|work=designation-systems.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202152/http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  The electronics of the time simply could not be miniaturized enough to make Sparrow II a viable working weapon.  It would take decades, and a new generation of digital electronics, to produce an effective active-radar air-to-air missile as compact as the Sparrow.\n\n===AIM-54 Phoenix LRM===\nThe US Navy later developed the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] long-range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It was a large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, Mach 5 missile designed to counter [[cruise missile]]s and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing [[Douglas F6D Missileer]] and then the navalized version of the [[F-111B#F-111B|F-111B]], it finally saw service with the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile. Phoenix was the first US [[fire-and-forget]], multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This, in theory, gave a Tomcat with a six-Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} away\u2014the only US fighter with such capability.\n\nA full load of six Phoenix missiles and its {{convert |2000|lb|kg}} dedicated launcher exceeded a typical Vietnam-era bomb load. Its service in the US Navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive [[rules of engagement]] in conflicts such as Operations [[Desert Storm]], [[Southern Watch]], and [[Iraqi Freedom]]. The US Navy retired the Phoenix in 2004<ref>{{Citation | title = Navy Retires AIM-54 Phoenix Missile | url = http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | place = United States | publisher = Navy | access-date = November 26, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110305105351/http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | archive-date = March 5, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> in light of availability of the AIM-120 AMRAAM on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and the pending retirement of the F-14 Tomcat from active service in late 2006.\n\n===ACEVAL/AIMVAL===\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974 to 1978 at [[Nellis AFB]] using the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles as the blue force and aggressor F-5E aircraft equipped with [[AIM-9L]] [[all-aspect]] Sidewinders as the red force. This [[joint test and evaluation]] (JT&E) was designated Air Combat Evaluation/Air Intercept Missile Evaluation ([[ACEVAL/AIMVAL]]).{{citation needed| date= July 2010| reason= Dead link removed}} A principal finding was that the necessity to produce illumination for the Sparrow until impact resulted in the red force's being able to launch their all-aspect Sidewinders before impact, resulting in mutual kills. What was needed was Phoenix-type multiple-launch and terminal active capability in a Sparrow-size airframe. This led to a [[memorandum of agreement]] (MOA) with European allies (principally the UK and Germany for development) for the US to develop an advanced, medium-range, air-to-air missile with the USAF as lead service. The MOA also assigned responsibility for development of an advanced, short-range, air-to-air missile to the European team; this would become the British [[ASRAAM]].\n\n===Requirements===\n[[File:CATM 120C AMRAAM p1230119.jpg|thumb|Surface-to-air mounting (shown: CATM-120C captive training variant)]]\n\nBy the 1990s, the reliability of the Sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of Vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]]. But while the USAF had passed on the Phoenix and their own similar [[AIM-47]]/[[YF-12]] to optimize dogfight performance, they still needed a multiple-launch fire-and-forget capability for the F-15 and F-16. AMRAAM would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the F-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the Sparrow on the F-4 Phantom. The European partners needed AMRAAM to be integrated on aircraft as small as the Sea Harrier. The US Navy needed AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons.\n\nThe AMRAAM became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low [[radar cross-section]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:AIM-120 first kill.jpg|thumb|right|First successful test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico 1982]]\n\nAMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the [[Family of Weapons]] MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology. Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile ([[ASRAAM]]). Although Europe initially adopted the AMRAAM, an effort to develop the [[Meteor (missile)|Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM, was begun in Great Britain. Eventually the ASRAAM was developed solely by the British, but using another source for its infrared seeker. After protracted development, the deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September 1991 in US Air Force [[F-15 Eagle]] fighter [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s. The US Navy soon followed (in 1993) in its [[F/A-18 Hornet]] squadrons.\n\nThe [[Russian Air Force]] counterpart of AMRAAM is the somewhat similar [[R-77]] (NATO codename AA-12 Adder), sometimes referred to in the West as the \"AMRAAMski\" Likewise, France began its own air-to-air missile development with the [[MICA (missile)|MICA]] concept that used a common airframe for separate radar-guided and infrared-guided versions.\n\n==Operational features summary==\nAMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range (BVR) capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of US and allied aircraft to meet the threat of enemy air-to-air weapons as they existed in 1991. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. An inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.\n\nOnce the missile closes in on the target, its [[active radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, known as \"fire-and-forget\", frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and break a radar lock after the missile seeker goes active and guide themselves to the targets.\n\nThe missile also features the ability to \"Home on Jamming,\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | title = Military Analysis Network: AIM-120 AMRAAM Slammer | date = April 14, 2000 | publisher = FAS | accessdate = April 12, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110316035752/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | archive-date = March 16, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing \u2013 homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.\n\n==Guidance system overview==\n {{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Interception course stage===\n[[File:F-14 carrying AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] carrying an AMRAAM during a 1982 test]]\n\nAMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built-in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an [[infra-red search and track]] system, from a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]] from another fighter aircraft, or from an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] aircraft.\n\nAfter launch, if the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates\u2014such as changes in the target's direction and speed\u2014are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to \"catch\" the target aircraft in the ''basket'' (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).\n\nNot all armed services using the AMRAAM have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in beyond visual range (BVR) engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] weapon\u2014the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.\n\n===Terminal stage and impact===\nOnce the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range, within visual range (WVR) or the near BVR, it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly \"fire and forget\". {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Boresight Visual mode===\nApart from the radar-slaved mode, there is a free guidance mode, called \"Visual\". This mode is radar guidance-free\u2014the missile just fires and locks onto the first thing it sees. This mode can be used for defensive shots, i.e. when the enemy has numerical superiority. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Kill probability and tactics==\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===General considerations===\nThe [[probability of kill|kill probability]] (P<sub>k</sub>) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. Typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched at close range to the target from an aircraft with an altitude and speed advantage, it will have a good chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target. Operationally, the missile, which was designed for [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond visual range]] combat, has a P<sub>k</sub> of 63.15% (19 missiles for 12 kills, including the Syrian Su-22 downed by a US Navy F/A-18E).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-070109-1.html|title=Coffin Corners for the Joint Strike Fighter|work=ausairpower.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322111910/http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-070109-1.html|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The targets included six [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]], two [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22s]], a [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb|Galeb]] and a US Army [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]] that was targeted by mistake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html|title=The Russian Philosophy of Beyond Visual Range Air Combat|pages=1|author=Dr C Kopp|work=ausairpower.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016|date=2008-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402114905/http://ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html|archive-date=April 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40322666 \"US coalition downs first Syria government jet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930211844/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40322666 |date=September 30, 2018 }} Retrieved 19 June 2017.</ref>\n\n==Variants and upgrades==\n[[File:Aim 120 amraam missile 20040710 145603 1.4.jpg|thumb|An AIM-120 AMRAAM missile on display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum]]\n[[File:F-22 GBU39B AIM-120 m02006120800117.jpg|thumb|right|AIM-120 AMRAAM (right) fitted in a weapons bay of a [[F-22 Raptor]]]]\n\n===Air-to-air missile versions===\nThere are currently four main variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Navy]], and the United States Marine Corps.

The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuse (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in 1998 and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being produced for both domestic and foreign customers.

In that engagement, at least three other Serbian aircraft were shot down by USAF F-16C fighters using [[AIM-9]] missiles (see [[Banja Luka incident]] for more details).

With an effective range of about {{convert|12|mi|km}}, it was introduced as a radar [[beam riding|beam-riding]] missile and then it was improved to a [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active radar guided]] missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the [[F3H Demon]] and [[F7U Cutlass]], but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather [[F-4 Phantom II]] fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in its [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and early [[U.S. Air Force]] versions. The F-4 carried up to four AIM-7s in built-in recesses under its belly.\n\nAlthough designed for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, because of poor performance against fighters over North Vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. Together with the short-range, infrared-guided [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], they replaced the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well. A disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching [[fighter plane]] at a time. Also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in [[air-to-air combat]].\n\nAn active-radar variant called the Sparrow II was developed to address these drawbacks, but the U.S. Navy pulled out of the project in 1956.  The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], which took over development in the hopes of using the missile to arm their prospective [[CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor, soon followed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|title=Raytheon AIM/RIM-7 Sparrow|work=designation-systems.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202152/http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  The electronics of the time simply could not be miniaturized enough to make Sparrow II a viable working weapon.  It would take decades, and a new generation of digital electronics, to produce an effective active-radar air-to-air missile as compact as the Sparrow.\n\n===AIM-54 Phoenix LRM===\nThe US Navy later developed the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] long-range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It was a large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, Mach 5 missile designed to counter [[cruise missile]]s and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing [[Douglas F6D Missileer]] and then the navalized version of the [[F-111B#F-111B|F-111B]], it finally saw service with the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile. Phoenix was the first US [[fire-and-forget]], multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This, in theory, gave a Tomcat with a six-Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} away\u2014the only US fighter with such capability.\n\nA full load of six Phoenix missiles and its {{convert |2000|lb|kg}} dedicated launcher exceeded a typical Vietnam-era bomb load. Its service in the US Navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive [[rules of engagement]] in conflicts such as Operations [[Desert Storm]], [[Southern Watch]], and [[Iraqi Freedom]]. The US Navy retired the Phoenix in 2004<ref>{{Citation | title = Navy Retires AIM-54 Phoenix Missile | url = http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | place = United States | publisher = Navy | access-date = November 26, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110305105351/http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | archive-date = March 5, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> in light of availability of the AIM-120 AMRAAM on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and the pending retirement of the F-14 Tomcat from active service in late 2006.\n\n===ACEVAL/AIMVAL===\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974 to 1978 at [[Nellis AFB]] using the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles as the blue force and aggressor F-5E aircraft equipped with [[AIM-9L]] [[all-aspect]] Sidewinders as the red force. This [[joint test and evaluation]] (JT&E) was designated Air Combat Evaluation/Air Intercept Missile Evaluation ([[ACEVAL/AIMVAL]]).{{citation needed| date= July 2010| reason= Dead link removed}} A principal finding was that the necessity to produce illumination for the Sparrow until impact resulted in the red force's being able to launch their all-aspect Sidewinders before impact, resulting in mutual kills. What was needed was Phoenix-type multiple-launch and terminal active capability in a Sparrow-size airframe. This led to a [[memorandum of agreement]] (MOA) with European allies (principally the UK and Germany for development) for the US to develop an advanced, medium-range, air-to-air missile with the USAF as lead service. The MOA also assigned responsibility for development of an advanced, short-range, air-to-air missile to the European team; this would become the British [[ASRAAM]].\n\n===Requirements===\n[[File:CATM 120C AMRAAM p1230119.jpg|thumb|Surface-to-air mounting (shown: CATM-120C captive training variant)]]\n\nBy the 1990s, the reliability of the Sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of Vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]]. But while the USAF had passed on the Phoenix and their own similar [[AIM-47]]/[[YF-12]] to optimize dogfight performance, they still needed a multiple-launch fire-and-forget capability for the F-15 and F-16. AMRAAM would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the F-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the Sparrow on the F-4 Phantom. The European partners needed AMRAAM to be integrated on aircraft as small as the Sea Harrier. The US Navy needed AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons.\n\nThe AMRAAM became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low [[radar cross-section]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:AIM-120 first kill.jpg|thumb|right|First successful test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico 1982]]\n\nAMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the [[Family of Weapons]] MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology. Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile ([[ASRAAM]]). Although Europe initially adopted the AMRAAM, an effort to develop the [[Meteor (missile)|Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM, was begun in Great Britain. Eventually the ASRAAM was developed solely by the British, but using another source for its infrared seeker. After protracted development, the deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September 1991 in US Air Force [[F-15 Eagle]] fighter [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s. The US Navy soon followed (in 1993) in its [[F/A-18 Hornet]] squadrons.\n\nThe [[Russian Air Force]] counterpart of AMRAAM is the somewhat similar [[R-77]] (NATO codename AA-12 Adder), sometimes referred to in the West as the \"AMRAAMski\" Likewise, France began its own air-to-air missile development with the [[MICA (missile)|MICA]] concept that used a common airframe for separate radar-guided and infrared-guided versions.\n\n==Operational features summary==\nAMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range (BVR) capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of US and allied aircraft to meet the threat of enemy air-to-air weapons as they existed in 1991. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. An inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.\n\nOnce the missile closes in on the target, its [[active radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, known as \"fire-and-forget\", frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and break a radar lock after the missile seeker goes active and guide themselves to the targets.\n\nThe missile also features the ability to \"Home on Jamming,\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | title = Military Analysis Network: AIM-120 AMRAAM Slammer | date = April 14, 2000 | publisher = FAS | accessdate = April 12, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110316035752/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | archive-date = March 16, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing \u2013 homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.\n\n==Guidance system overview==\n {{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Interception course stage===\n[[File:F-14 carrying AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] carrying an AMRAAM during a 1982 test]]\n\nAMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built-in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an [[infra-red search and track]] system, from a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]] from another fighter aircraft, or from an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] aircraft.\n\nAfter launch, if the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates\u2014such as changes in the target's direction and speed\u2014are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to \"catch\" the target aircraft in the ''basket'' (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).\n\nNot all armed services using the AMRAAM have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in beyond visual range (BVR) engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] weapon\u2014the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.\n\n===Terminal stage and impact===\nOnce the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range, within visual range (WVR) or the near BVR, it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly \"fire and forget\". {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Boresight Visual mode===\nApart from the radar-slaved mode, there is a free guidance mode, called \"Visual\". This mode is radar guidance-free\u2014the missile just fires and locks onto the first thing it sees. This mode can be used for defensive shots, i.e. when the enemy has numerical superiority. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Kill probability and tactics==\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===General considerations===\nThe [[probability of kill|kill probability]] (P<sub>k</sub>) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. Typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched at close range to the target from an aircraft with an altitude and speed advantage, it will have a good chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target. Operationally, the missile, which was designed for [[Beyond-visual-range missile|beyond visual range]] combat, has a P<sub>k</sub> of 63.15% (19 missiles for 12 kills, including the Syrian Su-22 downed by a US Navy F/A-18E).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-070109-1.html|title=Coffin Corners for the Joint Strike Fighter|work=ausairpower.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322111910/http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-NOTAM-070109-1.html|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The targets included six [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]], a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]], two [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22s]], a [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb|Galeb]] and a US Army [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk]] that was targeted by mistake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html|title=The Russian Philosophy of Beyond Visual Range Air Combat|pages=1|author=Dr C Kopp|work=ausairpower.net|accessdate=April 12, 2016|date=2008-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402114905/http://ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html|archive-date=April 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40322666 \"US coalition downs first Syria government jet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930211844/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40322666 |date=September 30, 2018 }} Retrieved 19 June 2017.</ref>\n\n==Variants and upgrades==\n[[File:Aim 120 amraam missile 20040710 145603 1.4.jpg|thumb|An AIM-120 AMRAAM missile on display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum]]\n[[File:F-22 GBU39B AIM-120 m02006120800117.jpg|thumb|right|AIM-120 AMRAAM (right) fitted in a weapons bay of a [[F-22 Raptor]]]]\n\n===Air-to-air missile versions===\nThere are currently four main variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Navy]], and the United States Marine Corps.

It was nominated for the 1997 [[ARIA Music Awards of 1997|ARIA Music Award]] for Best Group, but lost to [[Savage Garden (Savage Garden album)|Savage Garden]].\n\n== Recording and production ==\n[[Silverchair]] began recording their second studio album, ''Freak Show'', in May 1996 while experiencing the success of their debut album, 1995's ''[[Frogstomp]]'', in Australia and the US.\n\n''Freak Show'' was produced by [[Nick Launay]] ([[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], [[Models (band)|Models]], [[Midnight Oil]]).<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/62OUYFdii?url=http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm | title = Silverchair | work = HowlSpace \u2013 The Living History of Our Music | last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd | archivedate = 13 October 2011 | accessdate = 13 October 2011 | url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Spencer\">{{cite book| last1 = Spencer| first1 = Chris| first2 = Paul | last2 = McHenry | first3 = Zbig | last3 = Nowara| title = The Who's Who of Australian Rock | origyear = 1989| year = 2007| publisher = Moonlight Publishing| isbn = 978-1-86503-891-9| chapter = 'silverchair' entry }}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nFrontman [[Daniel Johns]] described the album's title in 1997 by comparing the on-the-road life of Silverchair to that of a [[traveling carnival]].

Although, the majority of the songs found on the album still retain emotional and angst-fueled themes that include disease and suicide. One writer claimed the songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of ''Frogstomp'' brought upon the band.<ref name=\"Wooldridge\">{{Cite news | title = ''Freak Show'' Review | work = Juice | first = Simon | last = Wooldridge | date = February 1997 }}</ref>\n\nMany ''Freak Show'' songs such as \"Slave\", \"Freak\", \"No Association\", and \"Nobody Came\" were performed live two years prior to their release on the album.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} A demo version of \"Freak\" is featured in trailers for the 1995 space combat film ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]''.

A song entitled \"Punk Song #2\" was recorded but not renamed; it later appeared on the \"[[Freak (Silverchair song)|Freak]]\" single. \"Punk Song #3\" (\"Satin Sheets\") was originally recorded for ''Freak Show'', but was omitted from the album and included on ''[[Neon Ballroom]]'' (1999) instead.\n\nAn unreleased song entitled \"Slime\" was recorded during the ''Freak Show'' sessions, but it has yet to be released. The existence of \"Slime\" can originally be traced back to the 1996 late October/early November European press release where it is listed amongst the rest of the ''Freak Show'' track listing. The song was described in the press release as \"similar to 'No Association'\" but \"more melodic\". Thematically-speaking, it was described as the \"linchpin\" of the entire album.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n== Release ==\nAlthough ''Freak Show'' was shelved until February 1997 for the general public, European and Australian promotional pressings were officially circulated throughout the music press in late October/early November 1996. The release of ''Freak Show'' was originally slated for the autumn of 1996; it was later pushed back to avoid competition from [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[No Code]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n''Freak Show'' was released on 4 February 1997.

[[Silverchair]]. It was recorded during May\u2013November 1996 and released on 4 February 1997 by record labels [[Murmur (record label)|Murmur]] and [[Epic Records|Epic]]. It was nominated for the 1997 [[ARIA Music Awards of 1997|ARIA Music Award]] for Best Group, but lost to [[Savage Garden (Savage Garden album)|Savage Garden]].\n\n== Recording and production ==\n[[Silverchair]] began recording their second studio album, ''Freak Show'', in May 1996 while experiencing the success of their debut album, 1995's ''[[Frogstomp]]'', in Australia and the US.\n\n''Freak Show'' was produced by [[Nick Launay]] ([[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], [[Models (band)|Models]], [[Midnight Oil]]).<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/62OUYFdii?url=http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm | title = Silverchair | work = HowlSpace \u2013 The Living History of Our Music | last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd | archivedate = 13 October 2011 | accessdate = 13 October 2011 | url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Spencer\">{{cite book| last1 = Spencer| first1 = Chris| first2 = Paul | last2 = McHenry | first3 = Zbig | last3 = Nowara| title = The Who's Who of Australian Rock | origyear = 1989| year = 2007| publisher = Moonlight Publishing| isbn = 978-1-86503-891-9| chapter = 'silverchair' entry }}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nFrontman [[Daniel Johns]] described the album's title in 1997 by comparing the on-the-road life of Silverchair to that of a [[traveling carnival]]. The album's front cover image is an illustration of [[Grady Stiles|Grady Stiles, Jr.]], a sideshow performer afflicted with [[ectrodactyly]], who used the stage name \"Lobster Boy\".

Although, the majority of the songs found on the album still retain emotional and angst-fueled themes that include disease and suicide. One writer claimed the songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of ''Frogstomp'' brought upon the band.<ref name=\"Wooldridge\">{{Cite news | title = ''Freak Show'' Review | work = Juice | first = Simon | last = Wooldridge | date = February 1997 }}</ref>\n\nMany ''Freak Show'' songs such as \"Slave\", \"Freak\", \"No Association\", and \"Nobody Came\" were performed live two years prior to their release on the album.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} A demo version of \"Freak\" is featured in trailers for the 1995 space combat film ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]''. This is one of the aforementioned ''Freak Show'' songs that Silverchair debuted live as early as January 1995.<ref name=\"thebrag\">https://thebrag.com/looking-back-silverchairs-freak-show-20-years-later</ref>\n\nSeveral of the songs also had different titles prior to the album's release.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} These include: \"Cat and Mouse\" (\"The Closing\"), \"The Proxy Song\" (\"The Door\"), and \"Punk Song #1\" (\"Lie to Me\"). A song entitled \"Punk Song #2\" was recorded but not renamed; it later appeared on the \"[[Freak (Silverchair song)|Freak]]\" single. \"Punk Song #3\" (\"Satin Sheets\") was originally recorded for ''Freak Show'', but was omitted from the album and included on ''[[Neon Ballroom]]'' (1999) instead.\n\nAn unreleased song entitled \"Slime\" was recorded during the ''Freak Show'' sessions, but it has yet to be released. The existence of \"Slime\" can originally be traced back to the 1996 late October/early November European press release where it is listed amongst the rest of the ''Freak Show'' track listing. The song was described in the press release as \"similar to 'No Association'\" but \"more melodic\". Thematically-speaking, it was described as the \"linchpin\" of the entire album.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n== Release ==\nAlthough ''Freak Show'' was shelved until February 1997 for the general public, European and Australian promotional pressings were officially circulated throughout the music press in late October/early November 1996. The release of ''Freak Show'' was originally slated for the autumn of 1996; it was later pushed back to avoid competition from [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[No Code]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n''Freak Show'' was released on 4 February 1997.
