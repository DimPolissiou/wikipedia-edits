It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks.

a [[light rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, that is owned and operated by [[TriMet]]. It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded [[interurban]] railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

Sivachandra Chakravarty and Monomohini Devi were his father and mother respectively. As a young medical student in Calcutta, Anukulchandra started serving and treating the slum dwellers in 1911. After six years of study, he came back to Himaitpur and began to practice medicine.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dpublication.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iachss-121-231.pdf|title=Diamond Scientific Publication|website=dpublication.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Anukulchandra was spiritually initiated by his mother. After his initiation, he along with his friends and companions started doing intense [[kirtan]]. During kirtan, he often went into a state of trance, fell on the ground unconsciously and uttered messages in that condition. His going into trance during kirtan, delivering holy messages during trance and the devotion of those around him started attracting many more people. As a number of people came to his village to visit him began to settle permanently, gradually his village home was converted into an ashram.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThakur Anukulchandra's service to the people as a doctor, his speaking in tongues in a state of trance as well as his advice and guidance to his followers helped him secure a position as a religious leader. The personality, life and teachings of Thakur Anukulchandra mediates between science and spirituality, personal affirmation and self-transformation, individualism and social commitment has put him in the class of [[prophet]]s or [[avatar]]s of the Indian religious tradition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> His devotees address him as ''Yuga Purushottam'' or the '''Prophet of the modern age'''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Philosophy and teachings===\nThakur Anukulchandra's philosophy is based on the Being and Becoming of every living creature. According to him, science and [[Dharma]] are not opposed to each other. He says, ''the stay of all existence is dharma''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/> His philosophy teaches individuals how to approach the life's problems in a balanced, dynamic, rationalistic and scientific way. According to him, the formula of spiritual enlightenment is to lead and practice a simple but meaningful Ideal centric life, i.e. making a realized living ideal as the guide or center of one's life.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> According to him, ''\"Ideal means- who enrich the past, enliven the present and enlighten the future.\"''<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHe opined that, everything that humans do both individually and collectively must be beneficial to the human existence in their entirety. According to him-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oldhistoricity.lbp.world/Administrator/UploadedArticle/382.pdf|title=Ideas of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra on Individual and Society|website=Historicity research journal}}</ref>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\u201cThe source of all 'isms' is existentialism \u2013 no existence, no 'ism'.\"</poem>}}''\n\nThakur Anukulchandra has put forward his views and solutions on almost every aspect of life, be it individual, conjugal, family, social and universal. Most of his messages were dictations revealed primarily in [[Bengali Language|Bengali]] and [[English Language|English]] in the form of passages, simple rhymes and poetry and extensive discourses with his disciples and visitors. His messages cover the topics of dharma, religion, spiritualism, ideal, love, service and activity, society, education, philosophy, science, psychology, health and hygine, economics, industry, commerce, politics, law and administration, varnashram, culture and tradition, eugenics, genetics, heredity, marriage, woman, conjugal life, Universal laws and others.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/282247|title=Educational philosophy of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra and its relevance to modern Indian education, PhD Thesis|website=Shodhganga: A reservoir of Indian theses}}</ref>\n\nHis discourses with people were primarily compilations of him answering to the questions of individuals and groups during his meetings on a daily basis. Several volumes of the discourses have been published by the in-house publication house of Satsang. About the answers to the questions asked to him, Thakur Anukulchandra clarified as below:<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\"I have answered to thy quest\nwhat I see, what I think and what I know\nto be beneficial to our life and growth\nwith every blazing outspoken reply\nas far as I conceive.\"</poem>}}'' \n\n[[File:Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur Bungalow.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur bungalow, Satsang Ashram]]\n[[File:Main Gate of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Badlapur.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Badlapur, Mumbai, Maharashtra]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Delhi]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha]]\n[[File:Hyderabad Satsang Vihar.jpg|thumb|Hyderabad Satsang Vihar, Telangana]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bengaluru]]\n[[File:Satsang Centre at West Hartford, Connecticut, USA .jpg|thumb|Satsang Centre, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Chennai.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Chennai]]\n\n==The motto and the principles==\nSatsang was established solely on the principles and ideals of Thakur Anukulchandra. It is a non-sectarian organization as revealed by the Guru himself in his hand written book '''Satyanusaran''' originally in Bengali and later translated in to many languages including English as 'The pursuit of Truth'.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.satsang.org.in/index.php?p=satyanusaran|title=Satyanusaran|website=satsang.org.in}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this book, he writes, ''\"Oh Mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to the past prophets. Be attached to your living Master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past Prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present\"''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He again writes, ''\"Dharma never becomes many. It is always one. There is no variety of it. Views may be many- even as many as there are people. In my opinion, to speak of Hindu Dharma, Christian Dharma, Mohammedan Dharma, Buddhist Dharma etc. is wrong; rather they are so many views\"''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAs a result, people from all faiths including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims came to Thakur Anukulchandra and accepted him as their realized guide, Guru and living ideal, without diluting their identities. He always preached and guided people of different faiths who came to him to become a true Muslim, true Christian or a true Hindu according to their own faiths and practices. Satsang at present is one of the fastest growing spiritual lineage in the world with more than 80 million members across the globe. It accepts members from all walks of life without discrimination and distinction. The members of Satsang are called '''Satsangees'''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto3\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn one of his verses, Thakur Anukulchandra puts forward the motto and ideals of Satsang in its entirety as below:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7rp2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=satsang+wants+man&source=bl&ots=w3GcUsJhLo&sig=ACfU3U0cldrr7PfnX-5nQTpyWSEKBGqy0Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNkePBw4XoAhXaBogKHbtPA84Q6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=satsang%20wants%20man&f=false|title=Bliss|website=books.google.co.in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://satsangamerica.org/sites/default/files/books/Souvenir-US_2011.pdf|title=Souvenir-US_2011|website=satsangamerica.org}}</ref> \n''{{quote|<poem>Satsang wants man\n      in the name of the One Supreme Creator\n                                      of all beings,\n                  God, Khoda or Existence,\n                        Whatever you call Him.\n      Satsang does not think in terms of\n            Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist ;\n                  regarding each and everyone\n                        as a child of Him alone,\n                              Satsang wants to make all\n                                   submissive to that One.\n\nSatsang does not think in terms of\n      Pakistan, Hindustan, Russia, China, Europe or America either-\n            Satsang wants man, every individual of mankind\u2014\n                  whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Buddhist or whatever\u2014\n                        to be gathered in His Name\n                              at the clarion call of Panchabarhi*\nin pursuit, nurture and fulfilment,\n      in elevating offering,\n            in mutual compassionate co-operation\n                  and in an uplifting, efficient and industrious go of life\n                        so that everybody by proper work\n                              earning their food and clothing can survive,\n      maintaining distinctiveness of being\n            and moving in the way of becoming,\n                  so that everyone can understand\n                        that everyone belongs to him,\n            so that no one can think\n                  that he is helpless, penniless, shelter less,\n                        so that every single person can say courageously\n                              with active co-operative zeal of love\n      \"I am everyone's\n            and everyone is mine\".\n\nSatsang wants the greatest co-operation\n      between states\n            so that there is not the least flaw\n                  in anyone's existential becoming\n                        and so that each and everyone\n                              can move on freely\n                                    in this world\n                                          in one accord\nwith self-elevating, efficient and active,\n      progressive go of service,\n            growing in integration\n                  that is mutually fulfilling\u2014\n                        being illuminated with the inspiration\n                              that cultivates the good,\n            with an eye to fulfilling that Ideal man\n                  being meaningful in that unparalleled One.\n                                                              -Sree Sree Thakur Anukulchnadra (Dhriti Bidhayana, Vol-I, p394)</poem>}}''\n\n==Branches and centers==\nThe headquarters of Satsang, known as [[Satsang Ashram]] is located in the city of [[Deoghar]], [[Jharkhand]], India.

Sivachandra Chakravarty and Monomohini Devi were his father and mother respectively. As a young medical student in Calcutta, Anukulchandra started serving and treating the slum dwellers in 1911. After six years of study, he came back to Himaitpur and began to practice medicine.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dpublication.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iachss-121-231.pdf|title=Diamond Scientific Publication|website=dpublication.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Anukulchandra was spiritually initiated by his mother. After his initiation, he along with his friends and companions started doing intense [[kirtan]]. During kirtan, he often went into a state of trance, fell on the ground unconsciously and uttered messages in that condition. His going into trance during kirtan, delivering holy messages during trance and the devotion of those around him started attracting many more people. As a number of people came to his village to visit him began to settle permanently, gradually his village home was converted into an ashram.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThakur Anukulchandra's service to the people as a doctor, his speaking in tongues in a state of trance as well as his advice and guidance to his followers helped him secure a position as a religious leader. The personality, life and teachings of Thakur Anukulchandra mediates between science and spirituality, personal affirmation and self-transformation, individualism and social commitment and put him in the class of [[prophet]]s or [[avatar]]s of the Indian religious tradition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> His devotees address him as ''Yuga Purushottam'' or the '''Prophet of the modern age'''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Philosophy and teachings===\nThakur Anukulchandra's philosophy is based on the Being and Becoming of every living creature. According to him, science and [[Dharma]] are not opposed to each other. He says, ''the stay of all existence is dharma''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/> His philosophy teaches individuals how to approach the life's problems in a balanced, dynamic, rationalistic and scientific way. According to him, the formula of spiritual enlightenment is to lead and practice a simple but meaningful Ideal centric life, i.e. making a realized living ideal as the guide or center of one's life.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> According to him, ''\"Ideal means- who enrich the past, enliven the present and enlighten the future.\"''<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHe opined that, everything that humans do both individually and collectively must be beneficial to the human existence in their entirety. According to him-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oldhistoricity.lbp.world/Administrator/UploadedArticle/382.pdf|title=Ideas of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra on Individual and Society|website=Historicity research journal}}</ref>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\u201cThe source of all 'isms' is existentialism \u2013 no existence, no 'ism'.\"</poem>}}''\n\nThakur Anukulchandra has put forward his views and solutions on almost every aspect of life, be it individual, conjugal, family, social and universal. Most of his messages were dictations revealed primarily in [[Bengali Language|Bengali]] and [[English Language|English]] in the form of passages, simple rhymes and poetry and extensive discourses with his disciples and visitors. His messages cover the topics of dharma, religion, spiritualism, ideal, love, service and activity, society, education, philosophy, science, psychology, health and hygine, economics, industry, commerce, politics, law and administration, varnashram, culture and tradition, eugenics, genetics, heredity, marriage, woman, conjugal life, Universal laws and others.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/282247|title=Educational philosophy of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra and its relevance to modern Indian education, PhD Thesis|website=Shodhganga: A reservoir of Indian theses}}</ref>\n\nHis discourses with people were primarily compilations of him answering to the questions of individuals and groups during his meetings on a daily basis. Several volumes of the discourses have been published by the in-house publication house of Satsang. About the answers to the questions asked to him, Thakur Anukulchandra clarified as below:<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\"I have answered to thy quest\nwhat I see, what I think and what I know\nto be beneficial to our life and growth\nwith every blazing outspoken reply\nas far as I conceive.\"</poem>}}'' \n\n[[File:Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur Bungalow.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur bungalow, Satsang Ashram]]\n[[File:Main Gate of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Badlapur.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Badlapur, Mumbai, Maharashtra]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Delhi]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha]]\n[[File:Hyderabad Satsang Vihar.jpg|thumb|Hyderabad Satsang Vihar, Telangana]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bengaluru]]\n[[File:Satsang Centre at West Hartford, Connecticut, USA .jpg|thumb|Satsang Centre, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Chennai.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Chennai]]\n\n==The motto and the principles==\nSatsang was established solely on the principles and ideals of Thakur Anukulchandra. It is a non-sectarian organization as revealed by the Guru himself in his hand written book '''Satyanusaran''' originally in Bengali and later translated in to many languages including English as 'The pursuit of Truth'.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.satsang.org.in/index.php?p=satyanusaran|title=Satyanusaran|website=satsang.org.in}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this book, he writes, ''\"Oh Mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to the past prophets. Be attached to your living Master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past Prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present\"''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He again writes, ''\"Dharma never becomes many. It is always one. There is no variety of it. Views may be many- even as many as there are people. In my opinion, to speak of Hindu Dharma, Christian Dharma, Mohammedan Dharma, Buddhist Dharma etc. is wrong; rather they are so many views\"''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAs a result, people from all faiths including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims came to Thakur Anukulchandra and accepted him as their realized guide, Guru and living ideal, without diluting their identities. He always preached and guided people of different faiths who came to him to become a true Muslim, true Christian or a true Hindu according to their own faiths and practices. Satsang at present is one of the fastest growing spiritual lineage in the world with more than 80 million members across the globe. It accepts members from all walks of life without discrimination and distinction. The members of Satsang are called '''Satsangees'''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto3\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn one of his verses, Thakur Anukulchandra puts forward the motto and ideals of Satsang in its entirety as below:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7rp2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=satsang+wants+man&source=bl&ots=w3GcUsJhLo&sig=ACfU3U0cldrr7PfnX-5nQTpyWSEKBGqy0Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNkePBw4XoAhXaBogKHbtPA84Q6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=satsang%20wants%20man&f=false|title=Bliss|website=books.google.co.in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://satsangamerica.org/sites/default/files/books/Souvenir-US_2011.pdf|title=Souvenir-US_2011|website=satsangamerica.org}}</ref> \n''{{quote|<poem>Satsang wants man\n      in the name of the One Supreme Creator\n                                      of all beings,\n                  God, Khoda or Existence,\n                        Whatever you call Him.\n      Satsang does not think in terms of\n            Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist ;\n                  regarding each and everyone\n                        as a child of Him alone,\n                              Satsang wants to make all\n                                   submissive to that One.\n\nSatsang does not think in terms of\n      Pakistan, Hindustan, Russia, China, Europe or America either-\n            Satsang wants man, every individual of mankind\u2014\n                  whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Buddhist or whatever\u2014\n                        to be gathered in His Name\n                              at the clarion call of Panchabarhi*\nin pursuit, nurture and fulfilment,\n      in elevating offering,\n            in mutual compassionate co-operation\n                  and in an uplifting, efficient and industrious go of life\n                        so that everybody by proper work\n                              earning their food and clothing can survive,\n      maintaining distinctiveness of being\n            and moving in the way of becoming,\n                  so that everyone can understand\n                        that everyone belongs to him,\n            so that no one can think\n                  that he is helpless, penniless, shelter less,\n                        so that every single person can say courageously\n                              with active co-operative zeal of love\n      \"I am everyone's\n            and everyone is mine\".\n\nSatsang wants the greatest co-operation\n      between states\n            so that there is not the least flaw\n                  in anyone's existential becoming\n                        and so that each and everyone\n                              can move on freely\n                                    in this world\n                                          in one accord\nwith self-elevating, efficient and active,\n      progressive go of service,\n            growing in integration\n                  that is mutually fulfilling\u2014\n                        being illuminated with the inspiration\n                              that cultivates the good,\n            with an eye to fulfilling that Ideal man\n                  being meaningful in that unparalleled One.\n                                                              -Sree Sree Thakur Anukulchnadra (Dhriti Bidhayana, Vol-I, p394)</poem>}}''\n\n==Branches and centers==\nThe headquarters of Satsang, known as [[Satsang Ashram]] is located in the city of [[Deoghar]], [[Jharkhand]], India.

He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]] before forming his own company in 1981. That company, Bloomberg L.P., is a financial information, software and media firm that is known for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]]. Bloomberg spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]]. First elected [[2001 New York City mayoral election|in 2001]], he held office for three consecutive terms, winning re-election [[2005 New York City mayoral election|in 2005]] and [[2009 New York City mayoral election|in 2009]].

He also led a rezoning of large areas of New York City, which facilitated massive and widespread new commercial and residential construction after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on [[politics of New York City|the politics]], [[Economy of New York City|business sector]], and [[culture of New York City]] during his three terms as mayor.

(born February 14, 1942) is an American businessman, politician, philanthropist, and author. He is the majority owner and co-founder of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]. He was the mayor of [[New York City]] from 2002 to 2013, and was briefly a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]].\n\nBloomberg grew up in [[Medford, Massachusetts]] and graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Harvard Business School]]. He began his career at the securities brokerage [[Salomon Brothers]] before forming his own company in 1981. That company, Bloomberg L.P., is a financial information, software and media firm that is known for its [[Bloomberg Terminal]]. Bloomberg spent the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. In 2019, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked him as [[The World's Billionaires#2019|the ninth-richest person in the world]], with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion. Since signing [[The Giving Pledge]], Bloomberg has given away $8.2 billion.\n\nBloomberg was elected the [[List of mayors of New York City|108th]] [[mayor of New York City]]. First elected [[2001 New York City mayoral election|in 2001]], he held office for three consecutive terms, winning re-election [[2005 New York City mayoral election|in 2005]] and [[2009 New York City mayoral election|in 2009]].

He also led a rezoning of large areas of New York City, which facilitated massive and widespread new commercial and residential construction after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on [[politics of New York City|the politics]], [[Economy of New York City|business sector]], and [[culture of New York City]] during his three terms as mayor. He has also faced significant criticism for his expansion of the city's [[stop and frisk]] program.\n\nIn November 2019, Bloomberg officially launched [[Michael Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign|his campaign]] for the Democratic nomination for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]].

Its plot concerns amusement park [[Android (robot)|android]]s that malfunction and begin killing visitors. It stars [[Yul Brynner]] as an android in a futuristic [[American Old West|Western]]-themed amusement park, and [[Richard Benjamin]] and [[James Brolin]] as guests of the park.\n\nThe film was from an original screenplay by Crichton, and served as his [[List of directorial debuts|feature directorial debut]].<ref name=\"tcm.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12461&mainArticleId=245816 |title=Westworld |website=tcm.com |publisher=TCM |access-date=April 29, 2012}}</ref> It was also the first feature film to use [[#Digital image processing|digital image processing]] to [[pixellate]] photography to simulate an android point of view.<ref name=yaeger>[http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html A Brief, Early History of Computer Graphics in Film] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717074134/http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html |date=July 17, 2012 }}, [[Larry Yaeger]], August 16, 2002 (last update). Retrieved March 24, 2010</ref> The film was nominated for [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]], and [[Saturn Awards|Saturn]] awards.\n\n''Westworld'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), and a short-lived television series, ''[[Beyond Westworld]]'' (1980). [[Westworld (TV series)|A television series]] based on the film debuted in 2016 on [[HBO]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the then-future year of 1983, a high-tech, highly realistic adult [[amusement park]] called Delos features three themed \"worlds\": Western World (the [[American Old West]]), Medieval World ([[medieval Europe]]), and Roman World (the [[ancient Roman]] city of [[Pompeii]]). The resort's three \"worlds\" are populated with lifelike [[Android (robot)|android]]s that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and a simulated fight to the death. Delos's tagline in its advertising promises \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\nPeter Martin, a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane, on a repeat visit, go to Westworld. One of the attractions is the [[Gunfighter|Gunslinger]], an android programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting anything with a high body temperature, such as humans, but allow them to \"kill\" the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the android always returning the next day for another duel.\n\nThe technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to [[Computer virus|spread like an infection among the androids]]: the androids in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to Westworld. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the \"analogy of an infectious disease\", he is told by the chief supervisor \"We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here. These are highly complicated pieces of equipment, almost as complicated as living organisms. In some cases, they've been [[Computer-aided engineering|designed by other computers]]. We don't know exactly how they work.\"\n\nThe malfunctions become more serious when a robotic rattlesnake bites Blane in Westworld, and, against its programming, an android refuses a guest's advances in Medieval World. The failures escalate until Medieval World's [[Black knight|Black Knight]] android kills a guest in a [[Swordsmanship|sword fight]]. The resort's supervisors try to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. However, the shutdown traps them in central control when the doors automatically lock, unable to turn the power back on and escape. Meanwhile, the androids in all three worlds run amok, operating on reserve power.\n\nMartin and Blane, recovering from a drunken bar-room brawl, wake up in Westworld's [[brothel]], unaware of the park's massive breakdown. When the Gunslinger challenges the men to a showdown, Blane treats the confrontation as an amusement until the android outdraws and shoots, killing him. Martin runs for his life and the android implacably follows.\n\nMartin flees to the other areas of the park, but finds only dead guests, damaged androids, and a panicked technician attempting to escape Delos, who is shortly thereafter shot by the Gunslinger. Martin climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort's computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors, so he runs away until he enters an android-repair laboratory. When the Gunslinger enters the room, Martin pretends to be an android, throws acid into the Gunslinger's face, and flees, returning to the surface inside the Medieval World castle.\n\nWith its optical inputs damaged by the acid, the Gunslinger is unable to track Martin visually and tries to find Martin using its [[infrared]] scanners. Martin stands beneath the flaming torches of the Great Hall to mask his presence from the android, before setting it on fire with one of the torches. The burned shell of the Gunslinger attacks him on the dungeon steps before succumbing to its damage. Martin sits on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, as the irony of Delos' slogan resonates: \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as the Gunslinger\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Peter Martin\n* [[James Brolin]] as John Blane\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] as the Chief Supervisor\n* [[Victoria Shaw (actress)|Victoria Shaw]] as the Medieval Queen\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as the Banker\n* [[Linda Gaye Scott|Linda Scott]] as Arlette, the French prostitute\n* [[Steve Franken]] as the Delos technician shot dead by the Gunslinger\n* Michael Mikler as the Black Knight\n* [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]] as the Sheriff\n* [[Majel Barrett]] as Miss Carrie, madame of the Westworld bordello\n* [[Anne Randall]] as Daphne, the serving-maid who refuses the Medieval Knight's advances\n* [[Nora Marlowe]] as the Hostess\n* [[Charles Seel]] as the Bellhop\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nCrichton said he did not wish to make his feature directorial debut (after one TV film) with science fiction but \"That's the only way I could get the studio to let me direct. People think I'm good at it I guess.\"<ref name=\"los\">Author of 'Terminal Man' Building Nonterminal Career: CRICHTON; GELMIS, JOSEPH. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] January 4, 1974: d12.</ref>\n\nCrichton's agent introduced him to producer [[Paul N. Lazarus III]]; they became friends and decided to make a film together.<ref name=\"pod\">{{cite podcast|url=http://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/paul-lazarus-legends-of-film/|title=Legends of Film: Paul Lazarus|date=December 27, 2004}}</ref> The script was written in August 1972. Lazarus says he asked Crichton why he did not tell the story as a book; Crichton said he felt the story was visual, and would not really work as a book.<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\nThe script was offered to all the major studios. They all turned down the project except for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], then under head of production [[Dan Melnick]] and president [[James T. Aubrey]]. Crichton said:\n\n{{Quote | MGM had a bad reputation among filmmakers; in recent years, directors as diverse as [[Robert Altman]], [[Blake Edwards]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Fred Zinneman]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] had complained bitterly about their treatment there. There were too many stories of unreasonable pressure, arbitrary script changes, inadequate post production, and cavalier recutting of the final film. Nobody who had a choice made a picture at Metro, but then we didn't have a choice. Dan Melnick&nbsp;... assured [us]&nbsp;... that we would not be subjected to the usual MGM treatment. In large part, he made good on that promise.<ref>Crichton p. ix</ref>}}\n\nCrichton said pre-production was difficult. MGM demanded script changes up to the first day of shooting and the leads were not signed until 48 hours before shooting began. Crichton said he had no control over casting<ref name=\"los\"/> and MGM originally would only make the film for under a million dollars but later increased this amount by $250,000.<ref name=\"Crichton p x\"/> Crichton said that $250,000 of the budget was paid to the cast, $400,000 to the crew and the remainder on everything else (including $75,000 for sets).<ref>Crichton p. x\u2013xi</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\n''Westworld'' was filmed in several locations, including the [[Mojave Desert]], the gardens of the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]], several MGM [[sound stage]]s and on the MGM [[backlot]], one of the final films to be shot there.<ref name=\"tcm.com\"/> It was filmed with [[Panavision]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses by [[Gene Polito]].\n\nRichard Benjamin later said he loved making the film:\n\n{{Quote | It probably was the only way I was ever going to get into a Western, and certainly into a science-fiction Western.... So you get to do stuff that's like you're 12 years old. All of the reasons you went to the movies in the first place.

A splash of water then produced the fizzing effect.\n\nThe score for ''Westworld'' was composed by American composer [[Fred Karlin]]. It combines [[Ersatz good|ersatz]] western scoring, [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|source cues]], and [[electronic music]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/cdID/348/ |title=Film Score Monthly CD: Coma/Westworld/The Carey Treatment |website= Filmscoremonthly.com |access-date=April 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCrichton later wrote that since \"most of the situations in the film are cliches; they are incidents out of hundreds of old movies\" that the scenes \"should be shot as [[clich\u00e9]]s. This dictated a conventional treatment in the choice of lenses and the staging.\"<ref>Crichton p. xiii</ref>\n\nThe movie was shot in 30 days. In order to save time, Crichton tried to shoot only what was needed.<ref>Crichton p. xvi</ref>\n\nThe original script and original ending of the movie culminated in a fight between Martin and the Gunslinger, which resulted in the Gunslinger being torn apart by a rack. Crichton said he \"had liked the idea of a complex machine being destroyed by a simple machine\", but when attempting it, \"it seemed stagey and foolish\", so the idea was dropped.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\">Crichton p. xix</ref> He also wanted to open the film with shots of a hovercraft traveling over the desert, but was unable to get the effect he wanted, so this was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nIn the novelization, Crichton explained how he re-edited the first cut of the movie, because he was depressed by how long and boring it was. Scenes that were deleted from the rough cut include a bank robbery and sales room sequences, an opening with a hovercraft flying above the desert, additional and longer dialogue scenes, more scenes with robots attacking and killing guests including a scene where one guest is tied down to a rack and is killed when his arms are pulled out, a longer chase scene with the Gunslinger chasing Peter, and one where the Gunslinger cleans his face with water after Peter throws acid on him. Crichton's assembly cut featured a different ending that included a fight between Gunslinger and Peter, and an alternate death scene in which the Gunslinger was killed on a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putlearningfirst.com/br/westworldshoot.html|title=Shooting Westworld}}</ref>\n\nA Yul Brynner biography mentions that 10 minutes of \"adult material\" was cut, because of the censors, probably for [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#From M to GP to PG|PG rating]], but no details about footage that was cut for rating issues were mentioned in Brynner's biography or anywhere else.\n\nOnce the film was completed, MGM authorized the shooting of some extra footage. A television commercial to open the film was added; because there was a writers' strike in Hollywood at the time, this was written by Steven Frankfurt, a New York advertising executive.<ref>Crichton p xvii</ref>\n\n===Digital image processing===\n''Westworld'' was the first feature film to use [[digital image processing]]. Crichton originally went to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, but after learning that two minutes of animation would take nine months and cost $200,000, he contacted [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney Sr.]], who in turn recommended his son John Whitney Jr. The latter went to [[Information International, Inc.]], where they could work at night and complete the animation both faster and much more cheaply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/512325-whitney-family-pioneers-computer-animation/|title=The Whitney Family: Pioneers in Computer Animation |website=Tested.com}}</ref> Whitney Jr. digitally processed motion picture photography at Information International, Inc. to appear [[Pixelization|pixelized]] in order to portray the Gunslinger android's [[Point-of-view shot|point of view]].<ref name=yaeger/> The approximately 2 minutes and 31 seconds' worth of cinegraphic block portraiture was accomplished by color-separating (three basic color separations plus black mask) each frame of source [[70 mm film]] images, scanning each of these elements to convert into rectangular blocks, then adding basic color according to the tone values developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec17.php |title=Ed Manning BlocPix |website=Atariarchives.org |access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> The resulting coarse pixel matrix was output back to film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |title=Chapter 4: A HISTORY OF COMPUTER ANIMATION 3/20/92 (note that this article is in error about the year the film was made) |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406031124/http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The process was covered in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' article \"Behind the scenes of Westworld\"<ref>''[[American Cinematographer]]'' 54(11):1394-1397, 1420-1421, 1436-1437.

Retrieved March 24, 2010</ref> The film was nominated for [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]], and [[Saturn Awards|Saturn]] awards.\n\n''Westworld'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), and a short-lived television series, ''[[Beyond Westworld]]'' (1980). [[Westworld (TV series)|A television series]] based on the film debuted in 2016 on [[HBO]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the then-future year of 1983, a high-tech, highly realistic adult [[amusement park]] called Delos features three themed \"worlds\": Western World (the [[American Old West]]), Medieval World ([[medieval Europe]]), and Roman World (the [[ancient Roman]] city of [[Pompeii]]). The resort's three \"worlds\" are populated with lifelike [[Android (robot)|android]]s that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and a simulated fight to the death. Delos's tagline in its advertising promises \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\nPeter Martin, a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane, on a repeat visit, go to Westworld. One of the attractions is the [[Gunfighter|Gunslinger]], an android programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting anything with a high body temperature, such as humans, but allow them to \"kill\" the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the android always returning the next day for another duel.\n\nThe technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to [[Computer virus|spread like an infection among the androids]]: the androids in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to Westworld. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the \"analogy of an infectious disease\", he is told by the chief supervisor \"We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here. These are highly complicated pieces of equipment, almost as complicated as living organisms. In some cases, they've been [[Computer-aided engineering|designed by other computers]]. We don't know exactly how they work.\"\n\nThe malfunctions become more serious when a robotic rattlesnake bites Blane in Westworld, and, against its programming, an android refuses a guest's advances in Medieval World. The failures escalate until Medieval World's [[Black knight|Black Knight]] android kills a guest in a [[Swordsmanship|sword fight]]. The resort's supervisors try to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. However, the shutdown traps them in central control when the doors automatically lock, unable to turn the power back on and escape. Meanwhile, the androids in all three worlds run amok, operating on reserve power.\n\nMartin and Blane, recovering from a drunken bar-room brawl, wake up in Westworld's [[brothel]], unaware of the park's massive breakdown. When the Gunslinger challenges the men to a showdown, Blane treats the confrontation as an amusement until the android outdraws and shoots, killing him. Martin runs for his life and the android implacably follows.\n\nMartin flees to the other areas of the park, but finds only dead guests, damaged androids, and a panicked technician attempting to escape Delos, who is shortly thereafter shot by the Gunslinger. Martin climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort's computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors, so he runs away until he enters an android-repair laboratory. When the Gunslinger enters the room, Martin pretends to be an android, throws acid into the Gunslinger's face, and flees, returning to the surface inside the Medieval World castle.\n\nWith its optical inputs damaged by the acid, the Gunslinger is unable to track Martin visually and tries to find Martin using its [[infrared]] scanners. Martin stands beneath the flaming torches of the Great Hall to mask his presence from the android, before setting it on fire with one of the torches. The burned shell of the Gunslinger attacks him on the dungeon steps before succumbing to its damage. Martin sits on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, as the irony of Delos' slogan resonates: \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as the Gunslinger\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Peter Martin\n* [[James Brolin]] as John Blane\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] as the Chief Supervisor\n* [[Victoria Shaw (actress)|Victoria Shaw]] as the Medieval Queen\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as the Banker\n* [[Linda Gaye Scott|Linda Scott]] as Arlette, the French prostitute\n* [[Steve Franken]] as the Delos technician shot dead by the Gunslinger\n* Michael Mikler as the Black Knight\n* [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]] as the Sheriff\n* [[Majel Barrett]] as Miss Carrie, madame of the Westworld bordello\n* [[Anne Randall]] as Daphne, the serving-maid who refuses the Medieval Knight's advances\n* [[Nora Marlowe]] as the Hostess\n* [[Charles Seel]] as the Bellhop\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nCrichton said he did not wish to make his feature directorial debut (after one TV film) with science fiction but \"That's the only way I could get the studio to let me direct.

Lazarus III]]; they became friends and decided to make a film together.<ref name=\"pod\">{{cite podcast|url=http://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/paul-lazarus-legends-of-film/|title=Legends of Film: Paul Lazarus|date=December 27, 2004}}</ref> The script was written in August 1972. Lazarus says he asked Crichton why he did not tell the story as a book; Crichton said he felt the story was visual, and would not really work as a book.<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\nThe script was offered to all the major studios. They all turned down the project except for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], then under head of production [[Dan Melnick]] and president [[James T. Aubrey]]. Crichton said:\n\n{{Quote | MGM had a bad reputation among filmmakers; in recent years, directors as diverse as [[Robert Altman]], [[Blake Edwards]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Fred Zinneman]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] had complained bitterly about their treatment there. There were too many stories of unreasonable pressure, arbitrary script changes, inadequate post production, and cavalier recutting of the final film. Nobody who had a choice made a picture at Metro, but then we didn't have a choice. Dan Melnick&nbsp;... assured [us]&nbsp;... that we would not be subjected to the usual MGM treatment. In large part, he made good on that promise.<ref>Crichton p. ix</ref>}}\n\nCrichton said pre-production was difficult. MGM demanded script changes up to the first day of shooting and the leads were not signed until 48 hours before shooting began. Crichton said he had no control over casting<ref name=\"los\"/> and MGM originally would only make the film for under a million dollars but later increased this amount by $250,000.<ref name=\"Crichton p x\"/> Crichton said that $250,000 of the budget was paid to the cast, $400,000 to the crew and the remainder on everything else (including $75,000 for sets).<ref>Crichton p. x\u2013xi</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\n''Westworld'' was filmed in several locations, including the [[Mojave Desert]], the gardens of the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]], several MGM [[sound stage]]s and on the MGM [[backlot]], one of the final films to be shot there.<ref name=\"tcm.com\"/> It was filmed with [[Panavision]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses by [[Gene Polito]].\n\nRichard Benjamin later said he loved making the film:\n\n{{Quote | It probably was the only way I was ever going to get into a Western, and certainly into a science-fiction Western....

This dictated a conventional treatment in the choice of lenses and the staging.\"<ref>Crichton p. xiii</ref>\n\nThe movie was shot in 30 days. In order to save time, Crichton tried to shoot only what was needed.<ref>Crichton p. xvi</ref>\n\nThe original script and original ending of the movie culminated in a fight between Martin and the Gunslinger, which resulted in the Gunslinger being torn apart by a rack. Crichton said he \"had liked the idea of a complex machine being destroyed by a simple machine\", but when attempting it, \"it seemed stagey and foolish\", so the idea was dropped.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\">Crichton p. xix</ref> He also wanted to open the film with shots of a hovercraft traveling over the desert, but was unable to get the effect he wanted, so this was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nIn the novelization, Crichton explained how he re-edited the first cut of the movie, because he was depressed by how long and boring it was. Scenes that were deleted from the rough cut include a bank robbery and sales room sequences, an opening with a hovercraft flying above the desert, additional and longer dialogue scenes, more scenes with robots attacking and killing guests including a scene where one guest is tied down to a rack and is killed when his arms are pulled out, a longer chase scene with the Gunslinger chasing Peter, and one where the Gunslinger cleans his face with water after Peter throws acid on him. Crichton's assembly cut featured a different ending that included a fight between Gunslinger and Peter, and an alternate death scene in which the Gunslinger was killed on a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putlearningfirst.com/br/westworldshoot.html|title=Shooting Westworld}}</ref>\n\nA Yul Brynner biography mentions that 10 minutes of \"adult material\" was cut, because of the censors, probably for [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#From M to GP to PG|PG rating]], but no details about footage that was cut for rating issues were mentioned in Brynner's biography or anywhere else.\n\nOnce the film was completed, MGM authorized the shooting of some extra footage. A television commercial to open the film was added; because there was a writers' strike in Hollywood at the time, this was written by Steven Frankfurt, a New York advertising executive.<ref>Crichton p xvii</ref>\n\n===Digital image processing===\n''Westworld'' was the first feature film to use [[digital image processing]]. Crichton originally went to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, but after learning that two minutes of animation would take nine months and cost $200,000, he contacted [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney Sr.]], who in turn recommended his son John Whitney Jr. The latter went to [[Information International, Inc.]], where they could work at night and complete the animation both faster and much more cheaply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/512325-whitney-family-pioneers-computer-animation/|title=The Whitney Family: Pioneers in Computer Animation |website=Tested.com}}</ref> Whitney Jr. digitally processed motion picture photography at Information International, Inc. to appear [[Pixelization|pixelized]] in order to portray the Gunslinger android's [[Point-of-view shot|point of view]].<ref name=yaeger/> The approximately 2 minutes and 31 seconds' worth of cinegraphic block portraiture was accomplished by color-separating (three basic color separations plus black mask) each frame of source [[70 mm film]] images, scanning each of these elements to convert into rectangular blocks, then adding basic color according to the tone values developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec17.php |title=Ed Manning BlocPix |website=Atariarchives.org |access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> The resulting coarse pixel matrix was output back to film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |title=Chapter 4: A HISTORY OF COMPUTER ANIMATION 3/20/92 (note that this article is in error about the year the film was made) |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406031124/http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The process was covered in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' article \"Behind the scenes of Westworld\"<ref>''[[American Cinematographer]]'' 54(11):1394-1397, 1420-1421, 1436-1437.

Tony learns that Don Vittorio, [[crime boss|boss]] of the  Naples family, is senile and that his son-in-law, Mauro Zucca, is serving a life sentence. He finds it very hard to accept that [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Annalisa Zucca|Annalisa]], who is Vittorio's daughter and Mauro's wife, is the effective head of the family.\n\nTony names his price for the cars, and also wants Furio transferred to America to work for him, and others later, as he requires. Annalisa negotiates hard, scoffs at his price, and tensions are further raised by their mutual sexual attraction. He lowers his price and they shake on it; he does not seem very pleased. Annalisa comes on to him; he tells her he wishes to keep their relationship professional. \n\nTony is accompanied to Naples by [[Paulie Walnuts|Paulie]] and [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]]. The former goes on a mission to rediscover his roots, only to uncover a distaste for Naples; the latter is doped on [[heroin]] almost all the time.\n\nWhile Tony is away, [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]], who is resentful that Tony has not taken her, has lunch with [[Rosalie Aprile]] and [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Angie Bonpensiero|Angie Bonpensiero]]. Angie shocks them by saying that when [[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|Pussy]] returned she wished he had died; he is indifferent to her, even now that she has a tumor; she has thought of suicide; and she  intends to divorce him. Carmela later visits her, urging her not to break the sacrament of marriage.  \n\nWhile with his [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] handler, [[FBI Informants on The Sopranos#Agent Skip Lipari|Skip Lipari]], Pussy runs into [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Jimmy Bones|Jimmy Bones]], a Soprano associate. The pair concoct a cover story but Pussy is afraid he does not believe it. He goes to Jimmy's home and beats him to death with a [[ball-peen hammer]]. He then goes to his own home and gives a bunch of flowers to Angie, whose tumor, she has told him, is benign. She takes the flowers, pauses, then beats him with them.\n\nTony returns home.

Schulz]]. She was originally a major character, until she was eventually relegated to  background and cameo appearances.\n\nViolet is best known as a bit of a snob who likes bragging and, along with her friends [[Patty (Peanuts)|Patty]] (her best friend) and [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] often teases and torments [[Charlie Brown]].\n\nIn addition to the comic strip, Violet has appeared alongside other ''Peanuts'' characters in numerous ''Peanuts'' television specials, cinematic movies, theatrical plays, and video games.\n\n== History ==\nViolet was first featured in the February 7, 1951 ''Peanuts'' strip.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/02/07|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for February 07, 1951 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1951-02-07|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> From there on, Violet's character changed and developed until the 1960s, when she began to be seen less often than the other major characters, with her  appearances eventually reduced to  the background and cameos. Her last appearance in the strip, discounting the reruns, was on the November 27, 1997 ''Peanuts'' strip.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1997/11/27|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for November 27, 1997 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1997-11-27|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref>\n\n== Appearance ==\nAs Violet's character developed over the years, her appearance changed as well. In the early strips, Violet has her shoulder-length dark hair kept in either pigtails, a bun, or, sometimes, a ponytail. Later on, Schulz dropped the braids and kept Violet's hair only in ponytails. Violet also wears front bangs and often wears dresses which are originally depicted as purple; later they were depicted as green, as well as black [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] shoes. Violet wears her classic purple dress in ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''.\n\n== Personality ==\nViolet is smart, popular, and somewhat of a [[snob]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Violet Gray {{!}} The Peanuts Movie {{!}} NOW PLAYING|url = http://www.peanutsmovie.com/characters/violet|website = Peanuts Movie {{!}} Official Site {{!}} NOW PLAYING!|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}</ref> She makes her opinions known to everyone,<ref name=\":0\"/> and her haughtiness causes her to often torment other people,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Against Snoopy {{!}} Manhattan, New York, NY {{!}} News|url = http://www.nypress.com/against-snoopy/|website = www.nypress.com|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}</ref> whom she views as beneath her.\n\nCompared to the apparent [[middle-class]] upbringing of the other characters, Violet is supposedly of [[upper-class]] mentality, and she likes to brag about how her father possesses something her friends' fathers don't; it is also implied, however, that Violet's father is often absent from her life, which her peers use against her when she gets too obnoxious. For example, in a [[Father's Day]] strip, her boasts are quelled by Charlie Brown when he takes her to his dad's barber shop. After telling her about how his dad would always smile at him no matter how bad a workday he was having, a moved and humbled Violet walked away, but not before quietly wishing Charlie Brown a Happy Father's Day. In another example, a character named \"[[list of minor characters in Peanuts#555 95472|5]]\" fired back at her with \"''My'' dad goes to [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meetings!\" Charlie Brown once deflated her with the comeback: \"''My'' dad has a ''son''.\"<ref>Schulz, Charles M.

By the 1960s, however, Violet, too, was largely phased out with the introduction of the next wave of characters ([[Peppermint Patty]], [[Marcie (Peanuts)|Marcie]], [[Franklin (Peanuts)|Franklin]] and such). Schulz admitted in a 1988 interview that Violet's pure vindictiveness had made it difficult to give her [[punch line]]s. Speaking of her, Patty and Shermy: \"Some characters just don't seem to have enough personality to carry out ideas. They're just almost born straight men.\" Violet's use in the strip was eventually reduced to appearances in the background.\n\n== Relationship with other ''Peanuts ''characters ==\n\n=== Interactions with Charlie Brown ===\nViolet often teased [[Charlie Brown]] (often adding a series of Nyah's), who often makes comebacks. In an example of such, Violet once said to him, \"It simply goes without saying that you are an inferior human being.\"  His adroit reply to this was, \"If it goes without saying, why did ''you'' have to say it?\" She, along with Patty, do not invite him to their parties and enjoyed tormenting him with this. Charlie Brown is usually depressed by this, but sometimes he decides to turn the tables on the two girls.  For example:\n* ''November 23, 1951'':  When they mentioned excluding Charlie Brown from their party, he let it roll off his back saying he did not want to go to their \"dumb ol' party\" anyway. After he left, they pondered whether he meant it. Violet was convinced he did, so Patty suggested \"In that case, maybe we'd better invite him.\"\n* ''January 29, 1954'':  Charlie Brown replied to them saying if they did not like him they were better off not inviting him. Stunned to silence, the girls just walked away, with Charlie Brown smiling after them.\n* ''September 1, 1954'':  Charlie Brown uncharacteristically threatened to [[strafe]], then [[bomb]] their house if he was not invited, to which both girls replied, \"Okay, you're invited.\"\nIn early strips, Violet was linked to romantic scenarios involving Shermy or Charlie Brown. She also feels bad for Charlie Brown when he doesn't get a Valentine's Day card in ''Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown'', which hints that she cares about him deep down (this caring is inconsistent; when he doesn't receive a Christmas card in ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', Violet responds in her usual mocking tone).\n\nAlthough Charlie Brown was the usual recipient of Violet's cruelty, he was not the only one.  One memorable Sunday strip of September 20, 1959, featured her hurling a series of virulent insults at Lucy (so venomous that Charlie Brown remarked that he was glad she wasn't yelling at ''him'', because he wouldn't have been able to take it), although ultimately Lucy won this battle by unleashing her own string of rapid-fire insults at Violet, causing Violet to walk away in shock.  Nor was Linus immune - one 1961 strip involved her and Patty mocking Linus for carrying a blanket (to which Linus responded by wrapping himself in his blanket and doing an impression of [[Count Dracula]], leading both girls to flee in terror). She and Patty insult 'Pig-Pen' in various comic strips and specials.\n\nViolet also is often prone to using physical violence against Charlie Brown in various comics. Some examples are:\n\n* April 1953, Violet Gray punches Charlie Brown on top of his head after he says, \"Ol' tattletale Gray, huh?\"\n*August 4, 1963, an angry Violet is seen chasing Charlie Brown, threatening to \"knock (his) block off\". Before she can throw a punch, Charlie Brown stops her and tries to reason with her, saying that there are better ways to solve problems than with violence. Unfazed, Violet ends up punching him in the middle of his speech, and in the final panel admits to Patty, \"I had to hit him quick. He was beginning to make sense!\"\n\n=== Interactions with Patty ===\nViolet and [[Patty (Peanuts)|Patty]] were friends, and would be seen walking about with each other, talking, and making mud pies. Despite this, not all their interactions were friendly, as on the 4th of April 1953, Patty calls Violet a 'tattletale' and storms off.\n<ref name=\"auto\"/><br />\n\n=== Interactions with Lucy van Pelt ===\nViolet and Lucy were also close friends, and would be seen together sometimes accompanied by Patty teasing Charlie Brown in the TV specials and films, or walking and talking with each other in them and the comics. Sometimes, they wouldn't bee to friendly towards each other as in one strip they were verbally fighting each other with insults, in which Lucy won.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1959/09/20|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for September 20, 1959 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=1959-09-20|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n=== Interactions with 'Pig-Pen' ===\nViolet always insults \"Pig-Pen\". For example, In a strip Violet attempts to shame 'Pig-Pen' by making him look in a mirror and she asks him, \"Aren't you ashamed?\" to which 'Pig-Pen' replies, \"On the contrary. I didn't think I looked this good.\" He also told Violet \"I forgot to rake my hair\" when she mocked him for having leaves on his head in a strip from November 16, 1984. In the Peanuts educational computer game, It's the Big Game, Charlie Brown, 'Pig-Pen' says that he is in love with Violet, due to her habit of making mud pies. However, this has never been stated in the comic strip, and therefore cannot be considered canon. But it has been hinted in the strip, for example, in one early strip, 'Pig-Pen' cleans up after seeing Violet hug Snoopy, complaining that no one ever hugged him this way, to impress her and possibly get a hug.\n<br />\n\n=== Interactions with Shermy ===\nShermy and Violet were seen talking a few times, for example in a strip where Charlie Brown is called to the office and comes back as a safety patrol member, they discuss it. In early strips, there was hint at a love rivalry between him, Charlie, and Violet. In the strip from January 9, 1952, Shermy claims that Violet is the most prettiest girl in the world. However, Charlie Brown rides on a sled with Snoopy running, yelling \"MUSH! MUSH!\" It is presumed Violet thought Shermy was lying, as in the next panel Shermy beats up Charlie Brown. However, in 1959, where Violet talks to Charlie Brown at the wall. She says that Shermy should be her friend, but he just isn't.\n<br />\n\n=== Interactions with Snoopy ===\nViolet has a good relationship with Snoopy and unlike Lucy, she is not afraid to be licked or kissed by him. In one strip, Lucy lashes out at the dog, but Violet comforts him and hugs him. Violet can frequently be seen cuddling with Snoopy, especially in the 50's.\n\n==Voiced by==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Sally Dryer]] (1963, 1965)\n*Karen Mendelson (1966)\n*Ann Altieri (1966-1969)\n*Linda Ercoli (1972-1975, 1976)\n*Lynn Mortensen (1974)\n*Linda Jenner (1974)\n*Roseline Rubens (1980)\n*[[Stacy Ferguson]] (1985)\n*Deanna Tello (1992)\n*[[Ashley Edner]] (2000)\n*Kaitlyn Maggio (2003)\n*Jolean Wejbe (2006)\n*Taya Calicetto (2008-2009)\n*Blesst Bowden (2011)\n*[[Madisyn Shipman]] (2015)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1951/02/07 First appearance of Violet], ''Peanuts'', 7 February 1951\n\n{{wikiquote|Peanuts#Violet|Violet}}\n{{Peanuts}}\n\n[[Category:Peanuts characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1951]]\n[[Category:Child characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional bullies]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Violet (''Peanuts'')}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name       = Violet Gray\n| series     = [[Peanuts]]\n| image      = [[File:Violet peanuts.jpg|frameless]]\n| caption    = \n| first      = February 7, 1951<br>''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (television special)<br>''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'' (film)\n| gender     = Female\n| family      = Unnamed father\n| voice      = [[Sally Dryer]] (1963, 1965)<br />Karen Mendelson (1966)<br />Ann Altieri (1966-1969)<br />Linda Ercoli (1972-1975, 1976)<br />Lynn Mortensen (1974)<br />[[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Jenner]] (1974)<br />Roseline Rubens (1980)<br />[[Fergie (singer)|Stacy Ferguson]] (1985)<br />Deanna Tello (1992)<br />[[Ashley Edner]] (2000)<br>Kaitlyn Maggio (2003)<br />Jolean Wejbe (2006)<br>Taya Calicetto (2008-2009)<br />Blesst Bowden (2011)<br>[[Madisyn Shipman]] (2015)\n|color = #00FF00}}\n'''Violet Gray''' is a fictional character featured in the long-running syndicated [[Daily strip|daily]] and [[Sunday strip|Sunday]] [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'', created by [[Charles M.

The show was first sold to the CBC, but the Levys decided against ABC as its U.S. broadcaster due to the network's alleged history of creative interference.

Cable networks [[HBO]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on the series, while broadcast networks [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (United States) and the [[CBC Television|CBC]] (Canada) expressed interest. The show was first sold to the CBC, but the Levys decided against ABC as its U.S. broadcaster due to the network's alleged history of creative interference. ''Schitt's Creek'' eventually found a U.S. home on Pop TV after striking a deal with network head Brad Schwartz, who had previously hired Daniel on [[MTV (Canada)|MTV Canada]].<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nDuring the early stages of development, various networks suggested the title of the show be changed to make it sound less profane. The Levys resisted these suggestions and argued \"Schitt\" was a legitimate last name. To prove their point, they brought pages copied from a phone book to the CBC showing listings for individuals with the \"Schitt\" surname.

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most powerful polities in eastern Indonesia, both politically and economically. The twin kingdoms' attempt to retain their hegemony brought them to a conflict with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), which wanted to monopolize the [[spice trade]] in the [[Moluccas]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=45\u201347}} In 1660, the Dutch attacked Gowa and managed to seize the fort of Paqnakkukang.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=49}} Gowa then forced its vassals to provide labor to build military constructions in anticipation of further conflict, which ultimately resulted in a rebellion led by the Bon\u00e9 noble [[Arung Palakka]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=50\u201352}} However, his attempt to revive the ''Tellumpocco'' alliance failed, as Wajoq refused to break its treaty with Gowa to join forces with the rebels.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=54}}<!-- According to the historian [[Leonard Andaya]], Wajoq's decision can be explained by the fact that its recent experiences with Gowa were much more positive than those with Bon\u00e9.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}} In the most recent memory of the Wajorese, it was Bon\u00e9, not Gowa, which invaded their country. Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 also had frequent disputes over territorial boundaries and the allegiance of their vassals.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}}{{efn|system of vassals...}} On the other hand, Wajoq's relationship with Gowa had been more friendly in the preceding years; Wajoq was one of Gowa's most trusted vassals, with the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Senngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) had even been married to a daughter of Gowa ruler [[Hasanuddin of Gowa|Hasanuddin]] (r. 1653\u20131669).{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 54\u201355}}--> Lacking enough support, the rebellion was successfully quelled by Gowa and Wajoq forces, driving Arung Palakka to escape to [[Buton]], and later, to [[Batavia]], seeking aid from the VOC.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=56\u201359, 66}}\n\nDuring the [[Makassar War]] (1666\u20131669), Wajoq fiercely supported Gowa against the alliance of the VOC and local forces from Bon\u00e9 and elsewhere led by Arung Palakka. Even after the fall of Gowa's court Sombaopu and the formal surrender of Gowa and Talloq, the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Sengngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) still refused to abide by the [[Treaty of Bungaya]] and continued to resist the Dutch and Bon\u00e9 forces.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=31\u201332}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 124\u2013126, 138}} By mid-1670, Arung Palakka had launched a large-scale invasion of Wajoq.<!-- Along the way, several Wajoq's vassals deserted and joined Bon\u00e9 forces, bringing the total number of invading forces to around 40,000 people when it arrived to besiege Tosora, the walled capital city of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=138\u2013139}}--> Despite hard resistance from Wajorese defenders, the walled capital city of Tosora fell to the Bon\u00e9-led forces in December 1670. La Tenrilai was [[killed in action]], and his successor [[La Paliliq To Malu]] (r. 1670\u20131679) was forced to sign a treaty restricting Wajorese political, trade and military powers, in addition to the Treaty of Bungaya.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=140\u2013141}} In spite of Wajoq's surrender, it still faced harsh retribution from Arung Palakka and the people of Bon\u00e9.

By this time, Arung Palakka had been sending soldiers to help the VOC in [[Trunajaya rebellion|a campaign in Java]], and the VOC did not want to risk severing their relationship with an important ally.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=37\u201338}}{{sfnp|Andaya|pp=142\u2013143, 190\u2013192, 205}}\n\nIt was these difficulties faced by the Wajorese in their homeland which prompted them to emigrate elsewhere.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}} While migration had always been an important part of Wajorese culture, it was particularly prominent in the aftermath of the Makassar War, when a large number of Wajorese migrants established themselves abroad in Makassar, eastern [[Borneo]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and the [[Straits of Malacca]] area, among other places.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=38, 82}}{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} These diaspora communities were connected to their homeland as well as to each other by familial, commercial, political and legal ties.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}} By the early 18th century, a sequence of Wajorese rulers had began to take advantage of these connections to revitalize their country. Several rulers ordered their people abroad to buy weapons to rearm Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}}{{sfnp|Duli|2010|pp=144\u2013145}} Attention was also given to commerce; one particular ''arung matoa'', [[La Tenriwerrung Puanna Sangngaji]] (r. 1711\u20131713), even proclaimed it as a moral duty, noting that the people of Wajoq \"could not 'stand upright' unless they sought riches\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}} His successor, [[La Sal\u00e9wangeng To Tenrirua]] (r. 1713\u20131736), actively supported international commerce in more practical ways.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=82\u201383}} He dredged the river that leads to the capital Tosora to ease access for large boats, strengthened local industries by requiring them to appoint political representatives known as ''akkajenangngeng'', created an official governmental post with the specific role of promoting trade, and set up a fund which can be used for investment on commerce and agriculture as well as for social security purposes.{{sfnp|Duli|2010|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=82\u201383}}\n\n=== Wajoq under La Maddukelleng (1730\u20131754) ===\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nSince Arung Palakka's death in 1696, none of his successor was as capable as him in maintaining Bon\u00e9's hegemony over South Sulawesi. This allowed Wajorese trade to flourish without much restriction.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=30, 69}} Interaction between Wajorese diaspora communities and their homeland intensified, and it culminated in the 1730s when the exiled Wajorese [[La Maddukelleng]] came back to South Sulawesi.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=137}} At first, he and his followers raided several communities in the western part of the peninsula and in the islands near Makassar.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=55}} In 1736, he assumed the leadership of P\u00e9n\u00e9ki (a constituent polity of Wajoq) and got involved in a confrontation with Bon\u00e9.

These communities were related to each other as well as to the central government at Tosora in various ways, ranging from vassalage to alliance \"as between brothers\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=176\u2013177}} The polity of Wajoq was divided into three ''limpo'' or main districts, namely B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, Tua, and Talotenreng, which represented its three original founding communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=177\u2013178}} Each ''limpo'' held power over several smaller communities that either chose to affiliate themselves with the said ''limpo'' or were conquered.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=50}} Each of these communities had considerable freedom, with its own leader and customs. It can also switch allegiance between different states, and by doing so, both its people and its territory will be subject to the new state.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}\n\n<!--Arung matoa is the highest...-->In running the day-to-day administration of Wajoq, the ''arung matoa'' was assisted by three pairs of civilian and military leaders, each pair representing one of the three ''limpo''.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} The civilian leader of a ''limpo'' was called a ''ranreng'' or regent, while the military leader was called a ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' or \"standard bearer\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}} The titles of the ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were taken from the banner they carried: ''Pilla'' or \"Scarlet\" for B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, ''Patola'' or \"Multi-colored\" for Talotenreng, and ''Cakkuridi'' or \"Yellow\" for Tua.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=485}} Each of the ''ranreng'' and  ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were at least as powerful as the ''arung matoa''; together, these seven officials formed the state's highest governing body, known as ''Petta Wajoq''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}}\n\nThe ''arung matoa'' was chosen among the \"white-blood\" or nobility class. The position of arung matoa cannot be held at once with another office. It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}}\n<!--\nThe power of ''Arung Patampulu'' is balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district. ''Punggawa'' had considerable power... \n\n- Diaspora governmental structure (focus on Borneo and Makassar)...\n-->\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Bugis people}}\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nWajorese texts often reiterate that \"the people of Wajoq are free\", and that their only master is the customary law, which is based on consensus. The concept of the \"freedoms of Wajoq\" included, among others: [[freedom of speech|freedom of expressing opinions]], freedom to act based on one's intention, [[freedom of movement]], [[freedom of contract]], and the freedom from unjust punishment.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=148}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=481}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=433, 447\u2013448}} These \"freedoms\", however, had limitations and do not necessarily apply to the whole population.\n\nBugis women in the precolonial states of South Sulawesi were routinely involved in many aspects of the society. Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other.

This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most powerful polities in eastern Indonesia, both politically and economically.

These communities were related to each other as well as to the central government at Tosora in various ways, ranging from vassalage to alliance \"as between brothers\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=176\u2013177}} The polity of Wajoq was divided into three ''limpo'' or main districts, namely B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, Tua, and Talotenreng, which represented its three original founding communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=177\u2013178}} Each ''limpo'' held power over several smaller communities that either chose to affiliate themselves with the said ''limpo'' or were conquered.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=50}} Each of these communities had considerable freedom, with its own leader and customs. It can also switch allegiance between different states, and by doing so, both its people and its territory will be subject to the new state.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}\n\n<!--Arung matoa is the highest...-->In running the day-to-day administration of Wajoq, the ''arung matoa'' was assisted by three pairs of civilian and military leaders, each pair representing one of the three ''limpo''.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} The civilian leader of a ''limpo'' was called a ''ranreng'' or regent, while the military leader was called a ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' or \"standard bearer\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}} The titles of the ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were taken from the banner they carried: ''Pilla'' or \"Scarlet\" for B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, ''Patola'' or \"Multi-colored\" for Talotenreng, and ''Cakkuridi'' or \"Yellow\" for Tua.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=485}} Each of the ''ranreng'' and  ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were at least as powerful as the ''arung matoa''; together, these seven officials formed the state's highest governing body, known as ''Petta Wajoq''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}}\n\nThe ''arung matoa'' was chosen among the \"white-blood\" or nobility class. The position of arung matoa cannot be held at once with another office. It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}}\n<!--\nThe power of ''Arung Patampulu'' is balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district. ''Punggawa'' had considerable power... \n\n- Diaspora governmental structure (focus on Borneo and Makassar)...\n-->\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Bugis people}}\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nWajorese texts often reiterate that \"the people of Wajoq are free\", and that their only master is the customary law, which is based on consensus. The concept of the \"freedoms of Wajoq\" included, among others: [[freedom of speech|freedom of expressing opinions]], freedom to act based on one's intention, [[freedom of movement]], [[freedom of contract]], and the freedom from unjust punishment.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=148}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=481}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=433, 447\u2013448}} These \"freedoms\", however, had limitations and do not necessarily apply to the whole population.\n\nBugis women in the precolonial states of South Sulawesi were routinely involved in many aspects of the society. Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and
