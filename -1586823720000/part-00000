Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nThe origins of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a forecast by city planners in 1967 which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system by 1992.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seah C.

Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nThe origins of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a forecast by city planners in 1967 which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system by 1992.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seah C.

The TV series was created for [[HBO]] by [[Damon Lindelof]], who also served as an executive producer and writer. Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Andrew Howard]], Jacob Ming-Trent, [[Tom Mison]], [[Sara Vickers]], Dylan Schombing, [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] and [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Jean Smart]] and [[Hong Chau]] joining the cast in later episodes.\n\nLindelof likened the television series to a \"[[remix]]\" of the original comic series. While the series is technically a sequel, which takes place 34 years after the events of the comics within the same alternate reality, Lindelof wanted to introduce new characters and conflicts that create a new story within the ''Watchmen'' continuity, rather than creating a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. The series focuses on events surrounding racist violence in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 2019. A [[white supremacist]] group called the Seventh Kavalry has taken up arms against the [[Tulsa Police Department]] because of perceived racial injustices, causing the police to conceal their identities with masks to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them in their homes following the \"White Night\". Angela Abar (King), a detective known as Sister Night, investigates the murder of her friend and superior, Judd Crawford (Johnson), and discovers secrets regarding the situations around [[vigilantism]].\n\nThe series, originally promoted by HBO as an ongoing drama series, premiered on October 20, 2019, before concluding its nine-episode run on December 15. Lindelof left his role as showrunner after the first season, stating that he had completed his intended story. HBO subsequently confirmed there are no further plans for the show to continue without Lindelof returning in some capacity, and reclassified the work as a limited series with possible future installments.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Watchmen'' takes place 34 years after the events of [[Watchmen|the comic series]]. Set in the comic's [[alternate history]] of the 20th century, [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]], once seen as heroes, have been outlawed due to their violent methods. In 1985, Adrian Veidt, formerly known as the vigilante [[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]], created a fake attack on [[New York City]] by a [[List of Watchmen characters#Alien Monster|squid-like alien]] that resulted in millions within New York being killed, coercing nations to work together against a common threat and to avert a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Veidt's actions disgusted his former companions, with [[Rorschach (character)|Rorschach]] planning to tell the world of Veidt's misdeeds before he is vaporized by [[Doctor Manhattan]], who subsequently left the planet, unaware Rorschach had sent his journal to be published beforehand.\n\nThe show takes place in 2019 [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. A [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] group, the Seventh Kavalry, inspired by Rorschach's writings and masked image, wage violent war against minorities and the police that enforce special [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] for victims of racial injustice. On Christmas Eve 2016, during an event that came to be known as the \"White Night\", the Kavalry attacked the homes of 40 [[police officer]]s working for the [[Tulsa Police Department]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Why the White Night Is a Chilling Turning Point in Watchmen's Alt-History |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a29612697/white-night-watchmen-hbo-show-explained/ |website=Esquire |first=Brady |last=Langmann |date=October 28, 2019 |accessdate=October 29, 2019}}</ref> Of those who survived, only two stayed with the force: Detective Angela Abar and Police Chief Judd Crawford.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/10/27/20934540/watchmen-season-1-episode-2-recap-review-explained |title=Take a close look at Watchmen episode 2 |first=Eric |last=Thurm |date=October 28, 2019 |accessdate=October 28, 2019 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> As the police force was rebuilt, laws were passed that required police to not disclose their profession and to protect their identities while on the job by wearing masks, which includes allowing for costumed police officers.<ref name=\"ew deep dive\"/>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Watchmen characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 500\n| perrow    = 4\n| footer    = The principal cast for ''Watchmen'' includes (top row, left to right) [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Jean Smart]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], (bottom row, left to right) [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Hong Chau]], [[Louis Gossett Jr.]], and [[Jeremy Irons]].\n| image1    = Regina_King_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image2    = Don_Johnson_TIFF_2019.jpg\n| image3    = Jean_Smart_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image4    = Yahya_Abdul-Mateen_II_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image5    = Tim Blake Nelson 2016.jpg\n| image6    = Hong Chau 2016 cropped.jpg\n| image7    = Louis Gossett Jr. (Guadalajara Film Festival) 2.jpg\n| image8    = SDCC_2015_-_Jeremy_Irons_(19524260758)_(cropped).jpg\n}}\n\n===Main===\n<!--- Cast and order per closing credits, starting from pilot episode, new cast members will be add to bottom as closing credits change, per MOS:TVCAST--->\n* [[Regina King]] as Angela Abar / Sister Night, a Tulsa Police [[detective]] who wears a [[nun]]'s [[Religious habit|habit]] and a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].

Ninety-eight years later, masked Officer Charlie Sutton is hospitalized after being shot by a member of the Seventh Kavalry. Chief Judd Crawford calls for retaliation to hunt down the shooter. Angela Abar hears of the shooting and hunts down a suspect under her secret persona, Sister Night. With help from another costumed police officer, Wade Tillman/Looking Glass, Angela elicits the shooter's location at a cattle ranch used by the Kavalry. Angela, Judd and other officers hunt them down, instigating a shootout that results in the deaths of all Kavalry members present, including the shooter. Sometime after the shootout, Judd runs over a spike strip while driving to the hospital to visit Sutton. Angela receives a call from someone who instructs her to find something at a countryside tree. She heads to the location, where she finds an elderly black man in a wheelchair below a hanged Judd.

In the present, Angela takes the elderly man she found under the tree to her hideout. He says his name is Will and claims to be her grandfather, which she later validates. The police round up several suspects from Nixonville on suspicion of Judd's lynching. Will warns Angela of Judd's duplicity, which she initially doubts. During Judd's wake however, while searching his house, she discovers a [[Ku Klux Klan]] outfit in a secret closet. She asks Will how he knew, to no avail, so she arrests him.

Hooded Justice's identity was never established in the limited series, and Lindelof's suggestion that he was a black man created a challenge for the writers. One of the first tasks the writing staff had was to determine how Will would become Hooded Justice, effectively establishing the plot to the sixth episode \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\".<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> To further tie to the limited series, the writing staff only considered using the established characters that would best serve Angela's story so that she would remain the focus.<ref name=\"thr ep7\"/> To that end, they had established that characters like Doctor Manhattan, Laurie Blake, and Adrian Veidt were necessary to support Angela's discovery of her legacy. They had considered including Dan Dreiberg, the second [[Nite Owl]], as well, but Lindelof wanted to have a fair balance of old and new characters within the show, and felt that adding Dan would have tipped the balance too far away from the new characters. They did consider Dan's fate as part of the \"Peteypedia\" additional materials created by the show's writers, in which Dan remains in prison after he and Laurie were arrested for vigilantism in the past, and refusing to accept the FBI's offer to work with them as Laurie had done.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-dan-dreiberg-isnt-in-watchmen-hbo/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why Dan Dreiberg Wasn't in ''Watchmen'' |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nLindelof used his experience from his past shows to plot out the season prior to writing, stating \"What I've learned over time is you need to know the answers to the mysteries...If you don't know those, you're lost.

After completing the sixth episode, \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\", Lindelof felt the story was closer to its ending rather than as a midpoint, and that if they continued for four additional episodes, one of them would have been [[filler (media)|filler]], and instead opted to conclude the story with three episodes. The omitted episode would have likely covered more of Lady Trieu's backstory, according to Lindelof, though it would not have been exclusively devoted to that topic. Instead, some of this material was covered in conversations within the seventh episode \"[[An Almost Religious Awe]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-watchmen-was-9-episodes-instead-of-10/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why ''Watchmen'' Was Shortened to 9 Episodes Instead of the Original 10 |first=Adam |last=Chitwood |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nA show-within-the-show, ''American Hero Story'', was used to tell the purported backstory of Hooded Justice. Writer Cord Jefferson said ''American Hero Story'' was meant to be the opposite to what they were creating for the actual show, a \"cheesy\" production that perpetuated the in-universe myth of Hooded Justice being a white man.<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> Lindelof said the show was designed to be comparable to [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and ''[[American Crime Story]]'', and had even considered bringing in Murphy to play himself as the producer of ''American Hero Story''. He opted against this, but still treated ''American Hero Story'' like a Murphy work, and taking its producer to be somewhat secretive and seclusive, like Murphy.<ref name=\"ahs\"/> Some media critics took the ''American Hero Story'' segments to be a parody of [[Zack Snyder]]'s [[Watchmen (film)|2009 live-action adaptation of ''Watchmen'']], a work generally panned by fans of the comic, but Lindelof and Kassell asserted this was not their intent. Kassell said, \"I fully admire [Snyder] as a filmmaker so to hear that it could even be used as a negative comment feels terrible. What I was wanting to do with those (''American Hero Story'' scenes) is like, 'This is the version we could make,' and we are very concretely not making that version.

Peteypedia was developed after most of the filming was completed, with writer [[Jeff Jensen]] overseeing it. The writing team were aware they had developed too much information that would fit into the broadcast show and debated how to present this, including as post-credit scenes or through [[social media]]. At the same time, HBO was working with Reznor and Ross on how to release the albums and were considering including additional [[liner note]]s in the vinyl releases, which included the additional background material the writers had developed. This led to creating reports and clippings similar to those presented in the original ''Watchmen'' comic, and presenting this as part of Peteypedia.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/how-watchmen-made-peteypedia.html |title=How Watchmen Built Out Its Universe With Peteypedia |first=Jackson |last=McHenry |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=December 23, 2019 |work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]}}</ref> Peteypedia allowed them, for example, to explain Laurie's trajectory from being the second Silk Spectre and fighting crime with Nite Owl at the end of the comic series, to becoming an FBI agent, elements of this that they had written briefly into the show but did not have broadcast time to spell out.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/> They also tied elements back to the original comic. Of note is the fictional novel ''Fogdancing'' written in-universe by Max Shea, one of the people that Veidt had used to device the squid attack in 1985. Jensen said that in the extra material with the graphic novel, ''Fogdancing'' had been made into a film at least twice, so the writers considered the work to be seminal to the characters in the television series, having the book appear at least twice during the show. Jensen created a whole plot summary of the work based on minimal clues from the comic, making the work to be about super-soldiers and having it tie to the idea of the ''Watchmen'' superhero culture.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/>\n\n===Continuation===\nWhile HBO had not yet confirmed a second season following the show's broadcast, Lindelof stated that if there were, he would not likely be back for it, but instead have another producer step forward to tell another story set in this universe.

The TV series was created for [[HBO]] by [[Damon Lindelof]], who also served as an executive producer and writer. Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Andrew Howard]], Jacob Ming-Trent, [[Tom Mison]], [[Sara Vickers]], Dylan Schombing, [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] and [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Jean Smart]] and [[Hong Chau]] joining the cast in later episodes.\n\nLindelof likened the television series to a \"[[remix]]\" of the original comic series. While the series is technically a sequel, which takes place 34 years after the events of the comics within the same alternate reality, Lindelof wanted to introduce new characters and conflicts that create a new story within the ''Watchmen'' continuity, rather than creating a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. The series focuses on events surrounding racist violence in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 2019. A [[white supremacist]] group called the Seventh Kavalry has taken up arms against the [[Tulsa Police Department]] because of perceived racial injustices, causing the police to conceal their identities with masks to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them in their homes following the \"White Night\". Angela Abar (King), a detective known as Sister Night, investigates the murder of her friend and superior, Judd Crawford (Johnson), and discovers secrets regarding the situations around [[vigilantism]].\n\nThe series, originally promoted by HBO as an ongoing drama series, premiered on October 20, 2019, before concluding its nine-episode run on December 15. Lindelof left his role as showrunner after the first season, stating that he had completed his intended story. HBO subsequently confirmed there are no further plans for the show to continue without Lindelof returning in some capacity, and reclassified the work as a limited series with possible future installments.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Watchmen'' takes place 34 years after the events of [[Watchmen|the comic series]]. Set in the comic's [[alternate history]] of the 20th century, [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]], once seen as heroes, have been outlawed due to their violent methods.

Veidt's actions disgusted his former companions, with [[Rorschach (character)|Rorschach]] planning to tell the world of Veidt's misdeeds before he is vaporized by [[Doctor Manhattan]], who subsequently left the planet, unaware Rorschach had sent his journal to be published beforehand.\n\nThe show takes place in 2019 [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].

In looking for a similar anxiety for contemporary times, Lindelof determined that [[Racism|racial tensions]] posed the same type of larger picture that would work well for the ''Watchmen'' universe, since it presented both historical and present conflicts.

Hooded Justice's identity was never established in the limited series, and Lindelof's suggestion that he was a black man created a challenge for the writers. One of the first tasks the writing staff had was to determine how Will would become Hooded Justice, effectively establishing the plot to the sixth episode \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\".<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> To further tie to the limited series, the writing staff only considered using the established characters that would best serve Angela's story so that she would remain the focus.<ref name=\"thr ep7\"/> To that end, they had established that characters like Doctor Manhattan, Laurie Blake, and Adrian Veidt were necessary to support Angela's discovery of her legacy. They had considered including Dan Dreiberg, the second [[Nite Owl]], as well, but Lindelof wanted to have a fair balance of old and new characters within the show, and felt that adding Dan would have tipped the balance too far away from the new characters. They did consider Dan's fate as part of the \"Peteypedia\" additional materials created by the show's writers, in which Dan remains in prison after he and Laurie were arrested for vigilantism in the past, and refusing to accept the FBI's offer to work with them as Laurie had done.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-dan-dreiberg-isnt-in-watchmen-hbo/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why Dan Dreiberg Wasn't in ''Watchmen'' |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nLindelof used his experience from his past shows to plot out the season prior to writing, stating \"What I've learned over time is you need to know the answers to the mysteries...If you don't know those, you're lost.

After completing the sixth episode, \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\", Lindelof felt the story was closer to its ending rather than as a midpoint, and that if they continued for four additional episodes, one of them would have been [[filler (media)|filler]], and instead opted to conclude the story with three episodes. The omitted episode would have likely covered more of Lady Trieu's backstory, according to Lindelof, though it would not have been exclusively devoted to that topic. Instead, some of this material was covered in conversations within the seventh episode \"[[An Almost Religious Awe]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-watchmen-was-9-episodes-instead-of-10/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why ''Watchmen'' Was Shortened to 9 Episodes Instead of the Original 10 |first=Adam |last=Chitwood |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nA show-within-the-show, ''American Hero Story'', was used to tell the purported backstory of Hooded Justice. Writer Cord Jefferson said ''American Hero Story'' was meant to be the opposite to what they were creating for the actual show, a \"cheesy\" production that perpetuated the in-universe myth of Hooded Justice being a white man.<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> Lindelof said the show was designed to be comparable to [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and ''[[American Crime Story]]'', and had even considered bringing in Murphy to play himself as the producer of ''American Hero Story''. He opted against this, but still treated ''American Hero Story'' like a Murphy work, and taking its producer to be somewhat secretive and seclusive, like Murphy.<ref name=\"ahs\"/> Some media critics took the ''American Hero Story'' segments to be a parody of [[Zack Snyder]]'s [[Watchmen (film)|2009 live-action adaptation of ''Watchmen'']], a work generally panned by fans of the comic, but Lindelof and Kassell asserted this was not their intent. Kassell said, \"I fully admire [Snyder] as a filmmaker so to hear that it could even be used as a negative comment feels terrible. What I was wanting to do with those (''American Hero Story'' scenes) is like, 'This is the version we could make,' and we are very concretely not making that version.

Peteypedia was developed after most of the filming was completed, with writer [[Jeff Jensen]] overseeing it. The writing team were aware they had developed too much information that would fit into the broadcast show and debated how to present this, including as post-credit scenes or through [[social media]]. At the same time, HBO was working with Reznor and Ross on how to release the albums and were considering including additional [[liner note]]s in the vinyl releases, which included the additional background material the writers had developed. This led to creating reports and clippings similar to those presented in the original ''Watchmen'' comic, and presenting this as part of Peteypedia.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/how-watchmen-made-peteypedia.html |title=How Watchmen Built Out Its Universe With Peteypedia |first=Jackson |last=McHenry |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=December 23, 2019 |work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]}}</ref> Peteypedia allowed them, for example, to explain Laurie's trajectory from being the second Silk Spectre and fighting crime with Nite Owl at the end of the comic series, to becoming an FBI agent, elements of this that they had written briefly into the show but did not have broadcast time to spell out.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/> They also tied elements back to the original comic. Of note is the fictional novel ''Fogdancing'' written in-universe by Max Shea, one of the people that Veidt had used to device the squid attack in 1985. Jensen said that in the extra material with the graphic novel, ''Fogdancing'' had been made into a film at least twice, so the writers considered the work to be seminal to the characters in the television series, having the book appear at least twice during the show.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>).

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> are all deeply red-colored crystals and water solutions, due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]].

Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

RDA is higher than EAR so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy equals 2.6{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. RDA for lactation equals 2.8 \u03bcg/day. For infants up to 12 months the adequate intake (AI) is 0.4\u20130.5{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. (AIs are established when there is insufficient information to determine EARs and RDAs.) For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to effectively absorb vitamin B{{sub|12}} naturally occurring in foods, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B{{sub|12}} or a supplement containing vitamin B{{sub|12}}. As for safety, [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin B{{sub|12}} there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses.

The central metal ion is [[cobalt]]. Four of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a [[dimethylbenzimidazole]] group. The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>).

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> are all deeply red-colored crystals and water solutions, due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. These are converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur.

Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]].

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].
