Guernsey may not apply different immigration controls to the UK.\n\n===Housing restrictions===\nGuernsey undertakes a population management mechanism using restrictions over who may work in the island through control of which properties people may live in. The housing market is split between ''local market'' properties and a set number of ''open market'' properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |title=Guernsey's Two Tier Housing Market |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419235752/http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |archivedate=19 April 2015  }}</ref> Anyone may live in an open market property, but local market properties can only be lived in by those who qualify \u2013 either through being born in Guernsey (to at least one local parent), by obtaining a housing licence, or by virtue of sharing a property with someone who does qualify (living ''en famille''). Consequently, ''open market'' properties are much more expensive both to buy and to rent. Housing licences are for fixed periods, often only valid for 4 years and only as long as the individual remains employed by a specified Guernsey employer. The licence will specify the type of accommodation and be specific to the address the person lives in,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/live |title=Where can licence holders live |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501145835/http://www.gov.gg/live |archivedate=1 May 2015  }}</ref> and is often subject to a police record check. These restrictions apply equally regardless of whether the property is owned or rented, and only apply to occupation of the property. Thus a person whose housing licence expires may continue to own a Guernsey property, but will no longer be able to live in it. There are no restrictions on who may own a property.\n\n[[File:Guernsey July 2010 92.jpg|thumb|Coast of Guernsey]]\nThere are a number of routes to qualifying as a \"local\" for housing purposes. Generally, it is sufficient to be born to at least one Guernsey parent and to live in the island for ten years in a twenty-year period. In a similar way a partner (married or otherwise) of a local can acquire local status. Multiple problems arise following early separation of couples, especially if they have young children or if a local partner dies, in these situations personal circumstances and compassion can add weight to requests for local status. Once \"local\" status has been achieved it remains in place for life. Even a lengthy period of residence outside Guernsey does not invalidate \"local\" housing status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |title=What is a Qualified Resident? |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414221632/http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |archivedate=14 April 2015  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Guernsey's inhabitants are full [[British nationality law|British citizens]],<ref>{{cite legislation UK | type = act | year = 1981| chapter = 61| act = British Nationality Act 1981}}</ref> an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in other European Union states is placed in the passport of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and [[Isle of Man]].

There are 10 primary schools, plus two junior schools and three infant schools. {{as of|2017}}, the island still has the 11-plus exam and pupils then transfer to one of four 11\u201316 secondary schools, or a co-educational grammar school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Selection at 11 (the 11+ process)|url=https://www.gov.gg/elevenplus|website=Gov.GG|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> There are also three fee-paying colleges with lower schools, for which pupils over 11 receive grant support from the States of Guernsey.

The Department has completed the building of Le Rondin special needs school, the Sixth Form Centre at the Grammar School and the first phase of the new College of Further Education \u2013 a performing arts centre. The construction of St Sampsons High was completed summer 2008 and admitted its first pupils in September 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the school leaving age was raised so the earliest date is the last Friday in June in the year a pupil turns 16, in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means pupils will be between 15 and 10 months and 16 and 10 months before being able to leave. Prior to this, pupils could leave school at the end of the term in which they turned 14, if they so wished: a letter was required to be sent to the Education department to confirm this. However, this option was undertaken by relatively few pupils, the majority choosing to complete their GCSEs and then either begin employment or continue their education.\n\nPost-[[GCSE]] pupils have a choice of transferring to the state-run [[Guernsey Grammar School and Sixth Form Centre|Grammar School & Sixth Form Centre]], or to the independent colleges for academic AS/A Levels/International Baccalureate Diploma Programme. They also have the option to study vocational subjects at the island's ''Guernsey College of Further Education''.\n\nThere are no universities in the island. Students who attend university in the United Kingdom receive state support towards both maintenance and tuition fees. In 2007, the Education Department received the approval of the States Assembly to introduce student contributions to the costs of higher education, in the form of student loans, as apply in the UK. However, immediately after the general election of 2008, the States Assembly voted in favour of a [[Private member's bill|Requ\u00eate]] which proposed abolishing the student loans scheme on the grounds that it was expensive to run and would potentially discourage students from going to, and then returning to the island from, university. In 2012, the Education Department reported to the States Assembly that it had no need to re-examine the basis of higher education funding at the present time.\n\n==Culture==\n\n{{main|Culture of Guernsey}}\n\n[[File:George M\u00e9tivier.jpg|thumb|left|[[George M\u00e9tivier]]]]\nEnglish is the language in general use by the majority of the population, while [[Guern\u00e9siais]], the [[Norman language]] of the island, is spoken fluently by only about 2% of the population (according to 2001 census). However, 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language. Until the early 20th-century French was the only official language of the Bailiwick, and all deeds for the sale and purchase of real estate in Guernsey were written in French until 1971. Family and place names reflect this linguistic heritage. [[George M\u00e9tivier]], a poet, wrote in Guernesiais. The loss of the island's language and the Anglicisation of its culture, which began in the 19th century and proceeded inexorably for a century, accelerated sharply when the majority of the island's school children were evacuated to the UK for five years during the German occupation of 1940\u201345.\n\n[[File:Renoir16.jpg|thumb|''Children on the Beach of Guernsey'' (1883) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]\nThe French [[impressionist]] painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] visited the island in late summer 1883.

There are also two representatives from [[Alderney]], a semi-autonomous dependency of the Bailiwick, but [[Sark]] sends no representative since it has its own legislature. The [[Bailiff of Guernsey|Bailiff]] or Deputy Bailiff preside in the assembly. There are also two non-voting members: H.M. Procureur (analogous to the role of [[Attorney General]]) and H.M. Comptroller (analogous to [[Solicitor General]]), both appointed by the Crown and collectively known as the Law Officers of the Crown.\n\nA ''projet de loi'' is the equivalent of a UK bill or a French ''projet de loi'', and a law is the equivalent of a UK [[Act of Parliament in the UK|act of parliament]] or a French ''loi''. A draft law passed by the States can have no legal effect until formally approved by Her Majesty in Council and promulgated by means of an [[order in council]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dawes|first1=Gordon|title=Laws of Guernsey|year=2003|publisher=Hart Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847311856}}</ref> Laws are given the Royal Sanction at regular meetings of the Privy Council in London, after which they are returned to the islands for formal registration at the [[Courts of Guernsey#Royal Court|Royal Court]]. The States also make delegated legislation known as Ordinances (''Ordonnances'') and Orders (''ordres'') which do not require the [[Royal Assent]]. Commencement orders are usually in the form of ordinances.\n\nThe [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] is responsible for Guernsey's constitutional and external affairs, developing strategic and corporate policy and coordinating States business. It also examines proposals and Reports placed before Guernsey's Parliament (the States of Deliberation) by Departments and Non States Bodies.

Guernsey has almost complete autonomy over internal affairs and certain external matters. However, the Crown \u2013 that is to say, the UK Government \u2013 retains an ill-defined reserved power to intervene in the domestic affairs of any of the five Crown Dependencies within the [[British Islands]] \"in the interests of good government\".<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Hotchkiss v. Channel Islands Knitwear Company Limited|date=2001|pinpoint=207}}</ref> The UK Parliament is also a source of Guernsey law for those matters which are reserved to the UK, namely defence and foreign affairs.\n\nThe head of the bailiwick judiciary in Guernsey is the Bailiff, who, as well as performing the judicial functions of a Chief Justice, is also the head of the States of Guernsey and has certain civic, ceremonial and executive functions. The Bailiff's functions may be exercised by the Deputy Bailiff. The posts of Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff are Crown appointments. Sixteen Jurats, who need no specific legal training, are elected by the [[States of Election]] from among Islanders. They act as a jury, as judges in civil and criminal cases and fix the sentence in criminal cases. First mentioned in 1179, there is a list of Jurats who have served since 1299.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/3089/Jurats |title=Jurats |publisher=Guernsey Royal Court}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest [[Courts of Guernsey]] can be traced back to the 9th century. The principal court is the Royal Court and exercises both civil and criminal jurisdiction. Additional courts, such as the Magistrate's Court, which deals with minor criminal matters, and the Court of Appeal, which hears appeals from the Royal Court, have been added to the Island's legal system over the years.\n\n===External relations===\n{{main|External relations of Guernsey}}\nSeveral European countries have a consular presence within the jurisdiction. The French Consulate is based at [[Victor Hugo]]'s former residence at [[Hauteville House]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Consulate of France in Guernsey, United Kingdom|url=https://www.embassypages.com/missions/embassy4446/|website=Embassypages.com|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the jurisdiction of Guernsey has complete autonomy over internal affairs and certain external matters, the topic of complete independence from the British Crown has been discussed widely and frequently, with ideas ranging from Guernsey obtaining independence as a Dominion to the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey uniting and forming an independent Federal State within the Commonwealth, whereby both islands retain their independence with regards to domestic affairs but internationally, the islands would be regarded as one state.<ref name=HoG/>\n\nAlthough it is not a member of the [[European Union]], it had a special relationship with it until [[Brexit]].

Each parish is administered by a Douzaine, usually made up of twelve members, known as Douzeniers. Douzeniers are elected for a six-year mandate, two Douzeniers being elected by parishioners at a parish meeting in November each year. The senior Douzenier is known as the Doyen (Dean). Two elected [[Conn\u00e9table (Jersey and Guernsey)|Constables]] ({{lang|fr|Conn\u00e9tables}}) carry out the decisions of the Douzaine, serving for between one and three years.

Guernsey may not apply different immigration controls to the UK.\n\n===Housing restrictions===\nGuernsey undertakes a population management mechanism using restrictions over who may work in the island through control of which properties people may live in. The housing market is split between ''local market'' properties and a set number of ''open market'' properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |title=Guernsey's Two Tier Housing Market |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419235752/http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |archivedate=19 April 2015  }}</ref> Anyone may live in an open market property, but local market properties can only be lived in by those who qualify \u2013 either through being born in Guernsey (to at least one local parent), by obtaining a housing licence, or by virtue of sharing a property with someone who does qualify (living ''en famille''). Consequently, ''open market'' properties are much more expensive both to buy and to rent. Housing licences are for fixed periods, often only valid for 4 years and only as long as the individual remains employed by a specified Guernsey employer. The licence will specify the type of accommodation and be specific to the address the person lives in,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/live |title=Where can licence holders live |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501145835/http://www.gov.gg/live |archivedate=1 May 2015  }}</ref> and is often subject to a police record check. These restrictions apply equally regardless of whether the property is owned or rented, and only apply to occupation of the property. Thus a person whose housing licence expires may continue to own a Guernsey property, but will no longer be able to live in it. There are no restrictions on who may own a property.\n\n[[File:Guernsey July 2010 92.jpg|thumb|Coast of Guernsey]]\nThere are a number of routes to qualifying as a \"local\" for housing purposes. Generally, it is sufficient to be born to at least one Guernsey parent and to live in the island for ten years in a twenty-year period. In a similar way a partner (married or otherwise) of a local can acquire local status. Multiple problems arise following early separation of couples, especially if they have young children or if a local partner dies, in these situations personal circumstances and compassion can add weight to requests for local status. Once \"local\" status has been achieved it remains in place for life. Even a lengthy period of residence outside Guernsey does not invalidate \"local\" housing status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |title=What is a Qualified Resident? |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414221632/http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |archivedate=14 April 2015  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Guernsey's inhabitants are full [[British nationality law|British citizens]],<ref>{{cite legislation UK | type = act | year = 1981| chapter = 61| act = British Nationality Act 1981}}</ref> an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in other European Union states is placed in the passport of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and [[Isle of Man]]. If classified with \"Islander Status\", the British passport will be endorsed as follows: 'The holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment'.

There are 10 primary schools, plus two junior schools and three infant schools. {{as of|2017}}, the island still has the 11-plus exam and pupils then transfer to one of four 11\u201316 secondary schools, or a co-educational grammar school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Selection at 11 (the 11+ process)|url=https://www.gov.gg/elevenplus|website=Gov.GG|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> There are also three fee-paying colleges with lower schools, for which pupils over 11 receive grant support from the States of Guernsey.

The Department has completed the building of Le Rondin special needs school, the Sixth Form Centre at the Grammar School and the first phase of the new College of Further Education \u2013 a performing arts centre. The construction of St Sampsons High was completed summer 2008 and admitted its first pupils in September 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the school leaving age was raised so the earliest date is the last Friday in June in the year a pupil turns 16, in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means pupils will be between 15 and 10 months and 16 and 10 months before being able to leave. Prior to this, pupils could leave school at the end of the term in which they turned 14, if they so wished: a letter was required to be sent to the Education department to confirm this. However, this option was undertaken by relatively few pupils, the majority choosing to complete their GCSEs and then either begin employment or continue their education.\n\nPost-[[GCSE]] pupils have a choice of transferring to the state-run [[Guernsey Grammar School and Sixth Form Centre|Grammar School & Sixth Form Centre]], or to the independent colleges for academic AS/A Levels/International Baccalureate Diploma Programme. They also have the option to study vocational subjects at the island's ''Guernsey College of Further Education''.\n\nThere are no universities in the island. Students who attend university in the United Kingdom receive state support towards both maintenance and tuition fees. In 2007, the Education Department received the approval of the States Assembly to introduce student contributions to the costs of higher education, in the form of student loans, as apply in the UK. However, immediately after the general election of 2008, the States Assembly voted in favour of a [[Private member's bill|Requ\u00eate]] which proposed abolishing the student loans scheme on the grounds that it was expensive to run and would potentially discourage students from going to, and then returning to the island from, university. In 2012, the Education Department reported to the States Assembly that it had no need to re-examine the basis of higher education funding at the present time.\n\n==Culture==\n\n{{main|Culture of Guernsey}}\n\n[[File:George M\u00e9tivier.jpg|thumb|left|[[George M\u00e9tivier]]]]\nEnglish is the language in general use by the majority of the population, while [[Guern\u00e9siais]], the [[Norman language]] of the island, is spoken fluently by only about 2% of the population (according to 2001 census). However, 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language. Until the early 20th-century French was the only official language of the Bailiwick, and all deeds for the sale and purchase of real estate in Guernsey were written in French until 1971. Family and place names reflect this linguistic heritage. [[George M\u00e9tivier]], a poet, wrote in Guernesiais. The loss of the island's language and the Anglicisation of its culture, which began in the 19th century and proceeded inexorably for a century, accelerated sharply when the majority of the island's school children were evacuated to the UK for five years during the German occupation of 1940\u201345.\n\n[[File:Renoir16.jpg|thumb|''Children on the Beach of Guernsey'' (1883) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]\nThe French [[impressionist]] painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] visited the island in late summer 1883.
