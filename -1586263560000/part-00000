In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit-switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet-switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.<ref>T-Mobile USA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106054447/http://support.t-mobile.com/knowbase/root/public/tm22696.htm#top \"What is EDGE\"].  t-mobile.com.</ref>\n\nBoth voice capacity and packet-switched data speed improved when 3G [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

[[Edward Markey]] revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7\u201310 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after the account is closed).<ref>[http://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/11539/news/wireless-carriers-reveal-user-data-requests Mobile Phone Reviews: Wireless Carriers Reveal User Data Requests<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nComparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7\u201310 years.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies|Telecommunication|United States}}\n* [[List of companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n* [[List of United States wireless communications service providers]]\n* [[List of mobile network operators of the Americas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.telekom.com/  Deutsche Telekom AG's homepage ]\n* [https://www.metropcs.com/ MetroPCS's official website]\n\n{{Finance links\n| name = T-Mobile US\n| symbol = TMUS\n| sec_cik = TMUS\n| reuters = TMUS.O\n| bloomberg = TMUS:US\n| yahoo = TMUS\n| google = TMUS\n}}\n\n{{Deutsche Telekom}}\n{{SoftBank}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{United States mobile communications brands}}\n{{Caribbean mobile phone companies}}\n{{Puerto Rico mobile phone companies}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Seattle Corporations}}\n}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Mobile phone companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Wi-Fi providers]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Deutsche Telekom]]\n[[Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies]]\n[[Category:2013 initial public offerings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{short description|American telecommunications company}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name                = T-Mobile USA, Inc.\n| logo                = T-Mobile US Logo 2020 RGB Magenta on Transparent.svg\n| image               = File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg\n| image_size          = 250px\n| image_caption       = T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, Washington\n| type                = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as           = {{ubl|{{NASDAQ|TMUS}}|[[NASDAQ-100]] component|[[S&P 500]] component}}\n| ISIN                = US8725901040\n| industry            = [[Telecommunications]]\n| predecessors        = {{ubl|VoiceStream Wireless Inc.|T-Mobile USA Inc.|MetroPCS Communications Inc.|[[Sprint Corporation]]}}\n| foundation          = {{Start date and age|1994}} (as VoiceStream Wireless PCS)\n| founder             = [[John W.

In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit-switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet-switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.<ref>T-Mobile USA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106054447/http://support.t-mobile.com/knowbase/root/public/tm22696.htm#top \"What is EDGE\"].  t-mobile.com.</ref>\n\nBoth voice capacity and packet-switched data speed improved when 3G [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

This document was uncovered by the ACLU's coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police. Notably, the document showed that T-Mobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/cell-phone-location-tracking-request-response-cell-phone-company-data-retention-chart|title=Cell Phone Location Tracking Request Response \u2013 Cell Phone Company Data Retention Chart|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Massachusetts Sen. [[Edward Markey]] revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7\u201310 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after the account is closed).<ref>[http://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/11539/news/wireless-carriers-reveal-user-data-requests Mobile Phone Reviews: Wireless Carriers Reveal User Data Requests<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nComparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7\u201310 years.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies|Telecommunication|United States}}\n* [[List of companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n* [[List of United States wireless communications service providers]]\n* [[List of mobile network operators of the Americas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.telekom.com/  Deutsche Telekom AG's homepage ]\n* [https://www.metropcs.com/ MetroPCS's official website]\n\n{{Finance links\n| name = T-Mobile US\n| symbol = TMUS\n| sec_cik = TMUS\n| reuters = TMUS.O\n| bloomberg = TMUS:US\n| yahoo = TMUS\n| google = TMUS\n}}\n\n{{Deutsche Telekom}}\n{{SoftBank}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{United States mobile communications brands}}\n{{Caribbean mobile phone companies}}\n{{Puerto Rico mobile phone companies}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Seattle Corporations}}\n}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Mobile phone companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Wi-Fi providers]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Deutsche Telekom]]\n[[Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies]]\n[[Category:2013 initial public offerings]]\n", "name_user": "Ridwan97", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_USA"}

Liam knows little himself since it was his father and a man named Serac who built it, but as he is about to reveal Serac's name Dolores is knocked out by Martin, Liam's head of security who discovered Dolores' deception. Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her. Elsewhere, Bernard stays ahead of a manhunt for him and intends to travel to Westworld, while the Charlotte host takes control of Delos.

While Dolores fights off Ashley and Caleb chases down Liam, Bernard realizes Martin is the swapped host.

Martin intends to kill Dolores, but she instead lures him into a trap, which allows her to replace Martin with a host. Martin names the partner as Serac. Dolores is wounded in a firefight, but is aided by Caleb, a former soldier that is trying to eke out an existence as a construction worker and petty criminal who had seen Martin try to kill her.
