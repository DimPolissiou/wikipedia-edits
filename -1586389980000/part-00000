The heart of this new strategy called for the elimination of the enemy base south of [[Songhua River]], headquartered at [[Linjiang, Jilin|Linjiang]].  After the enemy had been eradicated in the south, then the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] would push northward across the [[Songhua River]] and eliminate the enemy there.\n\nIn response to the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] strategy, the [[communist]] commander of [[northeast China]], [[Lin Biao]], and his followers accurately concluded that the [[communist]] base south of the [[Songhua River]] must be maintained at all cost, because it served to distract enemy and if it were lost, then the enemy could then devote its entire asset to pressure the [[communist]]s north of the [[Songhua River]], and the [[communist]]s in [[northeast China]] would then be endangered, and possibly facing total elimination.  The [[communist]]s decided to concentrate three columns with a total of nine [[Division (military)|divisions]] to stop the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensives, along with the help of three independent [[Division (military)|divisions]].\n\n==Order of battle==\n[[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] [[order of battle]]\n*The [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]]\n**The Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n**The Newly Organized 30th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The Newly Organized 6th Army\n*The 52nd Army\n**The 2nd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n**The 195th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 60th Army\n*The 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army\n*The 21st [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 87th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 88th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 89th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 207th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 54th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 13th Army\n\n[[Communist]] [[order of battle]]\n*The 3rd Column\n*The 4th Column\n*The 6th Column\n*The 1st Independent [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 2nd Independent [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 3rd Independent [[Division (military)|Division]]\n\n==First stage==\nOn December 17, 1946, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] send out six [[Division (military)|divisions]], including the 2nd [[Division (military)|division]] and the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army, the 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army and one [[Division (military)|Division]] from each of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]], the Newly Organized 6th Army and the 60th Army to launch the first offensive against the [[communist]] base south of [[Songhua River]], and two more [[Division (military)|Divisions]] were deployed as reserves.  The initial [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] objective was to linkup [[Tonghua]] with Ji'an (\u96c6\u5b89) so that the enemy could be further squeezed into the mountain.  In response, on December 18, 1946, the [[communist]] 4th Column struck the regions between [[Fushun]], [[Huanren (town)|Huanren]] and [[Benxi]] behind the enemy line, and after more than a dozen days of fighting, succeeded in taking over more than twenty positions from the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]], including the critical ones at Alkaline Factory (Jian Chang, \u78b1\u5382) and Master Field (Tian Shifu, \u7530\u5e08\u4ed8), and killing more than 3,000 [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] troops in the process.  The [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army was forced to withdraw to reinforce the rear, and this weakened the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] thrust by exposing the two [[Division (military)|divisions]] of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 52nd Army, which were ultimately badly mauled by the enemy who seized the opportunity and attacked with great efficiency and speed, resulting in the regions south of [[Tonghua]] newly taken by the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] earlier in the initial stage of the offensive falling back into the enemy hands.\n\nIn the north, the [[communist]]s massed three columns and three independent [[Division (military)|divisions]] to cross the [[Songhua River]] on January 5, 1947, to besiege the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] strategic location of Pagoda Wood (Tamu, \u5854\u6728), forced the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensive into a complete halt and then redeploying two attacking [[Division (military)|divisions]] to reinforce Pagoda Wood (Tamu, \u5854\u6728).  However, when the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] reinforcement reached the region between Zhangmazi Ditch (Zhangmazi Gou, \u5f20\u9ebb\u5b50\u6c9f) and the Jiao Family's Ridge (Jiajia Ling,\u7126\u5bb6\u5cad), they learned that Pagoda Wood (Tamu, \u5854\u6728) had already fallen into the enemy hands, with the entire garrison consisted of a security force regiment and two regiments of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] being completely annihilated by the enemy.  The enemy consequently returned to north of the [[Songhua River]] on January 19, 1947.\n\nAchieving their objectives when the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] stopped their assault on [[Linjiang, Jilin|Linjiang]], the [[communist]]s withdrew to their original bases and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] could not pursuit the enemy anymore due to the sudden change of the weather when the temperature suddenly dropped to forty degrees below zero.\n\n==Second stage==\nThe [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] correctly assessed that they must avoid fighting at the two fronts and thus attacks on the [[communist]] base in the south must continue in order to eliminate the enemy.  On January 30, 1947, a second offensive was launched with four [[Division (military)|divisions]]: the 21st [[Division (military)|Division]], the 2nd [[Division (military)|Division]] and the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army, and the 207th [[Division (military)|Division]].  The [[communist]]s in turn, deployed the 3rd Column and the 10th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 4th Column to stop the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensive and on February 5, 1947, the weakest [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] [[Division (military)|division]], the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army was ambushed at Gaolichengzi (\u9ad8\u529b\u57ce\u5b50), suffering more than 2,000 fatalities.  On February 6, 1947, a regiment of the advance guard of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 207th [[Division (military)|Division]] was annihilated at Sanyuanpu (\u4e09\u6e90\u6d66) by dusk, and after the setback, the commander of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 207th [[Division (military)|Division]] wisely chose to stop and withdraw.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[communist]] 4th Column once again struck the regions between [[Fushun]] (\u629a\u987a), [[Huanren (town)|Huanren]] (\u6853\u4ec1) and [[Benxi]] (\u672c\u6eaa) deep behind the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] line to take over numerous [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] strongholds, and when combined with [[communist]] victories elsewhere, eventually succeeding in forcing the second [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensive come to a complete stop again, and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were forced to give up the newly conquered lands when one [[Division (military)|division]] was redeployed to reinforce the rear and other begun their withdraw.\n\n==Third Stage==\nJust a week after the failure of the second offensive, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] launched their third offensive against the enemy by deploying the 2nd [[Division (military)|Division]] and the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army, the 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army, the Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]] of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] and the 21st [[Division (military)|Division]] to attack in four fronts on February 13, 1947.  A detachment of the [[communist]] 4th Column again played the same trick that was so successful in the previous two counteroffensives: struck the regions between [[Fushun]], [[Huanren (town)|Huanren]] and [[Benxi]] deep behind the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] line again and attracting three [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] [[Division (military)|divisions]] so that they could not be used to attack the [[communist]] base south of [[Songhua River]], while in the meantime, the  [[communist]] 3rd Column and the 4th Column first annihilated an entire regiment of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 21st [[Division (military)|Division]] at Tonggou (\u901a\u6c9f), and then annihilated another regiment of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army at Daibeicha (\u5927\u5317\u5c94), forcing the two [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] [[Division (military)|Divisions]] to withdraw on February 22, 1947.  The newly gained territory/towns in the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] third offensive such as Huinan (\u8f89\u5357), Golden River (Jinchuan, \u91d1\u5ddd), Willow River (Liuhe, \u67f3\u6cb3) and Ji'an (\u96c6\u5b89) therefore fell back into the enemy hands.\n\nOn the other front, the [[communist]] force crossed the [[Songhua River]] on February 21, 1947, and attacked regions surrounding [[Changchun]] to distract the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]].  After annihilating an entire regiment of the Newly Organized 30th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] at the town of Chengzi Street (Chengzi Jie, \u57ce\u5b50\u8857), the [[communist]] 6th Column turned north and linked up with the [[communist]] 2nd Independent [[Division (military)|Division]] to besiege [[Dehui]] (\u5fb7\u60e0) in order to draw [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] forces away from the [[communist]] base.  The plan succeeded and the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] redeployed [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] (including its Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]]), the 87th [[Division (military)|Division]], and the 88th [[Division (military)|Division]] to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms.  The enemy force wisely chose to withdraw back to the north of [[Songhua River]] on March 2, 1947, before the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] reinforcement could reach [[Dehui]].\n\nThe [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were determined not to let the enemy to get away so they continued their push northward, but in doing so, the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] were severely overstretched.  Seizing the opportunity, the enemy crossed the [[Songhua River]] again on March 8, 1947, for the third time to attack, and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] commanders had no choice but to order a general retreat.  However, the retreating [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] force was caught up by the pursuing enemy and the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 88th [[Division (military)|Division]] was annihilated at the Village of the Mountain of Guo (Guo-shan Tun, \u90ed\u5c71\u5c6f), and the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 87th [[Division (military)|Division]] was badly mauled at the Village Next to the Mountain (Kao-shan Tun, \u9760\u5c71\u5c6f).  On March 12, 1947, [[Nong'an County|Nong'an]] (\u519c\u5b89) was besieged and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were forced to redeploy the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] (including its Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]]) and the 54th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 13th Army from [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] (\u70ed\u6cb3) to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms again.  Succeeding in distracting the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] who had to stop their third offensives, the enemy withdrew to the north of [[Songhua River]].\n\n==Fourth Stage==\nNot wanting to admitting defeat, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] launched their fourth offensive against the [[communist]] base south of [[Songhua River]] on March 26, 1947, with a total strength of twenty regiments attacking in three fronts.  The enemy, in response, targeted the central front headed by the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 89th [[Division (military)|Division]], who was dangerously exposed because its push was much too fast.  While other enemy units resisted the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] left and right fronts, the main body of the enemy force ambushed the 89th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] central front on April 1, 1947, annihilating the entire [[Division (military)|Division]].  Learning the news of the annihilation of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 89th [[Division (military)|Division]], the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] on the other two fronts immediately withdrew.\n\nThe failure of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] fourth offensive marked the end of campaign because the units deployed were the same ones that participated in earlier offensives, and thus was gravely overworked and overstretched.  The [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] could not afford to expend anymore valuable troops and must reserve their strength to defend the territory currently under their control.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe [[Linjiang, Jilin|Linjiang]] Campaign marked the turning point of the battlefield of [[northeast China]]: after this [[communist]] victory, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] in [[northeast China]] were forced to be on the defensive, and could no longer to launch any offensives, while in contrast, the [[communist]]s would be on the offensives from then on.  It must be said, however, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were still quite capable of knocking out the entire [[communist]] force in [[northeast China]] if the right tactics were applied, such as concentrating on annihilating enemy force instead of gaining and holding on to more land, as suggested by many local [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] commanders, but their correct suggestion was overridden by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] infatuation with conquering more land.  Furthermore, even if the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were unable to annihilate the enemy at the time, they could still reserve their strength by giving up [[northeast China]] and saving troops, and the situation had improved, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] would be able to retake [[northeast China]], as suggested by [[Chen Cheng]] in 1946.

After the enemy had been eradicated in the south, then the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] would push northward across the [[Songhua River]] and eliminate the enemy there.\n\nIn response to the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] strategy, the [[communist]] commander of [[northeast China]], [[Lin Biao]], and his followers accurately concluded that the [[communist]] base south of the [[Songhua River]] must be maintained at all cost, because it served to distract enemy and if it were lost, then the enemy could then devote its entire asset to pressure the [[communist]]s north of the [[Songhua River]], and the [[communist]]s in [[northeast China]] would then be endangered, and possibly facing total elimination.  The [[communist]]s decided to concentrate three columns with a total of nine [[Division (military)|divisions]] to stop the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensives, along with the help of three independent [[Division (military)|divisions]].\n\n==Order of battle==\n[[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] [[order of battle]]\n*The [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]]\n**The Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n**The Newly Organized 30th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The Newly Organized 6th Army\n*The 52nd Army\n**The 2nd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n**The 195th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 60th Army\n*The 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army\n*The 21st [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 87th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 88th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 89th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 207th [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 54th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 13th Army\n\n[[Communist]] [[order of battle]]\n*The 3rd Column\n*The 4th Column\n*The 6th Column\n*The 1st Independent [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 2nd Independent [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*The 3rd Independent [[Division (military)|Division]]\n\n==First stage==\nOn December 17, 1946, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] send out six [[Division (military)|divisions]], including the 2nd [[Division (military)|division]] and the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army, the 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army and one [[Division (military)|Division]] from each of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]], the Newly Organized 6th Army and the 60th Army to launch the first offensive against the [[communist]] base south of [[Songhua River]], and two more [[Division (military)|Divisions]] were deployed as reserves.  The initial [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] objective was to linkup [[Tonghua]] with Ji'an (\u96c6\u5b89) so that the enemy could be further squeezed into the mountain.  In response, on December 18, 1946, the [[communist]] 4th Column struck the regions between [[Fushun]], [[Huanren (town)|Huanren]] and [[Benxi]] behind the enemy line, and after more than a dozen days of fighting, succeeded in taking over more than twenty positions from the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]], including the critical ones at Alkaline Factory (Jian Chang, \u78b1\u5382) and Master Field (Tian Shifu, \u7530\u5e08\u4ed8), and killing more than 3,000 [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] troops in the process.  The [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army was forced to withdraw to reinforce the rear, and this weakened the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] thrust by exposing the two [[Division (military)|divisions]] of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 52nd Army, which were ultimately badly mauled by the enemy who seized the opportunity and attacked with great efficiency and speed, resulting in the regions south of [[Tonghua]] newly taken by the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] earlier in the initial stage of the offensive falling back into the enemy hands.\n\nIn the north, the [[communist]]s massed three columns and three independent [[Division (military)|divisions]] to cross the [[Songhua River]] on January 5, 1947, to besiege the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] strategic location of Pagoda Wood (Tamu, \u5854\u6728), forced the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensive into a complete halt and then redeploying two attacking [[Division (military)|divisions]] to reinforce Pagoda Wood (Tamu, \u5854\u6728).  However, when the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] reinforcement reached the region between Zhangmazi Ditch (Zhangmazi Gou, \u5f20\u9ebb\u5b50\u6c9f) and the Jiao Family's Ridge (Jiajia Ling,\u7126\u5bb6\u5cad), they learned that Pagoda Wood (Tamu, \u5854\u6728) had already fallen into the enemy hands, with the entire garrison consisted of a security force regiment and two regiments of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] being completely annihilated by the enemy.  The enemy consequently returned to north of the [[Songhua River]] on January 19, 1947.\n\nAchieving their objectives when the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] stopped their assault on [[Linjiang, Jilin|Linjiang]], the [[communist]]s withdrew to their original bases and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] could not pursuit the enemy anymore due to the sudden change of the weather when the temperature suddenly dropped to forty degrees below zero.\n\n==Second stage==\nThe [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] correctly assessed that they must avoid fighting at the two fronts and thus attacks on the [[communist]] base in the south must continue in order to eliminate the enemy.  On January 30, 1947, a second offensive was launched with four [[Division (military)|divisions]]: the 21st [[Division (military)|Division]], the 2nd [[Division (military)|Division]] and the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army, and the 207th [[Division (military)|Division]].  The [[communist]]s in turn, deployed the 3rd Column and the 10th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 4th Column to stop the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensive and on February 5, 1947, the weakest [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] [[Division (military)|division]], the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army was ambushed at Gaolichengzi (\u9ad8\u529b\u57ce\u5b50), suffering more than 2,000 fatalities.  On February 6, 1947, a regiment of the advance guard of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 207th [[Division (military)|Division]] was annihilated at Sanyuanpu (\u4e09\u6e90\u6d66) by dusk, and after the setback, the commander of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 207th [[Division (military)|Division]] wisely chose to stop and withdraw.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[communist]] 4th Column once again struck the regions between [[Fushun]] (\u629a\u987a), [[Huanren (town)|Huanren]] (\u6853\u4ec1) and [[Benxi]] (\u672c\u6eaa) deep behind the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] line to take over numerous [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] strongholds, and when combined with [[communist]] victories elsewhere, eventually succeeding in forcing the second [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] offensive come to a complete stop again, and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were forced to give up the newly conquered lands when one [[Division (military)|division]] was redeployed to reinforce the rear and other begun their withdraw.\n\n==Third Stage==\nJust a week after the failure of the second offensive, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] launched their third offensive against the enemy by deploying the 2nd [[Division (military)|Division]] and the 195th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 52nd Army, the 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army, the Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]] of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] and the 21st [[Division (military)|Division]] to attack in four fronts on February 13, 1947.  A detachment of the [[communist]] 4th Column again played the same trick that was so successful in the previous two counteroffensives: struck the regions between [[Fushun]], [[Huanren (town)|Huanren]] and [[Benxi]] deep behind the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] line again and attracting three [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] [[Division (military)|divisions]] so that they could not be used to attack the [[communist]] base south of [[Songhua River]], while in the meantime, the  [[communist]] 3rd Column and the 4th Column first annihilated an entire regiment of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 21st [[Division (military)|Division]] at Tonggou (\u901a\u6c9f), and then annihilated another regiment of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 91st [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 71st Army at Daibeicha (\u5927\u5317\u5c94), forcing the two [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] [[Division (military)|Divisions]] to withdraw on February 22, 1947.  The newly gained territory/towns in the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] third offensive such as Huinan (\u8f89\u5357), Golden River (Jinchuan, \u91d1\u5ddd), Willow River (Liuhe, \u67f3\u6cb3) and Ji'an (\u96c6\u5b89) therefore fell back into the enemy hands.\n\nOn the other front, the [[communist]] force crossed the [[Songhua River]] on February 21, 1947, and attacked regions surrounding [[Changchun]] to distract the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]].  After annihilating an entire regiment of the Newly Organized 30th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] at the town of Chengzi Street (Chengzi Jie, \u57ce\u5b50\u8857), the [[communist]] 6th Column turned north and linked up with the [[communist]] 2nd Independent [[Division (military)|Division]] to besiege [[Dehui]] (\u5fb7\u60e0) in order to draw [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] forces away from the [[communist]] base.  The plan succeeded and the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] redeployed [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] (including its Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]]), the 87th [[Division (military)|Division]], and the 88th [[Division (military)|Division]] to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms.  The enemy force wisely chose to withdraw back to the north of [[Songhua River]] on March 2, 1947, before the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] reinforcement could reach [[Dehui]].\n\nThe [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were determined not to let the enemy to get away so they continued their push northward, but in doing so, the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] were severely overstretched.  Seizing the opportunity, the enemy crossed the [[Songhua River]] again on March 8, 1947, for the third time to attack, and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] commanders had no choice but to order a general retreat.  However, the retreating [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] force was caught up by the pursuing enemy and the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 88th [[Division (military)|Division]] was annihilated at the Village of the Mountain of Guo (Guo-shan Tun, \u90ed\u5c71\u5c6f), and the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 87th [[Division (military)|Division]] was badly mauled at the Village Next to the Mountain (Kao-shan Tun, \u9760\u5c71\u5c6f).  On March 12, 1947, [[Nong'an County|Nong'an]] (\u519c\u5b89) was besieged and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were forced to redeploy the [[New 1st Army|Newly Organized 1st Army]] (including its Newly Organized 22nd [[Division (military)|Division]]) and the 54th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the 13th Army from [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] (\u70ed\u6cb3) to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms again.  Succeeding in distracting the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] who had to stop their third offensives, the enemy withdrew to the north of [[Songhua River]].\n\n==Fourth Stage==\nNot wanting to admitting defeat, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] launched their fourth offensive against the [[communist]] base south of [[Songhua River]] on March 26, 1947, with a total strength of twenty regiments attacking in three fronts.  The enemy, in response, targeted the central front headed by the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 89th [[Division (military)|Division]], who was dangerously exposed because its push was much too fast.  While other enemy units resisted the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] left and right fronts, the main body of the enemy force ambushed the 89th [[Division (military)|Division]] of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] central front on April 1, 1947, annihilating the entire [[Division (military)|Division]].  Learning the news of the annihilation of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] 89th [[Division (military)|Division]], the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] on the other two fronts immediately withdrew.\n\nThe failure of the [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] fourth offensive marked the end of campaign because the units deployed were the same ones that participated in earlier offensives, and thus was gravely overworked and overstretched.  The [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] could not afford to expend anymore valuable troops and must reserve their strength to defend the territory currently under their control.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe [[Linjiang, Jilin|Linjiang]] Campaign marked the turning point of the battlefield of [[northeast China]]: after this [[communist]] victory, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] in [[northeast China]] were forced to be on the defensive, and could no longer to launch any offensives, while in contrast, the [[communist]]s would be on the offensives from then on.  It must be said, however, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were still quite capable of knocking out the entire [[communist]] force in [[northeast China]] if the right tactics were applied, such as concentrating on annihilating enemy force instead of gaining and holding on to more land, as suggested by many local [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] commanders, but their correct suggestion was overridden by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] infatuation with conquering more land.  Furthermore, even if the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] were unable to annihilate the enemy at the time, they could still reserve their strength by giving up [[northeast China]] and saving troops, and the situation had improved, the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] would be able to retake [[northeast China]], as suggested by [[Chen Cheng]] in 1946.  Again, this alternative would also contradicting with Chiang's uncompromising stand, which ultimately doomed the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chinese battles#Modern China|List of Battles of Chinese Civil War]]\n*[[National Revolutionary Army]]\n*[[History of the People's Liberation Army]]\n*[[Chinese Civil War]]\n{{Chinese Civil War}}\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=September 2014}}\n*Zhu, Zongzhen and Wang, Chaoguang, ''Liberation War History'', 1st Edition, Social Scientific Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2000, {{ISBN|7-80149-207-2}} (set)\n*Zhang, Ping, ''History of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Chinese Youth Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-5006-0081-X}} (pbk.)\n*Jie, Lifu, ''Records of the Libration War: The Decisive Battle of Two Kinds of Fates'', 1st Edition, [[Hebei]] People's Publishing House in [[Shijiazhuang]], 1990, {{ISBN|7-202-00733-9}} (set)\n*Literary and Historical Research Committee of the [[Anhui]] Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], ''Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Anhui]] People's Publishing House in [[Hefei]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-212-00007-8}}\n*Li, Zuomin, ''Heroic Division and Iron Horse: Records of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] Party History Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2004, {{ISBN|7-80199-029-3}}\n*Wang, Xingsheng, and Zhang, Jingshan, ''Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[People's Liberation Army]] Literature and Art Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2001, {{ISBN|7-5033-1351-X}} (set)\n*Huang, Youlan, ''History of the Chinese People's Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Archives Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1992, {{ISBN|7-80019-338-1}}\n*Liu Wusheng, ''From [[Yan'an]] to [[Beijing]]: A Collection of Military Records and Research Publications of Important Campaigns in the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Central Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993, {{ISBN|7-5073-0074-9}}\n*Tang, Yilu and Bi, Jianzhong, ''History of Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] in Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Military Scientific Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993 &ndash; 1997, {{ISBN|7-80021-719-1}} (Volum 1), 7800219615 (Volum 2), 7800219631 (Volum 3), 7801370937 (Volum 4), and 7801370953 (Volum 5)\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1946]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1947]]\n[[Category:Campaigns of the Chinese Civil War]]\n[[Category:1946 in China]]\n[[Category:1947 in China]]\n", "name_user": "Kevin9217", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linjiang_Campaign"}

P. Singh]] national government in November 1990, Yadav joined [[Chandra Shekhar]]'s Janata Dal (Socialist) party and continued in office as chief minister with the support of the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). His government fell when the INC withdrew their support in April 1991 in the aftermath of developments at the national level where it has earlier withdrawn its support for Chandra Shekhar's government. Mid-term elections to Uttar Pradesh assembly were held in mid-1991, in which Mulayam Singh's party lost power to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Second term ===\nIn 1992, Yadav founded his own Samajwadi Party (Socialist Party).<ref name=\"profile\" /> In 1993, he allied with the [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] for the elections to Uttar Pradesh assembly due to be held in November 1993.

Yadav became chief minister<ref name=\"profile\" /> of Uttar Pradesh with the support of Congress and Janata Dal. His stand on movement for demanding separate statehood for [[Uttarakhand]] was as much controversial as his stand on Ayodhya movement in 1990 was. There was a firing on Uttarakhand activists at Muzaffarnagar on 2 October 1994, something for which Uttarakhand activists held him responsible.

Mulayam termed the national convention as illegal and directly expelled his cousin, Ram Gopal Yadav, who had convened the national executive convention. But the Election commission of India ruled that Ram Gopal Yadav had the right to convene that executive convention, and reversed Mulayam's order.

His government fell when the INC withdrew their support in April 1991 in the aftermath of developments at the national level where it has earlier withdrawn its support for Chandra Shekhar's government.

Yadav became chief minister<ref name=\"profile\" /> of Uttar Pradesh with the support of Congress and Janata Dal.

Mulayam termed the national convention as illegal and directly expelled his cousin, Ram Gopal Yadav, who had convened the national executive convention. But the Election commission of India ruled that Ram Gopal Yadav had the right to convene that executive convention, and reversed Mulayam's order.

The organismic emotion is the outburst of emotions and feelings. In organismic emotion, emotions/feelings are instantly expressed. Social and other factors do not influence how the emotion is perceived, so these factors have no control on how or if the emotion is suppressed or expressed.\n\nIn interactive emotion, emotions and feelings are controlled. The individual is constantly considering how to react or what to suppress. In interactive emotion, unlike in organismic emotion, the individual is aware of their decision on how they feel and how they show it.\n\n[[Erving Goffman]], a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Self-harm ===\n{{Main|Self-harm}}\n[[Anger]], [[happiness]], [[joy]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]], and excitement are some of the feelings that can be experienced in life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.affektblog.de/emotionen-und-gefuehle-wo-ist-eigentlich-der-unterschied/|title=Feelings and Emotions - where is the difference?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|language=German}}</ref> In response to these emotions, our bodies react as well.

When an individual is dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and problems in their lives, it can lead to self-harm. When one is in a good state of feeling, they never want it to end; conversely, when someone is in a bad state, they want that feeling to disappear. Inflicting harm or pain to oneself is sometimes the answer for many individuals because they want something to keep their mind off the real problem. These individuals cut, stab, and starve themselves in an effort to feel something other than what they currently feel, as they believe the pain to be not as bad as their actual problem. Distraction is not the only reason why many individuals choose to inflict self-harm. Some people inflict self-harm to punish themselves for feeling a certain way.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19186925|year=2009|last1=Bar-Anan|first1=Y|title=The feeling of uncertainty intensifies affective reactions|journal=Emotion|volume=9|issue=1|pages=123\u20137|last2=Wilson|first2=T.

It may be negative, such as a feeling of uneasiness, or positive, such as a feeling of trust. Gut feelings are generally regarded as not modulated by conscious thought, but sometimes as a feature of [[intuition]] rather than [[rationality]]. The idea that emotions are experienced in the gut has a long historical legacy, and many nineteenth-century doctors considered the origins of mental illness to derive from the intestines.<ref>Manon Mathias and Alison M. Moore (eds), [https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030018566 Gut Feeling and Digestive Health in Nineteenth-Century Literature, History and Culture]. New York: Palgrave, 2018. {{ISBN|978-3-030-01857-3}}: </ref>\n\nThe phrase \"gut feeling\" may also be used as a shorthand term for an individual's \"common sense\" perception of what is considered \"the right thing to do\", such as helping an injured passerby, avoiding dark alleys and generally acting in accordance with instinctive feelings about a given situation. It can also refer to simple common knowledge phrases which are true no matter when said, such as \"Water is wet\" or \"Fire is hot\", or to ideas that an individual intuitively regards as true (see \"[[truthiness]]\" for examples).\n\n== Knowing or not knowing ==\nThe way that we see other people express their emotions or feelings determines how we respond. The way an individual responds to a situation is based on [[feeling rules]]. If an individual is uninformed about a situation the way they respond would be in a completely different demeanor than if they were informed about a situation. For example, if a tragic event had occurred and they had knowledge of it, their response would be sympathetic to that situation. If they had no knowledge of the situation, then their response may be indifference.  A lack of knowledge or information about an event can shape the way an individual sees things and the way they respond.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Timothy D. Wilson]], a psychology professor, tested this theory of the feeling of uncertainty along with his colleague Yoav Bar-Anan, a social psychologist. Wilson and Bar-Ann found that the more uncertain or unclear an individual is about a situation, the more invested they are. Since an individual does not know the background or the ending of a story they are constantly replaying an event in their mind which is causing them to have mixed feelings of happiness, sadness, excitement, and et cetera.  If there is any difference between feelings and emotions, the feeling of uncertainty is less sure than the emotion of ambivalence: the former is precarious, the latter is not yet acted upon or decided upon.\n\nIndividuals in society want to know every detail about something in hopes to maximize the feeling for that moment, but Wilson found that feeling uncertain can lead to something being more enjoyable because it has a sense of mystery. In fact, the feeling of not knowing can lead them to constantly think and feel about what could have been.<ref>{{cite journal | title=From Feeling Too Little and Too Much, to Feeling More and Less?

Evocation is used to obtain or bring up a certain feeling and suppression is used to put away or hide certain unwanted feelings. Emotion work is done by an individual, others upon them, or them upon others. Emotion work is done to achieve a certain feeling that one believes they should feel.\n\nThree more specific types of emotion work are cognitive, bodily, and expressive. Cognitive changes images, bodily changes physical aspects, and expressive changes gestures. A person who is sad uses expressive emotion work to lift their spirits by trying to smile. A person who is stressed uses bodily emotion work by trying to breathe slower in order to lower stress levels. Emotion work allows individuals to change their feelings to suit the current situation.\n\nFeelings are deemed appropriate if they fit the current situation. Since individuals want to fit in and be seen as normal, they are constantly working on their feelings in order to fit the situation. Emotion work is more so how people want to feel or how they want other people to see them feel. Feelings are not permanent, but an ongoing thing because people constantly try to bring up, suppress, or manage feelings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie|date=1979|title=Emotion Work, Feeling Rules, and Social Structure|url=https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf|journal=American Journal of Sociology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Psychophysiology|Psychophysiological]] Flow\", as Ikemi  points out,<ref>Ikemi, Akira (2005), Carl Rogers and Eugene Gendlin on the Bodily Felt Sense: What they share and where they differ, in: Person-Centered and Experiential Psychotherapies, Vol 4, N. 1</ref> is a concept created by [[Carl Rogers]], founder of the [[humanistic psychology]] school, to describe the 'sensory and visceral experiences', or the flow of internal sensations that the individual can perceive.\n\n=== Social class ===\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2018|section}}\nClass differences influence and varies how a parent raises their child. [[Middle-class]] parents raise their child through the use of feelings and [[Underclass|lower-class]] parents raise their children through behavior control. Middle-class parents and lower-class parents raise their children to be like them feeling and behavioral wise. Middle-class children get reprimanded for feeling the wrong way and lower-class children are punished for behaving badly.\n\n[[Lionel Trilling]], an author and literary critic, described the technique that the middle- and the lower-class parents use. Under-working and overworking their children's feelings causes them to seek approval of their feelings in the future. When children of lower-class and of [[working-class]] families join the [[workforce]], they are less prepared for emotional management than middle-class children.  However, the working-class and the middle-class do complain of over-management or micromanagement of feelings that distract from actual work.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Collier's Poster}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Affect (psychology)|Affect]]\n* [[Consciousness]]\n* [[Cognitive neuroscience]]\n* [[Emotion]]\n* [[Hard problem of consciousness]]\n* [[Intuition]]\n* [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]]\n* ''[[Psychological Types]]''\n* [[Qualia]]\n* [[Sensation (psychology)]]\n* [[Vedan\u0101]], the Buddhist concept of feeling\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{Emotion-footer}}\n\n[[Category:Feeling| ]]\n[[Category:Qualia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Conscious subjective experience of emotion}}\n{{redirect|Feelings|other uses|Feelings (disambiguation)}}\nOriginally used in the [[English language]] to describe the physical sensation of [[touch]] through either [[experience]] or [[perception]], the word is also used to describe other experiences, such as \"[[Emotion|a feeling of warmth]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/feeling|title=Yahoo|access-date=2008-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516132820/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/feeling|archive-date=2008-05-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> and of [[sentience]] in general.

Results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves.<ref name=\"Wood 188\u2013201\"/>\n\n[[Arlie Russell Hochschild]], a [[sociologist]], depicted two accounts of emotion. The organismic emotion is the outburst of emotions and feelings. In organismic emotion, emotions/feelings are instantly expressed. Social and other factors do not influence how the emotion is perceived, so these factors have no control on how or if the emotion is suppressed or expressed.\n\nIn interactive emotion, emotions and feelings are controlled. The individual is constantly considering how to react or what to suppress. In interactive emotion, unlike in organismic emotion, the individual is aware of their decision on how they feel and how they show it.\n\n[[Erving Goffman]], a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Self-harm ===\n{{Main|Self-harm}}\n[[Anger]], [[happiness]], [[joy]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]], and excitement are some of the feelings that can be experienced in life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.affektblog.de/emotionen-und-gefuehle-wo-ist-eigentlich-der-unterschied/|title=Feelings and Emotions - where is the difference?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|language=German}}</ref> In response to these emotions, our bodies react as well.

When an individual is dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and problems in their lives, it can lead to self-harm. When one is in a good state of feeling, they never want it to end; conversely, when someone is in a bad state, they want that feeling to disappear. Inflicting harm or pain to oneself is sometimes the answer for many individuals because they want something to keep their mind off the real problem. These individuals cut, stab, and starve themselves in an effort to feel something other than what they currently feel, as they believe the pain to be not as bad as their actual problem. Distraction is not the only reason why many individuals choose to inflict self-harm. Some people inflict self-harm to punish themselves for feeling a certain way.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19186925|year=2009|last1=Bar-Anan|first1=Y|title=The feeling of uncertainty intensifies affective reactions|journal=Emotion|volume=9|issue=1|pages=123\u20137|last2=Wilson|first2=T.

It may be negative, such as a feeling of uneasiness, or positive, such as a feeling of trust. Gut feelings are generally regarded as not modulated by conscious thought, but sometimes as a feature of [[intuition]] rather than [[rationality]]. The idea that emotions are experienced in the gut has a long historical legacy, and many nineteenth-century doctors considered the origins of mental illness to derive from the intestines.<ref>Manon Mathias and Alison M. Moore (eds), [https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030018566 Gut Feeling and Digestive Health in Nineteenth-Century Literature, History and Culture]. New York: Palgrave, 2018. {{ISBN|978-3-030-01857-3}}: </ref>\n\nThe phrase \"gut feeling\" may also be used as a shorthand term for an individual's \"common sense\" perception of what is considered \"the right thing to do\", such as helping an injured passerby, avoiding dark alleys and generally acting in accordance with instinctive feelings about a given situation. It can also refer to simple common knowledge phrases which are true no matter when said, such as \"Water is wet\" or \"Fire is hot\", or to ideas that an individual intuitively regards as true (see \"[[truthiness]]\" for examples).\n\n== Knowing or not knowing ==\nThe way that we see other people express their emotions or feelings determines how we respond. The way an individual responds to a situation is based on [[feeling rules]]. If an individual is uninformed about a situation the way they respond would be in a completely different demeanor than if they were informed about a situation. For example, if a tragic event had occurred and they had knowledge of it, their response would be sympathetic to that situation. If they had no knowledge of the situation, then their response may be indifference.  A lack of knowledge or information about an event can shape the way an individual sees things and the way they respond.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Timothy D. Wilson]], a psychology professor, tested this theory of the feeling of uncertainty along with his colleague Yoav Bar-Anan, a social psychologist. Wilson and Bar-Ann found that the more uncertain or unclear an individual is about a situation, the more invested they are. Since an individual does not know the background or the ending of a story they are constantly replaying an event in their mind which is causing them to have mixed feelings of happiness, sadness, excitement, and et cetera.  If there is any difference between feelings and emotions, the feeling of uncertainty is less sure than the emotion of ambivalence: the former is precarious, the latter is not yet acted upon or decided upon.\n\nIndividuals in society want to know every detail about something in hopes to maximize the feeling for that moment, but Wilson found that feeling uncertain can lead to something being more enjoyable because it has a sense of mystery. In fact, the feeling of not knowing can lead them to constantly think and feel about what could have been.<ref>{{cite journal | title=From Feeling Too Little and Too Much, to Feeling More and Less?

Evocation is used to obtain or bring up a certain feeling and suppression is used to put away or hide certain unwanted feelings. Emotion work is done by an individual, others upon them, or them upon others. Emotion work is done to achieve a certain feeling that one believes they should feel.\n\nThree more specific types of emotion work are cognitive, bodily, and expressive. Cognitive changes images, bodily changes physical aspects, and expressive changes gestures. A person who is sad uses expressive emotion work to lift their spirits by trying to smile. A person who is stressed uses bodily emotion work by trying to breathe slower in order to lower stress levels. Emotion work allows individuals to change their feelings to suit the current situation.\n\nFeelings are deemed appropriate if they fit the current situation. Since individuals want to fit in and be seen as normal, they are constantly working on their feelings in order to fit the situation. Emotion work is more so how people want to feel or how they want other people to see them feel. Feelings are not permanent, but an ongoing thing because people constantly try to bring up, suppress, or manage feelings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie|date=1979|title=Emotion Work, Feeling Rules, and Social Structure|url=https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf|journal=American Journal of Sociology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Psychophysiology|Psychophysiological]] Flow\", as Ikemi  points out,<ref>Ikemi, Akira (2005), Carl Rogers and Eugene Gendlin on the Bodily Felt Sense: What they share and where they differ, in: Person-Centered and Experiential Psychotherapies, Vol 4, N. 1</ref> is a concept created by [[Carl Rogers]], founder of the [[humanistic psychology]] school, to describe the 'sensory and visceral experiences', or the flow of internal sensations that the individual can perceive.\n\n=== Social class ===\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2018|section}}\nClass differences influence and varies how a parent raises their child. [[Middle-class]] parents raise their child through the use of feelings and [[Underclass|lower-class]] parents raise their children through behavior control. Middle-class parents and lower-class parents raise their children to be like them feeling and behavioral wise. Middle-class children get reprimanded for feeling the wrong way and lower-class children are punished for behaving badly.\n\n[[Lionel Trilling]], an author and literary critic, described the technique that the middle- and the lower-class parents use. Under-working and overworking their children's feelings causes them to seek approval of their feelings in the future. When children of lower-class and of [[working-class]] families join the [[workforce]], they are less prepared for emotional management than middle-class children.  However, the working-class and the middle-class do complain of over-management or micromanagement of feelings that distract from actual work.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Collier's Poster}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Affect (psychology)|Affect]]\n* [[Consciousness]]\n* [[Cognitive neuroscience]]\n* [[Emotion]]\n* [[Hard problem of consciousness]]\n* [[Intuition]]\n* [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]]\n* ''[[Psychological Types]]''\n* [[Qualia]]\n* [[Sensation (psychology)]]\n* [[Vedan\u0101]], the Buddhist concept of feeling\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{Emotion-footer}}\n\n[[Category:Feeling| ]]\n[[Category:Qualia]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4053:87:2be3::1150:c0ad", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling"}
