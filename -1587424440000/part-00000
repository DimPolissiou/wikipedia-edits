Crevels (2011) estimates 60,000 speakers out of an ethnic population of 140,000.<ref name=e21>{{Ethnologue21|pbb}}</ref>\n\nThe language is spoken by the second largest Colombian indigenous community, the [[P\u00e1ez people|P\u00e1ez]], in the north of the [[Cauca Department]], in southwestern Colombia. However, the people had to move to other departments of Colombia like [[Huila Department|Huila]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] and [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]].\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Paezan languages}}\n\nP\u00e1ez is generally considered to be a language isolate, or at least the only surviving member of its family (Adelaar & Muysken 2004). Jolkesky (2017) argues for a connection, perhaps genetic, with the Otomanguean languages of the Pacific coast of central Mexico, especially with the Zapotecan branch, and for a possible Otomanguean substratum in a couple of families neighboring Paez. The proposal has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n==Varieties==\nBelow is a full list of Paezan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n*'''Paez''' / '''Paisa''' - language spoken in the villages of the [[Paez River]], department of Huila. Dialects:\n**'''Nasayuw\u00e4''' - spoken in the village of Pitayo.\n**'''Okoshkoky\u00e9wa''' - spoken in the village of La Pe\u00f1a.\n**'''Paniquita''' - spoken in some villages, [[Paniquita]] and others, in the Huila region.\n\n*'''Panzaleo''' / '''Latacunga''' / '''Quito''' - extinct language once spoken in the provinces of [[Pichincha]], [[Cotopaxi]], and [[Tungurahua]], Ecuador.\n*'''Alaus\u00ed''' - once spoken in the village of [[Alaus\u00ed]], Chimborazo province, Ecuador. (Unattested.)\n\n==History==\nAlthough many Colombian indigenous languages have disappeared since colonial times, there are still more than 60 languages in Colombia, classified into 10 linguistic families: [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]], [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]], [[Cariban languages|Caribe]], [[Quechuan languages|Quichua]], [[Tucanoan languages|Tukano]], [[Guajiboan languages|Guahibo]], [[Macro-Puinavean languages|Mak\u00fa-Puinave]], [[Bora-Witoto languages|Witoto-Bora]], [[Piaroa-Saliban languages|S\u00e1liba]], and [[Choco languages|Choc\u00f3]]. Currently, the Chibcha family has languages from [[Santa Marta]]: [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]], [[Kogi language|kogui]], [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]], [[U'wa language|Tunebo]], [[Bar\u00ed language|Motilone]], [[Chimila language|Chimila]] and [[Kuna language|Cuna]], but it used to be believed that Nasa Yuwe was part of the Chibcha family.\n\nAgriculture is the basis of the people's economy and so they have been fighting to expand their fields. With territorial expansion, they could spread out their own language. For instance, Nasa Yuwe speakers could recently develop their culture in the east and the west of their own township.\n\nThe language has been endangered for many centuries. The first threat against the language was in the 17th century, with the imposition of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for education in Colombia.\n\nIn the 20th century, people believed that Nasa Yuwe had roots from Chibcha, but the former language is now considered an isolate. Also, in the P\u00e1ez townships, there are many groups of Guambianos that allow the creation of some linguistic variations and bilingualism.\n\nIn education, the Nasa Yuwe were oppressed by the dominant culture, which wanted them to become Colombian citizens. Schooling was partly to civilize the indigenous; children who spoke in their native language were punished such as by being forced to kneel on grains of corn for hours. Thus, people were forced to avoid their native language.\n\n==Revitalization==\nWith the General Law of Education, ethnoeducation is the opportunity of education for ethnic groups, but education needs to be related to the culture, traditions, language, and native elements of ethnic groups. To achieve the goal to give importance to indigenous languages, it is important to ensure that future indigenous generations preserve and relearn languages that do not have social privilege in Colombian society. Thus, it was necessary to implement booklets and original content material in the different languages.\n\nAlthough the government proposed the introduction of education of native languages in some communities, the preservation of languages and identities has been neglected. It is important to revitalize the language because it is part of the identity of many people who have been not considered part of Colombian society.\n\nThe first step is for the native teachers to know all the academic aspects and the sociocultural aspects of the ethnic group. The next is the creation of a campaign to promote the importance of the language in a minority community to maintain identity. The goal of the campaign is to reinforce the use of the language in the education environment and the family environment because they are children's first and most influential contacts. The last step is to promote the project to being used with other endangered languages of our country and revitalize them. Also, it is also necessary to create a conscience in the rest of the society to avoid the marginalization of the people who speak these native languages.\n\n== Phonology ==\nPaez has four vowel sounds: /i, e, a, u/. Each vowel demonstrates nasalization /\u0129 \u1ebd \u00e3 \u0169/, aspiration /i\u02b0 e\u02b0 a\u02b0 u\u02b0/, and vowel length /i\u02d0 e\u02d0 a\u02d0 u\u02d0/, all of which are contrastive. In addition, each vowel sound can be laryngealized /\u1e2d \u1e1b a\u0330 \u1e75/. Laryngealization can occur to nasalized or plain vowels, but not to lengthened vowels, while nasalization can occur to a plain or lengthened vowel. However, vowel length is not contrastive in all dialects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon \u2013 South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Esbozo gramatical de la lengua nasa (lengua p\u00e1ez)|last=Rojas|first=Tulio|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Consonants\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|p\n|p\u02b2\n|t\n|t\u02b2\n|k\n|k\u02b2\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|p\u02b0\n|p\u02b2\u02b0\n|t\u02b0\n|t\u02b2\u02b0\n|k\u02b0\n|k\u02b2\u02b0\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\u1d50b\n|\u1d50b\u02b2\n|\u207fd\n|\u207fd\u02b2\n|\u1d51\u0261\n|\u1d51\u0261\u02b2\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\n|t\u0361\u0283\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\u02b0\n|t\u0361\u0283\u02b0\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\n|\n|\u207fd\u0361z\n|\u207fd\u0361\u0292\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\u0278\u02b2\n|s\n|\u0283\n|x\n|x\u02b2\n|-\n!<small>voiced</small>\n|\n|\u03b2\u02b2\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\u0272\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n!<small>lateral</small>\n|\n|\n|l\n|\u028e\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|w\n|\n|}\n[[File:Nasa yuwe tale.jpg|thumb|Nasa yuwe tale]]\n\n==Vocabulary==\n[[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for Paez, Nasayuw\u00e4, Okoshkoky\u00e9wa, Paniquita, and Panzaleo.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! gloss !!

However, the people had to move to other departments of Colombia like [[Huila Department|Huila]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] and [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]].\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Paezan languages}}\n\nP\u00e1ez is generally considered to be a language isolate, or at least the only surviving member of its family (Adelaar & Muysken 2004). Jolkesky (2017) argues for a connection, perhaps genetic, with the Otomanguean languages of the Pacific coast of central Mexico, especially with the Zapotecan branch, and for a possible Otomanguean substratum in a couple of families neighboring Paez. The proposal has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n==Varieties==\nBelow is a full list of Paezan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n*'''Paez''' / '''Paisa''' - language spoken in the villages of the [[Paez River]], department of Huila.

(Unattested.)\n\n==History==\nAlthough many Colombian indigenous languages have disappeared since colonial times, there are still more than 60 languages in Colombia, classified into 10 linguistic families: [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]], [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]], [[Cariban languages|Caribe]], [[Quechuan languages|Quichua]], [[Tucanoan languages|Tukano]], [[Guajiboan languages|Guahibo]], [[Macro-Puinavean languages|Mak\u00fa-Puinave]], [[Bora-Witoto languages|Witoto-Bora]], [[Piaroa-Saliban languages|S\u00e1liba]], and [[Choco languages|Choc\u00f3]]. Currently, the Chibcha family has languages from [[Santa Marta]]: [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]], [[Kogi language|kogui]], [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]], [[U'wa language|Tunebo]], [[Bar\u00ed language|Motilone]], [[Chimila language|Chimila]] and [[Kuna language|Cuna]], but it used to be believed that Nasa Yuwe was part of the Chibcha family.\n\nAgriculture is the basis of the people's economy and so they have been fighting to expand their fields. With territorial expansion, they could spread out their own language. For instance, Nasa Yuwe speakers could recently develop their culture in the east and the west of their own township.\n\nThe language has been endangered for many centuries. The first threat against the language was in the 17th century, with the imposition of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for education in Colombia.\n\nIn the 20th century, people believed that Nasa Yuwe had roots from Chibcha, but the former language is now considered an isolate. Also, in the P\u00e1ez townships, there are many groups of Guambianos that allow the creation of some linguistic variations and bilingualism.\n\nIn education, the Nasa Yuwe were oppressed by the dominant culture, which wanted them to become Colombian citizens. Schooling was partly to civilize the indigenous; children who spoke in their native language were punished such as by being forced to kneel on grains of corn for hours. Thus, people were forced to avoid their native language.\n\n==Revitalization==\nWith the General Law of Education, ethnoeducation is the opportunity of education for ethnic groups, but education needs to be related to the culture, traditions, language, and native elements of ethnic groups. To achieve the goal to give importance to indigenous languages, it is important to ensure that future indigenous generations preserve and relearn languages that do not have social privilege in Colombian society. Thus, it was necessary to implement booklets and original content material in the different languages.\n\nAlthough the government proposed the introduction of education of native languages in some communities, the preservation of languages and identities has been neglected. It is important to revitalize the language because it is part of the identity of many people who have been not considered part of Colombian society.\n\nThe first step is for the native teachers to know all the academic aspects and the sociocultural aspects of the ethnic group. The next is the creation of a campaign to promote the importance of the language in a minority community to maintain identity. The goal of the campaign is to reinforce the use of the language in the education environment and the family environment because they are children's first and most influential contacts. The last step is to promote the project to being used with other endangered languages of our country and revitalize them. Also, it is also necessary to create a conscience in the rest of the society to avoid the marginalization of the people who speak these native languages.\n\n== Phonology ==\nPaez has four vowel sounds: /i, e, a, u/. Each vowel demonstrates nasalization /\u0129 \u1ebd \u00e3 \u0169/, aspiration /i\u02b0 e\u02b0 a\u02b0 u\u02b0/, and vowel length /i\u02d0 e\u02d0 a\u02d0 u\u02d0/, all of which are contrastive. In addition, each vowel sound can be laryngealized /\u1e2d \u1e1b a\u0330 \u1e75/. Laryngealization can occur to nasalized or plain vowels, but not to lengthened vowels, while nasalization can occur to a plain or lengthened vowel. However, vowel length is not contrastive in all dialects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon \u2013 South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Esbozo gramatical de la lengua nasa (lengua p\u00e1ez)|last=Rojas|first=Tulio|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Consonants\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|p\n|p\u02b2\n|t\n|t\u02b2\n|k\n|k\u02b2\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|p\u02b0\n|p\u02b2\u02b0\n|t\u02b0\n|t\u02b2\u02b0\n|k\u02b0\n|k\u02b2\u02b0\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\u1d50b\n|\u1d50b\u02b2\n|\u207fd\n|\u207fd\u02b2\n|\u1d51\u0261\n|\u1d51\u0261\u02b2\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\n|t\u0361\u0283\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\u02b0\n|t\u0361\u0283\u02b0\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\n|\n|\u207fd\u0361z\n|\u207fd\u0361\u0292\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\u0278\u02b2\n|s\n|\u0283\n|x\n|x\u02b2\n|-\n!<small>voiced</small>\n|\n|\u03b2\u02b2\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\u0272\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n!<small>lateral</small>\n|\n|\n|l\n|\u028e\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|w\n|\n|}\n[[File:Nasa yuwe tale.jpg|thumb|Nasa yuwe tale]]\n\n==Vocabulary==\n[[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for Paez, Nasayuw\u00e4, Okoshkoky\u00e9wa, Paniquita, and Panzaleo.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! gloss !!

They are a type of chemical messenger which transmits signals across a [[chemical synapse]] from one [[neuron]] (nerve cell) to another 'target' neuron, [[myocyte|muscle cell]], or [[gland|gland cell]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lodish|first1=H.|last2=Berk|first2=A.|last3=Zipursky|first3=S.L.|title=Molecular Cell Biology: Section 21.4Neurotransmitters, Synapses, and Impulse Transmission|date=2000|publisher=W.

Freeman|location=New York|edition=4th|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21521/}}</ref> Neurotransmitters are released from [[synaptic vesicles]] in synapses into the [[synaptic cleft]], where they are received by [[neurotransmitter receptor]]s on the target cell. Many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as [[amino acid]]s, which are readily available and only require a small number of [[biosynthetic]] steps for conversion. Neurotransmitters are essential to the function of complex neural systems. The exact number of unique neurotransmitters in humans is unknown, but more than 200&nbsp;have been identified.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cherry|first1=Kendra|title=What is a Neurotransmitter?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/nindex/g/neurotransmitter.htm|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://isyslab.info/NeuroPep/browse_organism?&name=Homo%20sapiens|title=Neuropeptide database|archivedate=23 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=965|title=Neuropeptides.

Neurotransmitters are released into and diffuse across the [[synaptic cleft]], where they bind to specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron.<ref>Elias, L. J, & Saucier, D. M. (2005). Neuropsychology: Clinical and Experimental Foundations. Boston: Pearson</ref> Binding of neurotransmitters may influence the postsynaptic neuron in either an [[Excitatory synapse|excitation]] or [[Inhibitory synapse|inhibitory]] way, [[Depolarization|depolarizing]] or [[Repolarization|repolarizing]] it respectively.\n\nMost neurotransmitters are about the size of a single amino acid; however, some neurotransmitters may be the size of larger proteins or [[peptides]]. A released neurotransmitter is typically available in the synaptic cleft for a short time before it is metabolized by enzymes, pulled back into the presynaptic neuron through [[reuptake]], or bound to a [[postsynaptic receptor]]. Nevertheless, short-term exposure of the receptor to a neurotransmitter is typically sufficient for causing a postsynaptic response by way of [[Neurotransmission|synaptic transmission]].\n\nGenerally, a neurotransmitter is released at the presynaptic terminal in response to a threshold [[action potential]] or [[Membrane potential#Graded potentials|graded electrical potential]] in the presynaptic neuron. However, low level 'baseline' release also occurs without electrical stimulation.\n\n==Discovery==\n{{see also|History of catecholamine research}}\nUntil the early 20th century, scientists assumed that the majority of synaptic communication in the brain was electrical. However, through [[Histology|histological]] examinations by [[Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]], a 20 to 40&nbsp;nm gap between neurons, known today as the [[synaptic cleft]], was discovered. The presence of such a gap suggested communication via chemical messengers traversing the synaptic cleft, and in 1921 German pharmacologist [[Otto Loewi]] confirmed that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals. Through a series of experiments involving the vagus nerves of frogs, Loewi was able to manually slow the heart rate of frogs by controlling the amount of saline solution present around the vagus nerve. Upon completion of this experiment, Loewi asserted that sympathetic regulation of cardiac function can be mediated through changes in chemical concentrations. Furthermore, Otto Loewi is credited with discovering [[acetylcholine]] (ACh)\u2014the first known neurotransmitter.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. ''Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function''. McGraw Hill. 2009 {{ISBN|0-07-727620-5}}</ref>\n\n==Identification==\nThere are four main criteria for identifying neurotransmitters:\n# The chemical must be synthesized in the neuron or otherwise be present in it. \n# When the neuron is active, the chemical must be released and produce a response in some targets. \n# The same response must be obtained when the chemical is experimentally placed on the target. \n# A mechanism must exist for removing the chemical from its site of activation after its work is done.\n\nHowever, given advances in pharmacology, genetics, and chemical [[neuroanatomy]], the term \"neurotransmitter\" can be applied to chemicals that:\n* Carry messages between neurons via influence on the postsynaptic membrane.\n* Have little or no effect on membrane voltage, but have a common carrying function such as changing the structure of the synapse. \n* Communicate by sending reverse-direction messages that affect the release or reuptake of transmitters.\n\nThe anatomical localization of neurotransmitters is typically determined using immunocytochemical techniques, which identify the location of either the transmitter substances themselves or of the enzymes that are involved in their synthesis. Immunocytochemical techniques have also revealed that many transmitters, particularly the [[neuropeptide]]s, are co-localized, that is, a neuron may release more than one transmitter from its synaptic terminal.<ref name=\"BioPsych Breedlove & Watson\">{{cite book|last1=University|first1=S.

Although other transmitters are used in fewer synapses, they may be very important functionally: the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering the actions of some neurotransmitter systems, often acting through transmitters other than glutamate or GABA. Addictive drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines exert their effects primarily on the dopamine system. The addictive [[opiate]] drugs exert their effects primarily as functional analogs of [[opioid peptides]], which, in turn, regulate dopamine levels.\n\n===List of neurotransmitters, peptides, and

Each neuron has as many as 15,000 connections with neighboring neurons.\n\nNeurons do not touch each other (except in the case of an electrical synapse through a gap junction); instead, neurons interact at contact points called synapses: a junction within two nerve cells, consisting of a miniature gap within which impulses are carried by a neurotransmitter. A neuron transports its information by way of a nerve impulse called an action potential. When an action potential arrives at the synapse's presynaptic terminal button, it may stimulate the release of neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft to bind onto the receptors of the postsynaptic membrane and influence another cell, either in an inhibitory or excitatory way. The next neuron may be connected to many more neurons, and if the total of excitatory influences minus inhibitory influences is great enough, it will also \"fire\". That is to say, it will create a new action potential at its axon hillock, releasing neurotransmitters and passing on the information to yet another neighboring neuron.\n\n=== Excitatory and inhibitory ===\n\nA neurotransmitter can influence the function of a neuron through a remarkable number of mechanisms.  In its direct actions in influencing a neuron's [[Membrane potential|electrical excitability]], however, a neurotransmitter acts in only one of two ways: excitatory or inhibitory. A neurotransmitter influences trans-membrane ion flow either to increase (excitatory) or to decrease (inhibitory) the probability that the cell with which it comes in contact will produce an action potential. Thus, despite the wide variety of synapses, they all convey messages of only these two types, and they are labeled as such. Type I synapses are [[excitatory]] in their actions, whereas type II synapses are [[inhibitory]]. Each type has a different appearance and is located on different parts of the neurons under its influence.\n\nType I (excitatory) synapses are typically located on the shafts or the spines of dendrites, whereas type II (inhibitory) synapses are typically located on a cell body. In addition, Type I synapses have round synaptic vesicles, whereas the vesicles of type II synapses are flattened. The material on the presynaptic and post-synaptic membranes is denser in a Type I synapse than it is in a type II, and the type I synaptic cleft is wider. Finally, the active zone on a Type I synapse is larger than that on a Type II synapse.\n\nThe different locations of type I and type II synapses divide a neuron into two zones: an excitatory dendritic tree and an inhibitory cell body. From an inhibitory perspective, excitation comes in over the dendrites and spreads to the [[axon hillock]] to trigger an [[action potential]]. If the message is to be stopped, it is best stopped by applying inhibition on the cell body, close to the axon hillock where the action potential originates. Another way to conceptualize excitatory\u2013inhibitory interaction is to picture excitation overcoming inhibition. If the cell body is normally in an inhibited state, the only way to generate an action potential at the axon hillock is to reduce the cell body's inhibition. In this \"open the gates\" strategy, the excitatory message is like a racehorse ready to run down the track, but first, the inhibitory starting gate must be removed.<ref name=\"Kolb Intro to Brain and Behavior\">{{cite book|last1=Whishaw|first1=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An introduction to brain and behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1429242288|edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n===Examples of important neurotransmitter actions===\nAs explained above, the only direct action of a neurotransmitter is to activate a receptor. Therefore, the effects of a neurotransmitter system depend on the connections of the neurons that use the transmitter, and the chemical properties of the receptors that the transmitter binds to.\n\nHere are a few examples of important neurotransmitter actions:\n*[[Glutamate]] is used at the great majority of fast excitatory synapses in the brain and spinal cord. It is also used at most synapses that are \"modifiable\", i.e. capable of increasing or decreasing in strength. [[Synaptic plasticity|Modifiable synapses]] are thought to be the main memory-storage elements in the brain. Excessive glutamate release can overstimulate the brain and lead to [[excitotoxicity]] causing cell death resulting in seizures or strokes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1609133 | pmid=20076484 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040371 | volume=4 | issue=11 | title=\"Supporting\" players take the lead in protecting the overstimulated brain | author=Gross L | journal=PLOS Biol | pages=e371 | year=2006}}</ref> Excitotoxicity has been implicated in certain chronic diseases including [[ischemic stroke]], [[epilepsy]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington disease]], and [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=\"pmid21729715\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang JL, Sykora P, Wilson DM, Mattson MP, Bohr VA | title = The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate stimulates DNA repair to increase neuronal resiliency | journal = Mech.

It activates skeletal muscles in the somatic nervous system and may either excite or inhibit internal organs in the autonomic system.<ref name=\"Kolb Intro to Brain & Behavior\" /> It is distinguished as the transmitter at the [[neuromuscular junction]] connecting motor nerves to muscles. The paralytic arrow-poison [[curare]] acts by blocking transmission at these synapses.

For instance, drugs can decrease the rate of synthesis of neurotransmitters by affecting the synthetic enzyme(s) for that neurotransmitter. When neurotransmitter syntheses are blocked, the amount of neurotransmitters available for release becomes substantially lower, resulting in a decrease in neurotransmitter activity. Some drugs block or stimulate the release of specific neurotransmitters.  Alternatively, drugs can prevent neurotransmitter storage in synaptic vesicles by causing the synaptic vesicle membranes to leak. Drugs that prevent a neurotransmitter from binding to its receptor are called [[receptor antagonist]]s. For example, drugs used to treat patients with schizophrenia such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and clozapine are antagonists at receptors in the brain for dopamine. Other drugs act by binding to a receptor and mimicking the normal neurotransmitter. Such drugs are called receptor [[agonist]]s. An example of a receptor agonist is [[morphine]], an opiate that mimics effects of the endogenous neurotransmitter [[\u03b2-endorphin]] to relieve pain. Other drugs interfere with the deactivation of a neurotransmitter after it has been released, thereby prolonging the action of a neurotransmitter. This can be accomplished by blocking re-uptake or inhibiting degradative enzymes. Lastly, drugs can also prevent an action potential from occurring, blocking neuronal activity throughout the central and peripheral [[nervous system]]. Drugs such as tetrodotoxin that block neural activity are typically lethal.\n\nDrugs targeting the neurotransmitter of major systems affect the whole system, which can explain the complexity of action of some drugs. [[Cocaine]], for example, blocks the re-uptake of [[dopamine]] back into the [[presynaptic]] neuron, leaving the neurotransmitter molecules in the [[synapse|synaptic gap]] for an extended period of time. Since the dopamine remains in the synapse longer, the neurotransmitter continues to bind to the receptors on the [[postsynaptic]] neuron, eliciting a pleasurable emotional response. Physical addiction to cocaine may result from prolonged exposure to excess dopamine in the synapses, which leads to the [[downregulation]] of some post-synaptic receptors. After the effects of the drug wear off, an individual can become depressed due to decreased probability of the neurotransmitter binding to a receptor. [[Fluoxetine]] is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), which blocks re-uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic cell which increases the amount of serotonin present at the synapse and furthermore allows it to remain there longer, providing potential for the effect of naturally released serotonin.<ref name=\"InhibitingSerotoninSynthesis\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yadav VK, Ryu JH, Suda N, Tanaka KF, Gingrich JA, Sch\u00fctz G, Glorieux FH, Chiang CY, Zajac JD, Insogna KL, Mann JJ, Hen R, Ducy P, Karsenty G | title = Lrp5 controls bone formation by inhibiting serotonin synthesis in the duodenum | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 5 | pages = 825\u201337 |date=November 2008  | pmid = 19041748 | pmc = 2614332 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.059 | url = }}</ref> [[AMPT]] prevents the conversion of tyrosine to [[L-DOPA]], the precursor to dopamine; [[reserpine]] prevents dopamine storage within [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]]; and [[deprenyl]] inhibits [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Drug-Neurotransmitter Interactions<ref>Carlson, N.

This results in neurotransmitters being blocked from binding to the receptors. The most common is called Atropine.\n# Indirect-acting antagonist- drugs that inhibit the release/production of neurotransmitters (e.g., [[Reserpine]]).\n\n==== Drug antagonists ====\nAn antagonist drug is one that attaches (or binds) to a site called a receptor without activating that receptor to produce a biological response. It is therefore said to have no intrinsic activity. An antagonist may also be called a receptor \"blocker\" because they block the effect of an agonist at the site. The pharmacological effects of an antagonist, therefore, result in preventing the corresponding receptor site's agonists (e.g., drugs, hormones, neurotransmitters) from binding to and activating it. Antagonists may be \"competitive\" or \"irreversible\".\n\nA competitive antagonist competes with an agonist for binding to the receptor. As the concentration of antagonist increases, the binding of the agonist is progressively inhibited, resulting in a decrease in the physiological response. High concentration of an antagonist can completely inhibit the response. This inhibition can be reversed, however, by an increase of the concentration of the agonist, since the agonist and antagonist compete for binding to the receptor. Competitive antagonists, therefore, can be characterized as shifting the [[dose\u2013response relationship]] for the agonist to the right. In the presence of a competitive antagonist, it takes an increased concentration of the agonist to produce the same response observed in the absence of the antagonist.\n\nAn irreversible antagonist binds so strongly to the receptor as to render the receptor unavailable for binding to the agonist. Irreversible antagonists may even form covalent chemical bonds with the receptor. In either case, if the concentration of the irreversible antagonist is high enough, the number of unbound receptors remaining for agonist binding may be so low that even high concentrations of the agonist do not produce the maximum biological response.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia.com 2\">{{cite web |last1=Goeders |first1=Nick E. |title=Antagonist |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Antagonist.aspx |accessdate=2 December 2014 |location=Encyclopedia of Drugs, Alcohol, and Addictive Behavior |year=2001}}</ref><!-- try OCLC 883560927 instead, it's more current -->\n\n===Precursors===\n{{Phenylalanine biosynthesis|align=right}}\nWhile intake of neurotransmitter [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] does increase neurotransmitter synthesis, evidence is mixed as to whether [[neurotransmitter release]] and postsynaptic receptor firing is increased.

The following are disorders involved in either an increase, decrease, or imbalance of certain neurotransmitters.\n\n'''Dopamine''':\n\nFor example, problems in producing dopamine (mainly in the [[substantia nigra]]) can result in [[Parkinson's disease]], a disorder that affects a person's ability to move as they want to, resulting in stiffness, tremors or shaking, and other symptoms. Some studies suggest that having too little or too much dopamine or problems using dopamine in the thinking and feeling regions of the brain may play a role in disorders like [[schizophrenia]] or [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). Dopamine is also involved in addiction and drug use, as most recreational drugs cause an influx of dopamine in the brain (especially [[opioid]] and [[methamphetamine]]s) that produces a pleasurable feeling, which is why users constantly crave drugs.\n\n'''Serotonin''':\n\nSimilarly, after some research suggested that drugs that block the recycling, or reuptake, of serotonin seemed to help some people diagnosed with depression, it was theorized that people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] might have lower-than-normal serotonin levels. Though widely popularized, this theory was not borne out in subsequent research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Healy|first=David|date=21 April 2015|title=Serotonin and depression|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1771|journal=BMJ|volume=350|pages=h1771|doi=10.1136/bmj.h1771|issn=1756-1833|pmid=25900074}}</ref> Therefore, [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)]] are used to increase the amounts of serotonin in synapses.\n\n'''Glutamate''':\n\nFurthermore, problems with producing or using glutamate have been suggestively and tentatively linked to many mental disorders, including [[autism]], [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[schizophrenia]], and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=\"NIH Brain Basics\">{{cite web|title=NIMH Brain Basics |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml |publisher=[[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] |accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> Having too much glutamate has been linked to neurological diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[stroke]], and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bittigau|first=P.|last2=Ikonomidou|first2=C.|date=November 1997|title=Glutamate in neurologic diseases|journal=Journal of Child Neurology|volume=12|issue=8|pages=471\u2013485|doi=10.1177/088307389701200802|issn=0883-0738|pmid=9430311}}</ref>\n[[File:CAPON Binds Nitric Oxide Synthase, Regulating NMDA Receptor\u2013Mediated Glutamate Neurotransmission.png|thumb|CAPON Binds Nitric Oxide Synthase, Regulating NMDA Receptor\u2013Mediated Glutamate Neurotransmission]]\n\n==Neurotransmitter imbalance==\nGenerally, there are no scientifically established \"norms\" for appropriate levels or \"balances\" of different neurotransmitters.

These include Parkinson's, depression, insomnia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety, memory loss, dramatic changes in weight and addictions. Chronic physical or emotional stress can be a contributor to neurotransmitter system changes. Genetics also plays a role in neurotransmitter activities. Apart from recreational use, medications that directly and indirectly interact one or more transmitter or its receptor are commonly prescribed for psychiatric and psychological issues. Notably, drugs interacting with [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] are prescribed to patients with problems such as depression and anxiety\u2014though the notion that there is much solid medical evidence to support such interventions has been widely criticized.<ref>Leo, J., & Lacasse, J.

This allows new signals to be produced from the adjacent nerve cells. When the neurotransmitter has been secreted into the synaptic cleft, it binds to specific receptors on the postsynaptic cell, thereby generating a postsynaptic electrical signal. The transmitter must then be removed rapidly to enable the postsynaptic cell to engage in another cycle of neurotransmitter release, binding, and signal generation. Neurotransmitters are terminated in three different ways:\n# Diffusion \u2013 the neurotransmitter detaches from receptor, drifting out of the synaptic cleft, here it becomes absorbed by [[glial cells]].\n# Enzyme degradation \u2013 special chemicals called [[enzymes]] break it down. Usually, [[astrocyte]]s absorb the excess neurotransmitters and pass them on to enzymes or pump them directly into the presynaptic neuron.\n# Reuptake \u2013 re-absorption of a neurotransmitter into the neuron. Transporters, or [[membrane transport protein]]s, pump neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft back into [[axon terminal]]s (the presynaptic neuron) where they are stored.<ref>\"General, Organic and Biological Chemistry Structures of Life\" by Karen C. Timberlake p.661</ref>\n\nFor example, [[choline]] is taken up and recycled by the pre-synaptic neuron to synthesize more ACh. Other neurotransmitters such as [[dopamine]] are able to [[diffusion|diffuse]] away from their targeted synaptic junctions and are eliminated from the body via the kidneys, or destroyed in the liver. Each neurotransmitter has very specific degradation pathways at regulatory points, which may be targeted by the body's regulatory system or by [[recreational drug]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n*[[BK channel#Cellular level]]\n*[[Kiss-and-run fusion]]\n*[[Natural neuroactive substance]]\n*[[Neuroendocrine]]\n*[[Neuroendocrinology]]\n*[[Neuropsychopharmacology]]\n*[[Neurotransmitter release]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Neurotransmitter|Neurotransmitter}}\n{{Wikibooks|Neuroscience/Cellular Neurobiology/Neurotransmitters}}\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21521/ Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition.

A released neurotransmitter is typically available in the synaptic cleft for a short time before it is metabolized by enzymes, pulled back into the presynaptic neuron through [[reuptake]], or bound to a [[postsynaptic receptor]]. Nevertheless, short-term exposure of the receptor to a neurotransmitter is typically sufficient for causing a postsynaptic response by way of [[Neurotransmission|synaptic transmission]].\n\nGenerally, a neurotransmitter is released at the presynaptic terminal in response to a threshold [[action potential]] or [[Membrane potential#Graded potentials|graded electrical potential]] in the presynaptic neuron. However, low level 'baseline' release also occurs without electrical stimulation.\n\n==Discovery==\n{{see also|History of catecholamine research}}\nUntil the early 20th century, scientists assumed that the majority of synaptic communication in the brain was electrical. However, through [[Histology|histological]] examinations by [[Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]], a 20 to 40&nbsp;nm gap between neurons, known today as the [[synaptic cleft]], was discovered. The presence of such a gap suggested communication via chemical messengers traversing the synaptic cleft, and in 1921 German pharmacologist [[Otto Loewi]] confirmed that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals. Through a series of experiments involving the vagus nerves of frogs, Loewi was able to manually slow the heart rate of frogs by controlling the amount of saline solution present around the vagus nerve. Upon completion of this experiment, Loewi asserted that sympathetic regulation of cardiac function can be mediated through changes in chemical concentrations. Furthermore, Otto Loewi is credited with discovering [[acetylcholine]] (ACh)\u2014the first known neurotransmitter.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. ''Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function''. McGraw Hill. 2009 {{ISBN|0-07-727620-5}}</ref>\n\n==Identification==\nThere are four main criteria for identifying neurotransmitters:\n# The chemical must be synthesized in the neuron or otherwise be present in it. \n# When the neuron is active, the chemical must be released and produce a response in some targets. \n# The same response must be obtained when the chemical is experimentally placed on the target. \n# A mechanism must exist for removing the chemical from its site of activation after its work is done.\n\nHowever, given advances in pharmacology, genetics, and chemical [[neuroanatomy]], the term \"neurotransmitter\" can be applied to chemicals that:\n* Carry messages between neurons via influence on the postsynaptic membrane.\n* Have little or no effect on membrane voltage, but have a common carrying function such as changing the structure of the synapse. \n* Communicate by sending reverse-direction messages that affect the release or reuptake of transmitters.\n\nThe anatomical localization of neurotransmitters is typically determined using immunocytochemical techniques, which identify the location of either the transmitter substances themselves or of the enzymes that are involved in their synthesis. Immunocytochemical techniques have also revealed that many transmitters, particularly the [[neuropeptide]]s, are co-localized, that is, a neuron may release more than one transmitter from its synaptic terminal.<ref name=\"BioPsych Breedlove & Watson\">{{cite book|last1=University|first1=S.

Each neuron has as many as 15,000 connections with neighboring neurons.\n\nNeurons do not touch each other (except in the case of an electrical synapse through a gap junction); instead, neurons interact at contact points called synapses: a junction within two nerve cells, consisting of a miniature gap within which impulses are carried by a neurotransmitter. A neuron transports its information by way of a nerve impulse called an action potential. When an action potential arrives at the synapse's presynaptic terminal button, it may stimulate the release of neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft to bind onto the receptors of the postsynaptic membrane and influence another cell, either in an inhibitory or excitatory way. The next neuron may be connected to many more neurons, and if the total of excitatory influences minus inhibitory influences is great enough, it will also \"fire\". That is to say, it will create a new action potential at its axon hillock, releasing neurotransmitters and passing on the information to yet another neighboring neuron.\n\n=== Excitatory and inhibitory ===\n\nA neurotransmitter can influence the function of a neuron through a remarkable number of mechanisms.  In its direct actions in influencing a neuron's [[Membrane potential|electrical excitability]], however, a neurotransmitter acts in only one of two ways: excitatory or inhibitory. A neurotransmitter influences trans-membrane ion flow either to increase (excitatory) or to decrease (inhibitory) the probability that the cell with which it comes in contact will produce an action potential. Thus, despite the wide variety of synapses, they all convey messages of only these two types, and they are labeled as such. Type I synapses are [[excitatory]] in their actions, whereas type II synapses are [[inhibitory]]. Each type has a different appearance and is located on different parts of the neurons under its influence.\n\nType I (excitatory) synapses are typically located on the shafts or the spines of dendrites, whereas type II (inhibitory) synapses are typically located on a cell body. In addition, Type I synapses have round synaptic vesicles, whereas the vesicles of type II synapses are flattened. The material on the presynaptic and post-synaptic membranes is denser in a Type I synapse than it is in a type II, and the type I synaptic cleft is wider. Finally, the active zone on a Type I synapse is larger than that on a Type II synapse.\n\nThe different locations of type I and type II synapses divide a neuron into two zones: an excitatory dendritic tree and an inhibitory cell body. From an inhibitory perspective, excitation comes in over the dendrites and spreads to the [[axon hillock]] to trigger an [[action potential]]. If the message is to be stopped, it is best stopped by applying inhibition on the cell body, close to the axon hillock where the action potential originates. Another way to conceptualize excitatory\u2013inhibitory interaction is to picture excitation overcoming inhibition. If the cell body is normally in an inhibited state, the only way to generate an action potential at the axon hillock is to reduce the cell body's inhibition. In this \"open the gates\" strategy, the excitatory message is like a racehorse ready to run down the track, but first, the inhibitory starting gate must be removed.<ref name=\"Kolb Intro to Brain and Behavior\">{{cite book|last1=Whishaw|first1=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An introduction to brain and behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1429242288|edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n===Examples of important neurotransmitter actions===\nAs explained above, the only direct action of a neurotransmitter is to activate a receptor. Therefore, the effects of a neurotransmitter system depend on the connections of the neurons that use the transmitter, and the chemical properties of the receptors that the transmitter binds to.\n\nHere are a few examples of important neurotransmitter actions:\n*[[Glutamate]] is used at the great majority of fast excitatory synapses in the brain and spinal cord.

For instance, drugs can decrease the rate of synthesis of neurotransmitters by affecting the synthetic enzyme(s) for that neurotransmitter. When neurotransmitter syntheses are blocked, the amount of neurotransmitters available for release becomes substantially lower, resulting in a decrease in neurotransmitter activity. Some drugs block or stimulate the release of specific neurotransmitters.  Alternatively, drugs can prevent neurotransmitter storage in synaptic vesicles by causing the synaptic vesicle membranes to leak. Drugs that prevent a neurotransmitter from binding to its receptor are called [[receptor antagonist]]s. For example, drugs used to treat patients with schizophrenia such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and clozapine are antagonists at receptors in the brain for dopamine. Other drugs act by binding to a receptor and mimicking the normal neurotransmitter. Such drugs are called receptor [[agonist]]s. An example of a receptor agonist is [[morphine]], an opiate that mimics effects of the endogenous neurotransmitter [[\u03b2-endorphin]] to relieve pain. Other drugs interfere with the deactivation of a neurotransmitter after it has been released, thereby prolonging the action of a neurotransmitter. This can be accomplished by blocking re-uptake or inhibiting degradative enzymes. Lastly, drugs can also prevent an action potential from occurring, blocking neuronal activity throughout the central and peripheral [[nervous system]]. Drugs such as tetrodotoxin that block neural activity are typically lethal.\n\nDrugs targeting the neurotransmitter of major systems affect the whole system, which can explain the complexity of action of some drugs. [[Cocaine]], for example, blocks the re-uptake of [[dopamine]] back into the [[presynaptic]] neuron, leaving the neurotransmitter molecules in the [[synapse|synaptic gap]] for an extended period of time. Since the dopamine remains in the synapse longer, the neurotransmitter continues to bind to the receptors on the [[postsynaptic]] neuron, eliciting a pleasurable emotional response. Physical addiction to cocaine may result from prolonged exposure to excess dopamine in the synapses, which leads to the [[downregulation]] of some post-synaptic receptors. After the effects of the drug wear off, an individual can become depressed due to decreased probability of the neurotransmitter binding to a receptor. [[Fluoxetine]] is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), which blocks re-uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic cell which increases the amount of serotonin present at the synapse and furthermore allows it to remain there longer, providing potential for the effect of naturally released serotonin.<ref name=\"InhibitingSerotoninSynthesis\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yadav VK, Ryu JH, Suda N, Tanaka KF, Gingrich JA, Sch\u00fctz G, Glorieux FH, Chiang CY, Zajac JD, Insogna KL, Mann JJ, Hen R, Ducy P, Karsenty G | title = Lrp5 controls bone formation by inhibiting serotonin synthesis in the duodenum | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 5 | pages = 825\u201337 |date=November 2008  | pmid = 19041748 | pmc = 2614332 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.059 | url = }}</ref> [[AMPT]] prevents the conversion of tyrosine to [[L-DOPA]], the precursor to dopamine; [[reserpine]] prevents dopamine storage within [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]]; and [[deprenyl]] inhibits [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Drug-Neurotransmitter Interactions<ref>Carlson, N.

This results in neurotransmitters being blocked from binding to the receptors. The most common is called Atropine.\n# Indirect-acting antagonist- drugs that inhibit the release/production of neurotransmitters (e.g., [[Reserpine]]).\n\n==== Drug antagonists ====\nAn antagonist drug is one that attaches (or binds) to a site called a receptor without activating that receptor to produce a biological response. It is therefore said to have no intrinsic activity. An antagonist may also be called a receptor \"blocker\" because they block the effect of an agonist at the site. The pharmacological effects of an antagonist, therefore, result in preventing the corresponding receptor site's agonists (e.g., drugs, hormones, neurotransmitters) from binding to and activating it. Antagonists may be \"competitive\" or \"irreversible\".\n\nA competitive antagonist competes with an agonist for binding to the receptor. As the concentration of antagonist increases, the binding of the agonist is progressively inhibited, resulting in a decrease in the physiological response. High concentration of an antagonist can completely inhibit the response. This inhibition can be reversed, however, by an increase of the concentration of the agonist, since the agonist and antagonist compete for binding to the receptor. Competitive antagonists, therefore, can be characterized as shifting the [[dose\u2013response relationship]] for the agonist to the right. In the presence of a competitive antagonist, it takes an increased concentration of the agonist to produce the same response observed in the absence of the antagonist.\n\nAn irreversible antagonist binds so strongly to the receptor as to render the receptor unavailable for binding to the agonist. Irreversible antagonists may even form covalent chemical bonds with the receptor. In either case, if the concentration of the irreversible antagonist is high enough, the number of unbound receptors remaining for agonist binding may be so low that even high concentrations of the agonist do not produce the maximum biological response.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia.com 2\">{{cite web |last1=Goeders |first1=Nick E. |title=Antagonist |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Antagonist.aspx |accessdate=2 December 2014 |location=Encyclopedia of Drugs, Alcohol, and Addictive Behavior |year=2001}}</ref><!-- try OCLC 883560927 instead, it's more current -->\n\n===Precursors===\n{{Phenylalanine biosynthesis|align=right}}\nWhile intake of neurotransmitter [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] does increase neurotransmitter synthesis, evidence is mixed as to whether [[neurotransmitter release]] and postsynaptic receptor firing is increased.

The following are disorders involved in either an increase, decrease, or imbalance of certain neurotransmitters.\n\n'''Dopamine''':\n\nFor example, problems in producing dopamine (mainly in the [[substantia nigra]]) can result in [[Parkinson's disease]], a disorder that affects a person's ability to move as they want to, resulting in stiffness, tremors or shaking, and other symptoms. Some studies suggest that having too little or too much dopamine or problems using dopamine in the thinking and feeling regions of the brain may play a role in disorders like [[schizophrenia]] or [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). Dopamine is also involved in addiction and drug use, as most recreational drugs cause an influx of dopamine in the brain (especially [[opioid]] and [[methamphetamine]]s) that produces a pleasurable feeling, which is why users constantly crave drugs.\n\n'''Serotonin''':\n\nSimilarly, after some research suggested that drugs that block the recycling, or reuptake, of serotonin seemed to help some people diagnosed with depression, it was theorized that people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] might have lower-than-normal serotonin levels. Though widely popularized, this theory was not borne out in subsequent research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Healy|first=David|date=21 April 2015|title=Serotonin and depression|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1771|journal=BMJ|volume=350|pages=h1771|doi=10.1136/bmj.h1771|issn=1756-1833|pmid=25900074}}</ref> Therefore, [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)]] are used to increase the amounts of serotonin in synapses.\n\n'''Glutamate''':\n\nFurthermore, problems with producing or using glutamate have been suggestively and tentatively linked to many mental disorders, including [[autism]], [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[schizophrenia]], and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=\"NIH Brain Basics\">{{cite web|title=NIMH Brain Basics |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml |publisher=[[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] |accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> Having too much glutamate has been linked to neurological diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[stroke]], and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bittigau|first=P.|last2=Ikonomidou|first2=C.|date=November 1997|title=Glutamate in neurologic diseases|journal=Journal of Child Neurology|volume=12|issue=8|pages=471\u2013485|doi=10.1177/088307389701200802|issn=0883-0738|pmid=9430311}}</ref>\n[[File:CAPON Binds Nitric Oxide Synthase, Regulating NMDA Receptor\u2013Mediated Glutamate Neurotransmission.png|thumb|CAPON Binds Nitric Oxide Synthase, Regulating NMDA Receptor\u2013Mediated Glutamate Neurotransmission]]\n\n==Neurotransmitter imbalance==\nGenerally, there are no scientifically established \"norms\" for appropriate levels or \"balances\" of different neurotransmitters.

When the neurotransmitter has been secreted into the synaptic cleft, it binds to specific receptors on the postsynaptic cell, thereby generating a postsynaptic electrical signal. The transmitter must then be removed rapidly to enable the postsynaptic cell to engage in another cycle of neurotransmitter release, binding, and signal generation. Neurotransmitters are terminated in three different ways:\n# Diffusion \u2013 the neurotransmitter detaches from receptor, drifting out of the synaptic cleft, here it becomes absorbed by [[glial cells]].\n# Enzyme degradation \u2013 special chemicals called [[enzymes]] break it down. Usually, [[astrocyte]]s absorb the excess neurotransmitters and pass them on to enzymes or pump them directly into the presynaptic neuron.\n# Reuptake \u2013 re-absorption of a neurotransmitter into the neuron. Transporters, or [[membrane transport protein]]s, pump neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft back into [[axon terminal]]s (the presynaptic neuron) where they are stored.<ref>\"General, Organic and Biological Chemistry Structures of Life\" by Karen C. Timberlake p.661</ref>\n\nFor example, [[choline]] is taken up and recycled by the pre-synaptic neuron to synthesize more ACh. Other neurotransmitters such as [[dopamine]] are able to [[diffusion|diffuse]] away from their targeted synaptic junctions and are eliminated from the body via the kidneys, or destroyed in the liver. Each neurotransmitter has very specific degradation pathways at regulatory points, which may be targeted by the body's regulatory system or by [[recreational drug]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n*[[BK channel#Cellular level]]\n*[[Kiss-and-run fusion]]\n*[[Natural neuroactive substance]]\n*[[Neuroendocrine]]\n*[[Neuroendocrinology]]\n*[[Neuropsychopharmacology]]\n*[[Neurotransmitter release]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Neurotransmitter|Neurotransmitter}}\n{{Wikibooks|Neuroscience/Cellular Neurobiology/Neurotransmitters}}\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21521/ Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition.

The city rests on a small [[karst]] plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including [[Mount Lov\u0107en]], the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography.\n\nCetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a center of Montenegrin life and both a cradle of [[Culture of Montenegro|Montenegrin culture]] and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious center. Its status as the honorary capital of Montenegro is due to its heritage as a long-serving former capital of Montenegro.\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], the town is known as  \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435 / ''Cetinje'' (archaically \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0463 / ''Cetin\u011b''); in [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''Cettigne''; in [[Greek language|Greek]] as \u039a\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7 (''Ket\u00edgni''); in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''\u00c7etince''; and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''Cetina''.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Founding===\nCetinje was founded in 1482, when [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] moved his capital from Obod above the [[Crnojevi\u0107 River]] to deeper into the hills to a more easily defended location in a field at the foot of [[Mount Lov\u0107en]]. He had his court built at the new location that year and also founded [[Old Cetinje Monastery|a monastery]] (dedicated to the Mother of Christ) as a personal endowment in 1484. His court and the monastery are the first recorded [[renaissance]] buildings in Montenegro.<ref name=\"DomljanKrle\u017ea.\">{{cite book|author1=\u017darko Domljan|author2=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea.\"|author3=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea\".|title=Likovna enciklopedija Jugoslavije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYufAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1984|publisher=Zavod|page=245|quote=Ivan Crnojevi\u0107 podigao dvorac, kasnije i crkvu zetske mitropolije... to su prvi datirani spomenici renesanse u Crnoj Gori}}</ref> Crnojevi\u0107 was forced to move the seat of the Eparchy of Zeta from [[Vranjina]] to Cetinje due to the Ottoman invasions, in 1485.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49>{{cite book|title=Glasnik Srpskog istorijsko-kulturnog dru\u0161tva \"Njego\u0161\"|volume=61\u201362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNjlAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Njego\u0161|page=49|quote=\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0432\u043e \u0412\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0408\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0443. \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 1485. \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u045b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0443\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435.}}</ref> The town was named after the Cetina river.\n\nThe bishopric of Zeta was elevated to a metropolitanate in Cetinje.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> It was later to play an important part in both the religious and national life.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> The [[Crnojevi\u0107 printing house]], the first printing house in southeastern Europe, was active between 1493 and 1496 in Cetinje.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frederick Bernard Singleton|title=A short history of the Yugoslav peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC&pg=PA30|accessdate=24 July 2011|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27485-2|pages=30\u2013}}</ref> Zeta was first put under Ottoman rule in 1499, then annexed by the Ottomans in 1514, organized into the [[Sanjak of Montenegro]].<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0106orovi\u0107|first=Vladimir|title=Istorija Jugoslavije|authorlink=Vladimir \u0106orovi\u0107|year=1933|publisher=Narodno Delo|location=Beograd|url=http://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_(%D0%92._%D0%8B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B)_3.11|accessdate=27 April 2011|language=Serbian|quote=\u0413\u043e\u0434. 1499. \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443. \u0410\u043b\u0438, \u0433\u043e\u0434. 1514. \u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043e \u0458\u043e\u0458 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0443, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0421\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430.}}</ref>\n\n===Early modern period===\n\nIn the next two centuries, the development of Cetinje stagnated. It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events.

The city rests on a small [[karst]] plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including [[Mount Lov\u0107en]], the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography.\n\nCetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a center of Montenegrin life and both a cradle of [[Culture of Montenegro|Montenegrin culture]] and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious center.

It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events. So the second half of the nineteenth century in the development of Cetinje marked period of state power and its pursuit of the European culture and international recognition. Recognition of Montenegro as an independent state, at the Berlin Congress in 1878., on the basis of which greatly expanded, he began a period of rapid creation of a national, economic, social, cultural, societal and spatial superstructure which caused increasing of economic power and the reorganization and improvement of the state apparatus and the authorities.

McGillivray was a contemporary of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. She encouraged the influential Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].\n\nIn the 1920s, McGillivray`s career exploded. Her art mainly was influenced by the Post-Impressionist and Fauvist movements. McGillivray lived in Whitby, Ottawa and Toronto but travelled often to pursue her work. She visited Europe, Alaska, Jamaica and Trinidad. Exhibition locations include Toronto Malloney's, Continental Galleries, Montreal, and her own studio in her hometown.\n\nThe National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre and galleries in Oshawa, Whitby, Kitchener, London, and Windsor all hold her work in their collections.

To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]].

But her real inspiration was the artist Frederic Fiebig<ref> Allen, pages 74-75</ref> and due to him, she began to work in a style new to her that involved using the palette knife and a heavier application of paint. Her works of art in this mode were acknowledged and she was invited to display her paintings at the Salon des Beaux Arts.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> Not long later, it is said, the artist was voted as president of the International Union.<ref name=\":2\" />  In the later years of McGillivray's life she joined the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (1917), she was elected an Associate member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]](1924),<ref name=\":1\" /> and was a Charter member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolour and its first woman member (1925). <ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\" />\n\n== Influence and Style ==\n[[File:St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H.

Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

McGillivray was a contemporary of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. She encouraged the influential Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].\n\nIn the 1920s, McGillivray`s career exploded. Her art mainly was influenced by the Post-Impressionist and Fauvist movements. McGillivray lived in Whitby, Ottawa and Toronto but travelled often to pursue her work. She visited Europe, Alaska, Jamaica and Trinidad. Exhibition locations include Toronto Malloney's, Continental Galleries, Montreal, and her own studio in her hometown.\n\nThe National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre and galleries in Oshawa, Whitby, Kitchener, London, and Windsor all hold her work in their collections.

To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]].

In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

PRA was among the top five debt buyers in the FTC Report.

They started with four people out of a small office in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. The company's debt purchasing activities began a few months after the company was formed, in May 1996.<ref name=\"snider2001\" />\n\nIn 2000, the company reported that it had purchased {{currency|1 billion}} of debt during the year, ranking (tying) in 10th place among top debt buyers.<ref name=\"ccr2002\" />  By 2010, the company was noted as \"the sixth-largest debt buyer in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"cardline2010\" />\n\nPRA Group's [[initial public offering]] was in 2002 and was [[Underwriting#Bank Underwriting|backed]] by [[William Blair & Company]] and [[Piper Jaffray]].<ref name=\"gill-and-cutler\" /><ref name=\"shean2002\" /><ref name=\"damodaran2004\" />  The company is listed on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange and traded under the symbol <tt>PRAA</tt>.<ref name=\"nasdaqpraa\" />\n\nPRA's SEC filings for 2015 state that PRA has large international operations, due to its acquisitions of Aktiv Kapital, a Norway-based debt buyer and lender in Europe and Canada.\n\n===Company name===\nThe name of the company when formed was '''Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC'''.<ref name=\"Xsp_abouttimeline\" />  On an unknown date, the company's name changed to '''Portfolio Recovery Associates, Inc.'''{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  Then in October 2014, the name changed to '''PRA Group, Inc.'''<ref name=\"10q2014III\" />  The PRA Group name and the design of its corporate logo were trademarked in 2014.<ref name=\"pratrdmk\" />\n\n===Litigation===\nIn 2014, the [[New York Attorney General|Attorney General of New York]] obtained a settlement against PRA Group \"for repeatedly bringing improper debt collection actions against New York consumers.\"<ref name=\"attgennypr2014\" />  The case involved \"uncontested default judgments\" levied against defendants who failed to respond to suits brought by PRA against them.<ref name=\"attgennypr2014\" />  The settlement required abandonment of claims against debtors (amounting to millions of dollars), changes in collection practices, and a civil fine of {{currency|300,000}}.<ref name=\"attgennypr2014\" />  In September, 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -the regulator of the debt buying industry, made public a Consent Order against PRA, which was detailed in PRA's 2015 Annual Report to the SEC.  As part of the Consent Order, PRA received a substantial fine and penalty, and must make restitution to some of its customer due to a variety of questionable debt collection practices.\n\n===Adverse Regulatory Actions ===\n\nIn September 2015, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Portfolio Recovery to pay $19 million in consumer refunds and an $8 million penalty, and stop collecting on over $3 million worth of debts. Portfolio is also barred from reselling debts to third parties in the future.\n\nThe CFPB found that Portfolio Recovery Associates threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts they should have known were inaccurate or had other problems, stated incorrect balances, interest rates, and payment due dates in attempting to collect debts from consumers.  Failed to provide documention on debts.  Filed court cases they knew they had no documentation for in hopes a consumer would default on their court date giving portfolio a default judgement.  Portfolio filed cases on debts that they knew were outside the statute of limitations.  Threatened that they were going to sue when an attorney had not even reviewed the case and made misrepresentations among other things.<ref>http://blog.credit.com/2015/09/2-of-americas-largest-debt-collectors-will-refund-60-million-to-consumers-125132/ 2 of America\u2019s Largest Debt Collectors Will Refund $60 Million to Consumers</ref>\n\nPRA's SEC filings for the calendar year 2015, page 92 and elsewhere, detail that the Internal Revenue Service conducted an audit of PRA of tax years 2005 to 2012.  The IRS is currently in litigation with PRA, and there is a tax claim of at least $197 million against PRA that is now pending in U.S Tax Court.  This matter is now set for trial in September 2016.\n\n==Business model==\nPRA's business model is based on purchasing pools of consumer debt from banks and other creditors, at a discount to the full amount owed.
