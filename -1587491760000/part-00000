Development of the area did not begin until 1844, when [[William Austin Burt|William Burt]] and [[Jacob Houghton]] (the brother of geologist [[Douglass Houghton]]) discovered iron deposits near Teal Lake west of Marquette. In 1845, Jackson Mining Company, the first organized mining company in the region, was formed.<ref name=eckert>{{cite book |last = Eckert |first = Kathryn Bishop |year = 2000 |title = The Sandstone Architecture of the Lake Superior Region |pages = 89\u201391 |location = Detroit |publisher = Wayne State University Press |isbn = 0-8143-2807-5 }}</ref>\n\nThe village of Marquette began on September 14, 1849, with the formation of a second iron concern, the Marquette Iron Company. Three men participated in organizing the firm: Robert J. Graveraet, who had prospected the region for ore; Edward Clark, agent for Waterman A. Fisher of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who financed the company, and Amos Rogers Harlow. The village was at first called New Worcester, with Harlow as the first postmaster. On August 21, 1850, the name was changed to honor [[Jacques Marquette]], the French Jesuit missionary who had explored the region. A second post office, named Carp River, was opened on October 13, 1851 by [[Peter White (Michigan)|Peter White]], who had gone there with Graveraet at age 18.<ref>{{cite journal |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ylLF0TN50sUC |title = [not listed] |journal = Inland Seas |year = 1968 |via = [[Google Books]] }}{{full citation needed|date= March 2015}}</ref> Harlow closed his post office in August 1852. The Marquette Iron Company failed, while its successor, the [[Cleveland Iron Mining Company]], flourished and had the village [[plat]]ted in 1854. The plat was recorded by Peter White.

[[Presque Isle Park]] is Marquette's most popular park located on the north side of the city. It includes {{convert|323|acre|ha}} of mostly forested land and juts out into Lake Superior. The park was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], noted for designing [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. Amenities include a wooden band shell for concerts, a park pavilion, a gazebo, a marina, a concession stand, picnic tables, barbecue pits, walking/skiing trails, playground facilities, and Moosewood Nature Center. The city has two popular [[beaches]], South Beach Park and McCarty's Cove. McCarty's Cove, flanked by the red U.S. Coast Guard Station lighthouse on its south shore, serves as a reprieve from hot summer days, where city and county residents alike take advantage of the cool, but tolerable, water temperatures and the cooling effects of the lake-generated [[sea breeze]]. Both beaches have picnic areas, grills, children's playgrounds and lifeguard stands. Other parks include Tourist Park, Founder's Landing, LaBonte Park, Mattson Lower Harbor Park, Park Cemetery, Shiras Park, Williams Park, Harlow Park, Pocket Park, Spring Street Park and Father Marquette Park.\n\n[[File:2009-0618-Marquette-SuperiorDome.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Superior Dome]]]]\n\nThere are also numerous other recreational facilities located within the city. [[Lakeview Arena]] is best known for its use as an ice hockey facility, but it also hosts a number of public events. A skateboard park is located just outside the arena and open during the summer. Lakeview Arena was home to the [[Marquette Electricians]] and Marquette Senior High School's Redmen hockey team. In 1974, the arena replaced the historic [[Palestra (Michigan)|Palestra]], which had been located a few blocks away. Gerard Haley Memorial Baseball field home of the Marquette Blues and Reds is located in the north side along with numerous little league and softball fields. Marquette has [[List of largest domes#Wood|the largest wooden dome in the world]], the [[Superior Dome]]\u2014unofficially but affectionately known as the YooperDome. During the football season, the Dome is used primarily for football on its newly renovated astro turf field. The turf was installed in July 2009. Northern Michigan University holds its home football games in the Dome, as does the Michigan High School Athletic Association with the upper peninsula's High School football playoffs. The dome also hosts numerous private and public events that draw in thousands from around the region. The Marquette Golf Club has brought international recognition to the area for its unique and dramatic Greywalls course, opened in 2005. The course features several panoramic views of Lake Superior and winds its way through rocky outcroppings, heaving fairways and a rolling valley, yet is located less than two miles (3&nbsp;km) from the downtown area.\n\nThe city is also known for fishing for deep water lake trout, whitefish, salmon and brown trout.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fishing|url=http://www.travelmarquettemichigan.com/category/recreation/fishing/|website=Travel Marquette|publisher=Travel Marquette|accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nMarquette has an extensive network of biking and walking paths.

Development of the area did not begin until 1844, when [[William Austin Burt|William Burt]] and [[Jacob Houghton]] (the brother of geologist [[Douglass Houghton]]) discovered iron deposits near Teal Lake west of Marquette. In 1845, Jackson Mining Company, the first organized mining company in the region, was formed.<ref name=eckert>{{cite book |last = Eckert |first = Kathryn Bishop |year = 2000 |title = The Sandstone Architecture of the Lake Superior Region |pages = 89\u201391 |location = Detroit |publisher = Wayne State University Press |isbn = 0-8143-2807-5 }}</ref>\n\nThe village of Marquette began on September 14, 1849, with the formation of a second iron concern, the Marquette Iron Company. Three men participated in organizing the firm: Robert J. Graveraet, who had prospected the region for ore; Edward Clark, agent for Waterman A. Fisher of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who financed the company, and Amos Rogers Harlow. The village was at first called New Worcester, with Harlow as the first postmaster. On August 21, 1850, the name was changed to honor [[Jacques Marquette]], the French Jesuit missionary who had explored the region. A second post office, named Carp River, was opened on October 13, 1851 by [[Peter White (Michigan)|Peter White]], who had gone there with Graveraet at age 18.<ref>{{cite journal |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ylLF0TN50sUC |title = [not listed] |journal = Inland Seas |year = 1968 |via = [[Google Books]] }}{{full citation needed|date= March 2015}}</ref> Harlow closed his post office in August 1852. The Marquette Iron Company failed, while its successor, the [[Cleveland Iron Mining Company]], flourished and had the village [[plat]]ted in 1854. The plat was recorded by Peter White.

[[Presque Isle Park]] is Marquette's most popular park located on the north side of the city. It includes {{convert|323|acre|ha}} of mostly forested land and juts out into Lake Superior. The park was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], noted for designing [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. Amenities include a wooden band shell for concerts, a park pavilion, a gazebo, a marina, a concession stand, picnic tables, barbecue pits, walking/skiing trails, playground facilities, and Moosewood Nature Center. The city has two popular [[beaches]], South Beach Park and McCarty's Cove. McCarty's Cove, flanked by the red U.S. Coast Guard Station lighthouse on its south shore, serves as a reprieve from hot summer days, where city and county residents alike take advantage of the cool, but tolerable, water temperatures and the cooling effects of the lake-generated [[sea breeze]]. Both beaches have picnic areas, grills, children's playgrounds and lifeguard stands. Other parks include Tourist Park, Founder's Landing, LaBonte Park, Mattson Lower Harbor Park, Park Cemetery, Shiras Park, Williams Park, Harlow Park, Pocket Park, Spring Street Park and Father Marquette Park.\n\n[[File:2009-0618-Marquette-SuperiorDome.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Superior Dome]]]]\n\nThere are also numerous other recreational facilities located within the city. [[Lakeview Arena]] is best known for its use as an ice hockey facility, but it also hosts a number of public events. A skateboard park is located just outside the arena and open during the summer. Lakeview Arena was home to the [[Marquette Electricians]] and Marquette Senior High School's Redmen hockey team. In 1974, the arena replaced the historic [[Palestra (Michigan)|Palestra]], which had been located a few blocks away. Gerard Haley Memorial Baseball field home of the Marquette Blues and Reds is located in the north side along with numerous little league and softball fields. Marquette has [[List of largest domes#Wood|the largest wooden dome in the world]], the [[Superior Dome]]\u2014unofficially but affectionately known as the YooperDome. During the football season, the Dome is used primarily for football on its newly renovated astro turf field. The turf was installed in July 2009. Northern Michigan University holds its home football games in the Dome, as does the Michigan High School Athletic Association with the upper peninsula's High School football playoffs. The dome also hosts numerous private and public events that draw in thousands from around the region. The Marquette Golf Club has brought international recognition to the area for its unique and dramatic Greywalls course, opened in 2005. The course features several panoramic views of Lake Superior and winds its way through rocky outcroppings, heaving fairways and a rolling valley, yet is located less than two miles (3&nbsp;km) from the downtown area.\n\nThe city is also known for fishing for deep water lake trout, whitefish, salmon and brown trout.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fishing|url=http://www.travelmarquettemichigan.com/category/recreation/fishing/|website=Travel Marquette|publisher=Travel Marquette|accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nMarquette has an extensive network of biking and walking paths.

On July 9, 1993, the contract for the project's design was awarded for $2,993,948. As part of the contract, the consultant investigated whether it was feasible to reconfigure the IRT passageway, to reframe the exit structure on the Lexington Avenue platforms to accommodate the relocation and widening of stairs, the construction of a new fan room, the removal of stairs on the Broadway Line platforms, the reframing of the existing structure, and the construction of a new staircase between the intermediate and IRT mezzanines. These were all deemed feasible, and in May 1994, a supplemental agreement worth $984,998 was reached to allow the consultant to prepare the design for this work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda May 1994|date=May 16, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit}}</ref>{{Rp|C-57}}\n\n==Station layout==\n{{NYCS Platform Layout 14th Street-Union Square Station}}\n\n===Exits===\n*[[File:SubwaySigns.jpg|thumb|Station entrance sign|alt=]]Two stairs inside Union Square Park on east side of Union Square West at 16th Street<ref name=maps>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Union Square / Gramercy|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M07_UnionSq-Gramercy_2015.pdf|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 6, 2015|date=2015}}</ref>\n* One stair at southeast corner of Union Square East and 15th Street<ref name=maps/>\n* One stair inside Union Square Park on north side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East<ref name=maps/>\n* One stair inside Union Square Park on north side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East<ref name=maps/>\n* One stair on south side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East<ref name=maps/>\n* Two stairs at southwest corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street<ref name=maps/>\n* Two stairs at southeast corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street<ref name=maps/>\n* {{access icon}} One stair, escalator bank, and elevator at northeast corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street<ref name=maps/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms ==\n\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = 14 Street\u2013Union Square\n| image = 14 Street-Union Square IRT 003.JPG\n| image_caption = Downtown platform for the local services (left) and express services (right), showing the curvature of the station and the movable platforms\n| bg_color = #007527\n| division = IRT\n| line = [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]]\n| service = Lexington\n| platforms = 2 [[island platform]]s (in service)<br>[[cross-platform interchange]]<br>2 [[side platform]]s (abandoned)\n| tracks = 4\n| cross_platform = yes\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1904|October|27|p=y}}<ref name=145th>{{Cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/10/28/118948832.html|title=Our Subway Open: 150,000 Try It; Mayor McClellan Runs the First Official Train.|date=October 28, 1904|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 21, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|page=1}}</ref>\n| code = 406\n| wifi = yes\n| accessible = mezzanine\n| next_north = {{NYCS next | type=express | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=Grand Central\u201342nd Street | service=Lexington express}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=local | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=23rd Street | service=Lexington local}}<br>{{NYCS next | station=18th Street | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | type=local; closed | service=none | type2=no service}}\n| next_south = {{NYCS next | type=local | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=Astor Place | service=Lexington local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall | service=Lexington express}}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|allexceptnights}}{{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|rushpeak}}\n}}\n{{Stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|Lexington}}\n|style=margin-left:10px;margin-top:10px;float:right;\n|legend =track\n|map=\nuvSTR!~MFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|42 St]]\nudSTR!~dMFADEg\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[23rd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|23 St]]\nuvSTRf\\uvSTRg\nd\\uv-SHI2r\\uvSTR\\udSTR\\numN330\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\uvSTR-\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\uvSHI2l-\nexdBSl\\udSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\\exdBSr\nexdBSl\\udSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\\exdBSr\nuvSHI2l-\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\uv-SHI2gr\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\uv\u00dcST\nuv-STR\\ubvvvSTR\nuv-STR\\ubvvvSTR\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\uvSHI2g+l-\nuvSTRf\\uvSTRg\nudSTR!~dMFADEf\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Astor Place (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Astor Pl]]\nuvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Br]]\n}}\n}}\n\n'''14th Street\u2013Union Square''', opened on October 27, 1904, is an express station on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] that has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s. The uptown and downtown platforms are offset from each other and slightly curved. [[Gap filler|Gap-filling]] movable platforms on the downtown side are automatically operated via proximity sensors when trains arrive. The station's mezzanines are located over the platforms.\n\nThe station has two abandoned local [[side platform]]s; the northbound one is visible through windows, bordered with wide, bright red frames (This is part of a larger, station-wide art installation entitled ''Framing Union Square''). From the north end of the downtown platform's mezzanine, the adjacent side platform can be seen through a hole in the plywood.\n\n===1991 accident===\n{{Main|1991 Union Square derailment}}\nOn August 28, 1991, an accident just north of the station killed five riders and injured 215 others in one of the worst wrecks since a [[1928 Times Square derailment|crash]] at [[Times Square\u201342nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square\u201342nd Street]] on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] in 1928 that killed 16 people. The train operator, Robert Ray, was intoxicated and had been overshooting platforms during the entire run from [[Woodlawn (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|Woodlawn]] in [[the Bronx]]. Just north of this station, his [[Crown Heights - Utica Avenue (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Utica Avenue]]-bound '''{{NYCS|4}}''' train was to be shifted to the local track due to repair work on the express one. He was running at 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) at a 10&nbsp;mph (16&nbsp;km/h) zone and took the switch so fast that only the first car made it through the crossover. The rest of the train was involved in a derailment that led to a massive pile-up. Cars 1435, 1436, 1437, 1439, and 1440 were essentially scrapped on the site, and the IRT Lexington Line suffered heavy structural damage as a result. Service was disrupted for six days (with trains terminating at [[59th Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|59th Street]] for the duration) as transit workers cleaned up the wreckage. The entire infrastructure, including signals, switches, track, roadbed, cabling, and 23 support columns needed to be replaced. Ray was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison, but released in April 2002 for good behavior.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nysubway.com/safety/subwaysafety.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316215653/http://www.nysubway.com/safety/subwaysafety.html |archive-date=2018-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>44:10-50:10 in this video do a small documentary on the accident: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KKVupF7Uug</ref>\n\nThe wreck occurred at the entry to a former pocket track. Like [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], this station was built with extra tracks on the approach to the station. These were between the local and express tracks and approximately {{convert|300|ft|m}} long. The idea was to have a \"stacking\" track where a train could be held momentarily until the platform cleared for it to enter the station. The tracks here and at 72nd Street were rendered useless when train lengths grew beyond these tracks' capacity. When the damage from the 1991 wreck was repaired, the stacking track was removed. A similar track still exists between the northbound tracks south of the platforms.\n\n===Image gallery===\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Union Square subway 001.JPG|Old IRT \"14\" eagle cartouche\nFile:NYCS IRT LexAve 14St.jpg|Abandoned side platform behind the wall and the black bars on the right, whose edge is still visible\nFile:Spring Street Mosaic.jpg|Depiction of the platform in a mosaic at the entrance to [[Spring Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Spring Street (8th Avenue) station]]\nFile:IRT North end Union Sq plat jeh.jpg|Platforms are not aligned; southbound one (background) is farther north\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== BMT Broadway Line platforms ==\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = 14 Street\u2013Union Square\n| image = 14th Street-Union Square - Broadway Line Platform.jpg\n| image_caption = {{rint|newyork|R}} train of [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]] cars departing on the local track\n| bg_color = #FFC800\n| font_color = black\n| font_color_2 = black\n| division = BMT\n| line = [[BMT Broadway Line]]\n| service = Broadway\n| platforms = 2 [[island platform]]s<br>[[cross-platform interchange]]\n| tracks = 4\n| accessible = yes\n| acc_note = Transfer to [[#IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms|IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms]] not accessible\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1917|September|4|p=y}}<ref>''The New York Times'', [https://www.nytimes.com/1917/09/05/archives/open-first-section-of-broadway-line-train-carrying-1000-passengers.html Open First Section of Broadway Line], September 5, 1917</ref><ref name=42nd>''The New York Times'', [http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/nytimes-1918-broadway.html Open New Subway to Times Square], January 6, 1918</ref>\n| code = 015\n| wifi = yes\n| next_north = {{NYCS next | type= express | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=34th Street\u2013Herald Square | service=Broadway express}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=local | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=23rd Street | service=Broadway local}}\n| next_south = {{NYCS next | type=local | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=Eighth Street\u2013New York University | service=Broadway local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express | line=BMT Broadway Line via Bridge | station=Canal Street | service=Broadway express}}\n| next_north_acc = {{NYCS next | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=34th Street\u2013Herald Square | service=Broadway}}\n| next_south_acc = {{NYCS next | type=via tunnel | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=Cortlandt Street | service= Broadway south}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=via bridge | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=DeKalb Avenue | service=Manhattan Bridge south DeKalb}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=via bridge bypass | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center | service=Manhattan Bridge south bypass }}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|allexceptnights}}{{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsweekends}}{{NYCS infobox legend|weekdaysonly}}\n}}\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{NYCS 4-tracked express station\n|1=23rd Street\n|l1=23 St\n|2=Eighth Street\u2013New York University\n|l2=8 St\u2013NYU\n|3=34th Street\u2013Herald Square\n|l3=34 St\n|4=Canal Street\n|l4=Canal St\n|deg=345\n|code=BMT Broadway Line\n|color=Broadway\n}}\n}}\n\n'''14th Street\u2013Union Square''', opened on September 5, 1917, is an express station on the [[BMT Broadway Line]] that has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s.\n\nIt is the southernmost station in [[Manhattan]] with a [[cross-platform interchange]] between all four Broadway services. A mosaic on the platform side walls is a depiction of \"the junction of Broadway and ... Bowery Road, 1828,\" as the area was once known. The mezzanine and crossover level has been reconstructed as well. Some former passageways and stairways have been closed off, including one immediately adjacent to the southernmost staircase on the northbound side.\n\nThis station was overhauled in the late 1970s. The MTA replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting with the 1970s wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. They also fixed staircases and platform edges. In 2002, the station was upgraded for [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessibility]] and its original late 1910s tiling was restored. As part of the upgrade, the MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiled for the walls and floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, installed yellow safety treads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions. The station now has an elevator on both platforms as well as connection to the station entrances and passageway to the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]].\n\nIn 2005, an artwork called ''City Glow'' by Chiho Aoshima was installed here.\n\n=== Image gallery ===\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:14th Street Union Square BMT Broadway 005.JPG|Depiction of the junction of Broadway and Bowery Road in 1828\nFile:Union Sq 14 9-11 name hall jeh.jpg|New tile name tablets on the mezzanine with names of 9/11 victims\nFile:14th Street-Union Square Elevator.jpg|Elevator to southbound platform from mezzanine\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== BMT Canarsie Line platform ==\n\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = Union Square\n| other_name = 14 Street\u2013Union Square\n| image = Union Square - Canarsie Line Platform.jpg\n| image_caption = \n| bg_color = #838A88\n| division = BMT\n| line = [[BMT Canarsie Line]]\n| service = Canarsie Manhattan\n| platforms = 1 [[island platform]]\n| tracks = 2\n| accessible = yes\n| acc_note = transfer to [[#IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms|IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms]] not accessible\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1924|06|30|p=y}}\n| code = 117\n| wifi = yes\n| next_topwest = {{NYCS next | station=Sixth Avenue | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| next_east = {{NYCS next | station=Third Avenue | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| next_topwest_acc = {{NYCS next | station=Eighth Avenue | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| next_east_acc = {{NYCS next | station=Myrtle\u2013Wyckoff Avenues | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}\n}}\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{NYCS 2-tracked island platform station\n|1=Sixth Avenue\n|l1=6 Av\n|2=Third Avenue\n|l2=3 Av\n|3r=yes\n|deg=060\n|code=BMT Canarsie Line\n|color=Canarsie\n|textcolor=white\n}}\n}}\n'''Union Square''' on the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] opened on June 30, 1924, as part of the '''14th Street\u2013Eastern Line''', which ran from [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] under the East River and through Williamsburg to Montrose and Bushwick Avenues.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/08/08/archives/subway-tunnel-through-passage-under-east-river-in-east-14th-street.html|title=Subway Tunnel Through|date=August 8, 1919|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/07/01/archives/celebrate-opening-of-subway-link-civic-and-city-officials-ride-in.html|title=Celebrate Opening of Subway Link|date=July 1, 1924|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The station has two tracks and one [[island platform]] with numerous stairways and exits leading from it.

It is located at the intersection of [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] and [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], underneath [[Union Square (Manhattan)|Union Square]] in [[Manhattan]], and is served by the:\n* '''{{NYCS|4}}''', '''{{NYCS|6}}''', '''{{NYCS|L}}''', '''{{NYCS|N}}''', and '''{{NYCS|Q}}''' trains at all times\n* '''{{NYCS|5}}''' and '''{{NYCS|R}}''' trains at all times except late nights\n* '''[[W (New York City Subway service)|W]]''' train on weekdays\n* '''[[6d (New York City Subway service)|&lt;6&gt;]]''' train weekdays in the peak direction\n\nIn 2016, over 34 million passengers entered this station, making it the fourth-busiest station in the system.<ref name=\"2014-rider\"/>\n\nThe complex is located on the border of several neighborhoods with popular business, residential and nightlife destination spots, including the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the southeast, [[Greenwich Village]] to the south and southwest, [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] to the northwest, and both the [[Flatiron District]] and [[Gramercy Park]] to the north and northeast.\n\nThere are three originally separate stations here, which were combined on July 1, 1948. They now share a [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]], common entrance points, and unified signage. This complex was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/NY/New+York/state.html New York County Listings at the National Register of Historic Places (Structure #05000671)]</ref>{{TOC left}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1990s, this station underwent a major station renovation. On July 9, 1993, the contract for the project's design was awarded for $2,993,948. As part of the contract, the consultant investigated whether it was feasible to reconfigure the IRT passageway, to reframe the exit structure on the Lexington Avenue platforms to accommodate the relocation and widening of stairs, the construction of a new fan room, the removal of stairs on the Broadway Line platforms, the reframing of the existing structure, and the construction of a new staircase between the intermediate and IRT mezzanines. These were all deemed feasible, and in May 1994, a supplemental agreement worth $984,998 was reached to allow the consultant to prepare the design for this work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda May 1994|date=May 16, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit}}</ref>{{Rp|C-57}}\n\n==Station layout==\n{{NYCS Platform Layout 14th Street-Union Square Station}}\n\n===Exits===\n*[[File:SubwaySigns.jpg|thumb|Station entrance sign|alt=]]Two stairs inside Union Square Park on east side of Union Square West at 16th Street<ref name=maps>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Union Square / Gramercy|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M07_UnionSq-Gramercy_2015.pdf|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 6, 2015|date=2015}}</ref>\n* One stair at southeast corner of Union Square East and 15th Street<ref name=maps/>\n* One stair inside Union Square Park on north side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East<ref name=maps/>\n* One stair inside Union Square Park on north side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East<ref name=maps/>\n* One stair on south side of 14th Street between Union Square West and Union Square East<ref name=maps/>\n* Two stairs at southwest corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street<ref name=maps/>\n* Two stairs at southeast corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street<ref name=maps/>\n* {{access icon}} One stair, escalator bank, and elevator at northeast corner of 4th Avenue and 14th Street<ref name=maps/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms ==\n\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = 14 Street\u2013Union Square\n| image = 14 Street-Union Square IRT 003.JPG\n| image_caption = Downtown platform for the local services (left) and express services (right), showing the curvature of the station and the movable platforms\n| bg_color = #007527\n| division = IRT\n| line = [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]]\n| service = Lexington\n| platforms = 2 [[island platform]]s (in service)<br>[[cross-platform interchange]]<br>2 [[side platform]]s (abandoned)\n| tracks = 4\n| cross_platform = yes\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1904|October|27|p=y}}<ref name=145th>''The New York Times'', [http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/nytimes-1904-dayoneopen.html Our Subway Open: 150,000 Try It], October 28, 1904</ref>\n| code = 406\n| wifi = yes\n| accessible = mezzanine\n| next_north = {{NYCS next | type=express | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=Grand Central\u201342nd Street | service=Lexington express}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=local | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=23rd Street | service=Lexington local}}<br>{{NYCS next | station=18th Street | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | type=local; closed | service=none | type2=no service}}\n| next_south = {{NYCS next | type=local | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=Astor Place | service=Lexington local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express | line=IRT Lexington Avenue Line | station=Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall | service=Lexington express}}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|allexceptnights}}{{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|rushpeak}}\n}}\n{{Stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|Lexington}}\n|style=margin-left:10px;margin-top:10px;float:right;\n|legend =track\n|map=\nuvSTR!~MFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|42 St]]\nudSTR!~dMFADEg\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[23rd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|23 St]]\nuvSTRf\\uvSTRg\nd\\uv-SHI2r\\uvSTR\\udSTR\\numN330\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\uvSTR-\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\uvSHI2l-\nexdBSl\\udSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\\exdBSr\nexdBSl\\udSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\\exdBSr\nuvSHI2l-\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\uv-SHI2gr\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\uv\u00dcST\nuv-STR\\ubvvvSTR\nuv-STR\\ubvvvSTR\nuv-STR\\uvSTR\\uvSHI2g+l-\nuvSTRf\\uvSTRg\nudSTR!~dMFADEf\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Astor Place (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Astor Pl]]\nuvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Br]]\n}}\n}}\n\n'''14th Street\u2013Union Square''', opened on October 27, 1904, is an express station on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] that has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s. The uptown and downtown platforms are offset from each other and slightly curved. [[Gap filler|Gap-filling]] movable platforms on the downtown side are automatically operated via proximity sensors when trains arrive. The station's mezzanines are located over the platforms.\n\nThe station has two abandoned local [[side platform]]s; the northbound one is visible through windows, bordered with wide, bright red frames (This is part of a larger, station-wide art installation entitled ''Framing Union Square''). From the north end of the downtown platform's mezzanine, the adjacent side platform can be seen through a hole in the plywood.\n\n===1991 accident===\n{{Main|1991 Union Square derailment}}\nOn August 28, 1991, an accident just north of the station killed five riders and injured 215 others in one of the worst wrecks since a [[1928 Times Square derailment|crash]] at [[Times Square\u201342nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square\u201342nd Street]] on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] in 1928 that killed 16 people. The train operator, Robert Ray, was intoxicated and had been overshooting platforms during the entire run from [[Woodlawn (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|Woodlawn]] in [[the Bronx]]. Just north of this station, his [[Crown Heights - Utica Avenue (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Utica Avenue]]-bound '''{{NYCS|4}}''' train was to be shifted to the local track due to repair work on the express one. He was running at 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) at a 10&nbsp;mph (16&nbsp;km/h) zone and took the switch so fast that only the first car made it through the crossover. The rest of the train was involved in a derailment that led to a massive pile-up. Cars 1435, 1436, 1437, 1439, and 1440 were essentially scrapped on the site, and the IRT Lexington Line suffered heavy structural damage as a result. Service was disrupted for six days (with trains terminating at [[59th Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|59th Street]] for the duration) as transit workers cleaned up the wreckage. The entire infrastructure, including signals, switches, track, roadbed, cabling, and 23 support columns needed to be replaced. Ray was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison, but released in April 2002 for good behavior.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nysubway.com/safety/subwaysafety.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316215653/http://www.nysubway.com/safety/subwaysafety.html |archive-date=2018-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>44:10-50:10 in this video do a small documentary on the accident: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KKVupF7Uug</ref>\n\nThe wreck occurred at the entry to a former pocket track. Like [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], this station was built with extra tracks on the approach to the station. These were between the local and express tracks and approximately {{convert|300|ft|m}} long. The idea was to have a \"stacking\" track where a train could be held momentarily until the platform cleared for it to enter the station. The tracks here and at 72nd Street were rendered useless when train lengths grew beyond these tracks' capacity. When the damage from the 1991 wreck was repaired, the stacking track was removed. A similar track still exists between the northbound tracks south of the platforms.\n\n===Image gallery===\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Union Square subway 001.JPG|Old IRT \"14\" eagle cartouche\nFile:NYCS IRT LexAve 14St.jpg|Abandoned side platform behind the wall and the black bars on the right, whose edge is still visible\nFile:Spring Street Mosaic.jpg|Depiction of the platform in a mosaic at the entrance to [[Spring Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Spring Street (8th Avenue) station]]\nFile:IRT North end Union Sq plat jeh.jpg|Platforms are not aligned; southbound one (background) is farther north\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== BMT Broadway Line platforms ==\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = 14 Street\u2013Union Square\n| image = 14th Street-Union Square - Broadway Line Platform.jpg\n| image_caption = {{rint|newyork|R}} train of [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]] cars departing on the local track\n| bg_color = #FFC800\n| font_color = black\n| font_color_2 = black\n| division = BMT\n| line = [[BMT Broadway Line]]\n| service = Broadway\n| platforms = 2 [[island platform]]s<br>[[cross-platform interchange]]\n| tracks = 4\n| accessible = yes\n| acc_note = Transfer to [[#IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms|IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms]] not accessible\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1917|September|4|p=y}}<ref>''The New York Times'', [https://www.nytimes.com/1917/09/05/archives/open-first-section-of-broadway-line-train-carrying-1000-passengers.html Open First Section of Broadway Line], September 5, 1917</ref><ref name=42nd>''The New York Times'', [http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/nytimes-1918-broadway.html Open New Subway to Times Square], January 6, 1918</ref>\n| code = 015\n| wifi = yes\n| next_north = {{NYCS next | type= express | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=34th Street\u2013Herald Square | service=Broadway express}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=local | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=23rd Street | service=Broadway local}}\n| next_south = {{NYCS next | type=local | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=Eighth Street\u2013New York University | service=Broadway local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express | line=BMT Broadway Line via Bridge | station=Canal Street | service=Broadway express}}\n| next_north_acc = {{NYCS next | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=34th Street\u2013Herald Square | service=Broadway}}\n| next_south_acc = {{NYCS next | type=via tunnel | line=BMT Broadway Line | station=Cortlandt Street | service= Broadway south}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=via bridge | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=DeKalb Avenue | service=Manhattan Bridge south DeKalb}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=via bridge bypass | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center | service=Manhattan Bridge south bypass }}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|allexceptnights}}{{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsweekends}}{{NYCS infobox legend|weekdaysonly}}\n}}\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{NYCS 4-tracked express station\n|1=23rd Street\n|l1=23 St\n|2=Eighth Street\u2013New York University\n|l2=8 St\u2013NYU\n|3=34th Street\u2013Herald Square\n|l3=34 St\n|4=Canal Street\n|l4=Canal St\n|deg=345\n|code=BMT Broadway Line\n|color=Broadway\n}}\n}}\n\n'''14th Street\u2013Union Square''', opened on September 5, 1917, is an express station on the [[BMT Broadway Line]] that has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s.\n\nIt is the southernmost station in [[Manhattan]] with a [[cross-platform interchange]] between all four Broadway services. A mosaic on the platform side walls is a depiction of \"the junction of Broadway and ... Bowery Road, 1828,\" as the area was once known. The mezzanine and crossover level has been reconstructed as well. Some former passageways and stairways have been closed off, including one immediately adjacent to the southernmost staircase on the northbound side.\n\nThis station was overhauled in the late 1970s. The MTA replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting with the 1970s wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. They also fixed staircases and platform edges. In 2002, the station was upgraded for [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessibility]] and its original late 1910s tiling was restored. As part of the upgrade, the MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiled for the walls and floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, installed yellow safety treads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions. The station now has an elevator on both platforms as well as connection to the station entrances and passageway to the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]].\n\nIn 2005, an artwork called ''City Glow'' by Chiho Aoshima was installed here.\n\n=== Image gallery ===\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:14th Street Union Square BMT Broadway 005.JPG|Depiction of the junction of Broadway and Bowery Road in 1828\nFile:Union Sq 14 9-11 name hall jeh.jpg|New tile name tablets on the mezzanine with names of 9/11 victims\nFile:14th Street-Union Square Elevator.jpg|Elevator to southbound platform from mezzanine\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== BMT Canarsie Line platform ==\n\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = Union Square\n| other_name = 14 Street\u2013Union Square\n| image = Union Square - Canarsie Line Platform.jpg\n| image_caption = \n| bg_color = #838A88\n| division = BMT\n| line = [[BMT Canarsie Line]]\n| service = Canarsie Manhattan\n| platforms = 1 [[island platform]]\n| tracks = 2\n| accessible = yes\n| acc_note = transfer to [[#IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms|IRT Lexington Avenue Line platforms]] not accessible\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1924|06|30|p=y}}\n| code = 117\n| wifi = yes\n| next_topwest = {{NYCS next | station=Sixth Avenue | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| next_east = {{NYCS next | station=Third Avenue | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| next_topwest_acc = {{NYCS next | station=Eighth Avenue | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| next_east_acc = {{NYCS next | station=Myrtle\u2013Wyckoff Avenues | line=BMT Canarsie Line | service=Canarsie Manhattan}}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}\n}}\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{NYCS 2-tracked island platform station\n|1=Sixth Avenue\n|l1=6 Av\n|2=Third Avenue\n|l2=3 Av\n|3r=yes\n|deg=060\n|code=BMT Canarsie Line\n|color=Canarsie\n|textcolor=white\n}}\n}}\n'''Union Square''' on the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] opened on June 30, 1924, as part of the '''14th Street\u2013Eastern Line''', which ran from [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] under the East River and through Williamsburg to Montrose and Bushwick Avenues.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/08/08/archives/subway-tunnel-through-passage-under-east-river-in-east-14th-street.html|title=Subway Tunnel Through|date=August 8, 1919|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/07/01/archives/celebrate-opening-of-subway-link-civic-and-city-officials-ride-in.html|title=Celebrate Opening of Subway Link|date=July 1, 1924|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The station has two tracks and one [[island platform]] with numerous stairways and exits leading from it.

Still the seat of the [[Roman Senate]], and a gem of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], Rome was not what it had once been \u2013 the emperors had moved their courts to the more secure [[Ravenna]] in the wake of the two pillages and the [[Hun]] incursions. \n\nThe Vandals were allowed to [[Sack of Rome (455)|enter the city]] after promising the [[Pope Leo I|Pope]] to spare its citizens, but they carried off many of the unfortunate Romans, some of whom were sold into slavery<ref>Gibbon, Edward.

This loot was later recovered by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].<ref>Brownworth, Lars. Lost to the West. 2010, Crown Publishing Group.</ref> At the time, however, its loss was a major blow to the Western Empire.\n\n=== Ricimer and other generals dominate ===\n\nAfter Rome's weaknesses were exposed by the Vandals' invasion, the barbarian tribes of Gaul, once a secure province loyal to the Empire, began to rebel against their former overlords.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 624. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref>  The Ravenna-based emperors now began to lose the respect of many of their subjects, and powerful generals, often of barbarian origin themselves, were forced to defend them.  Among the more successful of these commanders, the most senior of whom were called ''[[magistri militum]]'', were [[Avitus]], who would eventually be crowned emperor, and [[Ricimer]] (who was part-[[Suevi]] and half-[[Visigoth]]).  Ricimer grew so powerful that he was able to choose and depose weak emperors almost at will.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> \n\nIn 475, the Western emperor, [[Julius Nepos]] (nephew of the Eastern empress), was overthrown by his ''magister militum'', the aristocratic [[Flavius Orestes]], who had once been a trusted official of [[Attila]], the [[Hun]] ruler.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 636. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref>  Rather than take the throne himself, Orestes had his young son, [[Romulus Augustus]], crowned emperor.\n\n== Odoacer's coup and accession ==\n\n[[File:Roman Empires 476AD.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] (blue) and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] (red) Roman Empires by 476]]\n\n=== Death of Orestes and overthrow of his son ===\n\nOrestes, who ruled in his son's name, found an enemy in the persons of his non-Roman mercenary-soldiers.  When, led by an auxiliary general called [[Odoacer]], they demanded estates and were refused,<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> they swept into Italy.  Informing his soldiers that, if they followed and obeyed him, they would, in the words of Gibbon, \"extort the justice that had been denied to their dutiful petitions,\" the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Arian Christianity|Arian]] Odoacer confirmed his leadership of the revolt.  Barbarian soldiers in Italian cities and garrisons \"flocked\" to the audacious general's standard, and Orestes fled to fortified [[Pavia]].\n\nOdoacer laid siege to Pavia, which fell in due course.  The bishop of that city, [[Epiphanius of Pavia|Epiphanius]], managed to ransom many of the captives taken during this invasion,<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 638. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> but was unable to save Orestes, who was executed.  \n\nOrestes's brother was killed near Ravenna by Odoacer's forces, who entered the imperial capital soon afterward.  The young monarch Romulus Augustus was, on September 4, compelled to abdicate before the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].  That body requested that the Eastern Roman Emperor, [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], reunite his realm with the West, with Odoacer as his governor.  The auxiliary commander, now master of Ravenna, encouraged the senators in this effort.<ref>Hill, David Jayne.  A History of Diplomacy in the International Development of Europe, Vol. 1, Pg. 32. Longmans, Green, and Co, 1905.</ref><ref>Bryce, Viscount James. The Holy Roman empire, Pg 27.</ref>  The emperor was somewhat hesitant to give Odoacer what would be relative autonomy, citing the fact that his wife's nephew Julius Nepos, still alive and recognized as ''caesar'' in [[Dalmatia]], should be restored to the throne.  Zeno, however, did not want to use force to support his relation, so, while still urging Odoacer to recognize Nepos's claim, granted the general the rank of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]<ref>Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 407. Dover Publications, 1958.</ref> and accepted the general's gift of the Western imperial standards.  \n\nThe hapless ex-emperor, Romulus Augustus, was still present in Ravenna, and Odoacer rid himself of the boy by exiling him.  The fate of this final Western Roman emperor is somewhat uncertain, but it is believed that he retired to the [[Lucullan Villa]] in Campania<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 640. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> and died before 488, when the body of [[Severinus of Noricum|the saint Severinus]] was brought there.  In 480, the second of Odoacer's Roman rivals, Nepos, was assassinated by \"retainers.\"<ref>Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 410. Dover Publications, 1958</ref>  Until Nepos's murder, even the confirmation of Odoacer's patrician rank and authority had been undermined by the presence of Zeno's nephew.<ref>Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 410. Dover Publications, 1958</ref>\n\n=== The Kingdom of Italy is established and overrun ===\n\nOdoacer now proclaimed himself [[Kingdom of Italy (476-493)|king of Italy]] after absorbing Augustus's powers, and formed alliances with other barbarians, a prime example being the [[Visigoths]]. He proved himself to be a capable ruler, and, although Italy was beset by disasters such as plagues and famines during the turbulent end of the 5th century, historians such as [[Edward Gibbon]] have attested to Odoacer's \"prudence and humanity.\"<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol 3, Pg 641. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> \n\nDespite possessing these qualities, Odoacer was unable to defeat the [[Ostrogoths]] and their monarch, [[Theodoric the Great]], who invaded the Kingdom of Italy and overcame the forces that defended it.  After four years of fighting, Odoacer, with some pressure from his citizens and his soldiers, decided in 493 that it would be useless to continue fighting and surrendered.  The conqueror of the Western Roman Empire was himself conquered, and, unlike Romulus Augustus, he was not spared.  While enjoying a banquet, he was murdered by an Ostrogoth, who may have been Theodoric himself.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 4, Pg 692. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref>\n\n=== Temporary reestablishment of Roman control over Italy ===\n\nWhen the Ostrogothic queen [[Amalasuntha]], a Byzantine ally, was executed by her chosen successor [[Theodahad]] in 535, the Eastern Emperor, [[Justinian]], did not hesitate to declare war.  Under the command of the general [[Belisarius]], an army landed in Sicily and subdued that island before invading Italy proper.<ref>Young, George Frederick. East and West Through Fifteen Centuries, Vol. 2, Pg. 220. Longmans, Green and Co, 1916</ref>  When he did invade the peninsula, he took the city of Naples, then attacked and captured Rome.  For nearly twenty years,<ref>Young, George Frederick. East and West Through Fifteen Centuries, Vol. 2, Pg. 220. Longmans, Green and Co, 1916</ref> the Ostrogoths and Romans fought for control of the peninsula.  The suspicions of the Eastern empress, [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]], often led her husband [[Justinian]] to withhold reinforcements from Belisarius, who was recalled several times.  Some historians<ref>Brownworth, Lars. Lost to the West. 2010.</ref> have concluded that the war's successful conclusion was the victory of Belisarius, but the honor of defeating the Ostrogoths went to [[Narses]], who was trusted far more by his superiors in [[Constantinople]].  Eventually, after the Roman reconquest, another barbarian tribe, the [[Lombards]], invaded and settled in Italy.\n\n===Continuation of the Eastern Empire===\n  \nThe Eastern Empire went on after  the fall of the Western Empire; the last part of the Eastern Empire, the [[Principality of Theodoro]], fell in December 1475,<ref>[[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Vasiliev, Alexander A.]] (1936), ''The Goths in the Crimea'', Cambridge, MA:  Mediaeval Academy of America, pp.249-265.</ref> 999 years after the deposition of Romulus Augustus.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Romulus Augustulus]]\n[[Category:Western Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:476]]\n[[Category:5th century in Italy]]\n[[Category:470s in the Roman Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox historical event\n|name = Deposition of<br>Romulus Augustus\n|image = Young Folks' History of Rome illus420.png\n|image_size = frameless\n|alt = Romulus Augustus surrenders the crown\n|caption = [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Western Roman Emperor]], surrenders the crown to [[Odoacer]] (1880 illustration).\n|participants = [[Odoacer]]<br>[[Flavius Orestes]]<br>[[Romulus Augustus]]<br>[[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]<br>[[Julius Nepos]]\n|location = [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]\n|date = 476 AD\n|outcome = The overthrow of [[Romulus Augustus]], considered to have been the final [[Western Roman Emperor]].\n}}\n\n[[Odoacer]]'s '''deposition of Romulus Augustus''', occurring in 476 AD, was a [[coup]] that marked the end of the reign of the [[Western Roman Emperor]] last approved by the Western [[Roman Senate]] and the creation of the Kingdom of Italy, although [[Julius Nepos]] exercised control over [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] until 480.

Still the seat of the [[Roman Senate]], and a gem of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], Rome was not what it had once been \u2013 the emperors had moved their courts to the more secure [[Ravenna]] in the wake of the two pillages and the [[Hun]] incursions. \n\nThe Vandals were allowed to [[Sack of Rome (455)|enter the city]] after promising the [[Pope Leo I|Pope]] to spare its citizens, but they carried off many of the unfortunate Romans, some of whom were sold into slavery<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 623. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> in their captors' [[North African]] realm.  The widow of the emperors [[Valentinian III]] and [[Petronius Maximus]], [[Licinia Eudoxia|Licinia]], was herself taken to Carthage, where her daughter was married to Genseric's son.\n\nRome not only lost a portion of its population during the Vandal rampage \u2013 a fairly large amount of its treasures was plundered by the barbarians.  This loot was later recovered by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].<ref>Brownworth, Lars. Lost to the West. 2010, Crown Publishing Group.</ref> At the time, however, its loss was a major blow to the Western Empire.\n\n=== Ricimer and other generals dominate ===\n\nAfter Rome's weaknesses were exposed by the Vandals' invasion, the barbarian tribes of Gaul, once a secure province loyal to the Empire, began to rebel against their former overlords.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 624. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref>  The Ravenna-based emperors now began to lose the respect of many of their subjects, and powerful generals, often of barbarian origin themselves, were forced to defend them.  Among the more successful of these commanders, the most senior of whom were called ''[[magistri militum]]'', were [[Avitus]], who would eventually be crowned emperor, and [[Ricimer]] (who was part-[[Suevi]] and half-[[Visigoth]]).  Ricimer grew so powerful that he was able to choose and depose weak emperors almost at will.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> \n\nIn 475, the Western emperor, [[Julius Nepos]] (nephew of the Eastern empress), was overthrown by his ''magister militum'', the aristocratic [[Flavius Orestes]], who had once been a trusted official of [[Attila]], the [[Hun]] ruler.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 636. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref>  Rather than take the throne himself, Orestes had his young son, [[Romulus Augustus]], crowned emperor.\n\n== Odoacer's coup and accession ==\n\n[[File:Roman Empires 476AD.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] (blue) and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] (red) Roman Empires by 476]]\n\n=== Death of Orestes and overthrow of his son ===\n\nOrestes, who ruled in his son's name, found an enemy in the persons of his non-Roman mercenary-soldiers.  When, led by an auxiliary general called [[Odoacer]], they demanded estates and were refused,<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> they swept into Italy.  Informing his soldiers that, if they followed and obeyed him, they would, in the words of Gibbon, \"extort the justice that had been denied to their dutiful petitions,\" the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Arian Christianity|Arian]] Odoacer confirmed his leadership of the revolt.  Barbarian soldiers in Italian cities and garrisons \"flocked\" to the audacious general's standard, and Orestes fled to fortified [[Pavia]].\n\nOdoacer laid siege to Pavia, which fell in due course.  The bishop of that city, [[Epiphanius of Pavia|Epiphanius]], managed to ransom many of the captives taken during this invasion,<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 638. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> but was unable to save Orestes, who was executed.  \n\nOrestes's brother was killed near Ravenna by Odoacer's forces, who entered the imperial capital soon afterward.  The young monarch Romulus Augustus was, on September 4, compelled to abdicate before the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].  That body requested that the Eastern Roman Emperor, [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], reunite his realm with the West, with Odoacer as his governor.  The auxiliary commander, now master of Ravenna, encouraged the senators in this effort.<ref>Hill, David Jayne.  A History of Diplomacy in the International Development of Europe, Vol. 1, Pg. 32. Longmans, Green, and Co, 1905.</ref><ref>Bryce, Viscount James. The Holy Roman empire, Pg 27.</ref>  The emperor was somewhat hesitant to give Odoacer what would be relative autonomy, citing the fact that his wife's nephew Julius Nepos, still alive and recognized as ''caesar'' in [[Dalmatia]], should be restored to the throne.  Zeno, however, did not want to use force to support his relation, so, while still urging Odoacer to recognize Nepos's claim, granted the general the rank of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]<ref>Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 407. Dover Publications, 1958.</ref> and accepted the general's gift of the Western imperial standards.  \n\nThe hapless ex-emperor, Romulus Augustus, was still present in Ravenna, and Odoacer rid himself of the boy by exiling him.  The fate of this final Western Roman emperor is somewhat uncertain, but it is believed that he retired to the [[Lucullan Villa]] in Campania<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 640. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> and died before 488, when the body of [[Severinus of Noricum|the saint Severinus]] was brought there.  In 480, the second of Odoacer's Roman rivals, Nepos, was assassinated by \"retainers.\"<ref>Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 410. Dover Publications, 1958</ref>  Until Nepos's murder, even the confirmation of Odoacer's patrician rank and authority had been undermined by the presence of Zeno's nephew.<ref>Bury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 410. Dover Publications, 1958</ref>\n\n=== The Kingdom of Italy is established and overrun ===\n\nOdoacer now proclaimed himself [[Kingdom of Italy (476-493)|king of Italy]] after absorbing Augustus powers, and formed alliances with other barbarians, a prime example being the [[Visigoths]]. He proved himself to be a capable ruler, and, although Italy was beset by disasters such as plagues and famines during the turbulent end of the 5th century, historians such as [[Edward Gibbon]] have attested to Odoacer's \"prudence and humanity.\"<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol 3, Pg 641. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref> \n\nDespite possessing these qualities, Odoacer was unable to defeat the [[Ostrogoths]] and their monarch, [[Theodoric the Great]], who invaded the Kingdom of Italy and overcame the forces that defended it.  After four years of fighting, Odoacer, with some pressure from his citizens and his soldiers, decided in 493 that it would be useless to continue fighting and surrendered.  The conqueror of the Western Roman Empire was himself conquered, and, unlike Romulus Augustus, he was not spared.  While enjoying a banquet, he was murdered by an Ostrogoth, who may have been Theodoric himself.<ref>Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 4, Pg 692. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003</ref>\n\n=== Temporary reestablishment of Roman control over Italy ===\n\nWhen the Ostrogothic queen [[Amalasuntha]], a Byzantine ally, was executed by her chosen successor [[Theodahad]] in 535, the Eastern Emperor, [[Justinian]], did not hesitate to declare war.  Under the command of the general [[Belisarius]], an army landed in Sicily and subdued that island before invading Italy proper.<ref>Young, George Frederick. East and West Through Fifteen Centuries, Vol. 2, Pg. 220. Longmans, Green and Co, 1916</ref>  When he did invade the peninsula, he took the city of Naples, then attacked and captured Rome.  For nearly twenty years,<ref>Young, George Frederick. East and West Through Fifteen Centuries, Vol. 2, Pg. 220. Longmans, Green and Co, 1916</ref> the Ostrogoths and Romans fought for control of the peninsula.  The suspicions of the Eastern empress, [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]], often led her husband [[Justinian]] to withhold reinforcements from Belisarius, who was recalled several times.  Some historians<ref>Brownworth, Lars. Lost to the West. 2010.</ref> have concluded that the war's successful conclusion was the victory of Belisarius, but the honor of defeating the Ostrogoths went to [[Narses]], who was trusted far more by his superiors in [[Constantinople]].  Eventually, after the Roman reconquest, another barbarian tribe, the [[Lombards]], invaded and settled in Italy.\n\n===Continuation of the Eastern Empire===\n  \nThe Eastern Empire went on after  the fall of the Western Empire; the last part of the Eastern Empire, the [[Principality of Theodoro]], fell in December 1475,<ref>[[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Vasiliev, Alexander A.]] (1936), ''The Goths in the Crimea'', Cambridge, MA:  Mediaeval Academy of America, pp.249-265.</ref> 999 years after the deposition of Romulus Augustus.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Romulus Augustulus]]\n[[Category:Western Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:476]]\n[[Category:5th century in Italy]]\n[[Category:470s in the Roman Empire]]\n", "name_user": "Aerach", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Kingdom of Italy is established and overrun", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus"}

The town recorded a population of 50,380 in 2012, making it the most populous locality in Fife and the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|11th most populous in Scotland]].\n\nThe earliest known settlements in the area around Dunfermline probably date as far back as the [[Neolithic]] period. The area was not regionally significant until at least the [[Bronze Age]]. The town was first recorded in the 11th century, with the marriage of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]], King of Scots, and [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Saint Margaret]] at the church in Dunfermline. As his [[List of Scottish consorts|Queen consort]], Margaret established a new church dedicated to the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], which evolved into an [[Dunfermline Abbey|Abbey]] under their son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1128. During the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]], the church - later to be known as Dunfermline Abbey - was firmly established as a prosperous royal mausoleum for the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish Crown]]. A total of eighteen royals, including seven Kings, were buried here from Queen Margaret in 1093 to [[Robert, Duke of Albany|Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] in 1420. [[Robert The Bruce]], otherwise known as Robert I, became the last of the seven Scottish Kings to be buried in 1329. His bones would eventually be re-discovered and re-buried in 1821, when the excavation of the grounds of what had formerly been the eastern section of the Abbey became the site for the new Abbey Church.\n\nThe town is a major service centre for west Fife. Dunfermline retains much of its historic significance, as well as providing facilities for leisure. Employment is focused in the service sector, with the largest employer being [[Sky UK]]. Other large employers in the area include [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (on-line retailer), [[Best Western]] (hotels), CR Smith (windows manufacturing), [[FMC Technologies]] (offshore energy), [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds]] and [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]] (both financial services).<ref name=\"Dunfermline Economy Presentation p.4\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Dunfermline}}\n[[File:Malcolm Canmore's Tower, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of Malcolm Canmore's Tower]]\nThere have been various interpretations of the name, ''\"Dunfermline\"''.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\">Dennison and Stronach, ''Historic Dunfermline'', pp.3\u20134.</ref> The first element, ''\"dun\"'' translated from [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], has been accepted as a (fortified) hill, and is assumed to be referring to the rocky outcrop at the site of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]]'s tower in Pittencrieff Glen (now [[Pittencrieff Park]]).<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\">Taylor and M\u00e1rkus, ''The Place\u2013Names of Fife: Volume One'', pp.309\u2013310.</ref> The rest of the name is problematic.<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" /> The second element, ''\"the ferm\"'' may have been an alternative name for the Tower Burn according to a medieval record published in 1455 which, together with the Lyne Burn to the south, suggests the site of a fortification between these two watercourses.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\" /><ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" />\n\nThe first record of a settlement in the Dunfermline area was in the [[Neolithic]] period.

As the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] gathered pace the demand for [[Agricultural lime|lime]] (for improving land) increased the requirement for coal to burn it. Salt panning too required coal in large quantities, and the early outcrops near the Firth of Forth became exhausted, forcing the extraction to take place further inland. Many of the sites were within the present day limits of Dunfermline.\n\n{{main|The mineral railways of Dunfermline}}\nThe increasing distance of the pits from the Forth made transport of the minerals an issue, and Dunfermline was a pioneer in the construction of wooden waggonways for the purpose. By the eighteenth century a complex network had developed, and in time many of the lines were converted to railways: the Halbeath Railway, the Fordell Railway, the Elgin Railway and the Townhill Tramway being the most prominent. They generally ran from north to south, still conveying the mineral to the harbours at Charlestown, Limekilns, Inverkeithing and St David's. From 1848 more modern railways entered Dunfermline, at first on a west to east axis, intersecting the mineral lines. In time the latter were converted to make through running on to the main line network possible.\n\nDuring the [[industrial revolution]] and [[victorian period]] industry in Dunfermline was concentrated to the north of the town centre around Pilmuir Street and to the south along sections of the Lynn Burn at Elgin and Bothwell Streets with textiles being particularly important to the town's economy. After the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] traditional industries, particularly linen and coal mining, declined and eventually became obsolete in the town with many factories ceasing production.

''Toun'' is a word in [[Scots language|Scots]] which can refer to any form of settlement from farm estate to burgh or city (see headword ''toun'' in [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/ Scots National Dictionary]) and the reference occurs most famously in the ballad [[Sir Patrick Spens]]: ''The king sits in Dunfermline Toun,/ Drinking the blude-reid wine...''</ref>\n|population= 50,380\n|population_ref= <ref name=\"GROS 2012 Table 3a\"/>\n|population_density= {{convert|1498|/sqmi|/km2|abbr=on}}\n|statistic1= Est. 71,820\n|statistic_title1 =\n|os_grid_reference= NT105875\n|edinburgh_distance_mi=13\n|london_distance_mi=343\n|language = English, Scots\n|coordinates = {{coord|56.07192|-3.43930|display=inline,title}}\n|unitary_scotland= [[Fife]]\n|lieutenancy_scotland= [[Fife]]\n|post_town= DUNFERMLINE\n|postcode_district = KY11, KY12\n|postcode_area= KY\n|dial_code= 01383\n|constituency_westminster= [[Dunfermline and West Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline and West Fife]]\n|constituency_scottish_parliament= [[Dunfermline (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline]]\n|static_image_name= Scotland-2016-Aerial-Dunfermline Abbey.jpg\n|static_image_caption= Aerial view of Dunfermline Abbey and historic quarter\n|area_total_sq_mi= 7.07\n}}\n\n'''Dunfermline''' ({{IPAc-en|d|\u028c|n|\u02c8|f|\u025c\u02d0r|m|l|\u1d7b|n|audio=Dunfermline.ogg}}; {{lang-sco|Dunfaurlin}}, {{lang-gd|D\u00f9n Ph\u00e0rlain}}) is a town and former [[Royal Burgh]], and parish, in [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], on high ground {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}} from the northern shore of the [[Firth of Forth]]. The town recorded a population of 50,380 in 2012, making it the most populous locality in Fife and the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|11th most populous in Scotland]].\n\nThe earliest known settlements in the area around Dunfermline probably date as far back as the [[Neolithic]] period. The area was not regionally significant until at least the [[Bronze Age]]. The town was first recorded in the 11th century, with the marriage of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]], King of Scots, and [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Saint Margaret]] at the church in Dunfermline. As his [[List of Scottish consorts|Queen consort]], Margaret established a new church dedicated to the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]], which evolved into an [[Dunfermline Abbey|Abbey]] under their son, [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1128. During the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]], the church - later to be known as Dunfermline Abbey - was firmly established as a prosperous royal mausoleum for the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish Crown]]. A total of eighteen royals, including seven Kings, were buried here from Queen Margaret in 1093 to [[Robert, Duke of Albany|Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] in 1420. [[Robert The Bruce]], otherwise known as Robert I, became the last of the seven Scottish Kings to be buried in 1329. His bones would eventually be re-discovered and re-buried in 1821, when the excavation of the grounds of what had formerly been the eastern section of the Abbey became the site for the new Abbey Church.\n\nThe town is a major service centre for west Fife. Dunfermline retains much of its historic significance, as well as providing facilities for leisure. Employment is focused in the service sector, with the largest employer being [[Sky UK]]. Other large employers in the area include [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (on-line retailer), [[Best Western]] (hotels), CR Smith (windows manufacturing), [[FMC Technologies]] (offshore energy), [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds]] and [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]] (both financial services).<ref name=\"Dunfermline Economy Presentation p.4\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Dunfermline}}\n[[File:Malcolm Canmore's Tower, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of Malcolm Canmore's Tower]]\nThere have been various interpretations of the name, ''\"Dunfermline\"''.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\">Dennison and Stronach, ''Historic Dunfermline'', pp.3\u20134.</ref> The first element, ''\"dun\"'' translated from [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], has been accepted as a (fortified) hill, and is assumed to be referring to the rocky outcrop at the site of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]]'s tower in Pittencrieff Glen (now [[Pittencrieff Park]]).<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\">Taylor and M\u00e1rkus, ''The Place\u2013Names of Fife: Volume One'', pp.309\u2013310.</ref> The rest of the name is problematic.<ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" /> The second element, ''\"the ferm\"'' may have been an alternative name for the Tower Burn according to a medieval record published in 1455 which, together with the Lyne Burn to the south, suggests the site of a fortification between these two watercourses.<ref name=\"Dennison and Stronach3\u20134\" /><ref name=\"Taylor and M\u00e1rkus309\u2013310\" />\n\nThe first record of a settlement in the Dunfermline area was in the [[Neolithic]] period.

Council housing was focused towards [[Abbeyview]], on a {{convert|240|acre|adj=on|order=flip}} site on Aberdour Road; Touch, to the south of Garvock Hill; Bellyeoman and Baldridgeburn.

This growth has edged the population centre towards the town's boundary with the M90 road corridor; it is planned to continue until 2022. Major developments include the creation of the [[Duloch]] and Masterton neighbourhoods with over 6,000 homes, three new primary schools, new community infrastructure, employment land and the Fife Leisure Park.

As the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] gathered pace the demand for [[Agricultural lime|lime]] (for improving land) increased the requirement for coal to burn it. Salt panning too required coal in large quantities, and the early outcrops near the Firth of Forth became exhausted, forcing the extraction to take place further inland. Many of the sites were within the present day limits of Dunfermline.\n\n{{main|The mineral railways of Dunfermline}}\nThe increasing distance of the pits from the Forth made transport of the minerals an issue, and Dunfermline was a pioneer in the construction of wooden waggonways for the purpose. By the eighteenth century a complex network had developed, and in time many of the lines were converted to railways: the Halbeath Railway, the Fordell Railway, the Elgin Railway and the Townhill Tramway being the most prominent. They generally ran from north to south, still conveying the mineral to the harbours at Charlestown, Limekilns, Inverkeithing and St David's. From 1848 more modern railways entered Dunfermline, at first on a west to east axis, intersecting the mineral lines. In time the latter were converted to make through running on to the main line network possible.\n\nDuring the [[industrial revolution]] and [[victorian period]] industry in Dunfermline was concentrated to the north of the town centre around Pilmuir Street and to the south along sections of the Lynn Burn at Elgin and Bothwell Streets with textiles being particularly important to the town's economy. After the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] traditional industries, particularly linen and coal mining, declined and eventually became obsolete in the town with many factories ceasing production. Manufacturing in the town rejuvenated by the early 1960s when [[Monotype Corporation]] opened a new factory on Halbeath Road.<ref name=\"McEwan p73\">McEwan, Bert ''Dunfermline The Post-War Years'' p.&nbsp;73.</ref> The completion of the Pitreavie Industrial Estate (now known as the Pitreavie Business Park) opened in the mid-1970s, following the arrival of [[Philips]] and the re-location of the offices of the [[Dunfermline Press]].

In this document the fort is called ''Castrum Grisiniana''. In 1238 Gro\u017enjan was the property of Vicardo I. Pietrapalosa. In 1286 Gro\u017enjan fort was lent to the Aquileian patriarch during war with [[Venice]] but changed sides in 1287 and Gro\u017enjan was given to Venice.\n\nVicard's son Pietro inherited Gro\u017enjan after his father's death in 1329, and when he died in 1339 it again became the patriarch's property. The patriarch rented it to a [[Friuli]]an noble family, de Castello. In 1354 Gro\u017enjan's new owner became Volrich, or Ulrich, Reifenberg, who in 1358 sold it to Venice for 4,000 ducats in order to pay his debts. Volrich was a son of Deitalm, a descendant of Aquileian patriarch Volcher, and in 1356, during the war between Venice and [[Hungary]], his army, entrenched in Gro\u017enjan, strongly resisted the Hungarian army. Yet it seems that at the same time Volrich negotiated the surrendering of Gro\u017enjan in Venice.\n\n===Venetian Republic===\nVenice took Gro\u017enjan over in 1358 and ruled until its demise in 1797. In 1359 the [[Umag]] captain [[Pietro Dolfin]] moved to his new residence in Gro\u017enjan, and in 1360 and 1367 he fortified the town walls and renovated the palace.\n\nCaptain's Office moved from Gro\u017enjan to Raspo in 1394, when a central rule was established for the whole area. Since then Gro\u017enjan was governed by Venetian noblemen who were given the title of \"[[Mayor]]\". From the early 16th century Gro\u017enjan's mayors were chosen among [[Koper]] noblemen. In the 15th century judicial duties were performed by the Pietrapelosas, and in 1446 the town walls were fortified in order to protect it from possible Turkish attacks. After the terrible plague in 1630 the Gro\u017enjan area became almost completely deserted. In order to revitalize the area the St. Mark's Republic brought Italian families from [[Veneto]] and [[Friuli]]; these were mostly tradesmen who settled in towns. Settlers were invited by the Venetian Republic to cultivate the abandoned land in some hamlets around Gro\u017enjan. Most of the settlers were Morlaks from Dalmatia, but also Slavic people, Albanians and Greeks, all refugees of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAll settlers in Istria were given free land and were exempt from fiscal duties and work obligations for twenty years; the only condition was to cultivate the land within five years. Economic success of colonization of villages reflected on the towns as well: trade and transportation developed and demographics improved.\n\n===Austrian Empire===\nAfter the fall of Napoleon's Empire in 1813, his Illyrian provinces, including Gro\u017enjan, became part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. In 1816 the Austrian Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] visited Gro\u017enjan on his tour through Istria and met with the local clergy and population.\n\nDuring Austrian rule the Gro\u017enjan area flourished. Building of the [[Parenzana]] railroad in 1902 enhanced development of trade and agriculture. Wine, olive oil, eggs and other produce were sold in [[Koper]] and Trieste. According to the 1910 census, the settlement of Gro\u017enjan had 1,658, and the municipal area 4,028 inhabitants. The town had a doctor, a post office, a school, a lawyer, notary public, oil- processing plant, bakery, groceries and clothing stores, two butchers, several inns and various trade shops (shoemakers, blacksmiths, tailors, carpenters, etc.).\n\n===Kingdom of Italy===\nThe dissolution of the Austrian Empire, the subsequent Italian rule and the Great Depression had its consequences. In the 1920s people started to emigrate, looking for work in [[Trieste]] and overseas.\nDuring the rule of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] Gro\u017enjan attained waterworks, the area was electrified, and the [[Mirna/Quieto (Croatia)|Mirna]] river valley was reclaimed.\n\n===SFR Yugoslavia===\n{{see also|Istrian exodus}}\nAfter the Second World War, Istria was divided into two parts, the Yugoslav one and the [[Free Territory of Trieste]], which was divided into Zone A, controlled by the US Army, and Zone B, controlled by the [[Yugoslav Army]]. Gro\u017enjan become a part of Zone B. On October 5, 1954 the London Memorandum was signed and Zone A was assigned to Italy, and Zone B to the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1975 the [[Treaty of Osimo]] divided the Free Territory of Trieste and Gro\u017enjan became part of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe [[London Memorandum]] provided the population with the option of emigration to Italy. The new Yugoslavia's emergent communist system and its application, along with lingering hostilities between Italians and Yugoslavs (like the murder of priest [[Francesco Bonifacio]]), contributed to a large wave of emigration (part of the [[Istrian exodus]]). By April 1956, 2/3 of the population emigrated from the area to Italy.\n\nIn 1955 Gro\u017enjan lost its municipality status and became part of [[Buje]] municipality. In 1965, when the Town of Arts was founded, some of the housing was given to artists from Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina, and some were assigned to the Cultural Centre of the International Music Youth Federation in 1969. In 1993 Gro\u017enjan got its municipality status again.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2011 census in [[Croatia]], the whole of Gro\u017enjan Municipality has 736 inhabitants, while the settlement of Gro\u017enjan itself has 164 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"/> The ethnic composition of the municipality is 39.40% [[Italians]], 29.62% [[Croats]], 18.21% regionally declared (\"Istrians\"), and 2.17% [[Slovenes]],<ref>{{Croatian Census 2011|E|18}}</ref> which makes Gro\u017enjan the only Croatian municipality with a majority share of ethnic Italians.

In the 1920s people started to emigrate, looking for work in [[Trieste]] and overseas.\nDuring the rule of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] Gro\u017enjan attained waterworks, the area was electrified, and the [[Mirna/Quieto (Croatia)|Mirna]] river valley was reclaimed.\n\n===SFR Yugoslavia===\n{{see also|Istrian exodus}}\nAfter the Second World War, Istria was divided into two parts, the Yugoslav one and the [[Free Territory of Trieste]], which was divided into Zone A, controlled by the US Army, and Zone B, controlled by the [[Yugoslav Army]]. Gro\u017enjan become a part of Zone B. On October 5, 1954 the London Memorandum was signed and Zone A was assigned to Italy, and Zone B to the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1975 the [[Treaty of Osimo]] divided the Free Territory of Trieste and Gro\u017enjan became part of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe [[London Memorandum]] provided the population with the option of emigration to Italy. The new Yugoslavia's emergent communist system and its application, along with lingering hostilities between Italians and Yugoslavs (like the murder of priest [[Francesco Bonifacio]]), contributed to a large wave of emigration (part of the [[Istrian exodus]]). By April 1956, 2/3 of the population emigrated from the area to Italy.\n\nIn 1955 Gro\u017enjan lost its municipality status and became part of [[Buje]] municipality. In 1965, when the Town of Arts was founded, some of the housing was given to artists from Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina, and some were assigned to the Cultural Centre of the International Music Youth Federation in 1969. In 1993 Gro\u017enjan got its municipality status again.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2011 census in [[Croatia]], the whole of Gro\u017enjan Municipality has 736 inhabitants, while the settlement of Gro\u017enjan itself has 164 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"/> The ethnic composition of the municipality is 39.40% [[Italians]], 29.62% [[Croats]], 18.21% regionally declared (\"Istrians\"), and 2.17% [[Slovenes]],<ref>{{Croatian Census 2011|E|18}}</ref> which makes Gro\u017enjan the only Croatian municipality with a majority share of ethnic Italians.
