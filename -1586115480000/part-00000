{"title_page": "History of Louisiana", "text_new": "{{History of Louisiana}}\nThe history of the area that is now the US state of [[Louisiana]] began roughly 10,000 years ago. The first traces of permanent settlement, ushering in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], appear about 5,500 years ago. \n\nThe area formed part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]]. The [[Marksville culture]] emerged about 2,000 years ago out of the earlier [[Tchefuncte site#Tchefuncte culture|Tchefuncte culture]]. It is considered ancestral to the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] and [[Taensa]] peoples. About 1,000 years ago, the [[Mississippian culture]] emerged from the [[Woodland period]]. The emergence of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] coincides with the adoption of [[maize]] agriculture and [[chiefdom]]-level complex social organization beginning in c. 1200 AD. The Mississippian culture mostly disappeared around the 16th century, with the exception of some Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.\n\nEuropean influence began in the 16th century, and ''[[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]]'' (named after [[Louis XIV of France]]) became a colony of the [[Kingdom of France]] in 1682, before [[Louisiana (New Spain)|passing to Spain]] in 1763. It became part of the United States following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] Louisiana was a leading [[slave state]]; in  1860, 47% of the population was enslaved. Louisiana  seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)]] on 26 January 1861. [[New Orleans in the Civil War|New Orleans]], the largest city in the entire [[Southern United States|South]] and strategically important as a port city, was taken by Union troops on 25 April 1862.\n\nDuring the [[Reconstruction Era]], Louisiana was subject to [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[military occupation|occupation]] as part of the [[Fifth Military District]]. In 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchising]] constitution, whose effects were immediate and long-lasting. The disfranchisement of African Americans did not end until the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{further|Pre-Columbian North America}}\n\n===Lithic stage===\n{{further|Lithic stage|Paleo-Indian}}\nThe [[Dalton Tradition]] is a Late [[Paleo-Indian]] and Early Archaic [[projectile point]] tradition, appearing in much of   Southeast North America around 8500\u20137900 BC.\n\n===Archaic period===\n[[File:Watson Brake Aerial Illustration HRoe 2014.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Watson Brake, the oldest mound complex in North America]]\nDuring the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], Louisiana was home to the earliest mound complex in [[North America]] and one of the earliest dated complex constructions in the Americas. The [[Watson Brake]] site is an arrangement of human-made [[mound]]s located in the floodplain of the [[Ouachita River]] near [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] in northern Louisiana.

Walker, \"Earliest Mound Site\"], ''Archaeology Magazine'', Volume 51 Number 1,</ref>\n\nBy 2200, during the Late Archaic period the [[Poverty Point culture]] occupied much of Louisiana and was spread into several surrounding states. Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites, including the [[Jaketown Site]] near [[Belzoni, Mississippi]]. The largest and best-known site is near modern-day [[Epps, Louisiana]] at [[Poverty Point]]. The Poverty Point culture may have hit its peak around 1500, making it the first complex culture, and possibly the first tribal culture, not only in the [[Mississippi Delta]] but in the present-day United States. Its people were in villages that extended for nearly 100 miles across the Mississippi River.<ref>[http://www.deltablues.net/jon.html Jon L.

Archaeologists have traditionally viewed the Late Woodland as a time of cultural decline after the florescence of the Hopewell peoples. Late Woodland sites, with the exception of sites along the Florida Gulf Coast, tend to be small when compared with Middle Woodland sites. Although settlement size was small, there was an increase in the number of Late Woodland sites over Middle Woodland sites, indicating a population increase.

Population increased dramatically, and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity, especially by the end of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of [[chiefdom]] societies are not yet manifested, by 1000 CE the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Coles Creek sites are found in present-day [[Arkansas]], Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Texas. Many Coles Creek sites were erected over earlier Woodland period [[morgue|mortuary]] mounds, leading researchers to speculate that emerging elites were symbolically and physically appropriating dead ancestors to emphasize and project their own authority.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kidder |first= Tristram |editors= R.

In 1542, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|expedition]] skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and [[Tunica people|Tunica]] groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1543. The expedition encountered hostile tribes all along river. Natives followed the boats in large canoes, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days on end as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish, whose crossbows had long ceased working, had no effective offensive weapons on the water and were forced to rely on their remaining armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded. Neither of the explorations made any claims to the territory for Spain.\n\n==French exploration and colonization (1682\u20131763)==\n{{Main|Louisiana (New France)}}\n{{Further|French colonization of the Americas}}\n\nEuropean interest in Louisiana was dormant until the late 17th century, when French expeditions, which had imperial, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast. With its first settlements, France lay claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico through Canada. It was also establishing settlements in Canada, from the Maritimes westward along the [[St. Lawrence River]] and into the region surrounding the [[Great Lakes]].\n[[File:Pierre Le Moyne Iberville.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] \nThe French explorer [[Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] named the region Louisiana in 1682 to honor [[Louis XIV of France|France's King Louis XIV]].

It competed with the Dutch, and later English, across the northern tier for fur trade with the Native Americans. The fur trade also helped cement alliances between Europeans and Native American tribes.\n\nThe settlement of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] (along the Red River in present-day northwest Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent settlement in the territory that then composed the Louisiana colony. The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road (sometimes called El Camino Real, or Kings Highway)\u2014which ended at Nachitoches\u2014and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads. [[Sugar cane]] plantations were developed first. In the nineteenth century, cotton plantations were developed along the river. Over time, planters developed large plantations but also lived in fine homes in a growing town, a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places.\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts. They were concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], in modern-day [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]] and [[Missouri]].\n\nInitially [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], and (briefly) [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served the capital of the colony. In 1722, recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, France made [[New Orleans]] the seat of civilian and military authority. The Illinois Country exported its grain surpluses down the Mississippi to New Orleans, which climate could not support their cultivation. The lower country of Louisiana (modern-day Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana) depended on the Illinois French for survival through much of the eighteenth century.\n\nEuropean settlement in the Louisiana colony was not exclusively French; in the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\n===Africans and early slavery===\nIn 1719, two French ships arrived in New Orleans, the ''[[Duc du Maine (slave ship)|Duc du Maine]]'' and the ''[[Aurore (slave ship)|Aurore]]'', carrying the first African slaves to Louisiana for labor.<ref>Hall, Gwendolyn Midlo, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana'', p61</ref><ref>[http://theusgenweb.org/la/colonial/shipstola.htm theusgenweb.org \"Immigrants to Colonial Louisiana\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131153532/http://theusgenweb.org/la/colonial/shipstola.htm |date=January 31, 2009 }}</ref> From 1718 to 1750, traders transported thousands of captive Africans to Louisiana from the Senegambian coast, the west African region of the interior of modern [[Benin]], and from the coast of modern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]-[[Angola]] border.

This region between the Senegal and [[Gambia]] rivers had peoples who were closely related through history: three of the principal languages, [[Serer language|Sereer]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]] and [[Pulaar language|Pulaar]] were related, and [[Malinke]], spoken by the [[Mande people]] to the east, was \"mutually intelligible\" with them. Midlo-Hall says that this concentration of peoples from one region of Africa strongly shaped Louisiana Creole culture.<ref name=\"hall\">Gwendolyn Midlo Hall,''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'', Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University, 1992, p. 29</ref>\n\nPeter Caron says that the geographic and perhaps linguistic connection among many African captives did not necessarily imply developing a common culture in Louisiana. They likely differed in religions. Some slaves from Senegambia were [[Muslims]] while most followed their traditional spiritual practices. Many were likely captives taken in the Islamic jihads that engulfed the region from [[Futa Djallon]] to [[Futa Toro]] and Futa Bundu (modern Upper [[Niger River]]) in the early 18th century.<ref name=\"caron\"/> The inland territories of the African continent from which slaves were captured, were enormous.

The area around [[New Orleans]] and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], along with the rest of Louisiana, became a possession of Spain after the [[Seven Years' War]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1763.\n\nSpanish rule did not affect the pace of francophone immigration to the territory, which increased due to the English expulsion of the Acadians from Canada. Several thousand French-speaking refugees from [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], Canada) migrated to Louisiana after expulsion by the newly ascendant British, after conflicts in Canada. The first group of around 200 arrived in 1765, led by [[Joseph Broussard]] (called \"Beausoleil\").<ref>[http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm www.carencrohighschool.org \"Broussard named for early settler Valsin Broussard\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521212233/http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm |date=2009-05-21 }}</ref> They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Acadian refugees were welcomed by the Spanish as additions of Catholic population. Their descendants came to be called [[Cajun]]s.\n\nMany Spanish-speaking immigrants arrived such as the Canary Islanders of Spain, which are known as the [[Isle\u00f1os]] and Andalusians from the south of Spain called [[Malague\u00f1os]]. The Isle\u00f1os and Malague\u00f1os immigrated to Louisiana between 1778 and 1783. The Isle\u00f1os settled in southeast Louisiana mainly in St. Bernard Parish, just outside of New Orleans, as well as near the area just below Baton Rouge. The Malague\u00f1os settled mainly around New Iberia, but some spread to other parts of southern Louisiana.\n\nBoth free and enslaved populations increased rapidly during the years of Spanish rule, as new settlers and Creoles imported large numbers of slaves to work on plantations. Although some American settlers brought slaves with them who were native to Virginia or North Carolina, the Pointe Coupee inventories of the late eighteenth century showed that most slaves brought by traders came directly from Africa. In 1763 settlements from New Orleans to Pointe Coupee (north of Baton Rouge) included 3,654 free persons and 4,598 slaves. By the 1800 census, which included West Florida, there were 19,852 free persons and 24,264 slaves in Lower Louisiana. Although the censuses do not always cover the same territory, the slaves became the majority of the population during these years. Records during Spanish rule were not as well documented as with the French slave trade, making it difficult to trace African origins. The volume of slaves imported from Africa resulted in what historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]] called \"the re-Africanization\" of Lower Louisiana, which strongly influenced the culture.<ref>Hall,''Africans in Colonial Louisiana'', p. 279.</ref>\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for some two years. Documents have revealed that he harbored secret ambitions to reconstruct a large colonial empire in [[the Americas]]. This notion faltered, however, after the French attempt to reconquer [[Saint-Domingue]] after its [[Haitian Revolution|revolution]] ended in failure, with the loss of two-thirds of the more than 20,000 troops sent to the island to suppress the revolution. After French withdrawal in 1803, [[Haiti]] declared its independence in 1804 as the second republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\n==Incorporation into the United States and antebellum years (1803\u20131860)==\n{{Main|Louisiana Purchase}} \nAs a result of his setbacks, Napoleon gave up his dreams of American empire and sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the United States. The U.S. divided the land into two territories: the [[Territory of Orleans]], which became the state of Louisiana in 1812, and the [[District of Louisiana]], which consisted of the vast lands not included in the Orleans Territory, extending west of the Mississippi River north to Canada. The [[Florida Parishes]] were annexed from the short-lived and strategically important [[Republic of West Florida]], by proclamation of President [[James Madison]] in 1810.\n\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791-1804) resulted in a major emigration of refugees to Louisiana, where they settled chiefly in New Orleans. The thousands of Haitian immigrants included many [[free people of color]], [[white people|whites]], and enslaved [[Africans]]. Some refugees had earlier gone to [[Cuba]], and came from Cuba in another wave of immigration in 1809. The free people of color added substantially to the [[Creoles of color]] community in New Orleans and white Haitian immigrants added substantially to the [[French Creoles|French Creole]] community of New Orleans. These immigrants enlarged the [[French language|French-speaking]] community.<ref>\"Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries, The Black Republic and Louisiana\", ''In Motion: African American Migration Experience'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Study of Black Culture, 2002, accessed 7 May 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1811, the largest [[slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in American history, the [[1811 German Coast Uprising|German Coast Uprising]], took place in the Orleans Territory. Between [[History of slavery in Louisiana|64 and 500 slaves]] rose up on the \"[[German Coast]],\" forty miles upriver of New Orleans, and marched to within {{convert|20|mi|km}} of the city gates. All of the limited number of U.S. troops were gathered to suppress the revolt, as well as citizen militias.\n\n===State of Louisiana===\n[[Louisiana]] became a [[U.S. state]] on April 30, 1812. The western boundary of Louisiana with Spanish Texas remained in dispute until the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819, which was formally ratified in 1821,<ref>[http://thomaslegioncherokee.tripod.com/adamsonistreatymaptreatyofamitymap.html/ Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]</ref> The area referred to as the [[neutral Ground (Louisiana)|Sabine Free State]] serving as a neutral buffer zone, as well as a haven for criminals. Also called \"No Man's Land,\" this part of central and southwestern Louisiana was settled in part by a [[mixed-race]] people known as [[Redbone (ethnicity)|Redbones]].\n\nWith the growth of settlement in the Midwest (formerly the Northwest Territory) and Deep South during the early decades of the 19th century, trade and shipping increased markedly in New Orleans. Produce and products moved out of the Midwest down the [[Mississippi River]] for shipment overseas, and international ships docked at New Orleans with imports to send into the interior. The [[port]] was crowded with [[steamboat]]s, [[flatboats]], and [[sailing ship]]s, and workers speaking languages from many nations. New Orleans was the major port for the export of cotton and sugar. The city's population grew and the region became quite wealthy. More than the rest of the Deep South, it attracted immigrants for the many jobs in the city. The richest citizens imported fine goods of wine, furnishings, and fabrics.\n\nBy 1840 New Orleans had the biggest [[Slavery in the United States|slave market in the United States]], which contributed greatly to the economy. It had become one of the wealthiest cities and the third-largest city in the nation.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, p.2</ref> The ban on importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market. During these decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved [[African Americans]] underwent [[forced migration]] from the [[Upper South]] to the [[Deep South]], two thirds of them in the slave trade. Others were transported by slaveholders as they moved west for new lands.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=3 In Motion: The African-American Migration Experience- The Domestic Slave Trade, New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Study of Black Culture, 2002], accessed 27 Apr 2008</ref><ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619-1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, pp.96-98</ref>\n\nWith changing agriculture in the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers. Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] destinations at [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].\n\n==Secession and the Civil War (1860\u20131865)==\n{{Main|Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana secession}}\nWith its plantation economy, Louisiana was a state that generated wealth from the labor of and trade in enslaved Africans. It also had one of the largest free black populations in the United States, totaling 18,647 people in 1860. Most of the free blacks (or [[free people of color]], as they were called in the French tradition) lived in the New Orleans region and southern part of the state. More than in other areas of the South, most of the free people of color were of mixed race. Many ''[[free people of color|gens de couleur libre]]'' in New Orleans were middle class and educated; many were property owners. By contrast, according to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, nearly 47% of the state's total population of 708,002.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041019003356/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia], accessed 31 Oct 2007</ref>\n\nConstruction and elaboration of the levee system was critical to the state's ability to cultivate its commodity crops of cotton and sugar cane. Enslaved Africans built the first levees under planter direction. Later levees were expanded, heightened and added to mostly by Irish immigrant laborers, whom contractors hired when doing work for the state. As the 19th century progressed, the state had an interest in ensuring levee construction. By 1860, Louisiana had built {{convert|740|mi|km}} of levees on the Mississippi River and another {{convert|450|mi|km}} of levees on its outlets. These immense earthworks were built mostly by hand. They averaged six feet in height, and up to twenty feet in some areas.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CEEDF153BEF34BC4B52DFB667838F669FDE \"Louisiana: The Levee System of the State\"], ''The New York Times'', 8 October 1874, accessed 13 November 2007</ref>\n\nEnfranchised elite whites' strong economic interest in maintaining the slave system contributed to Louisiana's decision to secede from the Union in 1861. It followed other Southern states in seceding after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as [[President of the United States]]. Louisiana's secession was announced on January 26, 1861, and it became part of the [[Confederate States of America]].\n\nThe state was quickly defeated in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a result of Union strategy to cut the Confederacy in two by seizing the Mississippi. Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862. Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the Federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under Federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives to the [[U.S. Congress]].\n\n==Reconstruction, disenfranchisement, and segregation (1865\u20131929)==\n{{Main|Fifth Military District|Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era}}\nFollowing the Civil War, much of the South, including Louisiana, was placed under the supervision of military governors under northern command. Louisiana was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]]. Under this period of [[Reconstruction Era]], the slaves were freed and males were given suffrage. African Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and people of color who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nIn the 1870s, whites accelerated their insurgency to regain control of political power in the state. The Red River area, where new parishes had been created by the Reconstruction legislature, was an area of conflict. On Easter Sunday 1873, an estimated 85 to more than 100 blacks were killed in the [[Colfax massacre]], as white militias had gathered to challenge Republican officeholders after the disputed gubernatorial election of 1872.\n\n[[paramilitary organizations|Paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], formed in 1874, used violence and outright assassination to turn Republicans out of office, and intimidate African Americans and suppress black voting, control their work, and limit geographic movement in an effort to control labor. Among violent acts attributed to the White League in 1874 was the [[Coushatta massacre]], where they killed six Republican officeholders, including four family members of the local state senator, and twenty freedmen as witnesses.<ref>[http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2004-01/reconstruction.html Danielle Alexander, \"Forty Acres and a Mule: The Ruined Hope of Reconstruction\", ''Humanities'', January/February 2004, Vol.25/No.1.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916095443/http://neh.gov/news/humanities/2004-01/reconstruction.html |date=2008-09-16 }}, accessed 14 Apr 2008</ref>\n\nLater, 5,000 White Leaguers battled 3,500 members of the Metropolitan Police and state militia in New Orleans after demanding the resignation of Governor [[William Pitt Kellogg]].

They imposed institutionalized forms of racial discrimination and also conducted voter intimidation and violence against black Republicans. The rate of lynchings of blacks increased through the century, reaching a peak in the late 1800s, but with lynchings continuing well into the 20th century. Blacks came out in force in the April 1896 elections, in areas where they could freely vote, to support a Republican-Populist fusion ticket that might overturn the conservative Democrats. Blacks were threatened by increasing talk about restricting their vote, and Mississippi had already passed a new constitution in 1890 that disenfranchised most blacks. Racial tensions and violence were high, and there were 21 lynchings of blacks in Louisiana that year, surpassing the total for any state. Returns from Democratic-controlled plantation parishes were doctored, and the Democrats won the race.

The [[lawsuit]], based on restricted seating in interstate passenger trains, was brought from Louisiana with strong support from the Creoles of color community in New Orleans: Plessy was one. Separation through segregation, however, resulted everywhere in lesser services and facilities for blacks.\n\nFrom July 24\u201327, 1900, New Orleans erupted in a [[Robert Charles riots|white race riot]] after Robert Charles, an African-American laborer, fatally shot a white police officer during an altercation. He escaped and during and after the manhunt for him, whites rampaged through the city attacking other blacks and burning down two black schools. A total of 28 people died, including Charles, and more than 50 were wounded. Most of the casualties were black. The riot received national attention and ended only with intervention by state militia.<ref>William Ivy Hair.

As a result, they suffered inadequate funding for schools and services, and lack of attention to their interests and worse in the segregated state. They continued to build their own lives and institutions.\n\nIn 1915, the Supreme Court struck down the [[grandfather clause]] in its ruling in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]''. Although the case originated in Oklahoma, Louisiana and other Southern states had used similar clauses to exempt white voters from literacy tests. State legislators quickly passed new requirements for potential voters to demonstrate \"understanding,\" or reading comprehension, to official registrars. Administered subjectively by whites, in practice the understanding test was used to keep most black voters off the rolls. By 1923, Louisiana established the [[all-white primary]], which effectively shut out the few black voters from the Democratic Party, the only competitive part of elections in the one-party state.<ref>[http://www.naacpldf.org/content/pdf/reauthorization/Louisiana_VRA_Report.pdf Debo P.

They sought skilled jobs in the burgeoning defense industry in California in the 1940s, better education for their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote, as well as an escape from southern violence.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9  \"African American Migration Experience: The Great Migration\", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture], accessed 24 Apr 2008</ref>\n\n==Orphan trains==\nDuring some of this period, Louisiana accepted Catholic orphans in an urban resettlement program organized in New York City. [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] was a destination for at least three of the [[Orphan Train]]s which carried orphan children out of New York from 1854\u20131929. It was the heart of a traditional [[Catholic]] region of [[French people|French]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Acadian]], African and [[French West Indian]] heritage and traditions. Families in Louisiana took in more than 2,000 mostly Catholic orphans to live in rural farming communities. The city of Opelousas is constructing an Orphan Train Museum (second in the nation) in an old train depot located in Le Vieux Village in Opelousas. The first museum dedicated to the Orphan Train children is located in Kansas.\n\n==The Great Depression and World War II (1929\u20131940s)==\nDuring some of the [[Great Depression]], Louisiana was led by Governor [[Huey Long]]. He was elected to office on populist appeal. Though popular for his public works projects, which provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and for his programs in education and increased suffrage for poor whites, Long was criticized for his allegedly demagogic and autocratic style. He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana's state government. Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state. Long's rule ended abruptly with his [[assassination]] in the state capitol in 1935.\n\nMobilization for World War II created defense industry jobs in the state, attracting thousands of rural black and white farmers into the cities to obtain such employment. However, tens of thousands of black workers left the state in the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] for the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] to seek skilled jobs and better pay in the defense industry outside the South, better education for themselves and their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9  \"African American Migration Experience: The Second Great Migration\", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture], accessed 24 Apr 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough Long removed the poll tax associated with voting, the all-white primaries were maintained through 1944, until the Supreme Court struck them down in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]''. Through 1948 black people in Louisiana continued to be essentially disfranchised, with only 1% of those eligible managing to vote.<ref>[http://www.naacpldf.org/content/pdf/reauthorization/Louisiana_VRA_Report.pdf Debo P.

Civil rights organizations in New Orleans and southern parishes, where there had been a long tradition of free people of color before the Civil War, worked hard to register black voters. \n \nIn the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration. Despite opposition by the [[States' Rights Party of Louisiana|States' Rights Party]], downstate black voters began to increase their rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes. Gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20% and more, but it was still only 32% by 1964, when the first civil rights legislation of the era was passed.<ref>[http://www.naacpldf.org/content/pdf/reauthorization/Louisiana_VRA_Report.pdf Debo P.

Because of the Great Migration of blacks to the north and west, and growth of other groups in the state, by 1960 the proportion of African Americans in Louisiana had dropped to 32%. The 1,039,207 black citizens were adversely affected by segregation and efforts at disfranchisement.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed 15 Mar 2008</ref> African Americans continued to suffer disproportionate discriminatory application of the state's voter registration rules. Because of better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, blacks continued to migrate from Louisiana, for a net loss of more than 37,000 people. During the latter period, some people began to migrate to cities of the [[New South]] for opportunities.<ref>[http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2004/05demographics_frey.aspx William H.

This led to securing passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], with President Lyndon Johnson's leadership as well. By 1968 almost 59% of eligible-age African Americans had registered to vote in Louisiana. Contemporary rates for African-American voter registration and turnout in the state are above 70%, demonstrating the value they give it, a higher rate of participation than for African-American voters outside the South.<ref name=\"thernstrom\"/>\n\n==Katrina and its aftermath (2005\u2013present)==\n{{Main|Hurricane Katrina}}\n{{See also|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|Reconstruction of New Orleans}}\nIn August 2005, [[New Orleans]] and many other low-lying parts of the state along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] were hit by the catastrophic [[Hurricane Katrina]]. It caused widespread damage due to breaching of levees and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city. Officials issued warnings to evacuate the city and nearby areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, had stayed behind, some stranded, and suffered through the damage of the widespread flood waters.\n\nCut off in many cases from healthy food, medicine or water, or assembled in public spaces without functioning emergency services, more than 1500 people in New Orleans died in the aftermath. Government at all levels had failed to prepare adequately despite severe hurricane warnings, and emergency responses were slow. The state faced a humanitarian crisis stemming from conditions in many locations and the large tide of evacuating  citizens, especially the city of New Orleans. Today, Louisiana is developing in several new industries including film and technology. New Orleans has recently gained the title of the fastest growing city in the United States and the Hollywood of the South. Louisiana has also been declared one of the happiest state's due to the many festivals and customs of her citizens.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History|North America|United States|France}}\n{{see also|Outline of Louisiana#History of Louisiana}}\n* [[Acadiana]]\n** [[Expulsion of the Acadians]]\n* [[History of the Southern United States]]\n* [[Black Belt in the American South]]\n* [[Deep South]]\n* [[List of Governors of Louisiana]]\n* [[List of Louisiana state historic sites]]\n* [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Louisiana]]\n* [[Timeline of Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Timeline of Baton Rouge]]\n* [[Timeline of New Orleans]]\n* Timeline of Louisiana<ref>{{Cite book |location = NY |publisher=Hastings House |title = Louisiana: a Guide to the State |author = Federal Writers' Project |series=[[American Guide Series]] |date = 1941 |chapter=Chronology |pages=693\u2013703|hdl=2027/uc1.$b727648 |author-link=Federal Writers' Project }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n===Surveys===\n* Allain, Mathe.

The first traces of permanent settlement, ushering in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], appear about 5,500 years ago. \n\nThe area formed part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]]. The [[Marksville culture]] emerged about 2,000 years ago out of the earlier [[Tchefuncte site#Tchefuncte culture|Tchefuncte culture]]. It is considered ancestral to the [[Natchez people|Natchez]] and [[Taensa]] peoples. About 1,000 years ago, the [[Mississippian culture]] emerged from the [[Woodland period]]. The emergence of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] coincides with the adoption of [[maize]] agriculture and [[chiefdom]]-level complex social organization beginning in c. 1200 AD. The Mississippian culture mostly disappeared around the 16th century, with the exception of some Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.\n\nEuropean influence began in the 16th century, and ''[[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]]'' (named after [[Louis XIV of France]]) became a colony of the [[Kingdom of France]] in 1682, before [[Louisiana (New Spain)|passing to Spain]] in 1763. It became part of the United States following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] Louisiana was a leading [[slave state]]; in  1860, 47% of the population was enslaved. Louisiana  seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)]] on 26 January 1861.

In 1542, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|expedition]] skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and [[Tunica people|Tunica]] groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1543. The expedition encountered hostile tribes all along river. Natives followed the boats in large canoes, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days on end as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish, whose crossbows had long ceased working, had no effective offensive weapons on the water and were forced to rely on their remaining armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded. Neither of the explorations made any claims to the territory for Spain.\n\n==French exploration and colonization (1682\u20131763)==\n{{Main|Louisiana (New France)}}\n{{Further|French colonization of the Americas}}\n\nEuropean interest in Louisiana was dormant until the late 17th century, when French expeditions, which had imperial, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast. With its first settlements, France lay claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico through Canada. It was also establishing settlements in Canada, from the Maritimes westward along the [[St. Lawrence River]] and into the region surrounding the [[Great Lakes]].\n[[File:Pierre Le Moyne Iberville.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] \nThe French explorer [[Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] named the region Louisiana in 1682 to honor [[Louis XIV of France|France's King Louis XIV]]. The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], near [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]), was founded in 1699 by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], a French military officer from Canada.\n\nThe [[Louisiana (New France)|French colony of Louisiana]] originally claimed all the land on both sides of the [[Mississippi River]] and north to French territory in Canada around the Great Lakes. A royal ordinance of 1722\u2014following the transfer of the [[Illinois Country]]'s governance from Canada to Louisiana\u2014may have featured the broadest definition of the region: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenies]]<ref name=\"Ekberg-French Roots\">{{cite book|last=Ekberg|first=Carl|title=French Roots in the Illinois Country: The Mississippi Frontier in Colonial Times|date=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago, Ill.|isbn=9780252069246|pages=32\u201333|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NOdf3FRXms0C&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nA generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general [[Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Vaudreuil]] set the northern and eastern bounds of his domain as the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] valley up to the mouth of the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River tributary)|Vermilion River]] (near present-day [[Danville, Illinois]]); from there, northwest to [[Starved Rock State Park|''le Rocher'']]  on the [[Illinois River]], and from there west to the mouth of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] (at present day [[Rock Island, Illinois]]).<ref name=\"Ekberg-French Roots\" /> Thus, [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]] were the limit of Louisiana'a reach; the outposts at [[Ouiatenon]] (on the upper Wabash near present-day [[Lafayette, Indiana]]), [[Chicago]], [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]]s (near present-day [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]) and [[Prairie du Chien]] operated as dependencies of Canada.<ref name=\"Ekberg-French Roots\" />\n\nThis boundary between Canada and Louisiana remained in effect until the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, after which France surrendered its remaining territory east of the Mississippi\u2014except for New Orleans\u2014to Great Britain.

It competed with the Dutch, and later English, across the northern tier for fur trade with the Native Americans. The fur trade also helped cement alliances between Europeans and Native American tribes.\n\nThe settlement of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] (along the Red River in present-day northwest Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent settlement in the territory that then composed the Louisiana colony. The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road (sometimes called El Camino Real, or Kings Highway)\u2014which ended at Nachitoches\u2014and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads. [[Sugar cane]] plantations were developed first. In the nineteenth century, cotton plantations were developed along the river. Over time, planters developed large plantations but also lived in fine homes in a growing town, a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places.\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts. They were concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], in modern-day [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]] and [[Missouri]].\n\nInitially [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], and (briefly) [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served the capital of the colony. In 1722, recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, France made [[New Orleans]] the seat of civilian and military authority. The Illinois Country exported its grain surpluses down the Mississippi to New Orleans, which climate could not support their cultivation. The lower country of Louisiana (modern-day Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana) depended on the Illinois French for survival through much of the eighteenth century.\n\nEuropean settlement in the Louisiana colony was not exclusively French; in the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\n===Africans and early slavery===\nIn 1719, two French ships arrived in New Orleans, the ''[[Duc du Maine (slave ship)|Duc du Maine]]'' and the ''[[Aurore (slave ship)|Aurore]]'', carrying the first African slaves to Louisiana for labor.<ref>Hall, Gwendolyn Midlo, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana'', p61</ref><ref>[http://theusgenweb.org/la/colonial/shipstola.htm theusgenweb.org \"Immigrants to Colonial Louisiana\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131153532/http://theusgenweb.org/la/colonial/shipstola.htm |date=January 31, 2009 }}</ref> From 1718 to 1750, traders transported thousands of captive Africans to Louisiana from the Senegambian coast, the west African region of the interior of modern [[Benin]], and from the coast of modern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]-[[Angola]] border.

They likely differed in religions. Some slaves from Senegambia were [[Muslims]] while most followed their traditional spiritual practices.

The area around [[New Orleans]] and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], along with the rest of Louisiana, became a possession of Spain after the [[Seven Years' War]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1763.\n\nSpanish rule did not affect the pace of francophone immigration to the territory, which increased due to the English expulsion of the Acadians from Canada. Several thousand French-speaking refugees from [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], Canada) migrated to Louisiana after expulsion by the newly ascendant British, after conflicts in Canada. The first group of around 200 arrived in 1765, led by [[Joseph Broussard]] (called \"Beausoleil\").<ref>[http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm www.carencrohighschool.org \"Broussard named for early settler Valsin Broussard\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521212233/http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm |date=2009-05-21 }}</ref> They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Acadian refugees were welcomed by the Spanish as additions of Catholic population. Their descendants came to be called [[Cajun]]s.\n\nMany Spanish-speaking immigrants arrived such as the Canary Islanders of Spain, which are known as the [[Isle\u00f1os]] and Andalusians from the south of Spain called [[Malague\u00f1os]]. The Isle\u00f1os and Malague\u00f1os immigrated to Louisiana between 1778 and 1783. The Isle\u00f1os settled in southeast Louisiana mainly in St. Bernard Parish, just outside of New Orleans, as well as near the area just below Baton Rouge. The Malague\u00f1os settled mainly around New Iberia, but some spread to other parts of southern Louisiana.\n\nBoth free and enslaved populations increased rapidly during the years of Spanish rule, as new settlers and Creoles imported large numbers of slaves to work on plantations. Although some American settlers brought slaves with them who were native to Virginia or North Carolina, the Pointe Coupee inventories of the late eighteenth century showed that most slaves brought by traders came directly from Africa. In 1763 settlements from New Orleans to Pointe Coupee (north of Baton Rouge) included 3,654 free persons and 4,598 slaves. By the 1800 census, which included West Florida, there were 19,852 free persons and 24,264 slaves in Lower Louisiana. Although the censuses do not always cover the same territory, the slaves became the majority of the population during these years. Records during Spanish rule were not as well documented as with the French slave trade, making it difficult to trace African origins. The volume of slaves imported from Africa resulted in what historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]] called \"the re-Africanization\" of Lower Louisiana, which strongly influenced the culture.<ref>Hall,''Africans in Colonial Louisiana'', p. 279.</ref>\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for some two years. Documents have revealed that he harbored secret ambitions to reconstruct a large colonial empire in [[the Americas]]. This notion faltered, however, after the French attempt to reconquer [[Saint-Domingue]] after its [[Haitian Revolution|revolution]] ended in failure, with the loss of two-thirds of the more than 20,000 troops sent to the island to suppress the revolution. After French withdrawal in 1803, [[Haiti]] declared its independence in 1804 as the second republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\n==Incorporation into the United States and antebellum years (1803\u20131860)==\n{{Main|Louisiana Purchase}} \nAs a result of his setbacks, Napoleon gave up his dreams of American empire and sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the United States. The U.S. divided the land into two territories: the [[Territory of Orleans]], which became the state of Louisiana in 1812, and the [[District of Louisiana]], which consisted of the vast lands not included in the Orleans Territory, extending west of the Mississippi River north to Canada. The [[Florida Parishes]] were annexed from the short-lived and strategically important [[Republic of West Florida]], by proclamation of President [[James Madison]] in 1810.\n\nThe [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791-1804) resulted in a major emigration of refugees to Louisiana, where they settled chiefly in New Orleans. The thousands of Haitian immigrants included many [[free people of color]], [[white people|whites]], and enslaved [[Africans]]. Some refugees had earlier gone to [[Cuba]], and came from Cuba in another wave of immigration in 1809. The free people of color added substantially to the [[Creoles of color]] community in New Orleans and white Haitian immigrants added substantially to the [[French Creoles|French Creole]] community of New Orleans. These immigrants enlarged the [[French language|French-speaking]] community.<ref>\"Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries, The Black Republic and Louisiana\", ''In Motion: African American Migration Experience'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Study of Black Culture, 2002, accessed 7 May 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1811, the largest [[slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in American history, the [[1811 German Coast Uprising|German Coast Uprising]], took place in the Orleans Territory. Between [[History of slavery in Louisiana|64 and 500 slaves]] rose up on the \"[[German Coast]],\" forty miles upriver of New Orleans, and marched to within {{convert|20|mi|km}} of the city gates. All of the limited number of U.S. troops were gathered to suppress the revolt, as well as citizen militias.\n\n===State of Louisiana===\n[[Louisiana]] became a [[U.S. state]] on April 30, 1812. The western boundary of Louisiana with Spanish Texas remained in dispute until the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819, which was formally ratified in 1821,<ref>[http://thomaslegioncherokee.tripod.com/adamsonistreatymaptreatyofamitymap.html/ Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]</ref> The area referred to as the [[neutral Ground (Louisiana)|Sabine Free State]] serving as a neutral buffer zone, as well as a haven for criminals. Also called \"No Man's Land,\" this part of central and southwestern Louisiana was settled in part by a [[mixed-race]] people known as [[Redbone (ethnicity)|Redbones]].\n\nWith the growth of settlement in the Midwest (formerly the Northwest Territory) and Deep South during the early decades of the 19th century, trade and shipping increased markedly in New Orleans. Produce and products moved out of the Midwest down the [[Mississippi River]] for shipment overseas, and international ships docked at New Orleans with imports to send into the interior. The [[port]] was crowded with [[steamboat]]s, [[flatboats]], and [[sailing ship]]s, and workers speaking languages from many nations. New Orleans was the major port for the export of cotton and sugar. The city's population grew and the region became quite wealthy. More than the rest of the Deep South, it attracted immigrants for the many jobs in the city. The richest citizens imported fine goods of wine, furnishings, and fabrics.\n\nBy 1840 New Orleans had the biggest [[Slavery in the United States|slave market in the United States]], which contributed greatly to the economy. It had become one of the wealthiest cities and the third-largest city in the nation.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, p.2</ref> The ban on importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market. During these decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved [[African Americans]] underwent [[forced migration]] from the [[Upper South]] to the [[Deep South]], two thirds of them in the slave trade. Others were transported by slaveholders as they moved west for new lands.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=3 In Motion: The African-American Migration Experience- The Domestic Slave Trade, New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Study of Black Culture, 2002], accessed 27 Apr 2008</ref><ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619-1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, pp.96-98</ref>\n\nWith changing agriculture in the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers. Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] destinations at [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].\n\n==Secession and the Civil War (1860\u20131865)==\n{{Main|Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana secession}}\nWith its plantation economy, Louisiana was a state that generated wealth from the labor of and trade in enslaved Africans. It also had one of the largest free black populations in the United States, totaling 18,647 people in 1860. Most of the free blacks (or [[free people of color]], as they were called in the French tradition) lived in the New Orleans region and southern part of the state. More than in other areas of the South, most of the free people of color were of mixed race. Many ''[[free people of color|gens de couleur libre]]'' in New Orleans were middle class and educated; many were property owners. By contrast, according to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, nearly 47% of the state's total population of 708,002.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041019003356/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia], accessed 31 Oct 2007</ref>\n\nConstruction and elaboration of the levee system was critical to the state's ability to cultivate its commodity crops of cotton and sugar cane. Enslaved Africans built the first levees under planter direction. Later levees were expanded, heightened and added to mostly by Irish immigrant laborers, whom contractors hired when doing work for the state. As the 19th century progressed, the state had an interest in ensuring levee construction. By 1860, Louisiana had built {{convert|740|mi|km}} of levees on the Mississippi River and another {{convert|450|mi|km}} of levees on its outlets. These immense earthworks were built mostly by hand. They averaged six feet in height, and up to twenty feet in some areas.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CEEDF153BEF34BC4B52DFB667838F669FDE \"Louisiana: The Levee System of the State\"], ''The New York Times'', 8 October 1874, accessed 13 November 2007</ref>\n\nEnfranchised elite whites' strong economic interest in maintaining the slave system contributed to Louisiana's decision to secede from the Union in 1861. It followed other Southern states in seceding after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as [[President of the United States]]. Louisiana's secession was announced on January 26, 1861, and it became part of the [[Confederate States of America]].\n\nThe state was quickly defeated in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a result of Union strategy to cut the Confederacy in two by seizing the Mississippi. Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862. Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the Federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under Federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives to the [[U.S. Congress]].\n\n==Reconstruction, disenfranchisement, and segregation (1865\u20131929)==\n{{Main|Fifth Military District|Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era}}\nFollowing the Civil War, much of the South, including Louisiana, was placed under the supervision of military governors under northern command. Louisiana was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]]. Under this period of [[Reconstruction Era]], the slaves were freed and males were given suffrage. African Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and people of color who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nIn the 1870s, whites accelerated their insurgency to regain control of political power in the state. The Red River area, where new parishes had been created by the Reconstruction legislature, was an area of conflict. On Easter Sunday 1873, an estimated 85 to more than 100 blacks were killed in the [[Colfax massacre]], as white militias had gathered to challenge Republican officeholders after the disputed gubernatorial election of 1872.\n\n[[paramilitary organizations|Paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], formed in 1874, used violence and outright assassination to turn Republicans out of office, and intimidate African Americans and suppress black voting, control their work, and limit geographic movement in an effort to control labor. Among violent acts attributed to the White League in 1874 was the [[Coushatta massacre]], where they killed six Republican officeholders, including four family members of the local state senator, and twenty freedmen as witnesses.<ref>[http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2004-01/reconstruction.html Danielle Alexander, \"Forty Acres and a Mule: The Ruined Hope of Reconstruction\", ''Humanities'', January/February 2004, Vol.25/No.1.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916095443/http://neh.gov/news/humanities/2004-01/reconstruction.html |date=2008-09-16 }}, accessed 14 Apr 2008</ref>\n\nLater, 5,000 White Leaguers battled 3,500 members of the Metropolitan Police and state militia in New Orleans after demanding the resignation of Governor [[William Pitt Kellogg]]. They hoped to replace him with the Democratic candidate of the disputed 1872 elections, [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]]. The White League briefly took over the statehouse and city hall before Federal troops arrived.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.76-77.</ref> In 1876, the white Democrats regained control of Louisiana.\n\nThrough the 1880s, white Democrats began to reduce voter registration of [[Black people|blacks]] and poor [[White people|whites]] by making registration and elections more complicated. They imposed institutionalized forms of racial discrimination and also conducted voter intimidation and violence against black Republicans. The rate of lynchings of blacks increased through the century, reaching a peak in the late 1800s, but with lynchings continuing well into the 20th century. Blacks came out in force in the April 1896 elections, in areas where they could freely vote, to support a Republican-Populist fusion ticket that might overturn the conservative Democrats. Blacks were threatened by increasing talk about restricting their vote, and Mississippi had already passed a new constitution in 1890 that disenfranchised most blacks. Racial tensions and violence were high, and there were 21 lynchings of blacks in Louisiana that year, surpassing the total for any state. Returns from Democratic-controlled plantation parishes were doctored, and the Democrats won the race. The legislature \"refused to investigate what everyone knew was a stolen election.\"<ref name=\"hair\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=E412rbbxn7YC&pg=PA69&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false  William Ivy Hair, ''Carnival of Fury: Robert Charles and the New Orleans Race Riot of 1900''], LSU Press, 2008, pp. 104-105</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the white Democratic, [[Planter (American South)|planter]]-dominated legislature passed a new [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] constitution, with provisions for voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]], to raise barriers to black voter registration, as Mississippi had successfully done. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

Ferguson]]'' (1896), the Court ruled that \"separate but equal\" facilities were constitutional. The [[lawsuit]], based on restricted seating in interstate passenger trains, was brought from Louisiana with strong support from the Creoles of color community in New Orleans: Plessy was one. Separation through segregation, however, resulted everywhere in lesser services and facilities for blacks.\n\nFrom July 24\u201327, 1900, New Orleans erupted in a [[Robert Charles riots|white race riot]] after Robert Charles, an African-American laborer, fatally shot a white police officer during an altercation. He escaped and during and after the manhunt for him, whites rampaged through the city attacking other blacks and burning down two black schools. A total of 28 people died, including Charles, and more than 50 were wounded. Most of the casualties were black. The riot received national attention and ended only with intervention by state militia.<ref>William Ivy Hair. ''[[Carnival of Fury: Robert Charles and the New Orleans Race Riot of 1900]]'', [[Louisiana State University Press]] (1976) {{ISBN|0-8071-0178-8}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of disfranchisement, African Americans in Louisiana essentially had no representation; as they could not vote, they could not participate in juries or in local, state or federal offices. As a result, they suffered inadequate funding for schools and services, and lack of attention to their interests and worse in the segregated state. They continued to build their own lives and institutions.\n\nIn 1915, the Supreme Court struck down the [[grandfather clause]] in its ruling in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]''. Although the case originated in Oklahoma, Louisiana and other Southern states had used similar clauses to exempt white voters from literacy tests. State legislators quickly passed new requirements for potential voters to demonstrate \"understanding,\" or reading comprehension, to official registrars. Administered subjectively by whites, in practice the understanding test was used to keep most black voters off the rolls. By 1923, Louisiana established the [[all-white primary]], which effectively shut out the few black voters from the Democratic Party, the only competitive part of elections in the one-party state.<ref>[http://www.naacpldf.org/content/pdf/reauthorization/Louisiana_VRA_Report.pdf Debo P.

The [[boll weevil]] infestation and agricultural problems had cost sharecroppers and farmers their jobs, and continuing violence drove out many families. The mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for many farm laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the burgeoning defense industry in California in the 1940s, better education for their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote, as well as an escape from southern violence.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9  \"African American Migration Experience: The Great Migration\", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture], accessed 24 Apr 2008</ref>\n\n==Orphan trains==\nDuring some of this period, Louisiana accepted Catholic orphans in an urban resettlement program organized in New York City. [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] was a destination for at least three of the [[Orphan Train]]s which carried orphan children out of New York from 1854\u20131929. It was the heart of a traditional [[Catholic]] region of [[French people|French]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Acadian]], African and [[French West Indian]] heritage and traditions. Families in Louisiana took in more than 2,000 mostly Catholic orphans to live in rural farming communities. The city of Opelousas is constructing an Orphan Train Museum (second in the nation) in an old train depot located in Le Vieux Village in Opelousas. The first museum dedicated to the Orphan Train children is located in Kansas.\n\n==The Great Depression and World War II (1929\u20131940s)==\nDuring some of the [[Great Depression]], Louisiana was led by Governor [[Huey Long]]. He was elected to office on populist appeal. Though popular for his public works projects, which provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and for his programs in education and increased suffrage for poor whites, Long was criticized for his allegedly demagogic and autocratic style. He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana's state government. Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state. Long's rule ended abruptly with his [[assassination]] in the state capitol in 1935.\n\nMobilization for World War II created defense industry jobs in the state, attracting thousands of rural black and white farmers into the cities to obtain such employment. However, tens of thousands of black workers left the state in the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] for the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] to seek skilled jobs and better pay in the defense industry outside the South, better education for themselves and their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9  \"African American Migration Experience: The Second Great Migration\", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture], accessed 24 Apr 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough Long removed the poll tax associated with voting, the all-white primaries were maintained through 1944, until the Supreme Court struck them down in ''[[Smith v.

Civil rights organizations in New Orleans and southern parishes, where there had been a long tradition of free people of color before the Civil War, worked hard to register black voters. \n \nIn the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration. Despite opposition by the [[States' Rights Party of Louisiana|States' Rights Party]], downstate black voters began to increase their rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes.

Government at all levels had failed to prepare adequately despite severe hurricane warnings, and emergency responses were slow. The state faced a humanitarian crisis stemming from conditions in many locations and the large tide of evacuating  citizens, especially the city of New Orleans. Today, Louisiana is developing in several new industries including film and technology. New Orleans has recently gained the title of the fastest growing city in the United States and the Hollywood of the South.

E-government has enhanced office automation in the public sector, through the utilization of the Internet and wireless technologies to connect telephones, fax machines, and printers. This is especially relevant for those public-sector fields where staff are constantly on the move, such as police officers and project managers.\n\n==History==\n\n===The beginning (1960s\u20131970s)===\nSouth Korea's E-Government project first started as part of the office automation efforts for statistical analysis work in the Economy Planning Board (EPB) with the introduction of computers in 1967. At the time, it was the Committee on Coordination for Development of Computerized Organization established in 1967 under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) that supplied computers to each ministry in the government.\n\nIn a survey conducted a decade later on supply and management of computers in government agencies by MOST in 1977, it was found that computers had greatly contributed to fast and accurate results in simple arithmetic tasks such as payroll and personnel management, calculations for phone bills, grading tests and so on, in central agencies such as the Ministry of Culture and Education, Ministry of Communication and Postal Service, and the National Tax Agency. However, in 1978, the need for informatization rather than simple automation of menial tasks brought about the start of the E-Government initiative aiming to realize a more advanced model of E-Government.\n\nMoves to introduce ICT into government took the form of E-Government projects for building necessary infrastructure to achieve this end, under the \"Five Year Basic Plan on Informatizaton of Public Administration\". These efforts, led by the [[Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs]] (MOGAHA), paved the way for implementation of South Korea's advanced informatization policies in the 1980s. \n\n===Building the infrastructure for E-government (1980s\u20131990s)===\nThe decision to build a \"National Backbone Computer Network\" and subsequent enactments of laws such as the Computer Program Protection Act and Supply and Utilization of Computer Network Act in 1986, and the Software Development Promotion Act in 1987, secured technology and infrastructure vital to realizing e-governance. These efforts led to a concrete plan and project engagements for the \"National Backbone Computer Network\" project that would become the communications and information network for the public sector. Under this plan, five national network projects &ndash; administration, finance, education and research, defense, and security &ndash; were launched.\n\nThis period was also a turning point for the infrastructure of e-governance in Korea. In 1993, a basic plan for building the foundation for the Information Super-Highway was announced, and the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) was launched in 1994. The following year saw the enactment by the National Assembly of the \"Framework on Informatization Promotion Act\", which became the basis for policies on informatization and e-governance. Based on this Act, the \"Informatization Promotion Committee\" was created along with the \"Informatization Promotion Fund,\" to act as the steering head for informatization and E-Government initiatives. This act also provided a firm basis for implementing E-Government initiatives such as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) system. During the latter half of the 90s, the first Informatization Promotion conference was held at the Blue House on October 14, 1996, where President [[Kim Young-sam]]'s ideas on E-Government were announced in the form of a report, \"Informatization Strategy for Strengthening National Competitiveness\". In 1997, an evaluation system for informatization projects was introduced while plans were made for implementation of the second stage of advanced ICT.\n\n===Full-scale implementation of E-Government (2000\u2013Present)===\nWith the inauguration of the [[Kim Dae-jung]] administration in 1998, the official government homepage went online and Internet-based civil services, such as real estate registration, became available. Presidential executive orders for appointing CIOs in the public sector and guidelines for sharing administrative information were established as well. In 1999 a comprehensive E-Government implementation plan was created, while civil services based on integrated civil application information system and comprehensive statistical information system were introduced.\n\n:::<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:About 03 img01.gif|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 27 March 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nBy 2001, halfway into the term of the Kim Dae-jung administration, South Korea passed the first comprehensive legislation on E-Government, the \"Promotion of Digitalization of Administrative Work for E-Government Realization Act\". The SCEG{{clarify|reason=not stated what these initials refer to|date=August 2017}} began work in February of the same year, holding 12 executive and two general meetings where detailed plans for implementation, as well as funding for the 11 newly selected key E-Government projects, listed in (Table 1), were drawn up and reported to the President on 7 May 2001.\n\nWith the inauguration of Participatory Government under President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] from 2002, policies for E-Government became focused on ways to extend informatization. The former PCGI was restructured into PCGID (Presidential Committee on Government Innovation and Decentralization), encompassing E-Government, administrative reform, fiscal and tax reform, and decentralization. From each of the sub-committees in charge of these areas, implementation plans centered on the presidential agenda were announced as Roadmap tasks.\n\nFor e-governance, the \"Participatory Government's Vision and Direction of E-Government\" was announced in May 2003, and the \"E-Government Roadmap\" based on the vision of realizing the \"World's Best Open E-Government\" was released in August of the same year. The roadmap is divided into four areas, 10 agenda, 31 tasks and managed in terms of 45 detailed subtasks. It sets specific targets, including: to increase online public services to 85%; to attain a top 10 ranking in the world for business support competitiveness; to reduce visits for civil service applicants to 3 per year; and to raise the utilization rate of E-Government programs to 60%.\n\n==Development and implementation issues==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Government of South Korea]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://korea.go.kr/eng/_eng_about/about_04.jsp Korea e-Government Portal site]\n* [http://www.egov.go.kr/eng/Webzine/webzine.jsp Korea e-Government Webzine]\n* [http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/19156/koreas-government-integrated-data-center-sets-new-benchmark-e-government-it Korea's Government Integrated Data Center Sets a New Benchmark on e-Government IT]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:E-Government In South Korea}}\n[[Category:E-government by country|South Korea]]\n[[Category:Government of South Korea]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in South Korea]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=July 2008}}\n{{update|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[E-government]] began in South Korea in the 1980s when the [[Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs]] (MOGAHA) began to implement [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] within government, based on the \"National Backbone Computer Network\" consisting of five national networks.

In 1999 a comprehensive E-Government implementation plan was created, while civil services based on integrated civil application information system and comprehensive statistical information system were introduced.\n\n:::<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:About 03 img01.gif|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 27 March 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nBy 2001, halfway into the term of the Kim Dae-jung administration, South Korea passed the first comprehensive legislation on E-Government, the \"Promotion of Digitalization of Administrative Work for E-Government Realization Act\". The SCEG{{clarify|reason=not stated what these initials refer to|date=August 2017}} began work in February of the same year, holding 12 executive and two general meetings where detailed plans for implementation, as well as funding for the 11 newly selected key E-Government projects, listed in (Table 1), were drawn up and reported to the President on 7 May 2001.\n\nWith the inauguration of Participatory Government under President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] from 2002, policies for E-Government became focused on ways to extend informatization. The former PCGI was restructured into PCGID (Presidential Committee on Government Innovation and Decentralization), encompassing E-Government, administrative reform, fiscal and tax reform, and decentralization. From each of the sub-committees in charge of these areas, implementation plans centered on the presidential agenda were announced as Roadmap tasks.\n\nFor e-governance, the \"Participatory Government's Vision and Direction of E-Government\" was announced in May 2003, and the \"E-Government Roadmap\" based on the vision of realizing the \"World's Best Open E-Government\" was released in August of the same year. The roadmap is divided into four areas, 10 agenda, 31 tasks and managed in terms of 45 detailed subtasks. It sets specific targets, including: to increase online public services to 85%; to attain a top 10 ranking in the world for business support competitiveness; to reduce visits for civil service applicants to 3 per year; and to raise the utilization rate of E-Government programs to 60%.\n\n==Development and implementation issues==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Government of South Korea]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://korea.go.kr/eng/_eng_about/about_04.jsp Korea e-Government Portal site]\n* [http://www.egov.go.kr/eng/Webzine/webzine.jsp Korea e-Government Webzine]\n* [http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/19156/koreas-government-integrated-data-center-sets-new-benchmark-e-government-it Korea's Government Integrated Data Center Sets a New Benchmark on e-Government IT]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:E-Government In South Korea}}\n[[Category:E-government by country|South Korea]]\n[[Category:Government of South Korea]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in South Korea]]\n", "name_user": "Strickesel", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed a typo found byWikipedia:Typo Team/moss\u2013 you can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government_in_South_Korea"}

Such a control may be a [[rocker switch]], a [[toggle switch]], a [[Push-button]], a virtual switch on a display screen, or some other user interface. The internationally standardized symbols are intended to communicate their function in a language-independent manner.\n\n==Description==\nThe well-known on/off power symbol was the result of the logical evolution in user interface design. Originally, most early power controls consisted of switches that were toggled between two states demarcated by the words ''On'' and ''Off''. As technology became more ubiquitous, these English words were replaced with the universal symbols line \"|\" and circle \"o\" (typically without [[serifs]]) to bypass language barriers. This standard is still used on toggle power switches.\n\nThe symbol for the standby button was created by superimposing the symbols \"|\" and \"o\"; however, it is commonly interpreted as the numerals \"0\" and \"1\". Yet the IEC holds these symbols as a graphical representation of a line and a circle.{{cn|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Standby symbol ambiguity==\nBecause the exact meaning of the standby symbol on a given device may be unclear until the control is tried, it has been proposed that a separate sleep symbol, a [[waning]] moon, instead be used to indicate a low power state. Proponents include the [[California Energy Commission]] and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]. Under this proposal, the older standby symbol would be redefined as a generic \"power\" indication, in cases where the difference between it and the other power symbols would not present a safety concern. This alternative symbolism was published as IEEE standard 1621 on December 8, 2004.<ref name=\"berkreport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/reports/2003-10-31_500-03-012F_APP.PDF | author=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] | publisher=[[California Energy Commission]] |title=The Power Control User Interface Standard (consultant report) | format=PDF | date=December 2002 | accessdate=2007-04-26}} {{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"calidraft\">{{cite web | url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/reports/2003-10-31_500-03-076F.PDF | author=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] | publisher=[[California Energy Commission]] | title=Draft Standard for User Interface Elements in Power Control of Electronic Devices Employed in Office/Consumer Environments (consultant report) | format=PDF | date=December 2002 | accessdate=2007-04-26}} {{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aip.org/dbis/HFES/stories/15017.html | title=Save Energy at Your PC; Energy Scientists Propose Color-Coding Standard for PC Sleep Mode | publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] | date=2005-06-01 | accessdate=2007-04-26 |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706040225/http://www.aip.org/dbis/HFES/stories/15017.html | archivedate=2007-07-06}}</ref><ref name=\"ieee1621\">{{cite web | url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/Controls/1621/1621index.html | title=Power Management Controls - User Interface Standard - IEEE 1621 | publisher=[[IEEE]] | accessdate=2007-04-26 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421055438/http://eetd.lbl.gov/Controls/1621/1621index.html | archivedate=2007-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Standards==\nUniversal power symbols are described in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] 60417 standard, ''Graphical symbols for use on equipment'', appearing in the 1973 edition of the document (as IEC 417) and informally used earlier.<ref name=\"berkreport\" />\n{|\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| [[File:IEC5007 On Symbol.svg|center|18x18px]] || IEC 60417-5007<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iec:grs:60417:5007|title=IEC 60417 - 5007, \"ON\" (power)|publisher=IEC}}</ref>, the power-on symbol (line), appearing on a [[Button (control)|button]] or one end of a [[toggle switch]] indicates that the control places the equipment into a fully powered state.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| [[File:IEC5008 Off Symbol.svg|center|18x18px]] || IEC 60417-5008<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iec:grs:60417:5008|title=IEC 60417 - 5008, \"OFF\" (power)|publisher=IEC}}</ref>, the power-off symbol (circle) on a button or toggle, indicates that using the control will disconnect power to the device.\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| [[File:IEC5009 Standby Symbol.svg|center|18x18px]] || IEC 60417-5009<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iec:grs:60417:5009|title=IEC 60417 - 5009, Stand-by|publisher=IEC}}</ref>, the standby symbol (line partially within a broken circle), indicates a [[sleep mode]] or low power state.

Located on the [[Gulf of Kutch]], it is one of major ports on the west coast. Kandla was constructed in the 1950s as the chief seaport serving western India, due to the [[partition of India]] leaving the port of [[Karachi]] in [[Pakistan]].\n\nThe Port of Kandla is located on the Gulf of Kutch on the northwestern coast of India, some 256 nautical miles southeast of the [[Port of Karachi]] in Pakistan and over 430 nautical miles north-northwest of the [[Port of Mumbai]] (Bombay). It is the largest port of India by volume of cargo handled. Kandla Port Trust, India's busiest major port in recent years, is gearing to add substantial cargo handling capacity with private sector participation. The west coast port handled 72,225 million tonnes of cargo in 2008-09, over 11% more than the 64,920 million tonnes handled in 2007-08.\n\nEven as much of this growth has come from handling of crude oil imports, mainly for Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery in Gujarat, the port is also taking measures to boost non-POL cargo. Last fiscal, POL traffic accounted for 63 per cent of the total cargo handled at Kandla Port, as against 59% in 2007-08.\n\nThe port will soon begin selecting developers for four clean cargo berths that together aim to handle 8 million tonnes of cargo. The four berths will be supported by a 14 m draft capable of handling 75,000 dwt vessels. The port has already received encouraging response from prospective bidders, for the project that is estimated to cost nearly 5,000 million INR.\n\nIn 2015-16 the port handled 106 million tonne of cargo.<ref>http://www.livemint.com/Companies/Py2u1PGwFybmKKx9DT8JzN/Kandla-Port-Trusts-Ravi-Parmar-We-aims-to-reach-185-MTPA-c.html</ref>\n\nKandla Port was renamed as Maharao Khengarji Port under the India port act of 1908.\n\n==Traffic handled==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Mln tons\n!Change* % \n!Share** %\n|-\n|2003\u201304\n|41,523\n|2.2\n|12.0\n|-\n|2004\u201305\n|41,551\n|0.1\n|10.8\n|-\n|2005\u201306\n|45,907\n|10.5\n|10.8\n|-\n|2006\u201307\n|52,982\n|15.4\n|11.4\n|-\n|2007\u201308\n|64,920\n|22.5\n|12.5\n|-\n|2008\u201309\n|72,225\n|11.3\n|13.6\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> With respect to previous year.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> In all India traffic at major ports.\n\nKPT is also moving towards building dedicated container handling capacity. In 2008-09 container trade was 138,000 containers, down from 165,000 containers in 2007-08.\n\nThere is currently one container terminal that is under private operatorship of ABG Heavy Industries Ltd. The port trust's plans include setting up a dedicated container terminal with two berths (No.11 and No.12 of the port) on BOT basis. The 3,300 million INR project is expected to annually handle 0.6 million containers.\n\nThe clean cargo and container berths form only a small part of KPT's expansion plans through private enterprise. Other aspects include berthing facilities off Tekra (Tuna) that is expected to boost cargo by 12 million tonnes, an offshore liquid terminal, bunkering facilities and a ship repair and building yard.\n\nKandla Port has shown buoyant growth in cargo handling in the recent past. In 2008-09, its total traffic grew by 13.6% to reach an all-time high of 72,225 million tonnes. The port's share in traffic handled by all major ports has risen steadily over the years, peaking at 13.6 per % last year (see table). Earlier projections made by the port indicate an annual capacity handling target of 100 million tonnes per annum by 2012.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate here is \"desert.\" There is virtually no rainfall in a year in Kandla. This climate is considered to be BWh according to the Koppen-Geiger classification of climates. The average annual temperature is 24.8\u00b0C. The average rainfall is 379 mm.\n\n==Economy==\nThe Port of Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ) was the first special economic zone to be established in India and in Asia.<ref name=\"Soundarapandian2011\">{{cite book|last=Soundarapandian|first=Mookkiah|title=Development of Special Economic Zones in India: Policies and issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwtCrB5a2c8C&pg=PA194|accessdate=4 June 2012|year=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-8069-772-2|page=194}}</ref> Established in 1965,<ref name=\"C2010\">{{cite book|author=Francis C|title=International Business : Text And Cases, 5/e PB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFSKTmPrYbkC&pg=PA703|accessdate=4 June 2012|year=2010|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Located on the [[Gulf of Kutch]], it is one of major ports on the west coast. Kandla was constructed in the 1950s as the chief seaport serving western India, after the [[partition of India]] and [[Pakistan]] left the port of [[Karachi]] in Pakistan.\n\nThe Port of Kandla is located on the Gulf of Kutch on the northwestern coast of India, some 256 nautical miles southeast of the [[Port of Karachi]] in Pakistan and over 430 nautical miles north-northwest of the [[Port of Mumbai]] (Bombay). It is the largest port of India by volume of cargo handled. Kandla Port Trust, India's busiest major port in recent years, is gearing to add substantial cargo handling capacity with private sector participation. The west coast port handled 72,225 million tonnes of cargo in 2008-09, over 11% more than the 64,920 million tonnes handled in 2007-08.\n\nEven as much of this growth has come from handling of crude oil imports, mainly for Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery in Gujarat, the port is also taking measures to boost non-POL cargo. Last fiscal, POL traffic accounted for 63 per cent of the total cargo handled at Kandla Port, as against 59% in 2007-08.\n\nThe port will soon begin selecting developers for four clean cargo berths that together aim to handle 8 million tonnes of cargo. The four berths will be supported by a 14 m draft capable of handling 75,000 dwt vessels. The port has already received encouraging response from prospective bidders, for the project that is estimated to cost nearly 5,000 million INR.\n\nIn 2015-16 the port handled 106 million tonne of cargo.<ref>http://www.livemint.com/Companies/Py2u1PGwFybmKKx9DT8JzN/Kandla-Port-Trusts-Ravi-Parmar-We-aims-to-reach-185-MTPA-c.html</ref>\n\nKandla Port was renamed as Maharao Khengarji Port under the India port act of 1908.\n\n==Traffic handled==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Mln tons\n!Change* % \n!Share** %\n|-\n|2003\u201304\n|41,523\n|2.2\n|12.0\n|-\n|2004\u201305\n|41,551\n|0.1\n|10.8\n|-\n|2005\u201306\n|45,907\n|10.5\n|10.8\n|-\n|2006\u201307\n|52,982\n|15.4\n|11.4\n|-\n|2007\u201308\n|64,920\n|22.5\n|12.5\n|-\n|2008\u201309\n|72,225\n|11.3\n|13.6\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> With respect to previous year.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> In all India traffic at major ports.\n\nKPT is also moving towards building dedicated container handling capacity. In 2008-09 container trade was 138,000 containers, down from 165,000 containers in 2007-08.\n\nThere is currently one container terminal that is under private operatorship of ABG Heavy Industries Ltd. The port trust's plans include setting up a dedicated container terminal with two berths (No.11 and No.12 of the port) on BOT basis. The 3,300 million INR project is expected to annually handle 0.6 million containers.\n\nThe clean cargo and container berths form only a small part of KPT's expansion plans through private enterprise. Other aspects include berthing facilities off Tekra (Tuna) that is expected to boost cargo by 12 million tonnes, an offshore liquid terminal, bunkering facilities and a ship repair and building yard.\n\nKandla Port has shown buoyant growth in cargo handling in the recent past. In 2008-09, its total traffic grew by 13.6% to reach an all-time high of 72,225 million tonnes. The port's share in traffic handled by all major ports has risen steadily over the years, peaking at 13.6 per % last year (see table). Earlier projections made by the port indicate an annual capacity handling target of 100 million tonnes per annum by 2012.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate here is \"desert.\" There is virtually no rainfall in a year in Kandla. This climate is considered to be BWh according to the Koppen-Geiger classification of climates. The average annual temperature is 24.8\u00b0C. The average rainfall is 379 mm.\n\n==Economy==\nThe Port of Kandla Special Economic Zone (KASEZ) was the first special economic zone to be established in India and in Asia.<ref name=\"Soundarapandian2011\">{{cite book|last=Soundarapandian|first=Mookkiah|title=Development of Special Economic Zones in India: Policies and issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwtCrB5a2c8C&pg=PA194|accessdate=4 June 2012|year=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-8069-772-2|page=194}}</ref> Established in 1965,<ref name=\"C2010\">{{cite book|author=Francis C|title=International Business : Text And Cases, 5/e PB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFSKTmPrYbkC&pg=PA703|accessdate=4 June 2012|year=2010|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

This company's routes inside Edinburgh itself were taken over by [[Edinburgh and District Tramways]] in 1893, while the Leith Burgh Corporation took over those routes within their own boundaries in 1904, running them as [[Leith Corporation Tramways]], after which Edinburgh Street Tramways ceased to trade.\n\nIn 1888, [[Edinburgh Northern Tramways]] began operating cable-hauled tram services from [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] to Ferry Road and [[Comely Bank]]. They were also taken over by Edinburgh and District Tramways in 1897.\n\nThe Corporation of the City of Edinburgh (then the formal name for the city council) introduced a motor bus service in July 1914.<ref>Gavin Booth, Edinburgh's Trams & Buses, 1988, page 64, {{ISBN|0-946265-09-7}}</ref> This service was short lived, with the buses being requisitioned for wartime use, and services did not resume until after the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\">Bus Results in the Scottish Capital ''[[Commercial Motor']]'' 3 August  1926  page 14</ref> In December 1916 the Corporation published a report they commissioned from various tram experts. Having only been tasked to report on the future of cable-trams regarding potential expansion and alternative methods of traction, it commented on the potential of the motor bus to substitute trams. It concluded that the introduction of motor buses instead of tramcars would incur a total loss of \u00a339,425 per annum, and that the bus only had a future serving thinly populated districts, or acting as a feeder for trams. The report was heavily criticised by ''Commercial Motor'' magazine as being wholly one-sided, with fallacious assumptions, seeming to them a deliberate attempt to discredit buses. It recommended the Corporation procure independent advice from people with experience running motor buses at the necessary scale.<ref>Motorbus or Tramcar?

In some cases, the buses were so unpopular they were removed and replaced with electric trams. On the other hand, they were showing their usefulness in other areas. Because of this, by 1925 the department's manager was of the opinion that trams should still be used for the heaviest and busiest loadings, but never for new routes with a frequency less than 6 per hour, while buses would still remain employed on routes either complementing or connecting existing tram lines, or on routes that were unsuitable or uneconomic for trams. He nonetheless advocated for the bus as a necessary part of new housing developments such as [[Lochend, Edinburgh|Lochend]], where revenue growth over time was evident, and considered the vibration issue solved since the introduction of pneumatic tyres. He concluded that as both modes are so inter-dependent, they \"should be considered as a single transport organization for the city.\"<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/><ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1925, page 10\">Bus Results in Scottish Cities ''Commercial Motor'', 4 August 1925, page 10</ref>\n\nThe effect of motor bus tyres (which at that time were solid rubber) on the road surface was an early issue. Reimbursement for repairing the damage to the roads in Holyrood Park by the tour charabancs was laid down as a condition of operating there in the 1921 season.<ref name=\"Passenger Travel 1921, page 16\"/> In 1921 the city deputy surveyor found that no undue damage was being done by buses on tarmacked roads, with some not damaged at all, but water-bound [[macadam]] surfaces and sett paving without concrete underlay were vulnerable to rutting and other issues.<ref>The Wheels of Industry ''Commercial Motor'', 9 August 1921, page 4</ref> On one hilly route, after residents complained of vibration caused by the buses, various remedies were deployed - limiting the speed to 8&nbsp;mph, descent in gear, and the fitting of super-cushion tyres (Dunlop and North British).<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/> The 8&nbsp;mph limit was also necessary in granite paved sections of running, which were extensive in Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/>\n\nThis record of the early introduction of buses was hailed by ''Commercial Motor'' magazine in the mid 1920s as a sign of the Edinburgh authority's foresight in recognising \"the part which the motorbus was destined ultimately to play in the solution of the passenger transport problems of the age\", contrasting it with Glasgow Corporation which, despite having twice the population of Edinburgh, had only begun bus services in December 1924.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nIn the early 1920s, batch by batch reliability of buses could be unpredictable and often required running adjustments. The combination the build quality of early AEC vehicles and the professionalism of the Corporation's garage staff produced in-service mileage figures and engine life that ''Commercial Motor'' praised as \"exceptionally good\".<ref>Remarkable Motorbus Performances, ''Commercial Motor'', 30 October 1923, page 30</ref> Measures taken included mandatory defect reporting by drivers at the end of each shift, a preventative maintenance regime which called for inspection/repairs every 10 days (with the spare parts inventory including complete engines) with close monitoring of parts usage, and an overhaul/repaint cycle of every 18 months.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/> In order to improve the system, the Corporation was performing its own modifications to buses as early as 1921, experimenting with a new type of rear shock absorber using rubber pads on one of its Leylands, and widening the doors of buses during overhaul.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/> Examples of in-house innovation included portable bus electrics testing apparatus in 1932<ref>Wheels of Industry, ''Commercial Motor'', 26 April 1932, page 48</ref> and the establishment in the 1940s of a soap making plant inside the Laundry at Shrubhill Depot, in response to the need for a soap which didn't damage vehicle paintwork.<ref>Edinburgh Transport Has Its Own Laundry, ''Commercial Motor'', 6 September 1940, page 41</ref>\n\nAll horse and cable operated trams on the network were fully electrified by 1923.\n\nBy 1926 there were 12 regular bus routes, with a total mileage of 43, and working to Bath Street, Blackford, Bonnington, [[Cameron Toll]], Colinton, [[Cramond]], Easter Road, Juniper Green, [[Hillend, Edinburgh|Hillend]], [[Lochend, Edinburgh|Lochend]], [[Newcraighall]], [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] and Surgeon's Hall. The average number of passengers per mile was just under 9, with the average fare at around 1.6d.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nGood loadings on an experimental night service run from October 1925 to April 1926 saw the Corporation make plans to introduce regular winter night services.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s, the average speed of the bus fleet approached, and then surpassed, that of the trams. The change occurred some time in the window of the 1927/8 financial year - in the space of this period the average speed of the buses went from 8.25&nbsp;mph to 9.5&nbsp;mph, in contrast to the trams, which went from 8.5&nbsp;mph to 8.76&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1928, page 53\">Bus Results in Scottish Cities, ''Commercial Motor'', 7 August 1928, page 53</ref>\n\nIn 1928, given the increasing importance of buses, the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department was renamed the '''Edinburgh Corporation Transport''' Department.<ref>G. Booth, ibid, page 64</ref> In 1928, the Corporation introduced measures to ensure bus operators could not undercut trams, by insisting one-way fares on routes duplicating trams must be at least 1d (one penny) higher, and that other forms of ticketing must not be cheaper than equivalent tram travel.<ref>Wheels of Industry, ''Commercial Motor'', 12 June 1928, page 42</ref>\n\nEdinburgh was one of many corporation transport systems in the UK that began employing female conductors in large numbers during the Second World War.\n\nEdinburgh Corporation's tram network was abandoned between 1950 and 1956.\n\n== 1956 to present ==\nIn 1975, under the local government reorganisation which followed the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], ownership of Edinburgh Corporation Transport passed to the Lothian Regional Council's Department of Public Transport.  The operation was duly renamed '''Lothian Regional Transport'''.\n\nThe Transport Act 1985 deregulated bus services in Great Britain and required that municipal bus operations be run as commercial companies rather than as public service departments. Therefore, on 26 October 1986 the operation became Lothian Region Transport [[Public Limited Company|plc]], better known by its initials 'LRT', a company wholly owned by Lothian Regional Council.\n\nIn May 1989, a private company called [[Guide Friday]] set up an open top bus tour called the Edinburgh Tour. Later that year, LRT set up the Classic Tour using open top Leyland Atlanteans as a direct competitor - Edinburgh Corporation and LRT had operated tour services since the early 1920s, but with weaker branding.

Although the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government had sought to have the company [[Privatization|privatised]], this was resisted by local politicians and ownership the company passed to the new City of Edinburgh Council and the three neighbouring councils. The LRT identity remained until January 2000, when the company was renamed '''Lothian Buses plc''', the LRT logo changing to 'Lothian'.\n\nIn July 2000 Lothian Buses became one of the first bus tour operators to join the [[City Sightseeing]] franchise model, re-branding and upgrading the Classic Tour. Lothian purchased the first purpose built low flow open top buses, painted in City Sightseeing livery. The Classic tour was completely transformed into the City Sightseeing red scheme by May 2001.<ref>[http://www.city-sightseeing.com/News/news_17a City Sightseeing news page]</ref> In 2002, Lothian Buses acquired both Guide Friday, its biggest rival in the tour bus market, and the smaller Mac Tours, which had been founded in 1998 and operated vintage bus tours - this Left Lothian Buses as the only tour bus operator in the city. All three tour brands were consolidated as one subsidiary company; Edinburgh Bus Tours. In 2004, Edinburgh Bus Tours introduced the Majestic Tour, visiting the Royal Yacht Britannia and the Botanic Gardens.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About - Edinburgh Bus Tours|url = http://edinburghtour.com/about|website = edinburghtour.com|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}</ref>\n\nPost [[Bus deregulation|deregulation]] Lothian experienced alternating periods of competition and stability with the other major bus operator in Edinburgh, First in Edinburgh (First), and its previous incarnations [[Scottish Motor Traction|SMT]]/[[Eastern Scottish]]. During this time Lothian acquired a number of smaller Edinburgh operators. In 2001, Lothian alleged anti-competitive practises by First.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1565988.stm Bus wars to be investigated]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1492381.stm Bus firm hits back over 'fares war']</ref> This claim was later rejected.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2004/75-04 |title=OFT judgement |access-date=23 March 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805131853/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2004/75-04 |archive-date=5 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other operators such as [[Stagecoach Fife]], E&M Horsburgh, [[Perryman's Buses]] and MacEwans also operate stage services into Edinburgh, but as these tend to be long-distance routes or subsidised local services they are not generally a competitive threat. One lasting effect of competition was the extension of Lothian services beyond the City of Edinburgh boundaries, in response to incursion by Eastern into Edinburgh city services. However, Lothian subsequently withdrew from [[West Lothian]], leaving this area to First, with the sole exception of a night bus service between Longstone depot and Livingston which is operated primarily for the use of staff who live in West Lothian. Although this service is not widely advertised to the public, they are permitted to use this service. Withdrawal from this area and not the others that Lothian extended into has caused concern amongst residents who had experienced low fares and greater choice of services during the period when Lothian and Eastern Scottish were competing. During the time in which it was not served by Lothian Buses, West Lothian Council remained a shareholder of the company.<ref>[http://business.scotsman.com/firstgroup/Bus-travellers-fury-over-fares.2816363.jp Bus travellers' fury over fares increase]</ref> In 2014, Lothian Buses began to again serve to the historical area of the county after taking over a contracted service to [[South Queensferry]] and [[Kirkliston]].<ref>[http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/transport/south-queensferry-back-on-bus-map-after-30-years-1-3426393 South Queensferry back on bus map after 30 years] The Scotsman</ref> However, these towns are located in the City of Edinburgh council area under present-day municipal boundaries.\n\nIn 2005 the drivers of Lothian Buses plc staged official and wildcat strikes over pay.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Bus-drivers-accept-pay-offer.2653481.jp Bus drivers accept pay offer]</ref> In some cases this resulted in passengers being abandoned as buses were taken out of service by drivers.<ref>[http://business.scotsman.com/lothianbusesstrike/New-talks-bid-after-drivers.2648719.jp New talks bid after drivers' wildcat strike]</ref>\n\nLothian Buses set up a subsidiary company in December 2006 to operate a taxibus service to and from [[Edinburgh Airport]], and so fill a gap in the airport transport market between conventional bus services and taxis.<ref name=\"Edinburgh Shuttle\">{{cite web|url=http://airportexpress.org/|title=Edinburgh Shuttle|publisher=Lothian Buses|accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.airport-parking-discounts.co.uk/Edinburgh-airport-shuttle.htm Edinburgh airport shuttle to be launched - airport parking news]</ref>  In September 2007 it was investigated by the Traffic Commissioner for selling illegal fares.<ref>[http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Shuttle-faces-probe-into-illegal.3326603.jp Shuttle faces probe into \"illegal fares\" - Edinburgh Evening News] 13 September 2007</ref> Despite this it was extended to serve Leith, Ocean Terminal and Cameron Toll from October 2007.

Double-deckers have long made up the majority of the fleet. Buses have generally been purchased new - relatively few secondhand vehicles have been operated.\n\nFrom 1969 until 2001 Lothian favoured dual-door vehicles, which minimised loading times by allowing simultaneous boarding (at the front door) and alighting (from the rear door). With the exception of those bought for the Airlink service, all new double-deckers bought in this period had dual-doors, as did the Leyland National and Lynx saloons.  However, in 2002 a decision was made to purchase single door vehicles only, apparently to stop fraudulent lawsuits claiming that the driver closed the rear doors while they were exiting.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Bus-chiefs-slam-the-door.2637295.jp Scotsman.com News - Bus chiefs slam the door on fraudsters and fare dodgers] from Edinburgh Evening News 22 June 2005</ref> There is an ongoing programme of converting earlier low-floor dual-door vehicles to single door.\n\n===Early Vehicles===\nIn 1919, Edinburgh Corporation bought their first Leyland charabancs, for tour services.<ref name=\"lothianbuses.com\"/> The Corporation was authorised to purchase 30 more buses in early 1920 for \u00a325,000.<ref>A Scottish Development, ''Commercial Motor'', 3 February 1920, page 7</ref> By the middle of 1920, the Corporation had around 60 Leyland buses in service or on order. Of these orders, a 33-seat 'Edinburgh type' single-decker bus body with rear door and a separate smoking compartment at the back, mounted on a 4-ton 36-40&nbsp;hp Model O chassis with worm drive axle, was exhibited at trade shows during the year, the Darlington Royal Show in June and the Commercial Motor Show at Kensington Olympia in October.<ref>The Darlington Royal Show, ''Commercial Motor'', 22 June 1920, page 23</ref><ref>Further Models for Olympia, ''Commercial Motor'', 5 October 1920, page 10</ref> This body type, in which the driver also had his own compartment, was already reportedly well-known and popular by 1921.<ref name=\"Passenger Travel 1921, page 16\"/> One reason for the complete enclosure of the driver was to increase protection against the weather, which in Edinburgh could be considerably cold.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nSome of the earlier rear entrance buses had narrow doors, which slowed down boarding/alighting. As a result, these were widened during overhaul. By early 1922, two Edinburgh type buses were in service with a centre door layout, i.e. between the axles. Featuring a wide door with a central hand rail, and signage directing passengers to board on the right of it and alight on the left, early indications were that this not only speeded up boarding/alighting, it increased the space available for standees.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nBy 1925, the Edinburgh type had further evolved to feature two doors, front and rear, albeit reduced to 31 seats. It was also now being fitted to 45&nbsp;hp AEC chassis.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/>\n\nThe early Edinburgh type buses required a driver and conductor to operate, but on lesser used routes, one-man-operation was also employed - for a 10 percent increase in wages the rear door would be closed and the driver would collect fares on boarding via the front.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/>\n\nThe early AEC and Leyland buses were reportedly up to the challenging task of route service in Edinburgh, which, due to its hilly terrain, was hard on engines, gears and brakes. To save on clutches, the AECs came with ratchet sprags fitted to the rear wheels (initially wire controlled, later modified to rod-control), with drivers instructed to deploy them at the bottom of hills.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nBecause the charabanc motor coaches were not in use in the winter months, some would be re-fitted with single-deck bus bodies and put into route service, while some of the remaining charabancs would be used in route service in case of extreme need. During the tram electrification programme, some were refitted with truck bodies to assist the works.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nThe first double-decker buses (open top, rear staircase layout) arrived in 1922.<ref name=\"Lothian Buses Timeline\"/>\n\nAlthough growing in size both before and after, for the period of May 1925 to May 1926 the fleet size was static at a total of 88 buses in regular use, as follows:<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/><ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1925, page 10\"/>\n\n* 71 single-deckers of the 31-seat Edinburgh body type (41 Leylands, 40 AECs)\n* 2 double-deckers (54 seaters)\n* 15 charabancs (nine 27-seaters, six 32-seaters)\n\nDuring 1924 nearly half the fleet were converted to use pneumatic tyres (Dunlop & Michelin) instead of the earlier solid rubber or later Supercushion designs; by 1925 the Corporation had already determined based on both direct (price, life) and indirect (vibration damage, fuel consumption) cost comparisons, as well as the increased passenger comfort, to use them on the entire fleet.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/><ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1925, page 10\"/> The issue of vibration was particularly serious in Edinburgh to the prevalence of granite paved streets.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/> Conversion presented difficulty on the rear twin tyres on the AEC Model 507 double-deckers due to the maximum legal width (7' 6\"), but this was overcome with in-house modifications.<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 86\">Edinburgh and its bus services, ''Commercial Motor'', 24 May 1927, page 86</ref>\n\nIn 1926 the Corporation had four 52 seat double-deckers on order from AEC.<ref>Recent AEC Orders, ''Commercial Motor'', 30 March  1926, page 6</ref>\n\nTo further solve the problem of lost time loading/unloading, by 1927 the corporation was stipulating two door bus bodies with wider doors, allowing simultaneous boarding and alighting - in through the rear (being at least 32' wide), and out through the front (28').<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 86\"/>\n\nThe presence of low bridges on almost all of the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. A batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the requirement for comfortably seating 39. A 61-80&nbsp;hp six-cylinder engine powered single tyres on both rear axle, with air pressure braking applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A smoking area was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, upholstered in green leather, with generous leg room.<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 86\"/><ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 58\">Six-wheeled buses for municipal use, ''Commercial Motor'', 23 August 1927, page 58</ref> Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single-deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.<ref>More Buses for Important Scottish Municipalities, ''Commercial Motor'', 1 November  1927, page 45</ref>\n\nHaving recognised the advantages of operating modern buses, by 1928 the Corporation was already practicing the art of fleet replacement - with new deliveries displacing older buses which would then be disposed of.<ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1928, page 53\"/>\n\n===1930s===\nBy May 1930 the fleet totalled 130 buses and coaches, the most recent arrivals being 14 AEC Reliance 95&nbsp;hp 32 seater single decker buses of the \"most modern\" design. Dual-doored, the front was Simplex pneumatically controlled. The interior featured oak panelling throughout, Induroleum floor covering, chrome fittings, a Holt patent heater, and the bucket type leather upholstered seats. There was still a rear smoker's compartment, now just seating 10.<ref>Bus Results in the Scottish Capital, ''Commercial Motor'', 30 July 1929, page 59</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the Corporation began trials to determine the fuel efficiency gains in using tar-oil mixed with petrol as a fuel, on petrol engined buses. This involved modifying a number of Leyland and AECs to use the Solex bi-fuel system, while a bespoke method was used on Daimlers.<ref>Tar-oil Experiments In Edinburgh, ''Commercial Motor'', 6 January 1933, page 45</ref>\n\nBy May 1934, Daimlers made up nearly half the fleet, which now totalled 152 buses and coaches.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1934, page 58\">Operating Aspects Of Passenger Transport, ''Commercial Motor'', 27 July 1934, page 58</ref>\n\n===Double Deckers===\nIn the period immediately following the Second World War, the [[Guy Arab]] and [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] CV-series were favoured, with a smaller number of [[AEC Regent III]]. Between 1952 and 1966 some 452 [[Leyland Titan (front engined double-decker)|Leyland Titan PD2 and PD3]] were delivered (notably including 300 PD2s with [[Metro-Cammell|MCCW]] Orion bodies in 1954-56 for tram replacement). With the move to rear-engined double-deckers, 588 [[Leyland Atlantean]] with [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders|Alexander]] bodies joined the fleet between 1965 and 1981.\n\nWith the demise of the Atlantean, the standard bus was the [[Leyland Olympian]] double decker with [[Eastern Coach Works]] or Alexander RH-type bodies (296 between 1982 and 1993). After the purchase of Leyland Bus by Volvo, Lothian remained loyal to the [[Volvo Olympian]] chassis, taking 134 with Alexander RH and Royale type bodies between 1994 and 1997. These were the last step-entrance buses purchased. 95 years of continuous Leyland operation with Lothian and its predecessors ended on 14 March 2009 with the withdrawal of the last Leyland Olympians.\n\nSubsequently, low floor double-deckers have been specified. Initially the [[Dennis Trident 2]] was favoured, with 197 being purchased between 1999 and 2004, of which first five had [[Alexander ALX400]] bodies and the remainder  [[Plaxton President]] bodywork (including four built new as open-toppers). Six [[Volvo B7TL]] with Plaxton President bodies were purchased for comparison in 2000, along with a similar bus which had started life as a manufacturer's demonstrator.  Subsequently, most new vehicles have been Volvos with [[Wrightbus]] bodywork, comprising 125 Volvo B7TL/[[Wright Eclipse Gemini]] (2005\u201307), 100 [[Volvo B9TL]]/Wright Eclipse Gemini (2007\u201309), 135 Volvo B9TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 (2009\u201311), 25 [[Volvo B5TL]]/Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 (2014), 40 [[Volvo B5LH]]/Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 hybrids (2015\u201317) and 132 Volvo B5TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 (2015\u201318), including 30 built as open toppers and 8 delivered new to the East Coast Buses unit.\n\nIn addition to the Volvos, a [[Scania OmniDekka]] demonstrator was delivered in 2004 for long term evaluation, and although it was subsequently returned to the manufacturer it did lead to the purchase of 15 [[Scania OmniCity]] in 2006\u201307. Two of these were later converted to open toppers for the East Coast Buses unit.  Another non-standard batch of buses are 15 [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400|Alexander Dennis Enviro400H]] hybrids delivered in 2011, although these have since been converted to full diesel operation.\n\nSecondhand double deckers were purchased in 2018\u201319 to allow expansion of the Lothian Country operation and to accelerate replacement of the last of the Tridents and Scanias.  These include 4 B5LH Gemini 3 from Bullock of Cheadle, and at least 64 (as of April 2019) B9TL Gemini 2 from various London fleets.  All of these are readily distinguishable from their \"native\" contemporaries by virtue of having a shorter wheelbase.\n\nThe newest double deckers in the fleet (as of early 2019) are 42 [[Volvo B8L|Volvo B8L(T)]] [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400|Alexander Dennis Enviro400 XLB]] tri-axle double deckers delivered in early 2019.\n\n===Single Deckers===\nPost-war single-deckers comprised small batches of [[Guy Arab]], Daimler CV-series, [[Crossley Motors|Crossley]] SD42, [[Bristol Commercial Vehicles|Bristol]] L-type, [[Leyland Royal Tiger PSU|Leyland Royal Tiger]] and [[Leyland-MCW Olympic|Olympic]], and [[Albion Aberdonian]]. In 1959\u201360, some 100 [[Leyland Tiger Cub]]s with [[Metro Cammell Weymann|Weymann]] bodies were purchased to replace the assorted front engined single-deckers. In 1961 a solitary [[Leyland Leopard]] was delivered. This was number 101 (registered YSG101), which was notable as a very early example (in the UK) of a 36' long bus, for carrying the second ever example of Alexander's long-running [[Alexander Y Type|Y-type]] body, and for being completed to an experimental standee layout with three sets of doors.\n\nIn 1966 the removal of disused railway bridges on Easter Road enabled the busy Leith circular services to be converted to double-deck operation. Many of the Tiger Cubs were sold to [[Ulsterbus]], and the single-deck fleet declined markedly. No more large single-deckers were purchased until 1975, when twelve more Y-type Leopards (to a more conventional specification) were purchased, and ten 1974 [[Bedford Y series|Bedford YRTs]] with similar bodies to coach specification were downgraded to service buses after only 1 season. Twenty dual-door [[Leyland National]]s arrived in 1982\u201385, followed by 12 dual-door [[Leyland Lynx]] in 1991. Later, some reconditioned secondhand Leyland Nationals were purchased for use on tendered services.\n\nSince the move to low-floor buses the number of single deckers in the fleet has increased. After operating a [[Volvo B10L]] demonstrator on long-term loan, 91 Dennis/[[Plaxton Pointer|Plaxton Super Pointer]] [[Dennis Dart|Dart]] were purchased in 2000\u20132003. Subsequently, Volvos were adopted as standard, with 66 new [[Volvo B7RLE]]/[[Wright Eclipse|Wright Eclipse Urban]] (2004\u201308), 2 similar secondhand vehicles purchased from Whitelaw of Stonehouse in 2011, 24 new Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse 2 (2009\u201313), and 50 [[Volvo B5LH]] 7900H hybrids in 2013\u201314.  These deliveries allowed the withdrawal of the Super Pointer Darts, since which time the single deck fleet has been 100% Volvo in its composition.\n\nThe need for additional single deckers for the East Coast Buses subsidiary led to the purchase of another 7 secondhand Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse Urban from [[Arriva Southern Counties]] in 2016, followed by 15 new [[Volvo B8RLE]]/Wright Eclipse 3 in 2017.\n\n===Midibuses===\n[[Minibuses]] and short [[wheelbase]] [[midibus]]es have not been used in large numbers by Lothian, although some midibuses had previously been used on less busy routes. Ten Seddon Pennine IV-236 were acquired in 1973. These were replaced by 18 Leyland Cubs with [[Duple Dominant]] bodies in 1981, which in turn gave way to 12 9m [[Dennis Dart]]s with [[Alexander Dash]] bodies in 1992. When the Darts were delivered they were the only non-Leyland vehicles in the fleet.  In 2001 five of these Darts were sold to Yorkshire Traction.  The ones that remained were gradually cascaded to the Mac Tours subsidiary until their replacement by six [[Optare Solo SR]]s in 2008.  The Solos were in turn replaced by six [[Wright StreetAir|Wright StreetAir EV DF]] electric buses in 2017.\n\n===Coaches===\nUntil the early 2000s, Lothian and its predecessors operated a small coach fleet. Until 1976 most coaches were lightweight types (mainly [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedfords]]), but subsequently 10 [[Leyland Leopard]], 14 [[Leyland Tiger]] and 7 [[Dennis Javelin]] were purchased up to 1999. An oddity (in that it was an import in what was at the time a 100% British fleet) was a [[Toyota Coaster]] minicoach, new in 1993. The coach operation was closed down in order to concentrate on stage services and the open top sightseeing tours.\n\nIn 2018 Lothian returned to the coach business with the launch of the Lothian Motor Coaches unit.  The initial fleet comprised five new [[Volvo B11R|Volvo B11R(T)]] [[Plaxton Panther|Plaxton Panther 3]], three secondhand [[Volvo B12B|Volvo B12B(T)]] [[Van Hool]] Acron T8 and one secondhand [[Volvo B12M]] [[Plaxton Paragon]].  Subsequent additions have been two new [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] minicoaches and a batch of secondhand [[Volvo B9R]] [[Caetano Levante]].\n\nExpansion of the Lothian Country operations in West Lothian in 2019 saw the purchase of 8 new [[Volvo B8R]] [[Plaxton Leopard]] interurban coaches for express services.\n\n==Main fleet liveries & route branding==\n[[File:Lothian Buses 833 G833GSX.jpg|thumb|right|A now-withdrawn [[Leyland Olympian]] in traditional madder and white livery in 2006]]\nTraditionally, Edinburgh Corporation, Lothian Regional Transport and Lothian Buses had a livery of [[Rose madder|madder]] (a dark red) and cream (white), with matching madder leatherette seating.\n\nIn the 1920s the livery, as seen on the Hall bodied Karrier Type WL6/1 six-wheelers on delivery, was maroon, with a cream band under the windows, with white window surrounds and a black roof. The fleetname was 'Corporation Motors', applied on the cream band.<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 58\"/>\n\nSome coach-seated Leyland Olympian / Alexander RH-types and Volvo Olympian / Alexander Royales had been painted in the same scheme, but with red in place of the madder. These vehicles are not branded for, but were typically found only on, routes 15/15A.\n\nWhile Lothian had traditionally maintained a uniform livery for all buses, deliveries of low floor vehicles has seen a new standard livery introduced. Low floor vehicles have also seen route branding come to be increasingly used by Lothian. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Edinburgh and the Lothians.\n\nIn 1999\u20132000, a new \"harlequin\" livery was introduced for all new vehicle deliveries, comprising all-over white, with madder lower skirting with a thin red separating stripe and a red front-panel. Gold and madder overlapping diamonds were added to the rear quarters and the rear of the vehicle. The red front serves to distinguish approaching Lothian vehicles from the all-over white of [[First Scotland East|First in Edinburgh]]. The livery was simplified in 2002 with the diamonds originating from a different position and no longer overlapping each other. This new livery was intended to highlight the low floor accessible nature of these buses and also benefits from being more durable than the madder paint through the life of the bus. The harlequin livery was not retrospectively applied to older vehicles in the fleet, with the Alexander Royale bodied Olympians the last vehicles to be delivered in the traditional madder and white scheme and when these vehicles were withdrawn in 2009 this livery left the Lothian fleet also.\n\nHowever it was announced in March 2010 that the traditional Madder Rose and White Livery was to be reintroduced across the 600 strong fleet.<ref>[http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/new_transit/news/?ID=21921 Lothian Buses introduces traditional look for new livery | TXNews | Transport News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The vehicles will be repainted as part of their ongoing maintenance, so the old \"harlequin\" livery will continue to be a common sight on Edinburgh's streets.\n\nOriginally, twelve buses had been branded for route 35 but in November 2007 a similar number of buses, ten ex-Airlink and two from the 2004 delivery of Tridents, were branded for the 35.  This featured a purple circle with the name \"''Airport-Holyrood-Government Link''\" and a route description on the sides above the purple circle. Certain single deckers have extra branding promoting the Nightbus network.\n\nFrom time to time, some buses will have wraparound advertising applied, either to the whole bus, an entire side or the entire rear of the bus. Ridacards are advertised on the entire side of older Olympians.\n\nPreviously, services 22 and 30 were branded but with the 22 converted to double-deck operation on 18 January 2009, this service lost the branding. The 30 also lost its branding, as the Dennis Darts used on it were replaced by cascaded Volvo B7RLE's from the 22 service.\n\n==Finances==\nThe first route (1919) initially generated and average revenue of \u00a335 a day. This had risen to \u00a3150 on this one route by 1921, thanks to increasing the frequency and length.

This company's routes inside Edinburgh itself were taken over by [[Edinburgh and District Tramways]] in 1893, while the Leith Burgh Corporation took over those routes within their own boundaries in 1904, running them as [[Leith Corporation Tramways]], after which Edinburgh Street Tramways ceased to trade.\n\nIn 1888, [[Edinburgh Northern Tramways]] began operating cable-hauled tram services from [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] to Ferry Road and [[Comely Bank]]. They were also taken over by Edinburgh and District Tramways in 1897.\n\nThe Corporation of the City of Edinburgh (then the formal name for the city council) introduced a motor bus service in July 1914.<ref>Gavin Booth, Edinburgh's Trams & Buses, 1988, page 64, {{ISBN|0-946265-09-7}}</ref> This service was short lived, with the buses being requisitioned for wartime use, and services did not resume until after the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\">Bus Results in the Scottish Capital ''[[Commercial Motor']]'' 3 August  1926  page 14</ref> In December 1916 the Corporation published a report they commissioned from various tram experts. Having only been tasked to report on the future of cable-trams regarding potential expansion and alternative methods of traction, it commented on the potential of the motor bus to substitute trams. It concluded that the introduction of motor buses instead of tramcars would incur a total loss of \u00a339,425 per annum, and that the bus only had a future serving thinly populated districts, or acting as a feeder for trams. The report was heavily criticised by ''Commercial Motor'' magazine as being wholly one-sided, with fallacious assumptions, seeming to them a deliberate attempt to discredit buses. It recommended the Corporation procure independent advice from people with experience running motor buses at the necessary scale.<ref>Motorbus or Tramcar?

In some cases, the buses were so unpopular they were removed and replaced with electric trams. On the other hand, they were showing their usefulness in other areas. Because of this, by 1925 the department's manager was of the opinion that trams should still be used for the heaviest and busiest loadings, but never for new routes with a frequency less than 6 per hour, while buses would still remain employed on routes either complementing or connecting existing tram lines, or on routes that were unsuitable or uneconomic for trams. He nonetheless advocated for the bus as a necessary part of new housing developments such as [[Lochend, Edinburgh|Lochend]], where revenue growth over time was evident, and considered the vibration issue solved since the introduction of pneumatic tyres. He concluded that as both modes are so inter-dependent, they \"should be considered as a single transport organization for the city.\"<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/><ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1925, page 10\">Bus Results in Scottish Cities ''Commercial Motor'', 4 August 1925, page 10</ref>\n\nThe effect of motor bus tyres (which at that time were solid rubber) on the road surface was an early issue. Reimbursement for repairing the damage to the roads in Holyrood Park by the tour charabancs was laid down as a condition of operating there in the 1921 season.<ref name=\"Passenger Travel 1921, page 16\"/> In 1921 the city deputy surveyor found that no undue damage was being done by buses on tarmacked roads, with some not damaged at all, but water-bound [[macadam]] surfaces and sett paving without concrete underlay were vulnerable to rutting and other issues.<ref>The Wheels of Industry ''Commercial Motor'', 9 August 1921, page 4</ref> On one hilly route, after residents complained of vibration caused by the buses, various remedies were deployed - limiting the speed to 8&nbsp;mph, descent in gear, and the fitting of super-cushion tyres (Dunlop and North British).<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/> The 8&nbsp;mph limit was also necessary in granite paved sections of running, which were extensive in Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/>\n\nThis record of the early introduction of buses was hailed by ''Commercial Motor'' magazine in the mid 1920s as a sign of the Edinburgh authority's foresight in recognising \"the part which the motorbus was destined ultimately to play in the solution of the passenger transport problems of the age\", contrasting it with Glasgow Corporation which, despite having twice the population of Edinburgh, had only begun bus services in December 1924.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nIn the early 1920s, batch by batch reliability of buses could be unpredictable and often required running adjustments. The combination the build quality of early AEC vehicles and the professionalism of the Corporation's garage staff produced in-service mileage figures and engine life that ''Commercial Motor'' praised as \"exceptionally good\".<ref>Remarkable Motorbus Performances, ''Commercial Motor'', 30 October 1923, page 30</ref> Measures taken included mandatory defect reporting by drivers at the end of each shift, a preventative maintenance regime which called for inspection/repairs every 10 days (with the spare parts inventory including complete engines) with close monitoring of parts usage, and an overhaul/repaint cycle of every 18 months.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/> In order to improve the system, the Corporation was performing its own modifications to buses as early as 1921, experimenting with a new type of rear shock absorber using rubber pads on one of its Leylands, and widening the doors of buses during overhaul.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/> Examples of in-house innovation included portable bus electrics testing apparatus in 1932<ref>Wheels of Industry, ''Commercial Motor'', 26 April 1932, page 48</ref> and the establishment in the 1940s of a soap making plant inside the Laundry at Shrubhill Depot, in response to the need for a soap which didn't damage vehicle paintwork.<ref>Edinburgh Transport Has Its Own Laundry, ''Commercial Motor'', 6 September 1940, page 41</ref>\n\nAll horse and cable operated trams on the network were fully electrified by 1923.\n\nBy 1926 there were 12 regular bus routes, with a total mileage of 43, and working to Bath Street, Blackford, Bonnington, [[Cameron Toll]], Colinton, [[Cramond]], Easter Road, Juniper Green, [[Hillend, Edinburgh|Hillend]], [[Lochend, Edinburgh|Lochend]], [[Newcraighall]], [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] and Surgeon's Hall. The average number of passengers per mile was just under 9, with the average fare at around 1.6d.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nGood loadings on an experimental night service run from October 1925 to April 1926 saw the Corporation make plans to introduce regular winter night services.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s, the average speed of the bus fleet approached, and then surpassed, that of the trams. The change occurred some time in the window of the 1927/8 financial year - in the space of this period the average speed of the buses went from 8.25&nbsp;mph to 9.5&nbsp;mph, in contrast to the trams, which went from 8.5&nbsp;mph to 8.76&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1928, page 53\">Bus Results in Scottish Cities, ''Commercial Motor'', 7 August 1928, page 53</ref>\n\nIn 1928, given the increasing importance of buses, the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department was renamed the '''Edinburgh Corporation Transport''' Department.<ref>G. Booth, ibid, page 64</ref> In 1928, the Corporation introduced measures to ensure bus operators could not undercut trams, by insisting one-way fares on routes duplicating trams must be at least 1d (one penny) higher, and that other forms of ticketing must not be cheaper than equivalent tram travel.<ref>Wheels of Industry, ''Commercial Motor'', 12 June 1928, page 42</ref>\n\nEdinburgh was one of many corporation transport systems in the UK that began employing female conductors in large numbers during the Second World War.\n\nEdinburgh Corporation's tram network was abandoned between 1950 and 1956.\n\n== 1956 to present ==\nIn 1975, under the local government reorganisation which followed the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], ownership of Edinburgh Corporation Transport passed to the Lothian Regional Council's Department of Public Transport.  The operation was duly renamed '''Lothian Regional Transport'''.\n\nThe Transport Act 1985 deregulated bus services in Great Britain and required that municipal bus operations be run as commercial companies rather than as public service departments. Therefore, on 26 October 1986 the operation became Lothian Region Transport [[Public Limited Company|plc]], better known by its initials 'LRT', a company wholly owned by Lothian Regional Council.\n\nIn May 1989, a private company called [[Guide Friday]] set up an open top bus tour called the Edinburgh Tour. Later that year, LRT set up the Classic Tour using open top Leyland Atlanteans as a direct competitor - Edinburgh Corporation and LRT had operated tour services since the early 1920s, but with weaker branding. The Classic Tour buses wore a blue and white livery, each carrying a name e.g.''Scottish Star'', ''Lothian Star'' and ''Highland Star''.<ref>[http://lothianbuses.fotopic.net/c1167578.html Fotopic collection of the Edinburgh Classic Tour fleet]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://opentopbus.fotopic.net/c833568.html Fotopic collection of the Edinburgh Classic Tour fleet]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 1996 Lothian Regional Council was abolished. Although the then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government had sought to have the company [[Privatization|privatised]], this was resisted by local politicians and ownership the company passed to the new City of Edinburgh Council and the three neighbouring councils. The LRT identity remained until January 2000, when the company was renamed '''Lothian Buses plc''', the LRT logo changing to 'Lothian'.\n\nIn July 2000 Lothian Buses became one of the first bus tour operators to join the [[City Sightseeing]] franchise model, re-branding and upgrading the Classic Tour. Lothian purchased the first purpose built low flow open top buses, painted in City Sightseeing livery. The Classic tour was completely transformed into the City Sightseeing red scheme by May 2001.<ref>[http://www.city-sightseeing.com/News/news_17a City Sightseeing news page]</ref> In 2002, Lothian Buses acquired both Guide Friday, its biggest rival in the tour bus market, and the smaller Mac Tours, which had been founded in 1998 and operated vintage bus tours - this Left Lothian Buses as the only tour bus operator in the city. All three tour brands were consolidated as one subsidiary company; Edinburgh Bus Tours. In 2004, Edinburgh Bus Tours introduced the Majestic Tour, visiting the Royal Yacht Britannia and the Botanic Gardens.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About - Edinburgh Bus Tours|url = http://edinburghtour.com/about|website = edinburghtour.com|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}</ref>\n\nPost [[Bus deregulation|deregulation]] Lothian experienced alternating periods of competition and stability with the other major bus operator in Edinburgh, First in Edinburgh (First), and its previous incarnations [[Scottish Motor Traction|SMT]]/[[Eastern Scottish]]. During this time Lothian acquired a number of smaller Edinburgh operators. In 2001, Lothian alleged anti-competitive practises by First.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1565988.stm Bus wars to be investigated]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1492381.stm Bus firm hits back over 'fares war']</ref> This claim was later rejected.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2004/75-04 |title=OFT judgement |access-date=23 March 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805131853/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2004/75-04 |archive-date=5 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other operators such as [[Stagecoach Fife]], E&M Horsburgh, [[Perryman's Buses]] and MacEwans also operate stage services into Edinburgh, but as these tend to be long-distance routes or subsidised local services they are not generally a competitive threat. One lasting effect of competition was the extension of Lothian services beyond the City of Edinburgh boundaries, in response to incursion by Eastern into Edinburgh city services. However, Lothian subsequently withdrew from [[West Lothian]], leaving this area to First, with the sole exception of a night bus service between Longstone depot and Livingston which is operated primarily for the use of staff who live in West Lothian. Although this service is not widely advertised to the public, they are permitted to use this service. Withdrawal from this area and not the others that Lothian extended into has caused concern amongst residents who had experienced low fares and greater choice of services during the period when Lothian and Eastern Scottish were competing. During the time in which it was not served by Lothian Buses, West Lothian Council remained a shareholder of the company.<ref>[http://business.scotsman.com/firstgroup/Bus-travellers-fury-over-fares.2816363.jp Bus travellers' fury over fares increase]</ref> In 2014, Lothian Buses began to again serve to the historical area of the county after taking over a contracted service to [[South Queensferry]] and [[Kirkliston]].<ref>[http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/transport/south-queensferry-back-on-bus-map-after-30-years-1-3426393 South Queensferry back on bus map after 30 years] The Scotsman</ref> However, these towns are located in the City of Edinburgh council area under present-day municipal boundaries.\n\nIn 2005 the drivers of Lothian Buses plc staged official and wildcat strikes over pay.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Bus-drivers-accept-pay-offer.2653481.jp Bus drivers accept pay offer]</ref> In some cases this resulted in passengers being abandoned as buses were taken out of service by drivers.<ref>[http://business.scotsman.com/lothianbusesstrike/New-talks-bid-after-drivers.2648719.jp New talks bid after drivers' wildcat strike]</ref>\n\nLothian Buses set up a subsidiary company in December 2006 to operate a taxibus service to and from [[Edinburgh Airport]], and so fill a gap in the airport transport market between conventional bus services and taxis.<ref name=\"Edinburgh Shuttle\">{{cite web|url=http://airportexpress.org/|title=Edinburgh Shuttle|publisher=Lothian Buses|accessdate=23 March 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.airport-parking-discounts.co.uk/Edinburgh-airport-shuttle.htm Edinburgh airport shuttle to be launched - airport parking news]</ref>  In September 2007 it was investigated by the Traffic Commissioner for selling illegal fares.<ref>[http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Shuttle-faces-probe-into-illegal.3326603.jp Shuttle faces probe into \"illegal fares\" - Edinburgh Evening News] 13 September 2007</ref> Despite this it was extended to serve Leith, Ocean Terminal and Cameron Toll from October 2007.

Double-deckers have long made up the majority of the fleet. Buses have generally been purchased new - relatively few secondhand vehicles have been operated.\n\nFrom 1969 until 2001 Lothian favoured dual-door vehicles, which minimised loading times by allowing simultaneous boarding (at the front door) and alighting (from the rear door). With the exception of those bought for the Airlink service, all new double-deckers bought in this period had dual-doors, as did the Leyland National and Lynx saloons.  However, in 2002 a decision was made to purchase single door vehicles only, apparently to stop fraudulent lawsuits claiming that the driver closed the rear doors while they were exiting.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Bus-chiefs-slam-the-door.2637295.jp Scotsman.com News - Bus chiefs slam the door on fraudsters and fare dodgers] from Edinburgh Evening News 22 June 2005</ref> There is an ongoing programme of converting earlier low-floor dual-door vehicles to single door.\n\n===Early Vehicles===\nIn 1919, Edinburgh Corporation bought their first Leyland charabancs, for tour services.<ref name=\"lothianbuses.com\"/> The Corporation was authorised to purchase 30 more buses in early 1920 for \u00a325,000.<ref>A Scottish Development, ''Commercial Motor'', 3 February 1920, page 7</ref> By the middle of 1920, the Corporation had around 60 Leyland buses in service or on order. Of these orders, a 33-seat 'Edinburgh type' single-decker bus body with rear door and a separate smoking compartment at the back, mounted on a 4-ton 36-40&nbsp;hp Model O chassis with worm drive axle, was exhibited at trade shows during the year, the Darlington Royal Show in June and the Commercial Motor Show at Kensington Olympia in October.<ref>The Darlington Royal Show, ''Commercial Motor'', 22 June 1920, page 23</ref><ref>Further Models for Olympia, ''Commercial Motor'', 5 October 1920, page 10</ref> This body type, in which the driver also had his own compartment, was already reportedly well-known and popular by 1921.<ref name=\"Passenger Travel 1921, page 16\"/> One reason for the complete enclosure of the driver was to increase protection against the weather, which in Edinburgh could be considerably cold.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nSome of the earlier rear entrance buses had narrow doors, which slowed down boarding/alighting. As a result, these were widened during overhaul. By early 1922, two Edinburgh type buses were in service with a centre door layout, i.e. between the axles. Featuring a wide door with a central hand rail, and signage directing passengers to board on the right of it and alight on the left, early indications were that this not only speeded up boarding/alighting, it increased the space available for standees.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nBy 1925, the Edinburgh type had further evolved to feature two doors, front and rear, albeit reduced to 31 seats. It was also now being fitted to 45&nbsp;hp AEC chassis.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/>\n\nThe early Edinburgh type buses required a driver and conductor to operate, but on lesser used routes, one-man-operation was also employed - for a 10 percent increase in wages the rear door would be closed and the driver would collect fares on boarding via the front.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/>\n\nThe early AEC and Leyland buses were reportedly up to the challenging task of route service in Edinburgh, which, due to its hilly terrain, was hard on engines, gears and brakes. To save on clutches, the AECs came with ratchet sprags fitted to the rear wheels (initially wire controlled, later modified to rod-control), with drivers instructed to deploy them at the bottom of hills.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nBecause the charabanc motor coaches were not in use in the winter months, some would be re-fitted with single-deck bus bodies and put into route service, while some of the remaining charabancs would be used in route service in case of extreme need. During the tram electrification programme, some were refitted with truck bodies to assist the works.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nThe first double-decker buses (open top, rear staircase layout) arrived in 1922.<ref name=\"Lothian Buses Timeline\"/>\n\nAlthough growing in size both before and after, for the period of May 1925 to May 1926 the fleet size was static at a total of 88 buses in regular use, as follows:<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/><ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1925, page 10\"/>\n\n* 71 single-deckers of the 31-seat Edinburgh body type (41 Leylands, 40 AECs)\n* 2 double-deckers (54 seaters)\n* 15 charabancs (nine 27-seaters, six 32-seaters)\n\nDuring 1924 nearly half the fleet were converted to use pneumatic tyres (Dunlop & Michelin) instead of the earlier solid rubber or later Supercushion designs; by 1925 the Corporation had already determined based on both direct (price, life) and indirect (vibration damage, fuel consumption) cost comparisons, as well as the increased passenger comfort, to use them on the entire fleet.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/><ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1925, page 10\"/> The issue of vibration was particularly serious in Edinburgh to the prevalence of granite paved streets.<ref name=\"Edinburgh's Experience With Buses 1925, page 10\"/> Conversion presented difficulty on the rear twin tyres on the AEC Model 507 double-deckers due to the maximum legal width (7' 6\"), but this was overcome with in-house modifications.<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 86\">Edinburgh and its bus services, ''Commercial Motor'', 24 May 1927, page 86</ref>\n\nIn 1926 the Corporation had four 52 seat double-deckers on order from AEC.<ref>Recent AEC Orders, ''Commercial Motor'', 30 March  1926, page 6</ref>\n\nTo further solve the problem of lost time loading/unloading, by 1927 the corporation was stipulating two door bus bodies with wider doors, allowing simultaneous boarding and alighting - in through the rear (being at least 32' wide), and out through the front (28').<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 86\"/>\n\nThe presence of low bridges on almost all of the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. A batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the requirement for comfortably seating 39. A 61-80&nbsp;hp six-cylinder engine powered single tyres on both rear axle, with air pressure braking applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A smoking area was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, upholstered in green leather, with generous leg room.<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 86\"/><ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 58\">Six-wheeled buses for municipal use, ''Commercial Motor'', 23 August 1927, page 58</ref> Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single-deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.<ref>More Buses for Important Scottish Municipalities, ''Commercial Motor'', 1 November  1927, page 45</ref>\n\nHaving recognised the advantages of operating modern buses, by 1928 the Corporation was already practicing the art of fleet replacement - with new deliveries displacing older buses which would then be disposed of.<ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1928, page 53\"/>\n\n===1930s===\nBy May 1930 the fleet totalled 130 buses and coaches, the most recent arrivals being 14 AEC Reliance 95&nbsp;hp 32 seater single decker buses of the \"most modern\" design. Dual-doored, the front was Simplex pneumatically controlled. The interior featured oak panelling throughout, Induroleum floor covering, chrome fittings, a Holt patent heater, and the bucket type leather upholstered seats. There was still a rear smoker's compartment, now just seating 10.<ref>Bus Results in the Scottish Capital, ''Commercial Motor'', 30 July 1929, page 59</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the Corporation began trials to determine the fuel efficiency gains in using tar-oil mixed with petrol as a fuel, on petrol engined buses. This involved modifying a number of Leyland and AECs to use the Solex bi-fuel system, while a bespoke method was used on Daimlers.<ref>Tar-oil Experiments In Edinburgh, ''Commercial Motor'', 6 January 1933, page 45</ref>\n\nBy May 1934, Daimlers made up nearly half the fleet, which now totalled 152 buses and coaches.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1934, page 58\">Operating Aspects Of Passenger Transport, ''Commercial Motor'', 27 July 1934, page 58</ref>\n\n===Double Deckers===\nIn the period immediately following the Second World War, the [[Guy Arab]] and [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] CV-series were favoured, with a smaller number of [[AEC Regent III]]. Between 1952 and 1966 some 452 [[Leyland Titan (front engined double-decker)|Leyland Titan PD2 and PD3]] were delivered (notably including 300 PD2s with [[Metro-Cammell|MCCW]] Orion bodies in 1954-56 for tram replacement). With the move to rear-engined double-deckers, 588 [[Leyland Atlantean]] with [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders|Alexander]] bodies joined the fleet between 1965 and 1981.\n\nWith the demise of the Atlantean, the standard bus was the [[Leyland Olympian]] double decker with [[Eastern Coach Works]] or Alexander RH-type bodies (296 between 1982 and 1993). After the purchase of Leyland Bus by Volvo, Lothian remained loyal to the [[Volvo Olympian]] chassis, taking 134 with Alexander RH and Royale type bodies between 1994 and 1997. These were the last step-entrance buses purchased. 95 years of continuous Leyland operation with Lothian and its predecessors ended on 14 March 2009 with the withdrawal of the last Leyland Olympians.\n\nSubsequently, low floor double-deckers have been specified. Initially the [[Dennis Trident 2]] was favoured, with 197 being purchased between 1999 and 2004, of which first five had [[Alexander ALX400]] bodies and the remainder  [[Plaxton President]] bodywork (including four built new as open-toppers). Six [[Volvo B7TL]] with Plaxton President bodies were purchased for comparison in 2000, along with a similar bus which had started life as a manufacturer's demonstrator.  Subsequently, most new vehicles have been Volvos with [[Wrightbus]] bodywork, comprising 125 Volvo B7TL/[[Wright Eclipse Gemini]] (2005\u201307), 100 [[Volvo B9TL]]/Wright Eclipse Gemini (2007\u201309), 135 Volvo B9TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 (2009\u201311), 25 [[Volvo B5TL]]/Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 (2014), 40 [[Volvo B5LH]]/Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 hybrids (2015\u201317) and 132 Volvo B5TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 (2015\u201318), including 30 built as open toppers and 8 delivered new to the East Coast Buses unit.\n\nIn addition to the Volvos, a [[Scania OmniDekka]] demonstrator was delivered in 2004 for long term evaluation, and although it was subsequently returned to the manufacturer it did lead to the purchase of 15 [[Scania OmniCity]] in 2006-07. Two of these were later converted to open toppers for the East Coast Buses unit.  Another non-standard batch of buses are 15 [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400|Alexander Dennis Enviro400H]] hybrids delivered in 2011, although these have since been converted to full diesel operation.\n\nSecondhand double deckers were purchased in 2018-19 to allow expansion of the Lothian Country operation and to accelerate replacement of the last of the Tridents and Scanias.  These include 4 B5LH Gemini 3 from Bullock of Cheadle, and at least 64 (as of April 2019) B9TL Gemini 2 from various London fleets.  All of these are readily distinguishable from their \"native\" contemporaries by virtue of having a shorter wheelbase.\n\nThe newest double deckers in the fleet (as of early 2019) are 42 [[Volvo B8L|Volvo B8L(T)]] [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400|Alexander Dennis Enviro400 XLB]] tri-axle double deckers delivered in early 2019.\n\n===Single Deckers===\nPost-war single-deckers comprised small batches of [[Guy Arab]], Daimler CV-series, [[Crossley Motors|Crossley]] SD42, [[Bristol Commercial Vehicles|Bristol]] L-type, [[Leyland Royal Tiger PSU|Leyland Royal Tiger]] and [[Leyland-MCW Olympic|Olympic]], and [[Albion Aberdonian]]. In 1959-60, some 100 [[Leyland Tiger Cub]]s with [[Metro Cammell Weymann|Weymann]] bodies were purchased to replace the assorted front engined single-deckers. In 1961 a solitary [[Leyland Leopard]] was delivered. This was number 101 (registered YSG101), which was notable as a very early example (in the UK) of a 36' long bus, for carrying the second ever example of Alexander's long-running [[Alexander Y Type|Y-type]] body, and for being completed to an experimental standee layout with three sets of doors.\n\nIn 1966 the removal of disused railway bridges on Easter Road enabled the busy Leith circular services to be converted to double-deck operation. Many of the Tiger Cubs were sold to [[Ulsterbus]], and the single-deck fleet declined markedly. No more large single-deckers were purchased until 1975, when twelve more Y-type Leopards (to a more conventional specification) were purchased, and ten 1974 [[Bedford Y series|Bedford YRTs]] with similar bodies to coach specification were downgraded to service buses after only 1 season. Twenty dual-door [[Leyland National]]s arrived in 1982-85, followed by 12 dual-door [[Leyland Lynx]] in 1991. Later, some reconditioned secondhand Leyland Nationals were purchased for use on tendered services.\n\nSince the move to low-floor buses the number of single deckers in the fleet has increased. After operating a [[Volvo B10L]] demonstrator on long term loan, 91 Dennis/[[Plaxton Pointer|Plaxton Super Pointer]] [[Dennis Dart|Dart]] were purchased in 2000-2003. Subsequently, Volvos were adopted as standard, with 66 new [[Volvo B7RLE]]/[[Wright Eclipse|Wright Eclipse Urban]] (2004\u201308), 2 similar secondhand vehicles purchased from Whitelaw of Stonehouse in 2011, 24 new Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse 2 (2009\u201313), and 50 [[Volvo B5LH]] 7900H hybrids in 2013-14.  These deliveries allowed the withdrawal of the Super Pointer Darts, since which time the single deck fleet has been 100% Volvo in its composition.\n\nThe need for additional single deckers for the East Coast Buses subsidiary led to the purchase of another 7 secondhand Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse Urban from [[Arriva Southern Counties]] in 2016, followed by 15 new [[Volvo B8RLE]]/Wright Eclipse 3 in 2017.\n\n===Midibuses===\n[[Minibuses]] and short [[wheelbase]] [[midibus]]es have not been used in large numbers by Lothian, although some midibuses had previously been used on less busy routes. Ten Seddon Pennine IV-236 were acquired in 1973. These were replaced by 18 Leyland Cubs with [[Duple Dominant]] bodies in 1981, which in turn gave way to 12 9m [[Dennis Dart]]s with [[Alexander Dash]] bodies in 1992. When the Darts were delivered they were the only non-Leyland vehicles in the fleet.  In 2001 five of these Darts were sold to Yorkshire Traction.  The ones that remained were gradually cascaded to the Mac Tours subsidiary until their replacement by six [[Optare Solo SR]]s in 2008.  The Solos were in turn replaced by six [[Wright StreetAir|Wright StreetAir EV DF]] electric buses in 2017.\n\n===Coaches===\nUntil the early 2000s, Lothian and its predecessors operated a small coach fleet. Until 1976 most coaches were lightweight types (mainly [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedfords]]), but subsequently 10 [[Leyland Leopard]], 14 [[Leyland Tiger]] and 7 [[Dennis Javelin]] were purchased up to 1999. An oddity (in that it was an import in what was at the time a 100% British fleet) was a [[Toyota Coaster]] minicoach, new in 1993. The coach operation was closed down in order to concentrate on stage services and the open top sightseeing tours.\n\nIn 2018 Lothian returned to the coach business with the launch of the Lothian Motor Coaches unit.  The initial fleet comprised five new [[Volvo B11R|Volvo B11R(T)]] [[Plaxton Panther|Plaxton Panther 3]], three secondhand [[Volvo B12B|Volvo B12B(T)]] [[Van Hool]] Acron T8 and one secondhand [[Volvo B12M]] [[Plaxton Paragon]].  Subsequent additions have been two new [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] minicoaches and a batch of secondhand [[Volvo B9R]] [[Caetano Levante]].\n\nExpansion of the Lothian Country operations in West Lothian in 2019 saw the purchase of 8 new [[Volvo B8R]] [[Plaxton Leopard]] interurban coaches for express services.\n\n==Main fleet liveries & route branding==\n[[File:Lothian Buses 833 G833GSX.jpg|thumb|right|A now-withdrawn [[Leyland Olympian]] in traditional madder and white livery in 2006]]\nTraditionally, Edinburgh Corporation, Lothian Regional Transport and Lothian Buses had a livery of [[Rose madder|madder]] (a dark red) and cream (white), with matching madder leatherette seating.\n\nIn the 1920s the livery, as seen on the Hall bodied Karrier Type WL6/1 six-wheelers on delivery, was maroon, with a cream band under the windows, with white window surrounds and a black roof. The fleetname was 'Corporation Motors', applied on the cream band.<ref name=\"Commercial Motor 1927, page 58\"/>\n\nSome coach-seated Leyland Olympian / Alexander RH-types and Volvo Olympian / Alexander Royales had been painted in the same scheme, but with red in place of the madder. These vehicles are not branded for, but were typically found only on, routes 15/15A.\n\nWhile Lothian had traditionally maintained a uniform livery for all buses, deliveries of low floor vehicles has seen a new standard livery introduced. Low floor vehicles have also seen route branding come to be increasingly used by Lothian. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Edinburgh and the Lothians.\n\nIn 1999-2000, a new \"harlequin\" livery was introduced for all new vehicle deliveries, comprising all-over white, with madder lower skirting with a thin red separating stripe and a red front-panel. Gold and madder overlapping diamonds were added to the rear quarters and the rear of the vehicle. The red front serves to distinguish approaching Lothian vehicles from the all-over white of [[First Scotland East|First in Edinburgh]]. The livery was simplified in 2002 with the diamonds originating from a different position and no longer overlapping each other. This new livery was intended to highlight the low floor accessible nature of these buses and also benefits from being more durable than the madder paint through the life of the bus. The harlequin livery was not retrospectively applied to older vehicles in the fleet, with the Alexander Royale bodied Olympians the last vehicles to be delivered in the traditional madder and white scheme and when these vehicles were withdrawn in 2009 this livery left the Lothian fleet also.\n\nHowever it was announced in March 2010 that the traditional Madder Rose and White Livery was to be reintroduced across the 600 strong fleet.<ref>[http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/new_transit/news/?ID=21921 Lothian Buses introduces traditional look for new livery | TXNews | Transport News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The vehicles will be repainted as part of their ongoing maintenance, so the old \"harlequin\" livery will continue to be a common sight on Edinburgh's streets.\n\nOriginally, twelve buses had been branded for route 35 but in November 2007 a similar number of buses, ten ex-Airlink and two from the 2004 delivery of Tridents, were branded for the 35.  This featured a purple circle with the name \"''Airport-Holyrood-Government Link''\" and a route description on the sides above the purple circle. Certain single deckers have extra branding promoting the Nightbus network.\n\nFrom time to time, some buses will have wraparound advertising applied, either to the whole bus, an entire side or the entire rear of the bus. Ridacards are advertised on the entire side of older Olympians.\n\nPreviously, services 22 and 30 were branded but with the 22 converted to double-deck operation on 18 January 2009, this service lost the branding. The 30 also lost its branding, as the Dennis Darts used on it were replaced by cascaded Volvo B7RLE's from the 22 service.\n\n==Finances==\nThe first route (1919) initially generated and average revenue of \u00a335 a day. This had risen to \u00a3150 on this one route by 1921, thanks to increasing the frequency and length. This particular route could even reach \u00a3260 on Saturdays due to football crowds, passing as it did the grounds of the city's two top clubs, Hearts and Hibs.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nWorking on a financial year ending in May, the corporation bus fleet recorded net profits from 1921 to 1923, with a high of over \u00a321.1k in 1922 being followed by a low of \u00a38.5k in 1923.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nOne factor affecting Edinburgh's finances is the above-average fuel consumption of the fleet, which is due to the hilly terrain.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1922, page 16\"/>\n\nHaving nearly reached 20m in 1923/4, the number of bus passengers carried in 1924/5 dropped back to 15.5m after The Mound and Hanover Street route was converted from bus operation to electric trams. By May 1925, the Corporation had 88 buses in regular use. Despite the size, and after a total capital expenditure of nearly \u00a3200,000 on buses and garages (of which around three-quarters had already been paid off), they now returned an annual loss of \u00a38,174 on revenues of \u00a3109,400, although the loss included the cost of converting half the fleet to pneumatic tyres (without which, the loss would have been \u00a31,357).<ref name=\"Scottish Cities 1925, page 10\"/>\n\nBy 1926 passenger numbers had increased to 17.2m, bringing the bus fleet back into profit, albeit just \u00a31,933.<ref name=\"Scottish Capital 1926, page 14\"/>\n\nA challenge presented itself in 1935 with the combination of rising fuel price rises and oil duty increases meaning the Corporation would add an extra \u00a39,500 a year in costs.<ref name=\"Passenger Transport 1934, page 58\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lothian Buses}}\n*[http://www.lothianbuses.com Lothian Buses official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110209113310/http://www.flybybus.com/ Airlink 100 official website]\n*[http://news.scotsman.com/newsfront.aspx?sectionid=10917&IsTopic=1 Lothian Buses Category] in [[The Scotsman]] newspaper website\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130516024408/http://scotlandbuses.fotopic.net/ Scotland Buses - Lothian's Buses enthusiast's picture website]\n*[http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2009/06/05/10511-edinburgh-zoo-catches-the-bus] Lothian Buses enters advertising deal with Edinburgh Zoo\n\n{{Bus operators in Scotland}}\n\n<!-- Note that while none of its buses currently serves West Lothian (one of the stakeholders listed) this may change in the future.

He was one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]], whose members were often called \"Tractarians\"; they aimed to reform the [[Church of England]] by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church.  The college was incorporated by [[royal charter]] dated 6 June 1870. Under its terms, the governance of the college was in the hands of the [[Warden (college)|Warden]] (the head of the college) and a council of nine to twelve members; the Warden could veto almost any decision of the council and so was in a strong position.<ref name=Drennan17>Drennan, p. 17.</ref><ref name=Mallet/> Other Oxford colleges, in contrast, were run by the head of the college and the [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellows]]. By keeping matters relating to religion and the college's internal affairs in the hands of the council, rather than college academics (termed Tutors at Keble during this period), the founders hoped to maintain Keble's religious position as \"a bastion of 'orthodox' Anglican teaching\" against the opponents of Tractarianism.<ref>Cameron and Archer, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> The council even had power to move the college away from Oxford (subject to the consent of the [[Visitor]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]) if it transpired that Oxford was not a suitable home.<ref name=Mallet/><ref>Hibbert, p. 207.</ref>\n\nIn total, 54&nbsp;men served on the council, 11 of whom were college alumni; in 1903, [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] ([[Bishop of London]]) became the first former Keble student to join the council. Appointment was for life or until resignation rather than for a fixed term; the council had power to fill vacancies.<ref name=Mallet>{{cite book|title=A History of the University of Oxford Volume 3: Modern Oxford|page=428|last=Mallet|first=Charles Edward|origyear=1927|year=1968|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]}}</ref> The first members were drawn from the committee of the Keble Memorial Fund whose work had raised the money to build the college.  The council met three times per year, including a meeting on [[St Mark]]'s Day (25 April) \u2013 this was not only John Keble's birthday but the date on which the foundation stone was laid in 1868, and so was adopted by the college for commemorations and celebrations.<ref name=CA1419>Cameron and Archer, pp. 14, 19.</ref>\n\nMost of the members of the council came from outside the college, and many did not have other continuing links with the university. It has been described as \"an external Council of ecclesiastical worthies\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/about/past/kebles-past|title=Keble's Past|publisher=Keble College, Oxford|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref>  There were often arguments during meetings about the future direction of the college when [[Edward Stuart Talbot]] was Warden (from the college's foundation until 1888).<ref name=CA1419/> Over time, the Tutors came to have a greater influence on the direction of the college, a change recognised in 1930 when the council ceded control of internal administration and academic matters to the Warden and Fellows (as the Tutors were then retitled).  It retained management of finances and ecclesiastical patronage, until [[Harry James Carpenter|Harry Carpenter]] (Warden from 1939 to 1955) persuaded the council to transfer its remaining powers to the Warden and Fellows.<ref name=Hibbert208>Hibbert, p. 208.</ref> This placed the college \"on a constitutional par with the older colleges of the University.\"<ref>Cameron and Archer, p. 59.</ref> The council ceased to exist after 9 April 1952, the date on which new statutes of the college that placed full management in the hands of the Warden and Fellows were approved by the [[Queen in Council]].<ref name=Drennan17/>\n\n==Council members==\n[[File:1st Earl of Cranbrook.jpg|thumb|alt=A balding man, with sideburns, sitting in a chair and reading a newspaper.

He was one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]], whose members were often called \"Tractarians\"; they aimed to reform the [[Church of England]] by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church.  The college was incorporated by [[royal charter]] dated 6 June 1870. Under its terms, the governance of the college was in the hands of the [[Warden (college)|Warden]] (the head of the college) and a council of nine to twelve members; the Warden could veto almost any decision of the council and so was in a strong position.<ref name=Drennan17>Drennan, p. 17.</ref><ref name=Mallet/> Other Oxford colleges, in contrast, were run by the head of the college and the [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellows]]. By keeping matters relating to religion and the college's internal affairs in the hands of the council, rather than college academics (termed Tutors at Keble during this period), the founders hoped to maintain Keble's religious position as \"a bastion of 'orthodox' Anglican teaching\" against the opponents of Tractarianism.<ref>Cameron and Archer, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> The council even had power to move the college away from Oxford (subject to the consent of the [[Visitor]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]) if it transpired that Oxford was not a suitable home.<ref name=Mallet/><ref>Hibbert, p. 207.</ref>\n\nIn total, 54&nbsp;men served on the council, 11 of whom were college alumni; in 1903, [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] ([[Bishop of London]]) became the first former Keble student to join the council. Appointment was for life or until resignation rather than for a fixed term; the council had power to fill vacancies.<ref name=Mallet>{{cite book|title=A History of the University of Oxford Volume 3: Modern Oxford|page=428|last=Mallet|first=Charles Edward|origyear=1927|year=1968|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]}}</ref> The first members were drawn from the committee of the Keble Memorial Fund whose work had raised the money to build the college.  The council met three times per year, including a meeting on [[St Mark]]'s Day (25 April) \u2013 this was not only John Keble's birthday but the date on which the foundation stone was laid in 1868, and so was adopted by the college for commemorations and celebrations.<ref name=CA1419>Cameron and Archer, pp. 14, 19.</ref>\n\nMost of the members of the council came from outside the college, and many did not have other continuing links with the university. It has been described as \"an external Council of ecclesiastical worthies\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/about/past/kebles-past|title=Keble's Past|publisher=Keble College, Oxford|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref>  There were often arguments during meetings about the future direction of the college when [[Edward Stuart Talbot]] was Warden (from the college's foundation until 1888).<ref name=CA1419/> Over time, the Tutors came to have a greater influence on the direction of the college, a change recognised in 1930 when the council ceded control of internal administration and academic matters to the Warden and Fellows (as the Tutors were then retitled).  It retained management of finances and ecclesiastical patronage, until [[Harry James Carpenter|Harry Carpenter]] (Warden from 1939 to 1955) persuaded the council to transfer its remaining powers to the Warden and Fellows.<ref name=Hibbert208>Hibbert, p. 208.</ref> This placed the college \"on a constitutional par with the older colleges of the University.\"<ref>Cameron and Archer, p. 59.</ref> The council ceased to exist after 9 April 1952, the date on which new statutes of the college that placed full management in the hands of the Warden and Fellows were approved by the [[Queen in Council]].<ref name=Drennan17/>\n\n==Council members==\n[[File:1st Earl of Cranbrook.jpg|thumb|alt=A balding man, with sideburns, sitting in a chair and reading a newspaper.

Located in the southeastern part of the county, it lies along the road between the cities of [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and [[Buz\u0103u]], and to the northeast of the national capital, [[Bucharest]]. Its position led it to become a thriving market town beginning in the 18th century, before a long period of economic decline began in the early 20th century. Agriculture gave way to industry as the chief employment under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], but the town has continued to face difficulties in the wake of a late-1990s [[deindustrialisation]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe town is situated in southeastern Prahova County, on the border with [[Buz\u0103u County]]; the four rural localities that surround it are [[Gura Vadului]] (north), [[Baba Ana]] (south), [[S\u0103h\u0103teni]] (east) and [[F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele, Prahova|F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele]] (west).<ref name=\"dev13\">{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.primaria-mizil.ro/documente/Strategie_Mizil_2008_2015.pdf Sustainable Development Strategy for Mizil Town, 2008-2015], p.13.

It was first mentioned as ''E\u0219teu'' in 1585, and as ''Istau'' in 1591, after its stream. Around the turn of the 18th century, [[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]] [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] owned the village, building houses at the nearby Corbeanca Dealul Dumb\u0103vii vineyard and establishing an annual fair in Mizil that would become renowned. It was during the 18th century that a [[mail coach]] station for changing horses opened in the village. Merchants began to set up shop, their business augmented by the location between two larger towns; coachmen, wheelwrights, woodcutters and watchmen also found work. In the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] of [[Wallachia]]'s rulers, the station was known as a ''menzil''. The ''n'' dropped out through [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] and the ''i'' became an ''e''; given that activity and transactions that took place around it, the resulting name came to be used for the village as a whole and to replace its old name. The first church was built in 1790, and Mizil was declared a town in 1830.<ref name=\"dev13\"/><ref name=\"primh\"/>\n\nMizil reached its peak of activity during the 19th century, rapidly outpacing [[Urla\u021bi]], which had possessed the advantage of having the closest market to most of the towns in that part of Wallachia. Moreover, in 1847 the Ploie\u0219ti-Buz\u0103u road began to be built along the foothills, shortening and modernising the link between the capitals of the [[Danubian Principalities]], Bucharest and Ia\u0219i. It was from the latter to the former city that [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] passed through Mizil in 1859, on his way to become head of the [[United Principalities]]. In this period, inhabitants worked in agriculture, viniculture, animal husbandry and various trades. The first school was built in 1857, by the ''[[boyar]]'' Ion C\u0103ciunescu, although teaching had begun around 1838. Following the efforts of mayor [[Leonida Condeescu]], an elementary trade school was established about 1902, with a high school opening later.<ref name=\"dev13\"/>\n\nThe town's rapid growth slowed down in the first half of the 20th century, eventually stagnating. In the 1950s and '60s, under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], it was the centre of Mizil [[raion]] in [[Regiunea Ploie\u0219ti]]. During this time, industry&mdash;textiles, wood and mechanics&mdash;came to be a chief source of employment for inhabitants.<ref name=\"primh\"/>\n\n==Government, economy and infrastructure==\n[[File:Mizil Gara.JPG|thumb|Mizil train station]]\nMizil is governed by a mayor and 17-member local council.

Located in the southeastern part of the county, it lies along the road between the cities of [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and [[Buz\u0103u]], and to the northeast of the national capital, [[Bucharest]]. Its position led it to become a thriving market town beginning in the 18th century, before a long period of economic decline began in the early 20th century. Agriculture gave way to industry as the chief employment under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], but the town has continued to face difficulties in the wake of a late-1990s [[deindustrialisation]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe town is situated in southeastern Prahova County, on the border with [[Buz\u0103u County]]; the four rural localities that surround it are [[Gura Vadului]] (north), [[Baba Ana]] (south), [[S\u0103h\u0103teni]] (east) and [[F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele, Prahova|F\u00e2nt\u00e2nele]] (west).<ref name=\"dev13\">{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.primaria-mizil.ro/documente/Strategie_Mizil_2008_2015.pdf Sustainable Development Strategy for Mizil Town, 2008-2015], p.13.

It was first mentioned as ''E\u0219teu'' in 1585, and as ''Istau'' in 1591, after its stream. Around the turn of the 18th century, [[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]] [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] owned the village, building houses at the nearby Corbeanca Dealul Dumb\u0103vii vineyard and establishing an annual fair in Mizil that would become renowned. It was during the 18th century that a [[mail coach]] station for changing horses opened in the village. Merchants began to set up shop, their business augmented by the location between two larger towns; coachmen, wheelwrights, woodcutters and watchmen also found work. In the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] of [[Wallachia]]'s rulers, the station was known as a ''menzil''. The ''n'' dropped out through [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] and the ''i'' became an ''e''; given that activity and transactions that took place around it, the resulting name came to be used for the village as a whole and to replace its old name. The first church was built in 1790, and Mizil was declared a town in 1830.<ref name=\"dev13\"/><ref name=\"primh\"/>\n\nMizil reached its peak of activity during the 19th century, rapidly outpacing [[Urla\u021bi]], which had possessed the advantage of having the closest market to most of the towns in that part of Wallachia. Moreover, in 1847 the Ploie\u0219ti-Buz\u0103u road began to be built along the foothills, shortening and modernising the link between the capitals of the [[Danubian Principalities]], Bucharest and Ia\u0219i. It was from the latter to the former city that [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] passed through Mizil in 1859, on his way to become head of the [[United Principalities]]. In this period, inhabitants worked in agriculture, viniculture, animal husbandry and various trades. The first school was built in 1857, by the ''[[boyar]]'' Ion C\u0103ciunescu, although teaching had begun around 1838. Following the efforts of mayor [[Leonida Condeescu]], an elementary trade school was established about 1902, with a high school opening later.<ref name=\"dev13\"/>\n\nThe town's rapid growth slowed down in the first half of the 20th century, eventually stagnating. In the 1950s and '60s, under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], it was the centre of Mizil [[raion]] in [[Regiunea Ploie\u0219ti]]. During this time, industry&mdash;textiles, wood and mechanics&mdash;came to be a chief source of employment for inhabitants.<ref name=\"primh\"/>\n\n==Government, economy and infrastructure==\n[[File:Mizil Gara.JPG|thumb|Mizil train station]]\nMizil is governed by a mayor and 17-member local council.
