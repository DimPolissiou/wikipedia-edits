Spouse of 18 years Nicola Johnson. Children  Alice Taylor Paige Lovett-Johnson(19) and Amy Piper Lane Lovett-Johnson(15)\n\n==Biography==\nJohnson got his start working on magazines which covered the then-burgeoning fantasy [[role playing game]]s industry. From there he got work at [[Marvel UK]] where he worked on weekly comic book series such as ''[[List of Transformers comic book series#Marvel Comics#Marvel UK|Transformers]]'' and ''[[Action Force]]''. During this period Johnson's first work was published in the US in [[Marvel Comics]] ''[[G.I. Joe]] European Missions'' in 1989; however this was not original work - the series reprinted his Marvel UK ''Action Force'' material.\n\nIn 1992 he did his first work for [[Fleetway|Fleetway Edition]]'s ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', a ''[[Tharg]]'s [[Future Shocks]]'' feature. His most recent work on the title was part of a [[Rogue Trooper]] serial in 2003.\n\nHis work on Marvel UK's ''[[Death Wreck]]'' series in 1994 led to him getting work from Marvel US on titles such as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' (1994), ''[[Force Works]]'' (1995) and ''[[Spider-Man]]: Funeral for an Octopus'' (1995).\n\nHe then began a long period where he worked exclusively for Marvel's competitor DC Comics, initially on a six-issue storyline in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #689-694 (September 1995- February 1996) which led to stints as regular penciller of ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' (1996\u20131999) and ''[[Catwoman]]'' (2000\u20132001). His most recent work for DC was the inter-company crossover ''[[Batman/Aliens]] II'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] in 2003.\n\nIn 2003 he returned to Marvel, and it is at that publisher that most of his work has since been published. At Marvel he has worked on ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'', ''[[New X-Men]]'', ''[[Underworld (comics)|Underworld]]'', ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: War Crimes'' and it was also through Marvel he got his work on the ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' [[List of Heroes graphic novels|webcomics]].\n\nJohnson was also the superhero expert on the  [[Channel 4]] television show ''[[Zero to Hero]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040914174411/http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/Z/zero2hero/findoutmore_credits.html Zero to Hero credits] (archive), Channel 4</ref>\n\nHe is currently working on a 150-page [[Dracula]] comic and has produced ''The New World Order'', a comic book series based on a line of [[Agent Provocateur (lingerie)|Agent Provocateur]] lingerie.<ref>[http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/spectrum/Graphic--novel.5640902.jp Agent Provocateur: Graphic and novel], ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', September 13, 2009</ref>\n\nJohnson lives in [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]], where he was brought up.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/8080735.stm=article Superheroes 'made in Yorkshire'], [[BBC News]], May 10, 2009</ref> He is married to Nicola Johnson, and has two children Alice (18) + Amy Lovett-Johnson (15)\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Deathwreck.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Death Wreck]] art by Johnson]]\nComics work includes:\n\n* \"Starting Over\" (in ''[[Transformers (Marvel UK)|The Transformers]]'' #261, [[Marvel UK]], 1990)\n* ''[[Future Shocks|Tharg's Future Shocks]]'':\n** \"A Hitch In Time\" (with [[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]], in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' #796, 1992)\n** \"Old Red\" (with [[Simon Spurrier]], in ''2000 AD'' #1232, 2001)\n** \"Adventures in the War Trade\" (with [[Alec Worley]], in ''2000 AD'' #1574, 2008)\n* ''[[Death Wreck]]'' (with [[Craig Houston]], Marvel UK, 1994)\n* ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #689-694 ([[DC Comics]], September 1995 - February 1996)\n* ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' (DC Comics, 1996\u20131999)\n* ''[[Catwoman]]'' (DC Comics, 2000\u20132001)\n*''[[Killer (2000 AD)|Killer]]'' (pencils, with [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] and inks by [[David Roach (comics)|David Roach]], in ''2000 AD'' #1264-1272, 2001)\n* ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' (with [[John Wagner]]):\n** \"The Sons of Katie Didd\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1248-1249, 2001)\n** \"Dead Funny\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1320, 2002)\n** \"Hot Night in 95\" (in ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #307-308 and 310, 2011)\n* ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' (with [[Gordon Rennie]] and [[Gerry Finley-Day]]):\n** \"What Lies Beneath\" (pencils, with inks by David Roach, in ''2000 AD'' #1301-1304, 2002)\n** \"Lions\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1308, 2002)\n** \"Dead Funny\" (in ''2000 AD'' #1345-1347, 2003)\n** \"Dead Ringer\" (in ''2000 AD'' #2011, 2010)\n* ''[[Batman/Aliens]] 2'' (with [[Ian Edginton]], DC Comics, 2003 {{ISBN|1-4012-0081-8}})\n* ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 2003)\n* ''[[Spider-Man]]''/''[[Doctor Octopus]]: Negative Exposure #1'' (Marvel Comics, 2003)\n* ''[[Spider-Man 2]]: The Movie'' (Marvel Comics, 2004)\n* ''[[New X-Men]]'' (Marvel Comics, 2004)\n* ''[[Underworld (comics)|Underworld]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' (Marvel Comics, 2006)\n* ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: War Crimes'' (Marvel Comics, 2007)\n* ''The New World Order'' (with writer [[Brady Webb]], 2009)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{gcdb|type=credit|search=staz+johnson|title=Staz Johnson}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=creator|id=2350|title=Staz Johnson}}\n*[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=stazj Staz Johnson] at Barney<!-- the new home of the 2000 AD database formerly on the main site -->\n*[http://lambiek.net/artists/j/johnson_staz.htm Staz Johnson] at [[Lambiek]]'s Comiclopedia\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.stazjohnson.com}}\n*[http://stazjohnson.blogspot.com/ Staz Johnson's blog]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Staz}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1965 births]]\n[[Category:English comics artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics creator\n| image = \n| imagesize = 150\n| caption = \n| birth_name = Stewart Johnson\n| birth_place = \n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| nationality = [[People of English descent|English]]\n| cartoonist = \n| write =  He has two daughters.
