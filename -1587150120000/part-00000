In 1881, he was elected [[List of mayors of Buffalo, New York|Mayor of Buffalo]] and later, [[governor of New York]]. Cleveland was the leader of the pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]] who opposed [[Tariffs in United States history#Civil War protective policy, 1861\u20131913|high tariffs]]; [[Free Silver]]; inflation; [[Overseas expansion of the United States#Hawaii|imperialism]]; and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and [[fiscal conservatism]] made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.<ref>Blum, 527</ref> Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of [[classical liberalism]].<ref>Jeffers, 8\u201312; Nevins, 4\u20135; Beito and Beito</ref> He fought political corruption, patronage, and [[Political boss|bossism]]. As a reformer, Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party, called \"[[Mugwumps]]\", largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election.<ref>McFarland, 11\u201356</ref>\n\nAs his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the [[Panic of 1893]] produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland was unable to reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a [[1894 United States House elections|Republican landslide in 1894]] and for the agrarian and [[silverite]] seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a [[realigning election|political realignment]] that ended the [[Third Party System]] and launched the [[Fourth Party System]] and the [[Progressive Era]].<ref>Gould, ''passim''</ref>\n\nCleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the [[gold standard]] and opposition to Free Silver alienated the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] wing of the Democratic Party.<ref name=\"tugwell\">Tugwell, 220\u2013249</ref> Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\u2014[[Depression (economics)|depressions]] and strikes\u2014in his second term.<ref name=\"tugwell\" /> Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, \"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\"<ref>Nevins, 4</ref> By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnIhCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=grover+cleveland+extremely+unpopular+after+second+term&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb89LlttDZAhUHZKwKHcXpDXQQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=grover%20cleveland%20extremely%20unpopular%20after%20second%20term&f=false President-Making in the Gilded Age]: The Nominating Conventions of 1876\u20131900 by Stan M.

On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from [[Anglo-Irish]] Protestants and [[German Americans|German]] [[Quaker]]s from Philadelphia.<ref>Nevins, 9</ref> Cleveland was distantly related to General [[Moses Cleaveland]], after whom the city of [[Cleveland]], Ohio, was named.<ref>Graff, 7</ref>\n\nCleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.<ref>Nevins, 10; Graff, 3</ref> In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to [[Fayetteville, New York]], where Grover spent much of his childhood.<ref>Nevins, 11; Graff, 8\u20139</ref> Neighbors later described him as \"full of fun and inclined to play pranks,\"<ref>Nevins, 11</ref> and fond of outdoor sports.<ref>Jeffers, 17</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Cleveland's father moved to [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], to work as district secretary for the [[American Home Missionary Society]].<ref>Nevins, 17\u201319</ref> Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.<ref>Tugwell, 14</ref> In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in [[Holland Patent, New York]] (near [[Utica, New York|Utica]]) and the family moved again.<ref name=\"nevins21\">Nevins, 21</ref> Shortly after, he died from a [[gastric ulcer]], with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.<ref name=\"nevins21\" />\n\n===Education and moving west===\n[[Image:PCLEV001-009.jpg|thumb|upright|An early, undated photograph of Grover Cleveland]]\nCleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy.<ref>Nevins, 18\u201319; Jeffers, 19</ref> After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the [[New York Institute for the Blind]] in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west.<ref>Nevins, 23\u201327</ref> He stopped first in [[Buffalo, New York]], where his uncle, [[Lewis F. Allen]], gave him a clerical job.<ref>Nevins, 27\u201333</ref> Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the [[law firm]] of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers.<ref>Nevins, 31\u201336</ref> [[Millard Fillmore]], the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership.<ref>Graff, 11</ref> Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to [[read the law]], and was [[Admission to practice law|admitted]] to the New York bar in 1859.<ref name=\"graff14\">Graff, 14</ref>\n\n===Early career and the Civil War===\nCleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years, then left in 1862 to start his own practice.<ref>Graff, 14\u201315</ref> In January 1863, he was appointed assistant [[district attorney]] of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]].<ref>Graff, 15; Nevins, 46</ref> With the [[American Civil War]] raging, Congress passed the [[Conscription Act of 1863]], requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute.<ref name=\"graff14\" /> Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150 ({{Inflation|US|150|1863|fmt=eq}}) to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old [[Poles|Polish]] immigrant, to serve in his place.<ref>Graff, 14; Nevins, 51\u201352</ref> Benninsky survived the war.<ref name=\"graff14\" />\n\nAs a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work.<ref name=\"nevins52\">Nevins, 52\u201353</ref> In 1866, he successfully defended some participants in the [[Fenian raids#Canada West|Fenian raid]], working on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis (free of charge).<ref>Nevins, 54</ref> In 1868, Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a [[libel]] suit against the editor of Buffalo's ''Commercial Advertiser''.<ref>Nevins, 54\u201355</ref> During this time, Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity, taking residence in a plain [[boarding house]]; Cleveland dedicated his growing income instead to the support of his mother and younger sisters.<ref>Nevins, 55\u201356</ref> While his personal quarters were austere, Cleveland enjoyed an active social life and \"the easy-going sociability of hotel-lobbies and [[Western saloon|saloons]].\"<ref>Nevins, 56</ref> He shunned the circles of higher society of Buffalo in which his uncle's family traveled.<ref>Tugwell, 26</ref>\n\n==Political career in New York==\n\n===Sheriff of Erie County===\n[[Image:DSCN4468 buffaloclevelandstatue e.jpg|upright|thumb|Statue of Grover Cleveland outside City Hall in [[Buffalo, New York]]]]\nFrom his earliest involvement in politics, Cleveland aligned with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>Nevins, 44\u201345</ref> He had a decided aversion to Republicans [[John Fremont]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], and the heads of the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats.<ref>Tugwell, 32</ref> In 1865, he ran for [[District Attorney]], losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, [[Lyman K.

Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it.<ref>Tugwell, 36</ref> A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who had been convicted of murdering his mother.<ref name=\"morrisey\">Jeffers, 34; Nevins, 61\u201362</ref> As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task.<ref name=\"morrisey\" /> In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself.<ref name=\"morrisey\" /> He hanged another murderer, [[List of people executed in New York|John Gaffney]], on February 14, 1873.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1851-1900/gaffneyhanging/gaffneyhanging.html|title=The Execution of John Gaffney|accessdate=March 27, 2008|website=The Buffalonian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162510/http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1851-1900/gaffneyhanging/gaffneyhanging.html|archivedate=October 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to his law practice, opening a firm with his friends Lyman K.

As biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, \"Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and taking the oath as President of the United States.\"<ref>Nevins, 78</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that Cleveland began courting a widow, [[Maria Halpin]].

His veto message said, \"I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money.\"<ref>Nevins, 85</ref> The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder.<ref>Nevins, 86</ref> Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted.<ref>Tugwell, 58</ref> For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland's reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County.<ref>Nevins, 94\u201395; Jeffers, 50\u201351</ref>\n\n===Governor of New York===\n[[File:GCleveland.png|thumb|left|Gubernatorial portrait of Grover Cleveland]]\nNew York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor.<ref name=\"nevins94\">Nevins, 94\u201399; Graff, 26\u201327</ref> [[Daniel Manning]], a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, was instrumental in his candidacy.<ref>Tugwell, 68\u201370</ref> With a split in the state Republican party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; there were several contenders for that party's nomination.<ref name=\"nevins94\" /> The two leading Democratic candidates were [[Roswell P. Flower]] and [[Henry Warner Slocum|Henry W. Slocum]]. Their factions deadlocked, and the convention could not agree on a nominee.<ref>Graff, 26; Nevins, 101\u2013103</ref> Cleveland, in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice.<ref>Nevins, 103\u2013104</ref> The Republican party remained divided against itself, and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor, with 535,318 votes to Republican nominee [[Charles J. Folger]]'s 342,464.<ref>Nevins, 105</ref> Cleveland's margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election; the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the [[New York State Legislature]].<ref>Graff, 28</ref>\n\nCleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos in his first two months in office.<ref>Graff, 35</ref> The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on [[History of the New York City Subway#Early steam and elevated railroads|New York City elevated trains]] to five cents.<ref>Graff, 35\u201336</ref> The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, [[Jay Gould]], was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced.<ref>Nevins, 114\u2013116</ref> Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust\u2014Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again.<ref name=\"nevins116\">Nevins, 116\u2013117</ref> Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the [[Contract Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|federal Constitution]].<ref name=\"nevins116\" /> Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto.<ref name=\"nevins116\" /> [[Theodore Roosevelt]], then a member of the [[New York State Assembly|Assembly]], had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons.<ref name=\"nevins117\">Nevins, 117\u2013118</ref> After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.<ref name=\"nevins117\" />\n\nCleveland's defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential [[Tammany Hall]] organization in New York City.<ref>Nevins, 125\u2013126</ref> Tammany, under its boss, [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]], had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of their point man in the State Senate, [[Thomas F.

Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the [[Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad]] and the [[Union Pacific Railway]], later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies.<ref name=\"blaine\">Nevins, 159\u2013162; Graff, 59\u201360</ref> Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible.<ref name=\"blaine\" /> On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written \"Burn this letter\", giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: \"Blaine, Blaine, James G.

These jobs were typically filled under the [[spoils system]], but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service.<ref>Nevins, 208\u2013211</ref> He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers.<ref>Nevins, 214\u2013217</ref> Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats;<ref>Graff, 83</ref> this was especially the case with policy making positions.<ref>Tugwell, 100</ref> While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.<ref>Nevins, 238\u2013241; Welch, 59\u201360</ref>\n\nCleveland also reformed other parts of the government.

The friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow-citizens in misfortune. This has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated. Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character, while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Writings and Speeches of Grover Cleveland |publisher=Cassell Publishing Co |year=1892 |location=New York |page=450 |chapter=Cleveland's Veto of the Texas Seed Bill |chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cleveland's_Veto_of_the_Texas_Seed_Bill |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Writings_and_Speeches_of_Grover_Cleveland.djvu |isbn=0-217-89899-8}}</ref>}}\n\n===Silver===\nOne of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by [[Bimetallism|gold and silver]], or by [[gold standard|gold alone]].<ref>Jeffers, 157\u2013158</ref> The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard.<ref name=\"nevins201\">Nevins, 201\u2013205; Graff, 102\u2013103</ref> Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.<ref name=\"nevins201\" />\n\nCleveland and Treasury Secretary [[Daniel Manning]] stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]] of 1878.<ref>Nevins, 269</ref> Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated.<ref>Tugwell, 110</ref> Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents.<ref>Nevins, 268</ref> In reply, one of the foremost silverites, [[Richard P.

These tariffs had been implemented as a temporary measure during the civil war to protect American industrial interests but remained in place after the war.<ref>[https://millercenter.org/president/grover-cleveland/key-events \"Grover Cleveland: Key Events\"] University of Virginia Miller Center.

Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.\n\n===Foreign policy, 1885\u20131889===\nCleveland was a committed non-interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism.

The first, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, was a former [[Mississippi]] Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When [[William Burnham Woods]] died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.<ref>Daniel J. Meador, \"Lamar to the Court: Last Step to National Reunion\" ''Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook 1986'': 27\u201347. {{ISSN|0362-5249}}</ref>\n\n[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Morrison Waite]] died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated [[Melville Fuller]] to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the [[Civil Service Commission]], preferring his Chicago law practice. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.<ref>Willard L. King, ''Melville Weston Fuller \u2013 Chief Justice of the United States 1888\u20131910'' (1950)</ref><ref>Nevins, 445\u2013450</ref>\n\nCleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the [[United States circuit court]]s, nine judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 30 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office at the time that the change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.\n\n==Election of 1888 and return to private life==\n\n===Defeated by Harrison===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1888|Grover Cleveland Presidential campaign, 1888}}\n[[Image:Cleveland-Thurman.jpg|thumb|right|Cleveland\u2013Thurman campaign poster]]\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1888.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Results of the 1888 Election]]\nThe Republicans nominated [[Benjamin Harrison]] of [[Indiana]] for president and [[Levi P.

But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes. Cleveland won a plurality of the popular vote -- 48.6 percent vs. 47.8 percent for Harrison -- but Harrison won the Electoral College vote easily, 233-168. <ref>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}</ref> The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as [[Blocks of Five]].<ref>Nevins, 435\u2013439; Jeffers, 220\u2013222</ref> Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.<ref>Nevins, 443\u2013449</ref>\n\n===Private citizen for four years===\nAs Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, \"Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again.\" When asked when she would return, she responded, \"We are coming back four years from today.\"<ref>Nevins, 448</ref> In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City, where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, [[Francis Lynde Stetson|Stetson]], Tracy, and MacVeigh.

Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876, 1884, and 1888, the 1892 election was, according to Cleveland biographer [[Allan Nevins]], \"the cleanest, quietest, and most creditable in the memory of the post-war generation,\"<ref>Nevins, 498</ref> in part because Harrison's wife, Caroline, was dying of tuberculosis.<ref>Calhoun, 149</ref> Harrison did not personally campaign at all. Following Caroline Harrison's death on October 25, two weeks before the national election, Cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning, thus making Election Day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates.\n\nThe issue of the tariff had worked to the Republicans' advantage in 1888.

The [[Wilson\u2013Gorman Tariff Act]] was introduced by West Virginian Representative [[William Lyne Wilson|William L. Wilson]] in December 1893.<ref>Festus P. Summers, ''William L.

''See [[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]''</ref> The [[American Sugar Refining Company|Sugar Trust]] in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer.<ref>Nevins, 577\u2013578</ref> Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests.<ref>Nevins, 585\u2013587; Jeffers, 288\u2013289</ref> Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.<ref>Nevins, 564\u2013588; Jeffers, 285\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Voting rights===\nIn 1892, Cleveland had campaigned against the [[Lodge Bill]],<ref>James B. Hedges (1940), \"North America\", in [[William L. Langer]], ed., ''An Encyclopedia of World History'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, Part V, Section G, Subsection 1c, p. 794.</ref> which would have strengthened [[voting rights in the United States|voting rights protections]] through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The [[Enforcement Act of 1871]] had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36).<ref>Congressional Research Service (2004), ''The Constitution of the United States: Analysis and Interpretation\u2014Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002'', Washington: Government Printing Office, \"Fifteenth Amendment\", \"Congressional Enforcement\", \"Federal Remedial Legislation\", p. 2058.</ref> The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'', 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and ''Giles v. Teasley'', 193 U.S. 146 (1904).\n\n===Labor unrest===\n[[File:John t morgan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Tyler Morgan|John T.

See also ''[[In re Debs]]''.</ref> \"If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago\", he proclaimed, \"that card will be delivered.\"<ref>Nevins, 628</ref> Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat [[John P. Altgeld]] of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.<ref>Nevins, 624\u2013628; Jeffers, 304\u2013305; Graff, 120</ref>\n\nJust before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor:\n:\"We are on the eve of [a] very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe [is] Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently [discontent] with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.\"<ref>Francis Lynde Stetson to Cleveland, October 7, 1894 in Allan Nevins, ed. ''Letters of Grover Cleveland, 1850\u20131908'' (1933) p. 369</ref>\n\nThe warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.<ref>[[Richard J.

In 1881, he was elected [[List of mayors of Buffalo, New York|Mayor of Buffalo]] and later, [[governor of New York]]. Cleveland was the leader of the pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]] who opposed [[Tariffs in United States history#Civil War protective policy, 1861\u20131913|high tariffs]]; [[Free Silver]]; inflation; [[Overseas expansion of the United States#Hawaii|imperialism]]; and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and [[fiscal conservatism]] made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.<ref>Blum, 527</ref> Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of [[classical liberalism]].<ref>Jeffers, 8\u201312; Nevins, 4\u20135; Beito and Beito</ref> He fought political corruption, patronage, and [[Political boss|bossism]]. As a reformer, Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party, called \"[[Mugwumps]]\", largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election.<ref>McFarland, 11\u201356</ref>\n\nAs his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the [[Panic of 1893]] produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland was unable to reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a [[1894 United States House elections|Republican landslide in 1894]] and for the agrarian and [[silverite]] seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a [[realigning election|political realignment]] that ended the [[Third Party System]] and launched the [[Fourth Party System]] and the [[Progressive Era]].<ref>Gould, ''passim''</ref>\n\nCleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the [[gold standard]] and opposition to Free Silver alienated the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] wing of the Democratic Party.<ref name=\"tugwell\">Tugwell, 220\u2013249</ref> Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\u2014[[Depression (economics)|depressions]] and strikes\u2014in his second term.<ref name=\"tugwell\" /> Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer [[Allan Nevins]] wrote, \"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\"<ref>Nevins, 4</ref> By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnIhCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=grover+cleveland+extremely+unpopular+after+second+term&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb89LlttDZAhUHZKwKHcXpDXQQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=grover%20cleveland%20extremely%20unpopular%20after%20second%20term&f=false President-Making in the Gilded Age]: The Nominating Conventions of 1876\u20131900 by Stan M.

On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from [[Anglo-Irish]] Protestants and [[German Americans|German]] [[Quaker]]s from Philadelphia.<ref>Nevins, 9</ref> Cleveland was distantly related to General [[Moses Cleaveland]], after whom the city of [[Cleveland]], Ohio, was named.<ref>Graff, 7</ref>\n\nCleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.<ref>Nevins, 10; Graff, 3</ref> In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to [[Fayetteville, New York]], where Grover spent much of his childhood.<ref>Nevins, 11; Graff, 8\u20139</ref> Neighbors later described him as \"full of fun and inclined to play pranks,\"<ref>Nevins, 11</ref> and fond of outdoor sports.<ref>Jeffers, 17</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Cleveland's father moved to [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], to work as district secretary for the [[American Home Missionary Society]].<ref>Nevins, 17\u201319</ref> Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.<ref>Tugwell, 14</ref> In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in [[Holland Patent, New York]] (near [[Utica, New York|Utica]]) and the family moved again.<ref name=\"nevins21\">Nevins, 21</ref> Shortly after, he died from a [[gastric ulcer]], with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.<ref name=\"nevins21\" />\n\n===Education and moving west===\n[[Image:PCLEV001-009.jpg|thumb|upright|An early, undated photograph of Grover Cleveland]]\nCleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy.<ref>Nevins, 18\u201319; Jeffers, 19</ref> After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the [[New York Institute for the Blind]] in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister.

Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the [[Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad]] and the [[Union Pacific Railway]], later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies.<ref name=\"blaine\">Nevins, 159\u2013162; Graff, 59\u201360</ref> Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible.<ref name=\"blaine\" /> On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written \"Burn this letter\", giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: \"Blaine, Blaine, James G.

Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character, while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Writings and Speeches of Grover Cleveland |publisher=Cassell Publishing Co |year=1892 |location=New York |page=450 |chapter=Cleveland's Veto of the Texas Seed Bill |chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cleveland's_Veto_of_the_Texas_Seed_Bill |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Writings_and_Speeches_of_Grover_Cleveland.djvu |isbn=0-217-89899-8}}</ref>}}\n\n===Silver===\nOne of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by [[Bimetallism|gold and silver]], or by [[gold standard|gold alone]].<ref>Jeffers, 157\u2013158</ref> The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard.<ref name=\"nevins201\">Nevins, 201\u2013205; Graff, 102\u2013103</ref> Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.<ref name=\"nevins201\" />\n\nCleveland and Treasury Secretary [[Daniel Manning]] stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]] of 1878.<ref>Nevins, 269</ref> Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated.<ref>Tugwell, 110</ref> Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents.<ref>Nevins, 268</ref> In reply, one of the foremost silverites, [[Richard P.

These tariffs had been implemented as a temporary measure during the civil war to protect American industrial interests but remained in place after the war.<ref>[https://millercenter.org/president/grover-cleveland/key-events \"Grover Cleveland: Key Events\"] University of Virginia Miller Center.

Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.\n\n===Foreign policy, 1885\u20131889===\nCleveland was a committed non-interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism.

These ships included the \"second-class [[battleship]]s\" {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}} and {{USS|Texas|1892|2}}, designed to match modern armored ships recently acquired by South American countries from Europe, such as the [[Brazilian battleship Riachuelo|Brazilian battleship ''Riachuelo'']].<ref>Bauer and Roberts, p. 102</ref> Eleven [[protected cruiser]]s (including the famous {{USS|Olympia|C-6|2}}), one [[armored cruiser]], and one [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] were also ordered, along with the experimental cruiser {{USS|Vesuvius|1888|2}}.<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 101, 133, 141\u2013147</ref>\n\n===Civil rights and immigration===\nCleveland, like a growing number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] as a failed experiment, and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]], which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans.<ref name=\"welch65\">Welch, 65\u201366</ref> Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed [[Frederick Douglass]] to continue in his post as [[recorder of deeds]] in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation.<ref name=\"welch65\" /> His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blacksandpresidency.com/grovercleveland.php |title=\"No Force bill!

It ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual Indians to sell land and keep the money.<ref name=\"welch70\" />\n\nIn the month before Cleveland's 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four million acres of [[Winnebago (tribe)|Winnebago]] and [[Crow Creek Reservation|Crow Creek]] Indian lands in the [[Dakota Territory]] to white settlement by executive order.<ref name=\"B141\">Brodsky, 141\u2013142; Nevins, 228\u2013229</ref> Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them.<ref name=\"B141\" /> Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory.<ref name=\"B141\" /> Cleveland sent in eighteen [[company (military unit)|companies]] of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General [[Philip Sheridan]], at the time Commanding General of the U.

When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married.<ref name=\"graff78\" /> On June 2, 1886, Cleveland was 49 when he married Frances Folsom (21) in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] at the White House.<ref>Graff, 79</ref> He was the second president to wed while in office,<ref>[[John Tyler]], who married his second wife [[Julia Gardiner Tyler|Julia Gardiner]] in 1844, was the first</ref> and has been the only president to marry in the White House.

The first, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, was a former [[Mississippi]] Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When [[William Burnham Woods]] died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.<ref>Daniel J. Meador, \"Lamar to the Court: Last Step to National Reunion\" ''Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook 1986'': 27\u201347. {{ISSN|0362-5249}}</ref>\n\n[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Morrison Waite]] died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated [[Melville Fuller]] to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the [[Civil Service Commission]], preferring his Chicago law practice. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.<ref>Willard L. King, ''Melville Weston Fuller \u2013 Chief Justice of the United States 1888\u20131910'' (1950)</ref><ref>Nevins, 445\u2013450</ref>\n\nCleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the [[United States circuit court]]s, nine judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 30 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office at the time that the change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.\n\n==Election of 1888 and return to private life==\n\n===Defeated by Harrison===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1888|Grover Cleveland Presidential campaign, 1888}}\n[[Image:Cleveland-Thurman.jpg|thumb|right|Cleveland\u2013Thurman campaign poster]]\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1888.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Results of the 1888 Election]]\nThe Republicans nominated [[Benjamin Harrison]] of [[Indiana]] for president and [[Levi P.

Hill]], weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state.<ref>Nevins, 423\u2013427</ref> A [[Murchison letter|letter from the British ambassador]] supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.\n\nAs in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Indiana]]. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes. Cleland won a plurality of the popular vote -- 48.6 percent vs. 47.8 percent for Harrison -- but Harrison won the Electoral College vote easily, 233-168. <ref>{{Leip PV source 2|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}, {{National Archives EV source|year=1888| as of=February 18, 2008}}</ref> The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as [[Blocks of Five]].<ref>Nevins, 435\u2013439; Jeffers, 220\u2013222</ref> Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.<ref>Nevins, 443\u2013449</ref>\n\n===Private citizen for four years===\nAs Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, \"Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again.\" When asked when she would return, she responded, \"We are coming back four years from today.\"<ref>Nevins, 448</ref> In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City, where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, [[Francis Lynde Stetson|Stetson]], Tracy, and MacVeigh.

The [[Wilson\u2013Gorman Tariff Act]] was introduced by West Virginian Representative [[William Lyne Wilson|William L. Wilson]] in December 1893.<ref>Festus P. Summers, ''William L. Wilson and Tariff Reform: A Biography'' (1974)</ref> After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin.<ref>Nevins, 567; the vote was 204 to 140</ref> The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials.<ref name=\"nevins564\">Nevins, 564\u2013566; Jeffers, 285\u2013287</ref> The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an [[income tax]] of two percent on income above $4,000 ({{Inflation|US|4000|1893|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"nevins564\" />\n\nThe bill was next considered in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by [[Arthur Pue Gorman]] of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed.<ref>Lambert, 213\u201315</ref> The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms.<ref>The income tax component of the Wilson-Gorman Act was partially ruled unconstitutional in 1895. ''See [[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]''</ref> The [[American Sugar Refining Company|Sugar Trust]] in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer.<ref>Nevins, 577\u2013578</ref> Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests.<ref>Nevins, 585\u2013587; Jeffers, 288\u2013289</ref> Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.<ref>Nevins, 564\u2013588; Jeffers, 285\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Voting rights===\nIn 1892, Cleveland had campaigned against the [[Lodge Bill]],<ref>James B. Hedges (1940), \"North America\", in [[William L. Langer]], ed., ''An Encyclopedia of World History'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, Part V, Section G, Subsection 1c, p. 794.</ref> which would have strengthened [[voting rights in the United States|voting rights protections]] through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The [[Enforcement Act of 1871]] had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36).<ref>Congressional Research Service (2004), ''The Constitution of the United States: Analysis and Interpretation\u2014Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002'', Washington: Government Printing Office, \"Fifteenth Amendment\", \"Congressional Enforcement\", \"Federal Remedial Legislation\", p. 2058.</ref> The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'', 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and ''Giles v. Teasley'', 193 U.S. 146 (1904).\n\n===Labor unrest===\n[[File:John t morgan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Tyler Morgan|John T.

Coxey]] began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies.<ref name=\"coxey\" /> This group, known as [[Coxey's Army]], agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts.<ref name=\"coxey\" /> By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the [[United States Capitol]], the group scattered.<ref name=\"coxey\" /> Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.<ref>Graff, 118; Jeffers, 280\u2013281</ref>\n\n===Pullman Strike===\n\n{{Main|Pullman strike}}\n\nThe [[Pullman Strike]] had a significantly greater impact than Coxey's Army. A strike began against the [[Pullman Company]] over low wages and twelve-hour workdays, and sympathy strikes, led by [[American Railway Union]] leader [[Eugene V. Debs]], soon followed.<ref>Nevins, 611\u2013613</ref> By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation's commerce.<ref>Nevins, 614</ref> Because the railroads carried the [[U.S. Postal Service|mail]], and because several of the affected lines were in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal receivership]], Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate.<ref>Nevins, 614\u2013618; Graff, 118\u2013119; Jeffers, 296\u2013297</ref> Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court, and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers.<ref>Nevins, 619\u2013623; Jeffers, 298\u2013302. See also ''[[In re Debs]]''.</ref> \"If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago\", he proclaimed, \"that card will be delivered.\"<ref>Nevins, 628</ref> Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat [[John P. Altgeld]] of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.<ref>Nevins, 624\u2013628; Jeffers, 304\u2013305; Graff, 120</ref>\n\nJust before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor:\n:\"We are on the eve of [a] very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe [is] Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently [discontent] with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.\"<ref>Francis Lynde Stetson to Cleveland, October 7, 1894 in Allan Nevins, ed. ''Letters of Grover Cleveland, 1850\u20131908'' (1933) p. 369</ref>\n\nThe warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.<ref>[[Richard J.

The film also features the return of [[Adrienne King]], [[Betsy Palmer]] and [[Walt Gorney]], who respectively portrayed [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]], [[Pamela Voorhees]], and [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Crazy Ralph|Crazy Ralph]] in the prior installment. It is the second installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' film series]] and a direct sequel to ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980). It picks up five years later, where a new murderer begins stalking the camp counselors at a nearby training camp on Crystal Lake.\n\nOriginally, ''Part 2'' was intended to be part of an [[Anthology film|anthology]] series of films based on the [[Friday the 13th|Friday the 13th superstition]]. However, after the popularity of the original film's surprise ending, the filmmakers opted to continue the story and mythology surrounding Camp Crystal Lake, a trend which would be repeated in every film in the franchise.\n\nLike the original film, ''Part 2'' faced opposition from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], who noted its \"accumulative violence\" as problematic, resulting in numerous cuts being made to allow an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R]] rating. The film was released theatrically in North America on April 30, 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=friday13th2.htm|title=Friday the 13th Part 2|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121206025552/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=friday13th2.htm|archive-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref> Although it did not gross as much as the original, the sequel grossed $21.7 million in the U.S. on a budget of $1.2 million. A sequel, ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'', was released the following year.\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo months after [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|the murders at Camp Crystal Lake]], sole survivor [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] is recovering from her traumatic experience. In her apartment, when Alice opens the refrigerator to get her cat some food, she finds the severed head of [[Pamela Voorhees]] in her refrigerator and is murdered by an unknown assailant with an ice pick to her temple.\n\nFive years later, Paul Holt opens a school for camp counselors on the shore of Crystal Lake. The camp is attended by Sandra Dier, her boyfriend Jeff Dunsberry, troublemaker Scott Cheney, tomboy Terry McCarthy, wheelchair-bound Mark Jarvis, sweet-natured Vickie Perry, jokester Ted Bowen, and Paul's assistant [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]], as well as many other trainees. Around the campfire that night, Paul tells the counselors about the legend of [[Jason Voorhees]], of how he survived his drowning, grew up living in the woods, and is now seeking to kill any intruders to avenge his mother's death. A man with a spear scares everyone, but it's only Ted in a mask. Paul reassures everyone that Jason is dead and that Camp Crystal Lake is now condemned and off limits. That night, Crazy Ralph wanders onto the property to warn the group but is [[garrote]]d from behind a tree. The following day, Jeff and Sandra sneak off to Camp Crystal Lake and find a carcass before getting caught by Deputy Winslow and returned to the camp. Later, Winslow spots someone masked in a [[burlap sack]] running across the road and chases him into the woods and to a shack before he is killed with a hammer claw.\n\nBack at camp, Paul offers the others one last night on the town before the training begins; six stay behind, including Jeff and Sandra, who are forced to stay as punishment for sneaking off. At the bar, Ginny muses that if Jason were still alive and had witnessed his mother's death, it may have left him with no distinction between life and death, or right and wrong. Paul dismisses the idea, proclaiming that Jason is nothing but an [[urban legend]]. Meanwhile, the assailant appears at the camp and kills the counselors, one by one. Scott has his throat slit with a machete while caught in a rope trap, and Terry is killed off-screen upon finding his dead body. Mark gets the machete slammed into his face and falls down a flight of stairs. The killer then moves upstairs and impales Jeff and Sandra with a spear as they have sex, and then stabs Vickie with a kitchen knife.\n\nLater, Ginny and Paul return to find the place in disarray. In the dark, the killer ambushes Paul and continues to chase Ginny throughout the camp and into the woods, where she comes across the shack. After barricading herself inside, she finds an altar with Pamela Voorhees' head on it, surrounded by a pile of bodies. Realizing that Jason Voorhees is the killer, Ginny puts on Pamela's sweater and tries to psychologically convince Jason that she is his mother. The ruse fails when he spots his mother's head on the altar and attacks Ginny. Paul appears and attacks Jason, but he is quickly overwhelmed. Just as Jason is about to kill Paul with a pickaxe, Ginny picks up the machete and slams it down into Jason's shoulder, seemingly killing him.\n\nPaul and Ginny return to the cabin. They think that Jason has followed them, but when they open the door, they are greeted by Terry's dog, Muffin. Suddenly, an unmasked Jason bursts through the window from behind and grabs Ginny. She then awakens to being loaded into an ambulance. She calls out for Paul, who is nowhere to be seen, his fate left ambiguous. Back in the shack, Pamela Voorhees' head remains on the altar as Jason is also [[Friday the 13th Part III|nowhere to be seen]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Anchor|Warrington Gillette}}<!-- until an article is created for him -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Amy Steel]] as [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]]\n* [[John Furey]] as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Paul Holt|Paul Holt]]\n* [[Adrienne King]] as [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]]\n* [[Steve Daskewisz]] as [[Jason Voorhees]]\n** Warrington Gillette as Jason Voorhees (unmasked)\n* [[Stuart Charno|Stu Charno]] as Ted Bowen\n* [[Lauren-Marie Taylor]] as Vickie Perry\n* Marta Kober as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Sandra Dier|Sandra Dier]]\n* [[Tom McBride (actor)|Tom McBride]] as Mark Jarvis\n* [[Bill Randolph]] as Jeff Dunsberry\n* Kirsten Baker as Terry McCarthy\n* [[Russell Todd]] as Scott Cheney\n* [[Walt Gorney]] as [[Crazy Ralph]]\n* [[Betsy Palmer]] as [[Pamela Voorhees]]\n* Jack Marks as Deputy Winslow\n* Cliff Cudney as Max \n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nFollowing the success of ''Friday the 13th'' in 1980, [[Paramount Pictures]] began plans to make a sequel. First acquiring the worldwide distribution rights, Frank Mancuso, Sr. stated, \"We wanted it to be an event, where teenagers would flock to the theaters on that Friday night to see the latest episode.\" The initial ideas for a sequel involved the \"Friday the 13th\" title being used for a series of films, released once a year, that would not have direct continuity with one another but be a separate \"scary movie\" in their own right. Phil Scuderi\u2014one of three owners of Esquire Theaters, along with Steve Minasian and Bob Barsamian, who produced the original film\u2014insisted that the sequel have Jason Voorhees, Pamela's son, even though his appearance in the original film was only meant to be a joke. [[Steve Miner]], associate producer on the first film, believed in the idea and would go on to direct the first two sequels, after Cunningham opted not to return to the director's chair. Miner would use many of the same crew members from the first film while working on the sequels.{{Sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=50\u201352}} Cunningham had mixed feelings about the entire \"Friday the 13th\" enterprise that he outlined for film critic and author [[Stephen Hunter]] in an interview for a book Hunter wrote on violent films. Hunter stated that Cunningham \"wasn't particularly proud\" of his work on these films, and Cunningham bluntly said that the only thing that seemed to reach a teenaged audience at that time involved high levels of gore and graphic violence.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Adrienne King]] was pursued by an obsessed fan after the success of the original ''Friday the 13th'' and purportedly wished her role to be small as possible,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/how-friday-the-13th-star-adrienne-king-uses-her-terrifying-stalker-tale-to-help-her-fans/|title=Friday The 13th\u2019 Star Adrienne King Uses Her Terrifying Stalker Tale To Help Her Fans|publisher=Uproxx|author=Burns, Ashley|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> though in the documentary ''[[Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th]]'', it was stated that King's agent had asked for a higher salary, which the studio could not afford.<ref name=bd/>\n\nThe film's heroine, Ginny, is played by Amy Steel, who won the part through an audition. \"At the time of [making the film], it was before the genre really picked up so I didn\u2019t give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another audition because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from a lot of the people working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and you see a lot of that when I\u2019m on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences. I wanted her to have some power.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/16108/dread-central-s-final-girls-amy-steel/|work=Dread Central|author=Wixson, Heather|date=March 5, 2010|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018012501/https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/16108/dread-central-s-final-girls-amy-steel/|archive-date=October 18, 2018|title=Dread Central\u2019s Final Girls: Amy Steel|access-date=November 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nActor Warrington Gillette played Jason unmasked at the end of the film.

Savini was then replaced by [[Stan Winston]]. Winston, however, had a scheduling conflict and had to drop out of the project.<ref name=bd/> The make-up effects were ultimately handled by Carl Fullerton. Fullerton designed the \"look\" for the adult Jason Voorhees and went with long red hair and a beard while following the facial deformities established in the original film in the make-up designed by Tom Savini for Jason as a child. Fullerton's look for the adult Jason was abandoned in the sequel, ''Friday the 13th Part 3'', despite the fact that the film took place the following day and was helmed by the same director, Steve Miner. Some fans have theorized that the sequence showing Jason with a beard and long hair reflects a \"dream\" rather than a reality because the following sequel picks up with the events showing his face having not happened, and therefore what was represented was Ginny's ''guess'' at what he looked like under the burlap sack rather than what he ''actually'' looked like, which would excuse the break in continuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2015/08/the-continuity-issues-of-jason-voorhees.html|work=Friday the 13th: The Franchise|title=The Continuity Issues Of Jason Voorhees' Appearance Between Part 2 And Part 3|author=Parker, Jason|date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018012138/http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2015/08/the-continuity-issues-of-jason-voorhees.html|archive-date=October 18, 2018|access-date=February 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSteve Daskawisz was rushed to the emergency room during filming after Amy Steel cut his hand with a machete.<ref name=bd/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2011/01/bts-wednesday-part-2-accident-and.html|title=Behind the Scenes: Part 2 accident and the Hospital|work=Friday the 13th: The Franchise|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018014208/http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2011/01/bts-wednesday-part-2-accident-and.html |archive-date=October 18, 2018|author=Parker, Jason|date=January 12, 2011}}</ref> Steel explained, \"The timing was wrong, and he didn't turn his pickaxe properly, and the machete hit his finger.\" Daskawisz received thirteen stitches on his middle finger.

A sequel, ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'', was released the following year.\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo months after [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|the murders at Camp Crystal Lake]], sole survivor [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] is recovering from her traumatic experience. In her apartment, when Alice opens the refrigerator to get her cat some food, she finds the severed head of [[Pamela Voorhees]] in her refrigerator and is murdered by an unknown assailant with an ice pick to her temple.\n\nFive years later, Paul Holt opens a school for camp counselors on the shore of Crystal Lake. The camp is attended by Sandra Dier, her boyfriend Jeff Dunsberry, troublemaker Scott Cheney, tomboy Terry McCarthy, wheelchair-bound Mark Jarvis, sweet-natured Vickie Perry, jokester Ted Bowen, and Paul's assistant [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]], as well as many other trainees. Around the campfire that night, Paul tells the counselors about the legend of [[Jason Voorhees]], of how he survived his drowning, grew up living in the woods, and is now seeking to kill any intruders to avenge his mother's death. A man with a spear scares everyone, but it's only Ted in a mask. Paul reassures everyone that Jason is dead and that Camp Crystal Lake is now condemned and off limits. That night, Crazy Ralph wanders onto the property to warn the group but is [[garrote]]d from behind a tree. The following day, Jeff and Sandra sneak off to Camp Crystal Lake and find a carcass before getting caught by Deputy Winslow and returned to the camp. Later, Winslow spots someone masked in a [[burlap sack]] running across the road and chases him into the woods and to a shack before he is killed with a hammer claw.\n\nBack at camp, Paul offers the others one last night on the town before the training begins; six stay behind, including Jeff and Sandra, who are forced to stay as punishment for sneaking off. At the bar, Ginny muses that if Jason were still alive and had witnessed his mother's death, it may have left him with no distinction between life and death, or right and wrong. Paul dismisses the idea, proclaiming that Jason is nothing but an [[urban legend]]. Meanwhile, the assailant appears at the camp and kills the counselors, one by one. Scott has his throat slit with a machete while caught in a rope trap, and Terry is killed off-screen upon finding his dead body. Mark gets the machete slammed into his face and falls down a flight of stairs. The killer then moves upstairs and impales Jeff and Sandra with a spear as they have sex, and then stabs Vickie with a kitchen knife.\n\nLater, Ginny and Paul return to find the place in disarray. In the dark, the killer ambushes Paul and continues to chase Ginny throughout the camp and into the woods, where she comes across the shack. After barricading herself inside, she finds an altar with Pamela Voorhees' head on it, surrounded by a pile of bodies. Realizing that Jason Voorhees is the killer, Ginny puts on Pamela's sweater and tries to psychologically convince Jason that she is his mother. The ruse fails when he spots his mother's head on the altar and attacks Ginny. Paul appears and attacks Jason, but he is quickly overwhelmed. Just as Jason is about to kill Paul with a pickaxe, Ginny picks up the machete and slams it down into Jason's shoulder, seemingly killing him.\n\nPaul and Ginny return to the cabin. They think that Jason has followed them, but when they open the door, they are greeted by Terry's dog, Muffin. Suddenly, an unmasked Jason bursts through the window from behind and grabs Ginny.

First acquiring the worldwide distribution rights, Frank Mancuso, Sr. stated, \"We wanted it to be an event, where teenagers would flock to the theaters on that Friday night to see the latest episode.\" The initial ideas for a sequel involved the \"Friday the 13th\" title being used for a series of films, released once a year, that would not have direct continuity with one another but be a separate \"scary movie\" in their own right. Phil Scuderi\u2014one of three owners of Esquire Theaters, along with Steve Minasian and Bob Barsamian, who produced the original film\u2014insisted that the sequel have Jason Voorhees, Pamela's son, even though his appearance in the original film was only meant to be a joke. [[Steve Miner]], associate producer on the first film, believed in the idea and would go on to direct the first two sequels, after Cunningham opted not to return to the director's chair. Miner would use many of the same crew members from the first film while working on the sequels.{{Sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=50\u201352}} Cunningham had mixed feelings about the entire \"Friday the 13th\" enterprise that he outlined for film critic and author [[Stephen Hunter]] in an interview for a book Hunter wrote on violent films. Hunter stated that Cunningham \"wasn't particularly proud\" of his work on these films, and Cunningham bluntly said that the only thing that seemed to reach a teenaged audience at that time involved high levels of gore and graphic violence.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Adrienne King]] was pursued by an obsessed fan after the success of the original ''Friday the 13th'' and purportedly wished her role to be small as possible,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/how-friday-the-13th-star-adrienne-king-uses-her-terrifying-stalker-tale-to-help-her-fans/|title=Friday The 13th\u2019 Star Adrienne King Uses Her Terrifying Stalker Tale To Help Her Fans|publisher=Uproxx|author=Burns, Ashley|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> though in the documentary ''[[Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th]]'', it was stated that King's agent had asked for a higher salary, which the studio could not afford.<ref name=bd/>\n\nThe film's heroine, Ginny, is played by Amy Steel, who won the part through an audition. \"At the time of [making the film], it was before the genre really picked up so I didn\u2019t give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another audition because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from a lot of the people working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and you see a lot of that when I\u2019m on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences.

Fullerton designed the \"look\" for the adult Jason Voorhees and went with long red hair and a beard while following the facial deformities established in the original film in the make-up designed by Tom Savini for Jason as a child. Fullerton's look for the adult Jason was abandoned in the sequel, ''Friday the 13th Part 3'', despite the fact that the film took place the following day and was helmed by the same director, Steve Miner. Some fans have theorized that the sequence showing Jason with a beard and long hair reflects a \"dream\" rather than a reality because the following sequel picks up with the events showing his face having not happened, and therefore what was represented was Ginny's ''guess'' at what he looked like under the burlap sack rather than what he ''actually'' looked like, which would excuse the break in continuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2015/08/the-continuity-issues-of-jason-voorhees.html|work=Friday the 13th: The Franchise|title=The Continuity Issues Of Jason Voorhees' Appearance Between Part 2 And Part 3|author=Parker, Jason|date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018012138/http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2015/08/the-continuity-issues-of-jason-voorhees.html|archive-date=October 18, 2018|access-date=February 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSteve Daskawisz was rushed to the emergency room during filming after Amy Steel cut his hand with a machete.<ref name=bd/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2011/01/bts-wednesday-part-2-accident-and.html|title=Behind the Scenes: Part 2 accident and the Hospital|work=Friday the 13th: The Franchise|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018014208/http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2011/01/bts-wednesday-part-2-accident-and.html |archive-date=October 18, 2018|author=Parker, Jason|date=January 12, 2011}}</ref> Steel explained, \"The timing was wrong, and he didn't turn his pickaxe properly, and the machete hit his finger.\" Daskawisz received thirteen stitches on his middle finger.
