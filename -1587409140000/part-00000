Band members are Nathan Willett (vocals, piano, guitar), Matt Maust (bass guitar), David Quon (guitar, backing vocals), Matthew Schwartz (keyboards, backing vocals, guitar, percussion), and [[Joe Plummer]] (drums, percussion). Former members of the band include [[Dann Gallucci]] (guitar, keyboards, percussion), Matt Aveiro (drums, percussion), and Jonnie Russell (guitar, [[backing vocals|vocals]], piano, keyboards, percussion).\n\nForming in 2004 in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] California, the Cold War Kids' early releases came from [[independent record label]] Monarchy Music. In 2006, the band signed with [[Downtown Records|Downtown]]/[[V2 Records|V2]] and released their major label debut ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' to cult appeal from fans and critics. 2008's ''[[Loyalty to Loyalty]]'' and 2011's ''[[Mine Is Yours]]'' saw the band develop different musical sounds and lyrical content throughout to mixed reviews. The band's seventh studio album, ''New Age Norms 1'', was released on November 1, 2019.\n\n==History==\n\n===2004\u20132006: Early years and ''Robbers & Cowards''===\n[[File:ColdWarKids NY07 rotated cropped.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Cold War Kids performing at the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City, 2007]]\nThe members of Cold War Kids met at [[Biola University]].<ref name=\"Stereogum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/4368/christianity_and_the_cold_war_kids_backlash/news/|title=Christianity And The Cold War Kids Backlash|author=Stereogum Staff|work=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref> They formed a band in 2004 when they would meet regularly in Jonnie Russell's apartment above a restaurant called Mulberry Street in downtown [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]]. Maust came up with the band's name around 1997, during his travels in Eastern Europe with his brother, where they found a park in [[Budapest]] with missing statues, taken away after Communism fell. Seeing that there was a playground in the park, Maust said \"...being in that environment just made the phrase 'Cold War Kids' pop into my head. I may have heard it before.

Between tours, the band released two more EPs: ''[[With Our Wallets Full]]'' and ''[[Up in Rags]]'', in 2006. Monarchy Music would re-release those EPs as one compilation album titled ''[[Up in Rags/With Our Wallets Full]]'' in 2006.\n\nIn summer 2006, Cold War Kids signed with [[Downtown Records]] and started work on their debut album.

Band members are Nathan Willett (vocals, piano, guitar), Matt Maust (bass guitar), David Quon (guitar, backing vocals), Matthew Schwartz (keyboards, backing vocals, guitar, percussion), and [[Joe Plummer]] (drums, percussion). Former members of the band include [[Dann Gallucci]] (guitar, keyboards, percussion), Matt Aveiro (drums, percussion), and Jonnie Russell (guitar, [[backing vocals|vocals]], piano, keyboards, percussion).\n\nForming in 2004 in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] California, the Cold War Kids' early releases came from [[independent record label]] Monarchy Music. In 2006, the band signed with [[Downtown Records|Downtown]]/[[V2 Records|V2]] and released their major label debut ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' to cult appeal from fans and critics. 2008's ''[[Loyalty to Loyalty]]'' and 2011's ''[[Mine Is Yours]]'' saw the band develop different musical sounds and lyrical content throughout to mixed reviews. The band's seventh studio album, ''New Age Norms 1'', was released on November 1, 2019.\n\n==History==\n\n===2004\u20132006: Early years and ''Robbers & Cowards''===\n[[File:ColdWarKids NY07 rotated cropped.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Cold War Kids performing at the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City, 2007]]\nThe members of Cold War Kids met at [[Biola University]].<ref name=\"Stereogum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/4368/christianity_and_the_cold_war_kids_backlash/news/|title=Christianity And The Cold War Kids Backlash|author=Stereogum Staff|work=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref> They formed a band in 2004 when they would meet regularly in Jonnie Russell's apartment above a restaurant called Mulberry Street in downtown [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]]. Maust came up with the band's name around 1997, during his travels in Eastern Europe with his brother, where they found a park in [[Budapest]] with missing statues, taken away after Communism fell. Seeing that there was a playground in the park, Maust said \"...being in that environment just made the phrase 'Cold War Kids' pop into my head. I may have heard it before.

The band relocated to [[Whittier, California]], and began recording their first demo, which Monarchy Music released as the EP ''[[Mulberry Street (EP)|Mulberry Street]]'' (based on the restaurant where they regularly met) in spring 2005.

The French arrived in 1604, claiming the Mi'kmaq lands for the King of France. Despite this, the Mi'kmaq tolerated the presence of the French in exchange for favours and trade. Catholic Mi'kmaq and Acadians were the predominant populations in the colony for the next 150 years.\n\nEarly European colonists, who would later become known as [[Acadians]], were French subjects primarily from the [[Pleumartin]] to [[Poitiers]] in the [[Vienne]] ''[[d\u00e9partement]]'' of west-central France. The first French settlement was established by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts|Pierre Dugua des Monts]], [[List of Acadian governors|Governor of Acadia]], under the authority of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]], on [[Saint Croix Island, New Brunswick|Saint Croix Island]] in 1604. The following year, the settlement was moved across the [[Bay of Fundy]] to [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] after a difficult winter on the island and deaths from [[scurvy]]. In 1607 the colony received bad news: King Henry had revoked Sieur de Monts' royal fur monopoly, citing that the income was insufficient to justify supplying the colony further. Thus recalled, the last of the Acadians left Port Royal in August 1607. Their allies, the native [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] nation, kept careful watch over their possessions, though. When the former lieutenant governor, [[Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just]], returned in 1610, he found Port Royal just as it was left.{{sfn|Faragher|2005|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nDuring the first 80 years, the French and Acadians were in Acadia, there were ten significant battles as the English, Scottish, [[Jurriaen Aernoutsz|Dutch]] and French fought for possession of the colony. These battles happened at [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]],{{efn|Until 1784, New Brunswick was considered part of Nova Scotia.}} Cap de Sable (present-day [[Port La Tour, Nova Scotia]]), [[Jemseg, New Brunswick|Jemseg]], [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] and [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Baleine]].\n\nDuring the next 74 years, there were six colonial wars that took place in Nova Scotia and Acadia (see the [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]). These wars were fought between [[New England]] and [[New France]] and their respective native allies before the British defeated the French in North America (1763). After the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Siege of Port Royal]] in 1710, mainland Nova Scotia was under the control of British colonial government, but both present-day [[New Brunswick]] and virtually all of present-day Maine remained contested territory between New England and New France.\n\nThe war was fought on two fronts: the southern border of Acadia, which New France defined as the [[Kennebec River]] in southern Maine.{{sfn|Williamson|1832|pages=27, 266, 293}} The other front was in Nova Scotia and involved preventing the British from taking the capital of Acadia, Port Royal (See [[Queen Anne's War]]), establishing themselves at [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]] (See [[Father Rale's War]]) and founding Halifax (see [[Father Le Loutre's War]]).\n\n===Acadian Civil War===\n{{main|Acadian Civil War}}\n[[File:Madame La Tour Defending Fort St.Jean.jpg|thumb|Siege of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] (1645) \u2013 d'Aulnay defeats La Tour in Acadia]]\n\nFrom 1640 to 1645, Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war.

In 1763, Britain would designate lands west of the Appalachians as the \"Indian Reserve\", but did not respect Mi'kmaq title to the Atlantic region, claiming title was obtained from the French. The Mi'kmaq remain in Acadia to this day. After 1764, many exiled Acadians finally settled in [[Spanish Louisiana|Louisiana]], which had been transferred by France to Spain at the end of the French and Indian War. The [[demonym]] ''Acadian'' developed into ''[[Cajun]],'' which was first used as a pejorative term until its later mainstream acceptance.

England controlled the area from 1621 to 1632 (see [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]]) and again from 1654 until 1670 (see [[William Crowne]] and [[Thomas Temple]]), with control permanently regained by its successor state, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], in 1710 (ceded under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713). Although France controlled the territory in the remaining periods, French monarchs consistently neglected Acadia.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} Civil government under the French regime was held by a series of Governors (see [[List of governors of Acadia]]). The government of New France was located in Quebec, but it had only nominal authority over the Acadians.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=9}}\n\nThe Acadians implemented village self-rule.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=176}} Even after Canada had given up its elected spokesmen, the Acadians continued to demand a say in their own government, as late as 1706 petitioning the monarchy to allow them to elect spokesmen each year by a plurality of voices. In a sign of his indifference to the colony, [[Louis XV]] agreed to their demand.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=175}} This representative assembly was a direct offshoot of a government system that developed out of the seigneurial and church parish imported from Europe. The seigneurial system was a \"set of legal regimes and practices pertaining to local landholding, politics, economics, and jurisprudence.\"<ref name=\"Fowler2009\">{{cite thesis |last=Fowler |first=Jonathan |title=The Neutral French of Mi'kma'ki: And Archaeology of Acadian Identities Prior to 1755 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLMGngEACAAJ&pg=PP1 |year=2009 |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Oxford University}}</ref> Many of the French Governors of Acadia prior to [[Hector d'Andign\u00e9 de Grandfontaine]] held seigneuries in Acadia. As Seigneur, in addition to the power held as governor, they held the right to grant land, collect their seigneurial rents, and act in judgement over disputes within their domain.<ref name=\"Fowler2009\"/> After Acadia came under direct Royal rule under Grandfontaine the Seigneurs continued to fulfill governance roles. The Acadian seignuerial system came to an end when the British Crown bought the seigneurial rights in the 1730s. The Catholic parish system along with the accompanying parish priest also aided in the development Acadian self-government. Priests, given their respected position, often assisted the community in representation with the civil government located at Port Royal/Annapolis Royal. Within each parish the Acadians used the elected \"marguilliers\" (wardens) of the \"conseil de fabrique\" to administer more than just the churches' affairs in the Parishes. The Acadians extended this system to see to the administrative needs of the community in general. The Acadians protected this structure from the priests and were \"No mere subordinates to clerical authority, wardens were \"always suspicious of any interference by the priests\" in the life of the rural parish, an institution which was, ... , largely a creation of the inhabitants.\"<ref name=\"Fowler2009\"/> During the British regime many of the Deputies were drawn from this ''marguillier'' group.\n\nThe Acadians occupied a borderland region of the British and French empires. As such the Acadian homeland was subjected to the ravages of war on numerous occasions. Through experience the Acadians learned to distrust imperial authorities (British and French). This is evidenced in a small way when Acadians were uncooperative with census takers.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} Administrators complained of constant in-fighting among the population, which filed many petty civil suits with colonial magistrates. Most of these were over boundary lines, as the Acadians were very quick to protect their new lands.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=8}}\n\n===Governance under the British after 1710===\n{{main|Deputy (Acadian)}}\nAfter 1710, the British military administration continued to utilize the deputy system the Acadians had developed under French colonial rule. Prior to 1732 the deputies were appointed by the governor from men in the districts of Acadian families \"as ancientest and most considerable in Lands & possessions,\".{{sfn|MacMechan|1900|page=59|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/acalendartwolet01macmgoog#page/n72/mode/2up]}} This appears to be in contravention of various [[British penal law]]s which made it nearly impossible for Roman Catholics and Protestant recusants to hold military and government positions. The need for effective administration and communication in many of the British colonies trumped the laws. In 1732 the governance institution was formalized. Under the formalized system the colony was divided into eight districts. Annually on October 11 free elections were to take place where each district, depending on its size, was to elect two, three, or four deputies. In observance of the Lord's Day, if October 11 fell on a Sunday the elections were to take place on the immediately following Monday. Notice of the annual election was to be given in all districts thirty days before the election date. Immediately following election, deputies, both outgoing and incoming, were to report to Annapolis Royal to receive the governor's approval and instructions. Prior to 1732 deputies had complained about the time and expense of holding office and carrying out their duties. Under the new elected deputy system each district was to provide for the expenses of their elected deputies. The duties of the deputies were broad and included reporting to the government in council the affairs of the districts, distribution of government proclamations, assistance in the settlement of various local disputes (primarily related to land), and ensuring that various weights and measures used in trade were \"Conformable to the Standard\".{{sfn|MacMechan|1900|p=190|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/acalendartwolet01macmgoog#page/n204/mode/2up/]}}\n\nIn addition to deputies, several other public positions existed. Each district had a clerk who worked closely with the deputies and under his duties recorded the records and orders of government, deeds and conveyances, and kept other public records. With the rapid expansion of the Acadian populace, there was also a growing number of cattle and sheep. The burgeoning herds and flocks, often free-ranging, necessitated the creation of the position of Overseer of Flocks. These individuals controlled where the flocks grazed, settled disputes and recorded the names of individuals slaughtering animals to ensure proper ownership. Skins and hides were inspected for brands. After the purchase by the British Crown of the seigniorial rights in Acadia, various rents and fees were due to the Crown. In the Minas, Piziquid and Cobequid Districts the seigniorial fees were collected by the \"Collector & Receiver of All His Majesty's Quit Rents, Dues, or Revenues\". The Collector was to keep a record of all rents and other fees collected, submit the rents to Annapolis Royal, and retain fifteen percent to cover his expenses.{{sfn|MacMechan|1900|p=248|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/acalendartwolet01macmgoog#page/n262/mode/2up]}}<ref name=Morris>{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Charles |title=A Brief Survey of Nova Scotia |via=The National Archives of Canada |publisher=The Royal Artillery Regimental Library, Woolwich, UK}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[Image:Acadie 1750.JPG|right|thumb|350px|Main Acadian communities of Acadia before the deportation]]\nBefore 1654, trading companies and patent holders concerned with fishing recruited men in France to come to Acadia to work at the commercial outposts.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=92}} The original Acadian population was a small number of [[indentured servant]]s and soldiers brought by the fur-trading companies. Gradually, fishermen began settling in the area as well, rather than return to France with the seasonal fishing fleet.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} The majority of the recruiting took place at [[La Rochelle]]. Between 1653 and 1654, 104 men were recruited at La Rochelle. Of these, 31% were builders, 15% were soldiers and sailors, 8% were food preparers, 6.7% were farm workers, and an additional 6.7% worked in the clothing trades.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=92}} Fifty-five percent of Acadia's first families came from western and west-central France, primarily from [[Poitou]], Aunis, [[Angoumois]], and [[Saintonge]]. Over 85% of these (47% of the total), were former residents of the La Chauss\u00e9e area of Poitou.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=8}} Many of the families who arrived in 1632 with Razilly shared some blood ties; those not related by blood shared cultural ties with the others.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=8}} The number of original immigrants was very small, and only about 100 surnames existed within the Acadian community.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} Although the majority of Acadian settlers came from France there were also members of the populace from Ireland, Spain (both Spanish and Basque), Portugal, England, Scotland, Belgium (Flemish), Channel Islands, and Croatia.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=White |title=Patronymes Acadiens/Acadian Family Names |publisher=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Monument Lefebvre |location=Moncton, New Brunswick |date=1992}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Acadia.svg|thumb|This Acadian flag was established at the second Acadian Convention in 1884 at Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/acadian/feature_acadian_flag.html |publisher=CBC |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>]]\n\nSome of the earliest settlers married women of the local [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] tribe who had converted to Roman Catholicism.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} A Parisian lawyer, Marc Lescarbot, who spent just over a year in Acadia, arriving in May 1606, described the Micmac as having \"courage, fidelity, generosity, and humanity, and their hospitality is so innate and praiseworthy that they receive among them every man who is not an enemy.

The colony had limited economic support or cultural contacts with France, leaving a \"social vacuum\" that allowed \"individual talents and industry ... [to supplant] inherited social position as the measure of a man's worth.\"{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=3}} Acadians lived as social equals, with the elderly and priests considered slightly superior.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=175}} Unlike the French colonists in Canada and the early English colonies in [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] and [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Acadians maintained an extended kinship system,{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=3}} and the large extended families assisted in building homes and barns, as well as cultivating and harvesting crops.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=11}} They also relied on interfamily cooperation to accomplish community goals, such as building dikes to reclaim tidal marshes.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=270}}\n\nMarriages were generally not love matches but were arranged for economic or social reasons. Parental consent was required for anyone under 25 who wished to marry, and both the mother's and father's consent was recorded in the marriage deed.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=180}} Divorce was not permitted in New France, and annulments were almost impossible to get. Legal separation was offered as an option but was seldom used.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=229}}\n\nThe Acadians were suspicious of outsiders and on occasion did not readily cooperate with census takers. The first reliable population figures for the area came with the census of 1671, which noted fewer than 450 people. By 1714, the Acadian population had expanded to 2,528&nbsp;individuals, mostly from natural increase rather than immigration.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} Most Acadian women in the 18th century gave birth to living children an average of eleven times. Although these numbers are identical to those in Canada, 75% of Acadian children reached adulthood, many more than in other parts of New France. The isolation of the Acadian communities meant the people were not exposed to many of the imported epidemics, allowing the children to remain healthier.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=219}}\n\nIn the 18th century, some Acadians migrated to nearby [[\u00cele Saint-Jean]] (now Prince Edward Island) to take advantage of the fertile cropland. In 1732, the island had 347 settlers but within 25 years its population had expanded to 5000 Europeans.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=6}} The bulk of this population explosion on \u00cele Saint-Jean took place in the early 1750s and has as its source Acadians removing themselves during the rising tensions on peninsular Nova Scotia after the settlement of Halifax in 1749. Le Loutre played a role in these removals through acts of encouragement and threats. The exodus to \u00cele Saint-Jean became a flood with refugees fleeing British held territory after the initial expulsions of 1755.\n\nIn 1714, a few Acadian families emigrated to [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]]. These families had little property. But for the majority of Acadians, they could not be enticed by the French government to abandon their heritage and the land of their forefathers for an area which was unknown and uncultivated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arsenault|first=Bona|title=Histoire des Acadiens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9vN1chq0i0C&pg=PA114|year=2004|publisher=Les Editions Fides|isbn=978-2-7621-2613-6|page=114}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nMost Acadian households were self-sufficient,{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=10}} with families engaged in subsistence farming only for a few years while they established their farms.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=9}} Very rapidly the Acadians established productive farms that yielded surplus crops that allowed them to trade with both Boston and Louisbourg.{{efn|Fowler's analysis of census records and other primary documents reveal that most farms by 1686 were producing in livestock alone, on a per capita basis, twice as much as was needed for their own consumption.

The high salinity of the reclaimed coastal marshland meant that the land would need to sit for three years after it was drained before it could be cultivated.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=11}} The land reclamation techniques that were used closely resembled the enclosures near La Rochelle that helped make solar salt.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}}\n\nAs time progressed, the Acadian agriculture improved, and Acadians traded with the British colonies in [[New England]] to gain ironware, fine cloth, rum, and salt. During the French administration of Acadia, this trade was illegal, but it did not stop some English traders from establishing small stores in Port Royal.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=174}} Under English rule, the Acadians traded with New England and often smuggled their excess food to Boston merchants waiting at Baie Verte for transshipment to the French at Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=16}}\n\nMany adult sons who did not inherit land from their parents settled on adjacent vacant lands to remain close to their families.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=178}} As the Acadian population expanded and available land became limited around Port Royal, new settlements took root to the northeast, in the Upper [[Bay of Fundy]], including Mines, Pisiquid, and [[Beaubassin]].

The French arrived in 1604, claiming the Mi'kmaq lands for the King of France. Despite this, the Mi'kmaq tolerated the presence of the French in exchange for favours and trade. Catholic Mi'kmaq and Acadians were the predominant populations in the colony for the next 150 years.\n\nEarly European colonists, who would later become known as [[Acadians]], were French subjects primarily from the [[Pleumartin]] to [[Poitiers]] in the [[Vienne]] ''[[d\u00e9partement]]'' of west-central France. The first French settlement was established by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts|Pierre Dugua des Monts]], [[List of Acadian governors|Governor of Acadia]], under the authority of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]], on [[Saint Croix Island, New Brunswick|Saint Croix Island]] in 1604. The following year, the settlement was moved across the [[Bay of Fundy]] to [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] after a difficult winter on the island and deaths from [[scurvy]]. In 1607 the colony received bad news: King Henry had revoked Sieur de Monts' royal fur monopoly, citing that the income was insufficient to justify supplying the colony further. Thus recalled, the last of the Acadians left Port Royal in August 1607. Their allies, the native [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] nation, kept careful watch over their possessions, though. When the former lieutenant governor, [[Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just]], returned in 1610, he found Port Royal just as it was left.{{sfn|Faragher|2005|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nDuring the first 80 years, the French and Acadians were in Acadia, there were ten significant battles as the English, Scottish, [[Jurriaen Aernoutsz|Dutch]] and French fought for possession of the colony. These battles happened at [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]],{{efn|Until 1784, New Brunswick was considered part of Nova Scotia.}} Cap de Sable (present-day [[Port La Tour, Nova Scotia]]), [[Jemseg, New Brunswick|Jemseg]], [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] and [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Baleine]].\n\nDuring the next 74 years, there were six colonial wars that took place in Nova Scotia and Acadia (see the [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]). These wars were fought between [[New England]] and [[New France]] and their respective native allies before the British defeated the French in North America (1763). After the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Siege of Port Royal]] in 1710, mainland Nova Scotia was under the control of British colonial government, but both present-day [[New Brunswick]] and virtually all of present-day Maine remained contested territory between New England and New France.\n\nThe war was fought on two fronts: the southern border of Acadia, which New France defined as the [[Kennebec River]] in southern Maine.{{sfn|Williamson|1832|pages=27, 266, 293}} The other front was in Nova Scotia and involved preventing the British from taking the capital of Acadia, Port Royal (See [[Queen Anne's War]]), establishing themselves at [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]] (See [[Father Rale's War]]) and founding Halifax (see [[Father Le Loutre's War]]).\n\n===Acadian Civil War===\n{{main|Acadian Civil War}}\n[[File:Madame La Tour Defending Fort St.Jean.jpg|thumb|Siege of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] (1645) \u2013 d'Aulnay defeats La Tour in Acadia]]\n\nFrom 1640 to 1645, Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war.

Then, in mid-August, a larger French force arrived before Fort Anne, but was also unable to mount an effective attack or siege against the garrison, which had received supplies and reinforcements from [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]]. In 1745, British colonial forces conducted the [[Siege of Port Toulouse]] (St. Peter's) and then [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured Fortress Louisbourg]] after a siege of six weeks.

In 1763, Britain would designate lands west of the Appalachians as the \"Indian Reserve\", but did not respect Mi'kmaq title to the Atlantic region, claiming title was obtained from the French. The Mi'kmaq remain in Acadia to this day.

England controlled the area from 1621 to 1632 (see [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]]) and again from 1654 until 1670 (see [[William Crowne]] and [[Thomas Temple]]), with control permanently regained by its successor state, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], in 1710 (ceded under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713). Although France controlled the territory in the remaining periods, French monarchs consistently neglected Acadia.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} Civil government under the French regime was held by a series of Governors (see [[List of governors of Acadia]]). The government of New France was located in Quebec, but it had only nominal authority over the Acadians.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=9}}\n\nThe Acadians implemented village self-rule.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=176}} Even after Canada had given up its elected spokesmen, the Acadians continued to demand a say in their own government, as late as 1706 petitioning the monarchy to allow them to elect spokesmen each year by a plurality of voices. In a sign of his indifference to the colony, [[Louis XV]] agreed to their demand.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=175}} This representative assembly was a direct offshoot of a government system that developed out of the seigneurial and church parish imported from Europe. The seigneurial system was a \"set of legal regimes and practices pertaining to local landholding, politics, economics, and jurisprudence.\"<ref name=\"Fowler2009\">{{cite thesis |last=Fowler |first=Jonathan |title=The Neutral French of Mi'kma'ki: And Archaeology of Acadian Identities Prior to 1755 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLMGngEACAAJ&pg=PP1 |year=2009 |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Oxford University}}</ref> Many of the French Governors of Acadia prior to [[Hector d'Andign\u00e9 de Grandfontaine]] held seigneuries in Acadia. As Seigneur, in addition to the power held as governor, they held the right to grant land, collect their seigneurial rents, and act in judgement over disputes within their domain.<ref name=\"Fowler2009\"/> After Acadia came under direct Royal rule under Grandfontaine the Seigneurs continued to fulfill governance roles. The Acadian seignuerial system came to an end when the British Crown bought the seigneurial rights in the 1730s. The Catholic parish system along with the accompanying parish priest also aided in the development Acadian self-government. Priests, given their respected position, often assisted the community in representation with the civil government located at Port Royal/Annapolis Royal. Within each parish the Acadians used the elected \"marguilliers\" (wardens) of the \"conseil de fabrique\" to administer more than just the churches' affairs in the Parishes. The Acadians extended this system to see to the administrative needs of the community in general. The Acadians protected this structure from the priests and were \"No mere subordinates to clerical authority, wardens were \"always suspicious of any interference by the priests\" in the life of the rural parish, an institution which was, ... , largely a creation of the inhabitants.\"<ref name=\"Fowler2009\"/> During the British regime many of the Deputies were drawn from this ''marguillier'' group.\n\nThe Acadians occupied a borderland region of the British and French empires. As such the Acadian homeland was subjected to the ravages of war on numerous occasions. Through experience the Acadians learned to distrust imperial authorities (British and French). This is evidenced in a small way when Acadians were uncooperative with census takers.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} Administrators complained of constant in-fighting among the population, which filed many petty civil suits with colonial magistrates. Most of these were over boundary lines, as the Acadians were very quick to protect their new lands.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=8}}\n\n===Governance under the British after 1710===\n{{main|Deputy (Acadian)}}\nAfter 1710, the British military administration continued to utilize the deputy system the Acadians had developed under French colonial rule. Prior to 1732 the deputies were appointed by the governor from men in the districts of Acadian families \"as ancientest and most considerable in Lands & possessions,\".{{sfn|MacMechan|1900|page=59|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/acalendartwolet01macmgoog#page/n72/mode/2up]}} This appears to be in contravention of various [[British penal law]]s which made it nearly impossible for Roman Catholics and Protestant recusants to hold military and government positions. The need for effective administration and communication in many of the British colonies trumped the laws. In 1732 the governance institution was formalized. Under the formalized system the colony was divided into eight districts. Annually on October 11 free elections were to take place where each district, depending on its size, was to elect two, three, or four deputies. In observance of the Lord's Day, if October 11 fell on a Sunday the elections were to take place on the immediately following Monday. Notice of the annual election was to be given in all districts thirty days before the election date. Immediately following election, deputies, both outgoing and incoming, were to report to Annapolis Royal to receive the governor's approval and instructions. Prior to 1732 deputies had complained about the time and expense of holding office and carrying out their duties. Under the new elected deputy system each district was to provide for the expenses of their elected deputies. The duties of the deputies were broad and included reporting to the government in council the affairs of the districts, distribution of government proclamations, assistance in the settlement of various local disputes (primarily related to land), and ensuring that various weights and measures used in trade were \"Conformable to the Standard\".{{sfn|MacMechan|1900|p=190|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/acalendartwolet01macmgoog#page/n204/mode/2up/]}}\n\nIn addition to deputies, several other public positions existed. Each district had a clerk who worked closely with the deputies and under his duties recorded the records and orders of government, deeds and conveyances, and kept other public records. With the rapid expansion of the Acadian populace, there was also a growing number of cattle and sheep. The burgeoning herds and flocks, often free-ranging, necessitated the creation of the position of Overseer of Flocks. These individuals controlled where the flocks grazed, settled disputes and recorded the names of individuals slaughtering animals to ensure proper ownership. Skins and hides were inspected for brands. After the purchase by the British Crown of the seigniorial rights in Acadia, various rents and fees were due to the Crown. In the Minas, Piziquid and Cobequid Districts the seigniorial fees were collected by the \"Collector & Receiver of All His Majesty's Quit Rents, Dues, or Revenues\". The Collector was to keep a record of all rents and other fees collected, submit the rents to Annapolis Royal, and retain fifteen percent to cover his expenses.{{sfn|MacMechan|1900|p=248|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/acalendartwolet01macmgoog#page/n262/mode/2up]}}<ref name=Morris>{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Charles |title=A Brief Survey of Nova Scotia |via=The National Archives of Canada |publisher=The Royal Artillery Regimental Library, Woolwich, UK}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[Image:Acadie 1750.JPG|right|thumb|350px|Main Acadian communities of Acadia before the deportation]]\nBefore 1654, trading companies and patent holders concerned with fishing recruited men in France to come to Acadia to work at the commercial outposts.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=92}} The original Acadian population was a small number of [[indentured servant]]s and soldiers brought by the fur-trading companies.

The colony had limited economic support or cultural contacts with France, leaving a \"social vacuum\" that allowed \"individual talents and industry ... [to supplant] inherited social position as the measure of a man's worth.\"{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=3}} Acadians lived as social equals, with the elderly and priests considered slightly superior.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=175}} Unlike the French colonists in Canada and the early English colonies in [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] and [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], Acadians maintained an extended kinship system,{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=3}} and the large extended families assisted in building homes and barns, as well as cultivating and harvesting crops.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=11}} They also relied on interfamily cooperation to accomplish community goals, such as building dikes to reclaim tidal marshes.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=270}}\n\nMarriages were generally not love matches but were arranged for economic or social reasons. Parental consent was required for anyone under 25 who wished to marry, and both the mother's and father's consent was recorded in the marriage deed.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=180}} Divorce was not permitted in New France, and annulments were almost impossible to get. Legal separation was offered as an option but was seldom used.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=229}}\n\nThe Acadians were suspicious of outsiders and on occasion did not readily cooperate with census takers. The first reliable population figures for the area came with the census of 1671, which noted fewer than 450 people. By 1714, the Acadian population had expanded to 2,528&nbsp;individuals, mostly from natural increase rather than immigration.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}} Most Acadian women in the 18th century gave birth to living children an average of eleven times. Although these numbers are identical to those in Canada, 75% of Acadian children reached adulthood, many more than in other parts of New France. The isolation of the Acadian communities meant the people were not exposed to many of the imported epidemics, allowing the children to remain healthier.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=219}}\n\nIn the 18th century, some Acadians migrated to nearby [[\u00cele Saint-Jean]] (now Prince Edward Island) to take advantage of the fertile cropland. In 1732, the island had 347 settlers but within 25 years its population had expanded to 5000 Europeans.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=6}} The bulk of this population explosion on \u00cele Saint-Jean took place in the early 1750s and has as its source Acadians removing themselves during the rising tensions on peninsular Nova Scotia after the settlement of Halifax in 1749. Le Loutre played a role in these removals through acts of encouragement and threats. The exodus to \u00cele Saint-Jean became a flood with refugees fleeing British held territory after the initial expulsions of 1755.\n\nIn 1714, a few Acadian families emigrated to [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]]. These families had little property. But for the majority of Acadians, they could not be enticed by the French government to abandon their heritage and the land of their forefathers for an area which was unknown and uncultivated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arsenault|first=Bona|title=Histoire des Acadiens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9vN1chq0i0C&pg=PA114|year=2004|publisher=Les Editions Fides|isbn=978-2-7621-2613-6|page=114}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nMost Acadian households were self-sufficient,{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=10}} with families engaged in subsistence farming only for a few years while they established their farms.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=9}} Very rapidly the Acadians established productive farms that yielded surplus crops that allowed them to trade with both Boston and Louisbourg.{{efn|Fowler's analysis of census records and other primary documents reveal that most farms by 1686 were producing in livestock alone, on a per capita basis, twice as much as was needed for their own consumption.

The high salinity of the reclaimed coastal marshland meant that the land would need to sit for three years after it was drained before it could be cultivated.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=11}} The land reclamation techniques that were used closely resembled the enclosures near La Rochelle that helped make solar salt.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=7}}\n\nAs time progressed, the Acadian agriculture improved, and Acadians traded with the British colonies in [[New England]] to gain ironware, fine cloth, rum, and salt. During the French administration of Acadia, this trade was illegal, but it did not stop some English traders from establishing small stores in Port Royal.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=174}} Under English rule, the Acadians traded with New England and often smuggled their excess food to Boston merchants waiting at Baie Verte for transshipment to the French at Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island.{{sfn|Brasseaux|1987|p=16}}\n\nMany adult sons who did not inherit land from their parents settled on adjacent vacant lands to remain close to their families.{{sfn|Moogk|2000|p=178}} As the Acadian population expanded and available land became limited around Port Royal, new settlements took root to the northeast, in the Upper [[Bay of Fundy]], including Mines, Pisiquid, and [[Beaubassin]].

For example, The Non Governmental Organizations (Amendment) Act, passed in 2006, has stifled the productivity of NGOs through erecting barriers to entry, activity, funding and assembly within the sector.  Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures (i.e. requiring recommendations from government officials; annual re-registration), unreasonable regulation of operations (i.e. requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO's area of interest), and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda, among other things, are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector.  Furthermore, the sector's freedom of speech has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation, and the recent Public Order Management Bill (severely limiting freedom of assembly) will only add to the government's stockpile of ammunition.<ref>The International Center for Not-For-Profit Law.

For instance, the NRM-sponsored Public Order Management Bill is strikingly similar to the 1967 Public Order and Security Act, codified by the Obote regime, in that both bills \"seek to gag dissenting views.\"<ref>Boniface, Ngaruye.

His presidency has been marred, however, by invading and occupying Congo during the [[Second Congo War]] (the war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] which has resulted in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since 1998) and other conflicts in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region.

According to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s 2012 Human Rights Report on Uganda, \"The World Bank's most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators reflected corruption was a severe problem\" and that \"the country annually loses 768.9 billion shillings ($286 million) to corruption.\" <ref>United States Department of State (Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor).(2012).

(2012). [http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results Corruption Perceptions Index 2012].</ref> A specific scandal, which had significant international consequences and highlighted the presence of corruption in high-level government offices, was the embezzlement of $12.6 mil in donor funds from the Office of the Prime Minister in 2012. These funds were \"earmarked as crucial support for rebuilding northern Uganda, ravaged by a 20-year war, and Karamoja, Uganda's poorest region.\"  This scandal prompted the E.U., The U.K., Germany, Denmark, Ireland and Norway to suspend aid.<ref>Human Rights Watch.

For instance, Angelo Izama, a Ugandan energy analyst at the U.S.-based Open Society Foundation said the new law was tantamount to \"handing over an ATM (cash) machine\" to Museveni and his regime.<ref>Biryabarema, Elias.

For example, The Non Governmental Organizations (Amendment) Act, passed in 2006, has stifled the productivity of NGOs through erecting barriers to entry, activity, funding and assembly within the sector.  Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures (i.e. requiring recommendations from government officials; annual re-registration), unreasonable regulation of operations (i.e. requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO's area of interest), and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda, among other things, are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector.  Furthermore, the sector's freedom of speech has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation, and the recent Public Order Management Bill (severely limiting freedom of assembly) will only add to the government's stockpile of ammunition.<ref>The International Center for Not-For-Profit Law.

Besigye was the party's presidential candidate, taking 37 per cent of the vote against Museveni's 59 per cent. Besigye alleged fraud and rejected the result.\n\nIn the [[Ugandan general election, 2006|general election of 23 February 2006]], the party won 37 out of 289 elected seats. In the presidential election on the same date, Besigye won 37.4 per cent of the vote. In the 2011 election, the party performed worse with Besigye getting 26.01 per cent of the vote and the party winning 34 seats.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe origins of the FDC are intertwined with the history of the ruling NRM led by President Museveni. The NRM through its military wing the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) fought a successful guerrilla war against the governments of [[Milton Obote]] and [[Tito Okello]] and came to power in Uganda in 1986. During the guerrilla war, Museveni successfully moulded various interest groups into an effective military machine, and on achieving power, he began to build the NRM into a cohesive political organisation. The transition process and the NRM's desire to broaden its political base revealed other interests within the party and a feeling amongst some senior members of being sidelined.\n\nMuseveni had relied heavily on the support of the [[Tutsi]] refugees and their descendants who had been forced out of Rwanda by the [[Hutu]] majority in the 1960s. During the guerrilla war, the NRA had moved from the central district of Luwero to the west of the country where most of the Tutsis had been recruited. On achieving power, Tutsis like [[Paul Kagame]] and [[Fred Gisa Rwigyema]] were rewarded with powerful positions within the army and government.\n\nThe NRA advance on [[Kampala]] was very rapid, and during this process, hundreds of new recruits were incorporated into the NRA. Many of these came from Museveni's own tribe, the [[Banyankole]], and other western tribes like the [[Batoro]]. When the NRA advanced back into [[Buganda]] through the town of Masaka, their ranks were expanded by Baganda, many who travelled from different parts of Buganda to join the guerrillas. For many of these, the common goal was simply to oust the northern-dominated government. There were also those who saw the opportunity to use the NRA to achieve Buganda's ambitions of autonomy.\n\n==Splits within the NRM==\n\nAnother important development was the NRA recruitment of younger impressionable soldiers who often held Museveni in awe. This did not often go down well with the more senior NRA officers:\n \n:''\"He was also clever that he recruited very young and inexperienced people; the kind that would obey him. Many of them were either coming from university or those who had not even been to school\"''.{{ref|RUBARAMIRA_RURANGA}}\n\nThe younger educated cadres began to gain more influence in the NRM. Many had only joined the war towards its conclusion or had joined as NRM cadres after the war. This rivalry was often vocal and acrimonious:\n\n:''\"Many people have intimidated us, calling us (young people) creepers and sycophants of Museveni\".''{{ref|FRANK_TUMWEBAZE}}\n\nThe young cadres and the Tutsi refugees formed the new power base of the NRM, and the party increasingly appeared tribal. Ugandan politics has been plagued by tribalism, and the young cadres with their new influence often encouraged the appointment of their relatives into key government positions. Most of these cadres were from the south-west of Uganda like Museveni.\n\nThis power base was suddenly weakened when the Tutsi refugees led by [[Fred Rwigema]] decided to return to Rwanda to fight the government (Habyarimana). The loss of so many key military and political advisers particularly in the intelligence services left Museveni vulnerable. The NRM realised it had to broaden its appeal, first by appeasing the [[Baganda]] (Uganda's largest ethnic group) by restoring their king the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], and recruiting more people from other tribes into the armed forces. The NRM also emphasised its role in restoring law and order to the country and continuously evoked the fear amongst the southern tribes that the brutal northern armies of Obote and [[Idi Amin]] could return if the NRM failed. This fear was facilitated by the war in the north waged by the [[Lords Resistance Army]]. The NRM also presided over rapid economic growth in the south of Uganda.\n\nWith this new confidence, Museveni began to act against those challenging his authority in the NRM. Many of these were the original members of the NRM/NRA, including the army commander Major General Mugisha Muntu and other once powerful NRM leaders. Many of these leaders opted for quiet retirement in their home districts, but others, like Mugisha Muntu and the former NRM spokesperson Winnie Byanyima, began openly criticising Museveni. There appeared, however, to have been little enthusiasm to completely break with the NRM, rather to encourage change from within.{{ref|bs}}\n\nThis changed in the elections in 2001 when retired NRA officer Besigye challenged Museveni for the presidency. Besigye was relatively unknown outside the NRM/NRA establishment,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} but his courage in standing for election attracted support.\n\n==Formation of the Forum for Democratic Change==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nThe FDC was formally established in 2004. Besigye had gone into exile in the United States and then South Africa. The genesis of the party, however, was in Uganda where many disgruntled NRM members were actively promoting the establishment of a political organisation to challenge Museveni. This desire was further cemented when Museveni amended the constitution to allow him to stand for a third presidential term. This had angered many NRM veterans who had remained in the NRM waiting to take over when Museveni stood down. The amendment was criticised by some of Museveni's closest allies, like [[Eriya Kategaya]] who at the time was seen by many as the number two in the NRM/NRA political hierarchy. This opposition, however, did not bother Museveni who had by now firmly established himself in the NRM.\n\nThe FDC benefited from this disquiet, and when Besigye returned to Uganda, he found the FDC had considerable support even within the ranks of the NRM. This factor prompted Museveni to arrest Besigye. Although it was doubtful that Besigye could win an election against Museveni, the fact that he was attracting support from the NRA (now renamed the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]]) members brought the spectre of a split in the army. The FDC had many ex-NRA commanders in its ranks, including the former army commander Mugisha Muntu. Another factor was that many of these politicians were from the same region of Uganda as Museveni and, therefore, they could attract support from the president's own backyard.\n\nBesigye's arrest was a political blunder that served to increase the popularity of the FDC. But the party now began to suffer from its success. Many of the prominent ex-NRM members were reluctant to publicly criticise Museveni. Politicians like Eriya Kategaya, who was now in the FDC leadership, were tentative in their approach. A further hindrance was that the government placed enormous restrictions on Besigye's ability to mount a national campaign. The FDC was extremely popular in urban areas like the capital city, Kampala, but with limited campaign time, he could not effectively campaign in rural areas where 70 percent of the population live. The NRM, on the other hand, spent enormous energy campaigning in rural areas and small towns.\n\nThe FDC and Besigye were also popular in the north where the population has suffered almost two decades of war between the government and the Lord's Resistance Army. This was despite the fact that the FDC hardly campaigned in this area. This is a reflection of the grievances felt by northern Ugandans who often felt abandoned by the government in Kampala.\n\nDespite these obstacles, the FDC won over 30 percent of the vote, a major achievement for a party that was hardly a year old. The party eclipsed the traditional opposition parties like the [[Uganda People's Congress]] and the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]].\n\n== Stagnation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nIn 2011, the FDC once again led the opposition to Museveni and the NRM in the presidential and parliamentary elections. The party once again failed to overturn Museveni's popularity. The FDC did worse than in 2006. Since the 2011 election, the party has been central in organising street demonstrations - some which have resulted in violent confrontations with the police.\n\n==Formation of People's Government==\nAfter 2016 presidential general elections the FDC flag bearer Dr. Kizza Besigye contested Electoral commission results, this was after he was under house arrest for three months he went ahead to swear himself in as Uganda People's President in a secret location. He went ahead to create what came to be known as People's government with full cabinet and district leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nilepost.co.ug/2019/11/25/betty-nambooze-no-opposition-entity-is-as-strong-as-peoples-government-in-uganda}}</ref> Kampala Lord Mayor ELias Lukwago was appointed Vice President a big number of opposition politicians were appointed and currently serve in the people's government.\n\n==Notes==\n<!-- Instructions for adding a footnote:\n   NOTE: Notes in this article use names, not numbers.

Since the 2011 election, the party has been central in organising street demonstrations - some which have resulted in violent confrontations with the police.\n==Formation of People's Government==\nAfter 2016 presidential general elections the FDC flag bearer Dr. Kizza Besigye contested Electoral commission results, this was after he was under house arrest for three months he went ahead to swear himself in as Uganda People's President in a secret location. He went ahead to create what came to be known as People's government with full cabinet and district leaders. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://nilepost.co.ug/2019/11/25/betty-nambooze-no-opposition-entity-is-as-strong-as-peoples-government-in-uganda}}</ref>Kampala Lord Mayor ELias Lukwago was appointed Vice President a big number of opposition politicians were appointed and currently serve in the people's government. \n\n==Notes==\n<!-- Instructions for adding a footnote:\n   NOTE: Notes in this article use names, not numbers.
