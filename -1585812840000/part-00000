In 1965, she had a role in [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]'s ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]'',<ref name=jstor /> the success of which caused her to market herself to young German directors in the 1970s. During this period, she played in [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s TV series ''[[Eight Hours Don't Make a Day]]'' and in [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s 1976 movie ''[[Coup de Gr\u00e2ce (1976 film)|Coup de Gr\u00e2ce]]''.<ref name=cyranos/>\n\n[[File:Valeska Gert - Mutter Erde fec.jpg|thumb|[[Ehrengrab|Grave of Honour]] by the city of Berlin]]\n\nIn 1978, [[Werner Herzog]] invited her to play the real estate broker Knock in his remake of [[F. W. Murnau|Murnau]]'s classic film ''[[Nosferatu]]''. The contract was signed March 1 but she died just two weeks later before filming began. On 18 March 1978 neighbors and friends in Kampen, Germany, reported she had not been seen for four days. When her door was forced in the presence of police she was found dead. She is believed to have died on 16 March. She was 86 years old. In 2010, the art of Valeska Gert was presented at the Berlin Museum for Contemporary Art [[Hamburger Bahnhof]], in the exhibition ''Pause. Bewegte Fragmente (Pause. Fragments in motion)''. The curators [[Wolfgang M\u00fcller (musician)|Wolfgang M\u00fcller]] from the art punk band ''[[Die T\u00f6dliche Doris]] (The Deadly Doris)'' and art historian An Paenhuysen included a video ''Baby'' showing Gert performing.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20171226172141/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 7.] \"The name of Benjamin Banneker, the Afro-American self-taught mathematician and almanac-maker, occurs again and again in the several published accounts of the survey of Washington City begun in 1791, but with conflicting reports of the role which he played. Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126 Bedini, 1971, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

Though born in [[Hungary]], he adapted the [[Jews of Germany|German-Jewish]] approach of openness towards general culture, world and society. \n\nHe employed the critical scientific method to the [[Talmud]] and wrote about the history of the development of the form of the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]] (as opposed to the development of the [[halachah|Law]] itself, the latter being an enterprise antithetical to traditional Jewish beliefs; see below). Despite this, he was an original member of the more traditionally oriented ''[[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]]'' (council of great Torah sages), and was also known to be \"of great moral conduct and piety\".\n\nHoffman was the leading authority on traditional ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) in [[Germany]] in his lifetime, as well as an expert in the area of ''[[midrash halakha]]'' (legalistic [[Biblical exegesis]]). \nHe was also known for his efforts to disprove the [[Documentary Hypothesis]], as expressed by the [[Julius Wellhausen|Graf-Wellhausen]] theory, with his arguments presented in the work ''Die wichtigsten Instanzen gegen die Graf-Wellhausensche Hypothese'' (1903/1916).  \n\n[[A. Altmann]], however, sees Hoffmann's writings on these matters (though evidencing great expertise) as pure apologetics, the cause of which may be seen as laid out in his introduction to [[Leviticus]] {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}, where Hoffmann makes the following remarks:\n\n{{quotation|I willingly agree that, in consequence of the foundation of my belief, I am unable to arrive at the conclusion that the [[Pentateuch]] was written by anyone other than [[Moses]]... \nWe believe that the whole [[Jewish Bible|Bible]] is true, holy, and of divine origin. That every word of the [[Torah]] was inscribed by divine command is expressed in the principle ''Torah min Ha Shamayim''... We must not presume to set ourselves up as critics of the author of a biblical text or doubt the truth of his statements or question the correctness of his teaching...\nThe Jewish commentator must (therefore) constantly be on guard against interpreting the passage in such a way as to appear to be in conflict with traditional [[Halachah]]. Just as the Torah as a divine revelation must not contradict itself, in the same way it must not contradict the Oral Law which is of divine origin.}}\n  \nYet, despite the piety of the above sentiments, and his repeated proclamations regarding the divinity of the Oral Law, Hoffmann was still very much the ''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums|Wissenschaft]]'' scholar. He cites in his work scholars such as [[Z. Frankel]], [[A. Geiger]], [[S.J. Rapoport]], and [[H. Graetz]], he studies the influences of [[Ancient Near Eastern]] culture on the evolution of the Talmud, and he identifies problems in the transmitted text. For example, Hoffmann in ''The First Mishna'' (discussed [[#Writings|below]]) sees the present Mishna [[Pirkei Avot|Avot]] as having been redacted from three different sources, a Mishna of [[Rabbi Akiva]], a Mishna of [[Rabbi Meir]], and a Mishna of [[Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi]], the originals of which cannot be completely reconstructed due to their thoroughgoing fusion and subsequent manipulation.\n\nThe extent to which Hoffmann resided in the ''Wissenschaft'' movement can also be seen from the criticism he received from such opponents of the movement as Samson Raphael Hirsch. Hildesheimer notes regarding Hirsch's opinion of his Rabbinical Seminary (where Hoffmann worked<ref name=je/> after leaving Hirsch's institution) that \"a question certainly exists as to whether Rabbi Hirsch considers the seminary to be an Orthodox institution.\" Hirsch's opposition extended to Hoffmann's own work, judging Hoffmann's book ''Mar Samuel'' to contain heresies {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}.\n\nHoffmann's resolution of this tension between faithfulness to tradition and textual criticism is found by {{Harvtxt|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}} in the following passage from the introduction to ''The First Mishna'':\n\n{{quotation|Thus, in the study of the [[Tanakh|Holy Scriptures]] on the one hand, we consider the authenticity and integrity to be absolute, and we can recognize as true only such results as do not question that premise.

The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of \"Kathmandu\" and \"Hollywood\"; \"Kollywood\" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} [[Chhakka Panja]] has been considered the highest-grossing film of all time in Nepali film industry and Kohinoor the second highest. The Nepali films [[The Black Hen]] (2015) and [[Kagbeni (film)|Kagbeni]] (2006) received international acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The Nepali feature film [[White Sun]] (Seto Surya) received the Best Film award at the 27th [[Singapore International Film Festival]] (SGIFF) in 2016.\n\n== History ==\n<!--[[History of the film industry]] redirects here-->\n{{main|History of film}}\n[[File:Story-of-the-kelly-gang-capture-1906.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Still frame|still]] from ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (Australia, 1906; 80&nbsp;min.)]]\nLes fr\u00e8res Lumi\u00e8re released the first projection with the Cinematograph, in Paris on 28 December 1895. The French film industry in the late 19th century and early 20th century was the world's most important. Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cin\u00e9matographe and their L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat in Paris in 1895 is considered by many historians as the official birth of cinematography.\nThe first [[feature film]] to be made was the 1906 Australian silent ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', an account of the notorious gang led by [[Ned Kelly]] that was directed and produced by the [[Melbourne|Melburnians]] Dan Barry and [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Story of the Kelly Gang |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ |publisher=Australian Screen, National Film and Sound Archive |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.\n\n=== Hollywood ===\n{{see|Cinema of the United States}}\n\nThe first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move west.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word \"Hollywood\" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.\n\nIn 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].\n\nThe [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.\n\nThe famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read \"Hollywoodland.\" It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest. The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].\n\nThe first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.\n\nFrom about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the \"Hollywood studio system\", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.\n\n=== Bollywood ===\n{{Main|Bollywood}}\n\n[[File:A scene from film, Raja Harishchandra, 1913.jpg|thumb|A shot from ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), the first film of [[Bollywood]].]]\n[[Bollywood]] is the [[Hindi]]-language film industry based in [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as [[Bombay]]), [[Maharashtra]], India.

The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker [[Nasir Hussain]],<ref>{{cite news|title=How film-maker Nasir Husain started the trend for Bollywood masala films|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/how-film-maker-nasir-husain-created-the-prototype-for-bollywood-masala-films/story-ckL6zPLHJFDYoupjFBtbfN.html|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=30 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> along with screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]], pioneering the Bollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] format.<ref name=\"Chaudhuri58\"/>\n\n== Economics ==\n{{main|Economics of the arts and literature}}\n\nProfitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.\n\nSubstantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].\n\nThe film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.\n\nOn the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n=== Largest industries by number of film productions ===\nThe following is a list of the top 15 countries by the number of feature films (fiction, animation and documentary) produced, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web |title=UIS Statistics |url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?ReportId=5538 |website=[[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of \"Kathmandu\" and \"Hollywood\"; \"Kollywood\" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} [[Chhakka Panja]] has been considered the highest-grossing film of all time in Nepali film industry and Kohinoor the second highest. The Nepali films [[The Black Hen]] (2015) and [[Kagbeni (film)|Kagbeni]] (2006) received international acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The Nepali feature film [[White Sun]] (Seto Surya) received the Best Film award at the 27th [[Singapore International Film Festival]] (SGIFF) in 2016.\n\n== History ==\n<!--[[History of the film industry]] redirects here-->\n{{main|History of film}}\n[[File:Story-of-the-kelly-gang-capture-1906.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Still frame|still]] from ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (Australia, 1906; 80&nbsp;min.)]]\nLes fr\u00e8res Lumi\u00e8re released the first projection with the Cinematograph, in Paris on 28 December 1895. The French film industry in the late 19th century and early 20th century was the world's most important. Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cin\u00e9matographe and their L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat in Paris in 1895 is considered by many historians as the official birth of cinematography.\nThe first [[feature film]] to be made was the 1906 Australian silent ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', an account of the notorious gang led by [[Ned Kelly]] that was directed and produced by the [[Melbourne|Melburnians]] Dan Barry and [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Story of the Kelly Gang |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ |publisher=Australian Screen, National Film and Sound Archive |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.\n\n=== Hollywood ===\n{{see|Cinema of the United States}}\n\nThe first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move west.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word \"Hollywood\" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.\n\nIn 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].\n\nThe [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.\n\nThe famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read \"Hollywoodland.\" It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest. The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].\n\nThe first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.\n\nFrom about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the \"Hollywood studio system\", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.\n\n=== Bollywood ===\n{{Main|Bollywood}}\n\n[[File:A scene from film, Raja Harishchandra, 1913.jpg|thumb|A shot from ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), the first film of [[Bollywood]].]]\n[[Bollywood]] is the [[Hindi]]-language film industry based in [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as [[Bombay]]), [[Maharashtra]], India.

The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker [[Nasir Hussain]],<ref>{{cite news|title=How film-maker Nasir Husain started the trend for Bollywood masala films|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/how-film-maker-nasir-husain-created-the-prototype-for-bollywood-masala-films/story-ckL6zPLHJFDYoupjFBtbfN.html|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=30 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> along with screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]], pioneering the Bollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] format.<ref name=\"Chaudhuri58\"/>\n\n== Economics ==\n{{main|Economics of the arts and literature}}\n\nProfitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.\n\nSubstantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].\n\nThe film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.\n\nOn the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n=== Largest industries by number of film productions ===\nThe following is a list of the top 15 countries by the number of feature films (fiction, animation and documentary) produced, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web |title=UIS Statistics |url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?ReportId=5538 |website=[[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It was released on August 3, 2018, through [[Cactus Jack Records]] and [[Grand Hustle Records]], and distributed by [[Epic Records]]. The album follows his second studio album ''[[Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight]]'' (2016), and his collaborative album ''[[Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho]]'' (2017) with [[Quavo]]. \n\nThe album features guest vocals from [[Kid Cudi]], [[Frank Ocean]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[The Weeknd]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]], [[Philip Bailey]], [[21 Savage]], [[Swae Lee]], [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]], [[Nav (rapper)|Nav]], [[Quavo]], [[Takeoff (rapper)|Takeoff]], [[Juice Wrld]], [[Sheck Wes]], and [[Don Toliver]], among others. Production was handled by multiple producers, including [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[Allen Ritter]], [[Hit-Boy]], [[WondaGurl]], [[Tay Keith]], [[Tame Impala]], [[Frank Dukes]], [[Sonny Digital]], and [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]].\n\nThe album title is named after the defunct theme park [[Six Flags AstroWorld]], which was located in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] prior to its closure. Scott aimed for the album to sound like \"taking an amusement park away from kids.\" He also described the album as a continuation of his debut album ''[[Rodeo (Travis Scott album)|Rodeo]]'' (2015). ''Astroworld'' is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] album, incorporating elements of [[Trap music|trap]] and [[psychedelic music]]. The album was supported by four singles, \"[[Butterfly Effect (Travis Scott song)|Butterfly Effect]]\", \"[[Sicko Mode]]\", \"[[Yosemite (song)|Yosemite]]\", and \"[[Wake Up (Travis Scott song)|Wake Up]]\". \n\n''Astroworld'' received widespread acclaim and performed well commercially, debuting atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 537,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 270,000 were pure sales.

Weingarten complimented the first half of the album, though considered the second half to be weaker in comparison: \"Unfortunately, Scott doesn't keep the envelope pushing up for the whole album: a seven-song stretch in the back end is vintage Travis with its zoned-out, hypnotic throb.

{"title_page": "QMA", "text_new": "{{about|the mathematical theory|the coaxial RF connector|QMA and QN connector}}\n\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], '''QMA''', which stands for '''Quantum [[Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol|Merlin Arthur]]''', is the quantum analog of the nonprobabilistic [[complexity class]] [[NP (complexity)|NP]] or the probabilistic complexity class [[Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol|MA]]. It is related to [[BQP]] in the same way [[NP (complexity)|NP]] is related to [[P (complexity)|P]], or [[Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol|MA]] is related to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]].\n\nInformally, it is the set of [[decision problem]]s for which, when the answer is YES, there is a polynomial-size quantum proof (a quantum state) that convinces a polynomial-time quantum verifier of the fact with high probability. Moreover, when the answer is NO, every polynomial-size quantum state is rejected by the verifier with high probability.\n\nMore precisely, the proofs have to be verifiable in [[polynomial time]] on a [[quantum computer]], such that if the answer is indeed YES, the verifier accepts a correct proof with probability greater than 2/3, and if the answer is NO, then there is no proof which convinces the verifier to accept with probability greater than 1/3. As is usually the case, the constants 2/3 and 1/3 can be changed. Changing 2/3 to any constant strictly between 1/2 and 1, or changing 1/3 to any constant strictly between 0 and 1/2, does not change the class QMA.\n\n'''QAM''' is a related complexity class, in which fictional agents Arthur and Merlin carry out the sequence: Arthur generates a random string, Merlin answers with a quantum [[certificate (complexity)|certificate]] and Arthur verifies it as a BQP machine.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA language L is in <math>\\mbox{QMA}(c,s)</math> if there exists a polynomial time quantum verifier V and a polynomial p(x) such that:<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/0210077v1|first1=Dorit|last1=Aharonov|author1-link= Dorit Aharonov|first2=Tomer|last2=Naveh|title=Quantum NP \u2013 A Survey|year=2002}}</ref><ref name=\"JW\">{{cite book|arxiv=0804.3401|first=John|last=Watrous|authorlink=John Watrous (computer scientist)|chapter=Quantum Computational Complexity|year=2009|title=Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science|pages=7174\u20137201|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-30440-3_428|editor-first=Robert A.|editor-last=Meyers}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gharibian |first1=Sevag |last2=Huang |first2=Yichen |last3=Landau |first3=Zeph |last4=Shin |first4=Seung Woo |title=Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity |journal=Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science |date=2015 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=159\u2013282 |doi=10.1561/0400000066|arxiv=1401.3916 }}</ref>\n*<math>\\forall x \\in L</math>, there exists a quantum state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> such that the probability that V accepts the input <math>(|x\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle)</math> is greater than <math>c</math>.\n*<math>\\forall x \\notin L</math>, for all quantum states <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math>, the probability that V accepts the input <math>(|x\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle)</math> is less than <math>s</math>.\nwhere <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> ranges over all quantum states with at most p(|x|) qubits.\n\nThe complexity class <math>\\mbox{QMA}</math> is defined to be equal to <math>\\mbox{QMA}({2}/{3},1/3)</math>. However, the constants are not too important since the class remains unchanged if <math>c</math> and <math>s</math> are set to any constants such that <math>c</math> is greater than <math>s</math>. Moreover, for any polynomials <math>q(n)</math> and <math>r(n)</math>, we have\n:<math>\\mbox{QMA}\\left(\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{1}{3}\\right) =\\mbox{QMA}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{q(n)},\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{q(n)}\\right)=\\mbox{QMA}(1-2^{-r(n)},2^{-r(n)})</math>.\n\n== Problems in QMA ==\n\nSince many interesting classes are contained in QMA, such as P, BQP and NP, all problems in those classes are also in QMA. However, there are problems that are in QMA but not known to be in NP or BQP. Some such well known problems are discussed below.\n\nA problem is said to be QMA-hard, analogous to [[NP-hard]], if every problem in QMA can be [[Reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to it. A problem is said to be QMA-[[complete (complexity)|complete]] if it is QMA-hard and in QMA.\n\n=== The local Hamiltonian problem ===\nThe local Hamiltonian problem is the quantum analogue of [[Maximum satisfiability problem|MAX-SAT]]. A Hamiltonian is a [[Hermitian matrix]] acting on quantum states, thus it is <math>2^n \\times 2^n</math> for a system of n [[qubit]]s. A k-local Hamiltonian is a Hamiltonian which can be written as the sum of Hamiltonians, each of which act non-trivially on at most k qubits (instead of all n qubits).\n\nThe k-local Hamiltonian problem, which is a [[promise problem]], is defined as follows.

Moreover, when the answer is NO, every polynomial-size quantum state is rejected by the verifier with high probability.\n\nMore precisely, the proofs have to be verifiable in [[polynomial time]] on a [[quantum computer]], such that if the answer is indeed YES, the verifier accepts a correct proof with probability greater than 2/3, and if the answer is NO, then there is no proof which convinces the verifier to accept with probability greater than 1/3. As is usually the case, the constants 2/3 and 1/3 can be changed. Changing 2/3 to any constant strictly between 1/2 and 1, or changing 1/3 to any constant strictly between 0 and 1/2, does not change the class QMA.\n\n'''QAM''' is a related complexity class, in which fictional agents Arthur and Merlin carry out the sequence: Arthur generates a random string, Merlin answers with a quantum [[certificate (complexity)|certificate]] and Arthur verifies it as a BQP machine.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA language L is in <math>\\mbox{QMA}(c,s)</math> if there exists a polynomial time quantum verifier V and a polynomial p(x) such that:<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/0210077v1|first1=Dorit|last1=Aharonov|author1-link= Dorit Aharonov|first2=Tomer|last2=Naveh|title=Quantum NP \u2013 A Survey|year=2002}}</ref><ref name=\"JW\">{{cite book|arxiv=0804.3401|first=John|last=Watrous|authorlink=John Watrous (computer scientist)|chapter=Quantum Computational Complexity|year=2009|title=Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science|pages=7174\u20137201|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-30440-3_428|editor-first=Robert A.|editor-last=Meyers}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gharibian |first1=Sevag |last2=Huang |first2=Yichen |last3=Landau |first3=Zeph |last4=Shin |first4=Seung Woo |title=Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity |journal=Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science |date=2015 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=159\u2013282 |doi=10.1561/0400000066|arxiv=1401.3916 }}</ref>\n*<math>\\forall x \\in L</math>, there exists a quantum state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> such that the probability that V accepts the input <math>(|x\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle)</math> is greater than <math>c</math>.\n*<math>\\forall x \\notin L</math>, for all quantum states <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math>, the probability that V accepts the input <math>(|x\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle)</math> is less than <math>s</math>.\nwhere <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> ranges over all quantum states with at most p(|x|) qubits.\n\nThe complexity class <math>\\mbox{QMA}</math> is defined to be equal to <math>\\mbox{QMA}({2}/{3},1/3)</math>.

However, there are problems that are in QMA but not known to be in NP or BQP. Some such well known problems are discussed below.\n\nA problem is said to be QMA-hard, analogous to [[NP-hard]], if every problem in QMA can be [[Reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to it. A problem is said to be QMA-[[complete (complexity)|complete]] if it is QMA-hard and in QMA.\n\n=== The local Hamiltonian problem ===\nThe local Hamiltonian problem is the quantum analogue of [[Maximum satisfiability problem|MAX-SAT]].

A k-local Hamiltonian is a Hamiltonian which can be written as the sum of Hamiltonians, each of which act non-trivially on at most k qubits (instead of all n qubits).\n\nThe k-local Hamiltonian problem, which is a [[promise problem]], is defined as follows. The input is a k-local Hamiltonian acting on n qubits, which is the sum of polynomially many Hermitian matrices that act on only k qubits. The input also contains two numbers <math>a< b \\in [0,1]</math>, such that <math>\\frac{1}{b-a}=O(n^c)</math> for some constant c.
