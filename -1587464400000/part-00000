It was established in 1981 as \"[[Technikon]] Free State\". As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the \u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution.

It was established in 1981 as \"[[Technikon]] Free State\". As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the \u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution. In this lies the strength of the planning pillar, which outlines the step-by-step implementation and review of the main practices and outcomes of Vision 2020.\n\n===Campuses===\nCUT is the foremost higher education institution in the heartland of South Africa.

During the first period, he did not rule, and the entire government was in the hands of his mother, Empress [[Wu Zetian]]. In the second period, most of the government was in the hands of his beloved wife [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]].\n\nEmperor Zhongzong was the son of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] and Empress Wu (later known as [[Wu Zetian]]). He succeeded his father in 684.  His mother, however, deposed him less than two months later in favor of his younger brother [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]].  The former emperor, demoted to a princely rank, was sent in exile in the provinces and placed under house arrest. Six years later, Emperor Ruizong in turn relinquished the throne to his mother and Empress Dowager Wu officially proclaimed herself [[queen regnant|empress regnant]], while Emperor Ruizong was made crown prince.\n\nBy 698 the court was caught in the middle of a bitter power struggle.  In an attempt to secure her prominence, Empress Wu liberated the former emperor from his 14 years of seclusion and recalled him to the capital in April 698.  He was reinstated as crown prince in October 698, taking the place of his brother. On 20 February 705, a palace coup deposed Wu Zetian and Emperor Zhongzong was restored as emperor three days later. Emperor Zhongzong reigned for five years but was a rather weak and easily influenced ruler. Real power was in the hands of his empress consort, [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]] and her lover [[Wu Sansi]] (Wu Zetian's nephew) and his daughter Li Guo'er, the [[Princess Anle]].\n\nIn 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei, who then installed his son, Li Chongmao, as [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Emperor Shang]].  Empress Wei, who had failed to install her daughter Li Guo'er, the [[Princess Anle]], as heir to Emperor Zhongzong, thought that Li Chongmao, born of Zhongzong and a [[concubine]] and who was only 16 years old, would be easy to control and allow her to preserve her power. The scheme failed, however, when [[Princess Taiping]], the sister of Emperor Zhongzong, launched a coup two weeks later with her nephew Li Longji (later [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]]), son of the abdicated Emperor Ruizong, and overthrew Empress Wei and the young emperor.  Emperor Ruizong, the father of Li Longji and the older brother of Princess Taiping, was restored as emperor.\n\n==Background==\nLi Xi\u01cen<ref>Tonal signs for his original name are used in this section only to disambiguate between him and his brother [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]].</ref> was born in 656, as the seventh son of his father [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] and the third son of his mother, Emperor Gaozong's second wife [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]] (later known as Wu Zetian).  In 657, he was created the Prince of Zhou and nominally made the prefect of the eastern capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (\u6d1b\u5dde, roughly modern [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]).  In 661, when his older brother [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]] the Prince of Pei had the literarily-talented official [[Wang Bo (poet)|Wang Bo]] on staff, the princes were apparently often engaged in [[cockfighting]].  Wang Bo wrote a playful piece entitled the ''Declaration Against the Prince of Zhou's Cock'' (\u6a84\u5468\u738b\u96de\u6587), which, however, when Emperor Gaozong read it, caused Emperor Gaozong to be angry, as he believed this would cause discord between his sons, and therefore expelled Wang from the Pei mansion.  However, in 674, a similar incident happened by Emperor Gaozong's own instigation\u2014as, at an imperial feast, he divided the imperial musicians into two teams and had Li Xi\u00e1n and Li Xi\u01cen lead the two teams in competition\u2014although he stopped when the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Hao Chujun]] pointed out the potential for rivalry.\n\nMeanwhile, during the years that Li Xi\u01cen was the Prince of Zhou, he had married a daughter of his grandaunt the Princess Changle and her husband, the general Zhao Gui (\u8d99\u74cc), as his wife and princess.  Emperor Gaozong had often shown favors to Princess Changle, and this displeased Empress Wu.  In 675, on account of this, she had Princess Zhao accused of crimes and put into solitary confinement at the bureau of eunuchs.  She was given raw vegetables and raw meat for her to cook them herself.  However, sometime later, the kitchen stopped to have smoke and steam come out of it, and when Empress Wu had her confinement house opened, Princess Zhao was seen dead inside, having starved to death.  Empress Wu also demoted Zhao Gui to be the prefect of Kuo Prefecture (\u62ec\u5dde, roughly modern [[Lishui, Zhejiang|Lishui]], [[Zhejiang]]) and ordered Princess Changle to accompany her husband to Kuo Prefecture, and further ordered that neither Zhao Gui nor Princess Changle would be allowed to enter the palace.\n\nIn 676, when the [[Tibetan Empire]] attacked Tang's western prefectures, Li Xi\u01cen and his younger brother [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Lun]], the Prince of Xiang, were nominally put in charge of the two armies that were actually commanded by the generals Liu Shenli (\u5289\u5be9\u79ae) and Qibi Heli (\u5951\u82fe\u4f55\u529b), but neither Li Xi\u01cen nor Li Lun actually set out with the troops.\n\nIn 677, Li Xi\u01cen had his title changed to Prince of Ying.  His name was also changed to Li Zhe.  He was also made the prefect of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (\u96cd\u5dde, roughly modern [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]]).\n\nBy 680, Li Xi\u00e1n, who was then [[crown prince]], had lost Empress Wu's favor.  After she suspected him of having had her trusted sorcerer Ming Chongyan (\u660e\u5d07\u513c) assassinated, she had him investigated for treason, and subsequently, he was found guilty.  He was reduced to commoner rank and exiled, and Li Zhe was created crown prince to replace him.  Hao Chujun and another chancellor, [[Liu Rengui]], were made his senior advisors.  Emperor Gaozong also recruited the famed hermit scholar Tian Youyan (\u7530\u904a\u5dd6) to serve as an advisor, although Tian would later draw criticism from others for not having any actual good advice for the crown prince.\n\n==First stint as crown prince==\nIn 681, after Emperor Gaozong had become ill after consuming pills made by [[alchemy|alchemists]], he had Li Zhe briefly exercise imperial powers.\n\nIn 682, Li Zhe's second wife, [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Wei]], gave birth to a son, [[Li Chongrun|Li Chongzhao]].  Emperor Gaozong was pleased, and he created Li Chongzhao the unprecedented title of \"Deputy Crown Prince\" (\u7687\u592a\u5b6b, ''Huang Taisun'').  Later that year, due to a famine in the [[Guanzhong]] region (i.e., the region around the capital [[Chang'an]]), Emperor Gaozong took up residence at the eastern capital [[Luoyang]], leaving Li Zhe in charge of Chang'an, assisted by the chancellors Liu Rengui, [[Pei Yan]], and [[Xue Yuanchao]].  it was said that while Li Zhe was in charge of Chang'an, he often spent his time on games and hunting, and Xue often advised him against spending time in this manner.  When Emperor Gaozong heard this, he rewarded Xue and summoned Xue to Luoyang.\n\nIn 683, Emperor Gaozong became ill at Luoyang, and he summoned Li Zhe to Luoyang, leaving Li Chongrun nominally in charge of Chang'an, assisted by Liu.<ref>The ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' indicated that the son of Li Zhe left nominally in charge of Chang'an was [[Li Chongfu]] the Prince of Tangchang.  See ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377203|vol. 203]].  However, both the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''New Book of Tang'' indicated that it was Li Chongzhao who was left in charge, and as Li Chongzhao's position was higher than Li Chongfu's, it appeared more likely that Li Chongzhao was in charge.  See ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537784|vol. 84]], and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377180|vol. 180]].  The ''Old Book of Tang'' did, elsewhere, indicate that Li Chongfu, not Li Chongzhao, was nominally in charge.  See ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53775|vol. 5]]</ref>  After Li Zhe arrived at Luoyang, Emperor Gaozong transferred imperial powers to him, and soon died.  Li Zhe took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but actual powers were entire in the hands of Empress Wu, now [[empress dowager]] and [[regent]].\n\n==First reign under Empress Dowager Wu's regency==\nEmperor Zhongzong, in spring 684, made his wife, Crown Princess Wei, [[queen consort|empress consort]], and he wanted to make his father-in-law, Wei Xuanzhen (\u97cb\u7384\u8c9e) ''Shizhong'' ({{zh|c=\u4f8d\u4e2d}}) \u2013 the head of the examination bureau of government and a post considered one for a chancellor.  He also wanted to make the son of his [[wet nurse]] an official of the fifth rank. Pei Yan resisted both commissions.  As they argued, Emperor Zhongzong, in anger, remarked, \"What would be wrong even if I gave the empire to Wei Xuanzhen?  Why do you care about ''Shizhong'' so much? <ref>[\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377203|vol. 203, p. 6417]</ref>\n\nPei, in fear, informed Empress Dowager Wu.  Just less than two months after Emperor Zhongzong had taken the throne, Empress Dowager Wu summoned the officials and generals and issued an edict deposing Emperor Zhongzong and reducing to the title of Prince of Luling.  As generals loyal to her physically removed Emperor Zhongzong from the throne, he struggled and asked, \"What crime have I committed?\"  Empress Dowager Wu responded, \"You wanted to give the empire to Wei Xuanzhen.  How can that not be a crime?\"  She had him put under arrest and reduced him to the rank of Prince of Luling, and she made Li Lun (now named Li Dan) the Prince of Yu the new emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).  Li Chongzhao was reduced to commoner rank.\n\n==In exile==\nEmpress Dowager Wu soon ordered that Li Zhe and his family first be delivered to Fang Prefecture (\u623f\u5dde, in modern [[Shiyan]], [[Hubei]]), and then Jun Prefecture (\u5747\u5dde, also in modern Shiyan), to be held under house arrest at the house that his uncle [[Li Tai]] had been placed after Li Tai was deposed in 643.  (Subsequently, in 685, he was moved back to Fang Prefecture.)  On the way to exile, Princess Wei gave birth to a daughter.  There was nothing to wrap the baby with, so Li Zhe took off his own shirt and wrapped the baby in it.  To commemorate this, the daughter was subsequently named [[Princess Anle|Li Guo'er]] (Guo'er meaning \"the child that was wrapped\").  Li Zhe and Princess Wei both greatly favored this child born in distress.\n\nLi Zhe was constantly in fear in exile, as Empress Dowager Wu had previously shown willingness to kill her own children\u2014having forced Li Xi\u00e1n to commit suicide in 684 and having been rumored to have poisoned another son, [[Li Hong]], in 675\u2014and whenever there would be imperial messengers arriving from then-capital [[Luoyang]], he would consider committing suicide, fearing that they brought orders for even worse fates.  Princess Wei would repeatedly tell him:\n\n{{quote|There is no set pattern to bad and good fortune.  Since we will all die one day anyway, why hasten death?}}\n\nAt this point, they were deeply in love with each other, and at another point, he told her:\n\n{{quote|If we will see the light of day again, I will not stop you from doing anything.}}\n\nWhile Li Zhe was in exile, people who rebelled against or plotted against Empress Dowager Wu often used him as a symbol of their resistance.  For example, when [[Li Jingye]] the Duke of Ying rose against Empress Dowager Wu later in 684, he declared that his goal was to restore Li Zhe.  Other examples included Yang Chucheng (\u694a\u521d\u6210) in 687 and Li Yin (\u674e\u8af2) the Duke of Poyang (Emperor Gaozong's cousin) in 689.\n\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as \"empress regnant\" of a new [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou Dynasty]], interrupting Tang.  She created Emperor Ruizong crown prince with the unusual title ''Huangsi'' (\u7687\u55e3), and initially, Li Zhe's status was not changed.\n\n==Second stint as crown prince In the reign of his mother Wu Zetian==\nIn 697, during a major [[Khitan people|Khitan]] incursion, led by the khan [[Sun Wanrong]], Sun issued a declaration questioning why Wu Zetian was keeping Li Zhe in exile.  Thereafter, the chancellor [[Di Renjie]] often counseled Wu Zetian to recall Li Zhe, which fellow chancellors [[Wang Fangqing]] and [[Wang Jishan]] also agreed with.  Further, Wu Zetian's close associate [[Ji Xu]] also advocated it and further persuaded her lovers [[Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong]] to advocate the same.  Wu Zetian finally agreed, and in 698 recalled Li Zhe and his family back to Luoyang, then capital.  Shortly thereafter, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian agreed, creating Li Zhe crown prince, demoting Li Dan to the rank of Prince of Xiang.  She also changed his name back to Li Xi\u01cen, and subsequently changed his surname to Wu.  Subsequently, when she named him the nominal commander of the forces defending against a major [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks|G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]] incursion, it was said that as soon as he was named the commander, men swarmed to enlist.\n\nIn 699, fearing that after her death the Li and Wu clans would not be able to keep peace with each other, Wu Zetian had Li Xi\u01cen, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, and her husband [[Wu Youji]] (Wu Zetian's nephew) swear an oath to each other.\n\nIn 701, Li Chongzhao (now named Li Chongrun to observe [[naming taboo]] for Wu Zetian (whose personal name was Wu Zhao) and now carrying the title of Prince of Shao), Li Zhe's daughter [[Li Xianhui]] the Princess Yongtai, and Li Xianhui's husband Wu Yanji (\u6b66\u5ef6\u57fa) the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian's grandnephew), were accused of secretly disparaging Wu Zetian's relationships with Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong.  In anger, Wu Zetian ordered the three of them to commit suicide.<ref>The ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' asserted that Li Chongrun was forced to commit suicide, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' asserted in his biographies that he was caned to death on Wu Zetian's orders.  Compare ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377207|vol. 207]], with ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537786|vol. 86]] and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377081|vol. 81]]. The ''Old Book of Tang'', meanwhile, inconsistently asserted in the chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign that he was forced to commit suicide.  See ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53776|vol. 6]]. The chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign in the ''New Book of Tang'' merely stated that the three of them \"were killed.\"  See  ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377004|vol. 4]]</ref><ref>However, some modern historians, based on the text on Li Xianhui's tombstone (written after Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne in 705), which suggested that she died the day after her brother and her husband and that she was pregnant at death, and the fact that the skeleton believed to be hers had a small pelvis, have proposed the theory that she was not ordered to commit suicide, but had, in grief over her brother's and husband's deaths, had either a miscarriage or a difficult birth and died from that.  See, e.g., illustrations preceding the ''[[Bo Yang]] Edition'' of the ''Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 49.  It may be notable that the [[Chinese Wikipedia]] article for [[:zh:\u674e\u4ed9\u8559|Li Xianhui]] gave the text for her tombstone, but did not give an external link corroborating the text in the article.</ref><!-- insert more definitive link later if locatable -->\n\nIn spring 705, Wu Zetian was seriously ill, and Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were attending to her and, at her direction, handling the major affairs of state, and there were rumors that they were seeking to displace Li Xi\u01cen.  The chancellors [[Zhang Jianzhi]] and [[Cui Xuanwei]], along with other officials [[Jing Hui]], [[Huan Yanfan]], and [[Yuan Shuji]] plotted to overthrow her and the Zhang brothers.  They persuaded the generals [[Li Duozuo]] and Li Dan (\u674e\u6e5b, note different character than the Prince of Xiang) to join the plot.  With agreement from Li Xi\u01cen as well, the coup leaders acted on 20 February,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A4%A4%A9v&reign=%AF%AB%C0s&yy=1&ycanzi=&mm=1&dd=22&dcanzi= \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323054815/http://www.blayney.nsw.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/329/3h%20-%20Hobbys%20Yards%20Heritage%20Items.pdf.aspx |date=2015-03-23 }}</ref> killing Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, and then surrounding Wu Zetian.  She, in fear, asked, \"Who is disturbing me?\"  Zhang Jianzhi responded, in a formalistic manner:\n\n{{quote|Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong committed treason.  Following the orders of the Crown Prince, we have executed them.  Because we were afraid that the secret would be leaked, we did not dare to first report to Your Imperial Majesty.  We are guilty of the great disrespect of moving troops within the palace, and should be executed 10,000 times.}}\n\nWu Zetian subsequently tried to have Li Xi\u01cen returned to the palace of the Crown Prince, but the coup leaders ignored her.  While the coup leaders allowed Wu Zetian to retain the title of \"emperor,\" they had her put under house arrest at the secondary palace Shangyang Palace (\u4e0a\u967d\u5bae) and forced her to yield the throne to Li Xi\u01cen, who was formerly emperor, and he was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong).\n\n==Second reign under Empress Wei's shadow== \nOnce restored, Emperor Zhongzong initially put the five coup leaders in prominent positions. However, Empress Wei, once restored, became the most powerful and dominant figure at court, along with Li Guo'er, who now carried the title of Princess Anle And from now on he set up a faction to run the country. Also  powerful was Wu Zetian's secretary [[Shangguan Wan'er]], whom Emperor Zhongzong took as a [[concubine]], who was also having an affair with Wu Zetian's nephew [[Wu Sansi]] the Prince of Liang.  Under her introduction, Empress Wei and Wu Sansi also soon started having an affair.  With Consort Shangguan's and Empress Wei's influence, Wu Sansi became a powerful and trusted advisor to Emperor Zhongzong.  Meanwhile, Empress Wei, disliking Emperor Zhongzong's oldest surviving son [[Li Chongfu]] the Prince of Qiao (born of a concubine), falsely accused Li Chongfu of complicit in Li Chongrun's death.  Emperor Zhongzong demoted Li Chongfu out of the capital to serve as a prefectural prefect, under heavy guard.  Emperor Zhongzong initially offered the crown prince position to Li Dan, but after Li Dan declined, created another son by a concubine, [[Li Chongjun]], crown prince.\n\nThe coup leaders, meanwhile, were trying to curb Wu Sansi's rise, but in turn, Wu Sansi and Empress Wei repeatedly warned Emperor Zhongzong that the coup leaders were overly powerful and dangerous.  In fall 705, Emperor Zhongzong agreed, and created the coup leaders princes under guise of honoring them, but removed them from their chancellor positions.\n\nIn winter 705, Wu Zetian died.  Her \"emperor\" title was subsequently removed and empress title restored, and Emperor Zhongzong buried her at [[Qianling Mausoleum|Qianling]], with his father Emperor Gaozong.  (Also buried there were Emperor Zhongzong's brother Li Xi\u00e1n, Li Chongrun, and Li Xianhui.)\n\nIn spring 706, after Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (\u738b\u540c\u768e, husband of Princess Ding'an), who despised Empress Wei and Wu Sansi, was accused of plotting to kill Wu Sansi and depose Empress Wei, Wang and his alleged coconspirators were executed, and subsequently, Wu Sansi and his associates accused Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, Zhang Jianzhi, Yuan Shuji, and Cui Xuanwei of being complicit in Wang's plot.  The five princes were exiled and subsequently died or were killed in exile.\n\nIn 707, Li Chongjun, angry that Li Guo'er and her husband Wu Chongxun (\u6b66\u5d07\u8a13, Wu Sansi's son) had repeatedly humiliated him and tried to get Li Guo'er created crown princess to displace him, rose in rebellion with Li Duozuo and the generals Li Sichong (\u674e\u601d\u6c96), Li Chengkuang (\u674e\u627f\u6cc1), Dugu Yizhi (\u7368\u5b64\u7995\u4e4b), and Shazha Zhongyi (\u6c99\u5412\u5fe0\u7fa9), along with Emperor Zhongzong's cousin Li Qianli (\u674e\u5343\u91cc) the Prince of Cheng and Li Qianli's son LI Xi (\u674e\u79a7) the Prince of Tianshui.  They attacked Wu Sansi's mansion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun, and then marched on to the palace, trying to seize Consort Shangguan, Empress Wei, and Li Guo'er.  The rebels hesitated at attacking the palace, and the imperial guards fought back.  After the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Yang Sixu (\u694a\u601d\u52d7) killed Li Duozuo's son-in-law Ye Huli (\u91ce\u547c\u5229), and Emperor Zhongzong made a personal appeal to the coup forces, the coup forces turned against Li Chongjun, killing the generals commanding them.  Li Chongjun fled but was killed in exile.  Subsequently, the senior chancellor [[Wei Yuanzhong]], whose son Wei Sheng (\u9b4f\u5347) had been forced to join the rebellion, was exiled and killed in exile at the instigation of two chancellors aligned with Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, [[Zong Chuke]] and [[Ji Chuna]].  However, attempts by Empress Wei's party to implicate Li Dan and Princess Taiping were unsuccessful.\n\nMeanwhile, the court was dominated by a number of powerful women, including Li Guo'er, Princess Changning (Emperor Zhongzong's and Empress Wei's older daughter), Empress Wei's sister Lady of Cheng, Consort Shangguan, Consort Shangguan's mother Lady Zheng of Pei, senior [[lady-in-waiting|ladies in waiting]] Chai and Helou, the sorceress Diwu Ying'er (\u7b2c\u4e94\u82f1\u5152), and Lady Zhao of Longxi.  These women were openly accepting bribes, and were able to recommend a number of people to be officials, directly commissioned by Emperor Zhongzong without approval from the legislative (\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701, ''Zhongshu Sheng'') and examination (\u9580\u4e0b\u7701, ''Menxia Sheng'') bureaus.  The civil service system was said to be overrun with corruption and running into near collapse.\n\nIn winter 708, after the Tuqishi (\u7a81\u9a0e\u65bd) chieftain [[Suoge]] (\u5a11\u845b), who had just succeeded his father [[Wuzhile]] (\u70cf\u8cea\u52d2), was challenged by Wuzhile's subordinate Juechuo Zhongjie (\u95d5\u555c\u5fe0\u7bc0),<ref>The ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', followed by the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', referred to this person as Juechuo Zhongjie, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' referred to him as Ashina Zhongjie (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u5fe0\u7bc0).</ref> Juechuo, who was unable to prevail over Suoge, bribed Zong and Ji to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to prepare a joint attack against Tuqishi with the Tibetan Empire, despite counsel by the general [[Guo Yuanzhen]] against it.  When Suoge heard this, he launched an attack preemptively, attacking several key Tang garrisons, capturing Juechuo, and killing the Tang general Feng Jiabin (\u99ae\u5609\u8cd3), who had been sent to assist Juechuo.  Subsequently, after Emperor Zhongzong recognized Suoge's authority over the Tuqishi tribes, hostility ceased, and Suoge again became a Tang vassal.\n\nIn spring 710, Emperor Zhongzong sent Princess Jincheng, the daughter of his nephew [[Li Shouli]] the Prince of Yong (Li Xi\u00e1n's son), to the Tibetan Empire to be married to its emperor, [[Me Agtsom]], cementing peace between the two states.\n\n==In Fiction & Popular Culture==\n*Portrayed by [[Raymond Cho (actor)|Raymond Cho]] in [[The Greatness of a Hero]] (2009).\n\n==Death==\nMeanwhile, there had been accusations made by individuals such as Lang Ji (\u90ce\u5c8c) and Yan Qinrong (\u71d5\u6b3d\u878d) that Empress Wei was committing adultery, and that her partisans, including Li Guo'er, her new husband Wu Yanxiu (\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0, a grandnephew of Wu Zetian), and Zong Chuke, were planning to overthrow the Tang dynasty.  Emperor Zhongzong ordered Lang executed, but became displeased when Zong had Yan killed without Emperor Zhongzong having decided to do so.  This caused Empress Wei and her partisans to begin to become apprehensive.  Empress Wei was, meanwhile, having affairs with the officials Ma Qinke (\u99ac\u79e6\u5ba2) and Yang Jun (\u694a\u5747).  She wanted to be Empress Regnant like Wu Zetian, and Li Guo'er wanted to be crown princess\u2014a request that Emperor Zhongzong had repeatedly rebuffed.  According to traditional historians, they thus decided to have Emperor Zhongzong killed.  They accomplished this by putting poison in a cake, and after Emperor Zhongzong ate the cake, he died on 3 July, 710.<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=1&yy=710&mm=7&dd=3 \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814060529/https://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=1&yy=710&mm=7&dd=3 |date=2017-08-14 }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] the Prince of Wen, was named emperor, with Empress Wei retaining power as empress dowager and regent.  Less than a month later, Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] the Prince of Linzi rose in rebellion and killed Empress Wei and Li Guo'er.  Subsequently, Li Dan took the throne again, displacing Emperor Shang.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Zhongzong was buried in an imperial burial, and as Empress Wei was considered unsuitable to be buried with him, Emperor Ruizong was set to bury Emperor Zhongzong's first wife Princess Zhao, whom Emperor Zhongzong had posthumously honored an empress, with him, but Princess Zhao's body could no longer be located.  Therefore, a ceremony was held in which her spirit was summoned to accompany Emperor Zhongzong in death.\n\n==Era names==\n\n===First reign===\n* ''Sisheng'' (\u55e3\u8056 s\u00ec sh\u00e8ng) 684\n\n===Second reign===\n* ''Shenlong'' (\u795e\u9f8d sh\u00e9n l\u00f3ng) 705\u2013707 (inherited from Wu Zetian)\n* ''Jinglong'' (\u666f\u9f8d j\u01d0ng l\u00f3ng) 707\u2013710\n\n==Chancellors during reign==\n\n===First reign===\n* [[Liu Rengui]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Pei Yan]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Guo Daiju]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Cen Changqian]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Guo Zhengyi]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Wei Xuantong]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Liu Jingxian]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Wei Hongmin]] (684)\n\n===Second reign===\n* [[Wei Anshi]] (705, 705\u2013706, 709\u2013710)\n* [[Cui Xuanwei]] (705)\n* [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]] (705)\n* [[Yang Zaisi]] (705\u2013709)\n* [[Tang Xiujing]] (705\u2013706, 709\u2013710)\n* [[Zhang Jianzhi]] (705)\n* [[Fang Rong]] (705)\n* [[Wei Chengqing]] (705)\n* [[Yuan Shuji]] (705)\n* [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Dan]] (705)\n* [[Jing Hui]] (705)\n* [[Huan Yanfan]] (705)\n* [[Wu Sansi]] (705)\n* [[Zhu Qinming]] (705\u2013706)\n* [[Wei Yuanzhong]] (705\u2013707)\n* [[Li Huaiyuan]] (705\u2013706, 706)\n* [[Doulu Qinwang]] (705\u2013709)\n* [[Wei Juyuan]] (705, 706\u2013710)\n* [[Li Jiao (Tang Dynasty)|Li Jiao]] (706\u2013710)\n* [[Yu Weiqian]] (706\u2013707)\n* [[Su Gui]] (706\u2013707, 709\u2013710)\n* [[Zong Chuke]] (707\u2013710)\n* [[Ji Chuna]] (707\u2013710)\n* [[Xiao Zhizhong]] (707\u2013710)\n* [[Zhang Renyuan]] (708\u2013710)\n* [[Wei Sili]] (709\u2013710)\n* [[Cui Shi]] (709)\n* [[Zhao Yanzhao]] (709\u2013710)\n* [[Wei Wen]] (709\u2013710)\n* [[Zheng Yin (Early Tang)|Zheng Yin]] (709)\n\n==Family==\n* Parents:\n** [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Li Zhi]], Gaozong ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u5b97 \u674e\u6cbb}};

During the first period, he did not rule, and the entire government was in the hands of his mother, Empress [[Wu Zetian]]. In the second period, most of the government was in the hands of his beloved wife [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]].\n\nEmperor Zhongzong was the son of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] and Empress Wu (later known as [[Wu Zetian]]). He succeeded his father in 684.  His mother, however, deposed him less than two months later in favor of his younger brother [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]].  The former emperor, demoted to a princely rank, was sent in exile in the provinces and placed under house arrest. Six years later, Emperor Ruizong in turn relinquished the throne to his mother and Empress Dowager Wu officially proclaimed herself [[queen regnant|empress regnant]], while Emperor Ruizong was made crown prince.\n\nBy 698 the court was caught in the middle of a bitter power struggle.  In an attempt to secure her prominence, Empress Wu liberated the former emperor from his 14 years of seclusion and recalled him to the capital in April 698.  He was reinstated as crown prince in October 698, taking the place of his brother. On 20 February 705, a palace coup deposed Wu Zetian and Emperor Zhongzong was restored as emperor three days later. Emperor Zhongzong reigned for five years but was a rather weak and easily influenced ruler. Real power was in the hands of his empress consort, [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]] and her lover [[Wu Sansi]] (Wu Zetian's nephew) and his daughter Li Guo'er, the [[Princess Anle]].\n\nIn 710, Emperor Zhongzong died, allegedly poisoned by Empress Wei, who then installed his son, Li Chongmao, as [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Emperor Shang]].  Empress Wei, who had failed to install her daughter Li Guo'er, the [[Princess Anle]], as heir to Emperor Zhongzong, thought that Li Chongmao, born of Zhongzong and a [[concubine]] and who was only 16 years old, would be easy to control and allow her to preserve her power. The scheme failed, however, when [[Princess Taiping]], the sister of Emperor Zhongzong, launched a coup two weeks later with her nephew Li Longji (later [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]]), son of the abdicated Emperor Ruizong, and overthrew Empress Wei and the young emperor.  Emperor Ruizong, the father of Li Longji and the older brother of Princess Taiping, was restored as emperor.\n\n==Background==\nLi Xi\u01cen<ref>Tonal signs for his original name are used in this section only to disambiguate between him and his brother [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]].</ref> was born in 656, as the seventh son of his father [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] and the third son of his mother, Emperor Gaozong's second wife [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]] (later known as Wu Zetian).  In 657, he was created the Prince of Zhou and nominally made the prefect of the eastern capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (\u6d1b\u5dde, roughly modern [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]).  In 661, when his older brother [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]] the Prince of Pei had the literarily-talented official [[Wang Bo (poet)|Wang Bo]] on staff, the princes were apparently often engaged in [[cockfighting]].  Wang Bo wrote a playful piece entitled the ''Declaration Against the Prince of Zhou's Cock'' (\u6a84\u5468\u738b\u96de\u6587), which, however, when Emperor Gaozong read it, caused Emperor Gaozong to be angry, as he believed this would cause discord between his sons, and therefore expelled Wang from the Pei mansion.  However, in 674, a similar incident happened by Emperor Gaozong's own instigation\u2014as, at an imperial feast, he divided the imperial musicians into two teams and had Li Xi\u00e1n and Li Xi\u01cen lead the two teams in competition\u2014although he stopped when the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Hao Chujun]] pointed out the potential for rivalry.\n\nMeanwhile, during the years that Li Xi\u01cen was the Prince of Zhou, he had married a daughter of his grandaunt the Princess Changle and her husband, the general Zhao Gui (\u8d99\u74cc), as his wife and princess.  Emperor Gaozong had often shown favors to Princess Changle, and this displeased Empress Wu.  In 675, on account of this, she had Princess Zhao accused of crimes and put into solitary confinement at the bureau of eunuchs.  She was given raw vegetables and raw meat for her to cook them herself.  However, sometime later, the kitchen stopped to have smoke and steam come out of it, and when Empress Wu had her confinement house opened, Princess Zhao was seen dead inside, having starved to death.  Empress Wu also demoted Zhao Gui to be the prefect of Kuo Prefecture (\u62ec\u5dde, roughly modern [[Lishui, Zhejiang|Lishui]], [[Zhejiang]]) and ordered Princess Changle to accompany her husband to Kuo Prefecture, and further ordered that neither Zhao Gui nor Princess Changle would be allowed to enter the palace.\n\nIn 676, when the [[Tibetan Empire]] attacked Tang's western prefectures, Li Xi\u01cen and his younger brother [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Lun]], the Prince of Xiang, were nominally put in charge of the two armies that were actually commanded by the generals Liu Shenli (\u5289\u5be9\u79ae) and Qibi Heli (\u5951\u82fe\u4f55\u529b), but neither Li Xi\u01cen nor Li Lun actually set out with the troops.\n\nIn 677, Li Xi\u01cen had his title changed to Prince of Ying.  His name was also changed to Li Zhe.  He was also made the prefect of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (\u96cd\u5dde, roughly modern [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]]).\n\nBy 680, Li Xi\u00e1n, who was then [[crown prince]], had lost Empress Wu's favor.  After she suspected him of having had her trusted sorcerer Ming Chongyan (\u660e\u5d07\u513c) assassinated, she had him investigated for treason, and subsequently, he was found guilty.  He was reduced to commoner rank and exiled, and Li Zhe was created crown prince to replace him.  Hao Chujun and another chancellor, [[Liu Rengui]], were made his senior advisors.  Emperor Gaozong also recruited the famed hermit scholar Tian Youyan (\u7530\u904a\u5dd6) to serve as an advisor, although Tian would later draw criticism from others for not having any actual good advice for the crown prince.\n\n==First stint as crown prince==\nIn 681, after Emperor Gaozong had become ill after consuming pills made by [[alchemy|alchemists]], he had Li Zhe briefly exercise imperial powers.\n\nIn 682, Li Zhe's second wife, [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Wei]], gave birth to a son, [[Li Chongrun|Li Chongzhao]].  Emperor Gaozong was pleased, and he created Li Chongzhao the unprecedented title of \"Deputy Crown Prince\" (\u7687\u592a\u5b6b, ''Huang Taisun'').  Later that year, due to a famine in the [[Guanzhong]] region (i.e., the region around the capital [[Chang'an]]), Emperor Gaozong took up residence at the eastern capital [[Luoyang]], leaving Li Zhe in charge of Chang'an, assisted by the chancellors Liu Rengui, [[Pei Yan]], and [[Xue Yuanchao]].  it was said that while Li Zhe was in charge of Chang'an, he often spent his time on games and hunting, and Xue often advised him against spending time in this manner.  When Emperor Gaozong heard this, he rewarded Xue and summoned Xue to Luoyang.\n\nIn 683, Emperor Gaozong became ill at Luoyang, and he summoned Li Zhe to Luoyang, leaving Li Chongrun nominally in charge of Chang'an, assisted by Liu.<ref>The ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' indicated that the son of Li Zhe left nominally in charge of Chang'an was [[Li Chongfu]] the Prince of Tangchang.  See ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377203|vol. 203]].  However, both the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''New Book of Tang'' indicated that it was Li Chongzhao who was left in charge, and as Li Chongzhao's position was higher than Li Chongfu's, it appeared more likely that Li Chongzhao was in charge.  See ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537784|vol. 84]], and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377180|vol. 180]].  The ''Old Book of Tang'' did, elsewhere, indicate that Li Chongfu, not Li Chongzhao, was nominally in charge.  See ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53775|vol. 5]]</ref>  After Li Zhe arrived at Luoyang, Emperor Gaozong transferred imperial powers to him, and soon died.  Li Zhe took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but actual powers were entire in the hands of Empress Wu, now [[empress dowager]] and [[regent]].\n\n==First reign under Empress Dowager Wu's regency==\nEmperor Zhongzong, in spring 684, made his wife, Crown Princess Wei, [[queen consort|empress consort]], and he wanted to make his father-in-law, Wei Xuanzhen (\u97cb\u7384\u8c9e) ''Shizhong'' ({{zh|c=\u4f8d\u4e2d}}) \u2013 the head of the examination bureau of government and a post considered one for a chancellor.  He also wanted to make the son of his [[wet nurse]] an official of the fifth rank. Pei Yan resisted both commissions.  As they argued, Emperor Zhongzong, in anger, remarked, \"What would be wrong even if I gave the empire to Wei Xuanzhen?  Why do you care about ''Shizhong'' so much? <ref>[\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377203|vol. 203, p. 6417]</ref>\n\nPei, in fear, informed Empress Dowager Wu.  Just less than two months after Emperor Zhongzong had taken the throne, Empress Dowager Wu summoned the officials and generals and issued an edict deposing Emperor Zhongzong and reducing to the title of Prince of Luling.  As generals loyal to her physically removed Emperor Zhongzong from the throne, he struggled and asked, \"What crime have I committed?\"  Empress Dowager Wu responded, \"You wanted to give the empire to Wei Xuanzhen.  How can that not be a crime?\"  She had him put under arrest and reduced him to the rank of Prince of Luling, and she made Li Lun (now named Li Dan) the Prince of Yu the new emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).  Li Chongzhao was reduced to commoner rank.\n\n==In exile==\nEmpress Dowager Wu soon ordered that Li Zhe and his family first be delivered to Fang Prefecture (\u623f\u5dde, in modern [[Shiyan]], [[Hubei]]), and then Jun Prefecture (\u5747\u5dde, also in modern Shiyan), to be held under house arrest at the house that his uncle [[Li Tai]] had been placed after Li Tai was deposed in 643.  (Subsequently, in 685, he was moved back to Fang Prefecture.)  On the way to exile, Princess Wei gave birth to a daughter.  There was nothing to wrap the baby with, so Li Zhe took off his own shirt and wrapped the baby in it.  To commemorate this, the daughter was subsequently named [[Princess Anle|Li Guo'er]] (Guo'er meaning \"the child that was wrapped\").  Li Zhe and Princess Wei both greatly favored this child born in distress.\n\nLi Zhe was constantly in fear in exile, as Empress Dowager Wu had previously shown willingness to kill her own children\u2014having forced Li Xi\u00e1n to commit suicide in 684 and having been rumored to have poisoned another son, [[Li Hong]], in 675\u2014and whenever there would be imperial messengers arriving from then-capital [[Luoyang]], he would consider committing suicide, fearing that they brought orders for even worse fates.  Princess Wei would repeatedly tell him:\n\n{{quote|There is no set pattern to bad and good fortune.  Since we will all die one day anyway, why hasten death?}}\n\nAt this point, they were deeply in love with each other, and at another point, he told her:\n\n{{quote|If we will see the light of day again, I will not stop you from doing anything.}}\n\nWhile Li Zhe was in exile, people who rebelled against or plotted against Empress Dowager Wu often used him as a symbol of their resistance.  For example, when [[Li Jingye]] the Duke of Ying rose against Empress Dowager Wu later in 684, he declared that his goal was to restore Li Zhe.  Other examples included Yang Chucheng (\u694a\u521d\u6210) in 687 and Li Yin (\u674e\u8af2) the Duke of Poyang (Emperor Gaozong's cousin) in 689.\n\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as \"empress regnant\" of a new [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou Dynasty]], interrupting Tang.  She created Emperor Ruizong crown prince with the unusual title ''Huangsi'' (\u7687\u55e3), and initially, Li Zhe's status was not changed.\n\n==Second stint as crown prince In the reign of his mother Wu Zetian==\nIn 697, during a major [[Khitan people|Khitan]] incursion, led by the khan [[Sun Wanrong]], Sun issued a declaration questioning why Wu Zetian was keeping Li Zhe in exile.  Thereafter, the chancellor [[Di Renjie]] often counseled Wu Zetian to recall Li Zhe, which fellow chancellors [[Wang Fangqing]] and [[Wang Jishan]] also agreed with.  Further, Wu Zetian's close associate [[Ji Xu]] also advocated it and further persuaded her lovers [[Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong]] to advocate the same.  Wu Zetian finally agreed, and in 698 recalled Li Zhe and his family back to Luoyang, then capital.  Shortly thereafter, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian agreed, creating Li Zhe crown prince, demoting Li Dan to the rank of Prince of Xiang.  She also changed his name back to Li Xi\u01cen, and subsequently changed his surname to Wu.  Subsequently, when she named him the nominal commander of the forces defending against a major [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks|G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]] incursion, it was said that as soon as he was named the commander, men swarmed to enlist.\n\nIn 699, fearing that after her death the Li and Wu clans would not be able to keep peace with each other, Wu Zetian had Li Xi\u01cen, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, and her husband [[Wu Youji]] (Wu Zetian's nephew) swear an oath to each other.\n\nIn 701, Li Chongzhao (now named Li Chongrun to observe [[naming taboo]] for Wu Zetian (whose personal name was Wu Zhao) and now carrying the title of Prince of Shao), Li Zhe's daughter [[Li Xianhui]] the Princess Yongtai, and Li Xianhui's husband Wu Yanji (\u6b66\u5ef6\u57fa) the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian's grandnephew), were accused of secretly disparaging Wu Zetian's relationships with Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong.  In anger, Wu Zetian ordered the three of them to commit suicide.<ref>The ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' asserted that Li Chongrun was forced to commit suicide, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' asserted in his biographies that he was caned to death on Wu Zetian's orders.  Compare ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377207|vol. 207]], with ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537786|vol. 86]] and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377081|vol. 81]]. The ''Old Book of Tang'', meanwhile, inconsistently asserted in the chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign that he was forced to commit suicide.  See ''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53776|vol. 6]]. The chronicles of Wu Zetian's reign in the ''New Book of Tang'' merely stated that the three of them \"were killed.\"  See  ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377004|vol. 4]]</ref><ref>However, some modern historians, based on the text on Li Xianhui's tombstone (written after Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne in 705), which suggested that she died the day after her brother and her husband and that she was pregnant at death, and the fact that the skeleton believed to be hers had a small pelvis, have proposed the theory that she was not ordered to commit suicide, but had, in grief over her brother's and husband's deaths, had either a miscarriage or a difficult birth and died from that.  See, e.g., illustrations preceding the ''[[Bo Yang]] Edition'' of the ''Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 49.  It may be notable that the [[Chinese Wikipedia]] article for [[:zh:\u674e\u4ed9\u8559|Li Xianhui]] gave the text for her tombstone, but did not give an external link corroborating the text in the article.</ref><!-- insert more definitive link later if locatable -->\n\nIn spring 705, Wu Zetian was seriously ill, and Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were attending to her and, at her direction, handling the major affairs of state, and there were rumors that they were seeking to displace Li Xi\u01cen.  The chancellors [[Zhang Jianzhi]] and [[Cui Xuanwei]], along with other officials [[Jing Hui]], [[Huan Yanfan]], and [[Yuan Shuji]] plotted to overthrow her and the Zhang brothers.  They persuaded the generals [[Li Duozuo]] and Li Dan (\u674e\u6e5b, note different character than the Prince of Xiang) to join the plot.  With agreement from Li Xi\u01cen as well, the coup leaders acted on 20 February,<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna=%AD%F0&king=%A4%A4%A9v&reign=%AF%AB%C0s&yy=1&ycanzi=&mm=1&dd=22&dcanzi= \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323054815/http://www.blayney.nsw.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/329/3h%20-%20Hobbys%20Yards%20Heritage%20Items.pdf.aspx |date=2015-03-23 }}</ref> killing Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, and then surrounding Wu Zetian.  She, in fear, asked, \"Who is disturbing me?\"  Zhang Jianzhi responded, in a formalistic manner:\n\n{{quote|Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong committed treason.  Following the orders of the Crown Prince, we have executed them.  Because we were afraid that the secret would be leaked, we did not dare to first report to Your Imperial Majesty.  We are guilty of the great disrespect of moving troops within the palace, and should be executed 10,000 times.}}\n\nWu Zetian subsequently tried to have Li Xi\u01cen returned to the palace of the Crown Prince, but the coup leaders ignored her.  While the coup leaders allowed Wu Zetian to retain the title of \"emperor,\" they had her put under house arrest at the secondary palace Shangyang Palace (\u4e0a\u967d\u5bae) and forced her to yield the throne to Li Xi\u01cen, who was formerly emperor, and he was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong).\n\n==Second reign under Empress Wei's shadow== \nOnce restored, Emperor Zhongzong initially put the five coup leaders in prominent positions. However, Empress Wei, once restored, became the most powerful and dominant figure at court, along with Li Guo'er, who now carried the title of Princess Anle And from now on he set up a faction to run the country. Also  powerful was Wu Zetian's secretary [[Shangguan Wan'er]], whom Emperor Zhongzong took as a [[concubine]], who was also having an affair with Wu Zetian's nephew [[Wu Sansi]] the Prince of Liang.  Under her introduction, Empress Wei and Wu Sansi also soon started having an affair.  With Consort Shangguan's and Empress Wei's influence, Wu Sansi became a powerful and trusted advisor to Emperor Zhongzong.  Meanwhile, Empress Wei, disliking Emperor Zhongzong's oldest surviving son [[Li Chongfu]] the Prince of Qiao (born of a concubine), falsely accused Li Chongfu of complicit in Li Chongrun's death.  Emperor Zhongzong demoted Li Chongfu out of the capital to serve as a prefectural prefect, under heavy guard.  Emperor Zhongzong initially offered the crown prince position to Li Dan, but after Li Dan declined, created another son by a concubine, [[Li Chongjun]], crown prince.\n\nThe coup leaders, meanwhile, were trying to curb Wu Sansi's rise, but in turn, Wu Sansi and Empress Wei repeatedly warned Emperor Zhongzong that the coup leaders were overly powerful and dangerous.  In fall 705, Emperor Zhongzong agreed, and created the coup leaders princes under guise of honoring them, but removed them from their chancellor positions.\n\nIn winter 705, Wu Zetian died.  Her \"emperor\" title was subsequently removed and empress title restored, and Emperor Zhongzong buried her at [[Qianling Mausoleum|Qianling]], with his father Emperor Gaozong.  (Also buried there were Emperor Zhongzong's brother Li Xi\u00e1n, Li Chongrun, and Li Xianhui.)\n\nIn spring 706, after Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (\u738b\u540c\u768e, husband of Princess Ding'an), who despised Empress Wei and Wu Sansi, was accused of plotting to kill Wu Sansi and depose Empress Wei, Wang and his alleged coconspirators were executed, and subsequently, Wu Sansi and his associates accused Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, Zhang Jianzhi, Yuan Shuji, and Cui Xuanwei of being complicit in Wang's plot.  The five princes were exiled and subsequently died or were killed in exile.\n\nIn 707, Li Chongjun, angry that Li Guo'er and her husband Wu Chongxun (\u6b66\u5d07\u8a13, Wu Sansi's son) had repeatedly humiliated him and tried to get Li Guo'er created crown princess to displace him, rose in rebellion with Li Duozuo and the generals Li Sichong (\u674e\u601d\u6c96), Li Chengkuang (\u674e\u627f\u6cc1), Dugu Yizhi (\u7368\u5b64\u7995\u4e4b), and Shazha Zhongyi (\u6c99\u5412\u5fe0\u7fa9), along with Emperor Zhongzong's cousin Li Qianli (\u674e\u5343\u91cc) the Prince of Cheng and Li Qianli's son LI Xi (\u674e\u79a7) the Prince of Tianshui.  They attacked Wu Sansi's mansion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun, and then marched on to the palace, trying to seize Consort Shangguan, Empress Wei, and Li Guo'er.  The rebels hesitated at attacking the palace, and the imperial guards fought back.  After the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Yang Sixu (\u694a\u601d\u52d7) killed Li Duozuo's son-in-law Ye Huli (\u91ce\u547c\u5229), and Emperor Zhongzong made a personal appeal to the coup forces, the coup forces turned against Li Chongjun, killing the generals commanding them.  Li Chongjun fled but was killed in exile.  Subsequently, the senior chancellor [[Wei Yuanzhong]], whose son Wei Sheng (\u9b4f\u5347) had been forced to join the rebellion, was exiled and killed in exile at the instigation of two chancellors aligned with Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, [[Zong Chuke]] and [[Ji Chuna]].  However, attempts by Empress Wei's party to implicate Li Dan and Princess Taiping were unsuccessful.\n\nMeanwhile, the court was dominated by a number of powerful women, including Li Guo'er, Princess Changning (Emperor Zhongzong's and Empress Wei's older daughter), Empress Wei's sister Lady of Cheng, Consort Shangguan, Consort Shangguan's mother Lady Zheng of Pei, senior [[lady-in-waiting|ladies in waiting]] Chai and Helou, the sorceress Diwu Ying'er (\u7b2c\u4e94\u82f1\u5152), and Lady Zhao of Longxi.  These women were openly accepting bribes, and were able to recommend a number of people to be officials, directly commissioned by Emperor Zhongzong without approval from the legislative (\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701, ''Zhongshu Sheng'') and examination (\u9580\u4e0b\u7701, ''Menxia Sheng'') bureaus.  The civil service system was said to be overrun with corruption and running into near collapse.\n\nIn winter 708, after the Tuqishi (\u7a81\u9a0e\u65bd) chieftain [[Suoge]] (\u5a11\u845b), who had just succeeded his father [[Wuzhile]] (\u70cf\u8cea\u52d2), was challenged by Wuzhile's subordinate Juechuo Zhongjie (\u95d5\u555c\u5fe0\u7bc0),<ref>The ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', followed by the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', referred to this person as Juechuo Zhongjie, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' referred to him as Ashina Zhongjie (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u5fe0\u7bc0).</ref> Juechuo, who was unable to prevail over Suoge, bribed Zong and Ji to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to prepare a joint attack against Tuqishi with the Tibetan Empire, despite counsel by the general [[Guo Yuanzhen]] against it.  When Suoge heard this, he launched an attack preemptively, attacking several key Tang garrisons, capturing Juechuo, and killing the Tang general Feng Jiabin (\u99ae\u5609\u8cd3), who had been sent to assist Juechuo.  Subsequently, after Emperor Zhongzong recognized Suoge's authority over the Tuqishi tribes, hostility ceased, and Suoge again became a Tang vassal.\n\nIn spring 710, Emperor Zhongzong sent Princess Jincheng, the daughter of his nephew [[Li Shouli]] the Prince of Yong (Li Xi\u00e1n's son), to the Tibetan Empire to be married to its emperor, [[Me Agtsom]], cementing peace between the two states.\n\n==In Fiction & Popular Culture==\n*Portrayed by [[Raymond Cho]] in [[The Greatness of a Hero]] (2009).\n\n==Death==\nMeanwhile, there had been accusations made by individuals such as Lang Ji (\u90ce\u5c8c) and Yan Qinrong (\u71d5\u6b3d\u878d) that Empress Wei was committing adultery, and that her partisans, including Li Guo'er, her new husband Wu Yanxiu (\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0, a grandnephew of Wu Zetian), and Zong Chuke, were planning to overthrow the Tang dynasty.  Emperor Zhongzong ordered Lang executed, but became displeased when Zong had Yan killed without Emperor Zhongzong having decided to do so.  This caused Empress Wei and her partisans to begin to become apprehensive.  Empress Wei was, meanwhile, having affairs with the officials Ma Qinke (\u99ac\u79e6\u5ba2) and Yang Jun (\u694a\u5747).  She wanted to be Empress Regnant like Wu Zetian, and Li Guo'er wanted to be crown princess\u2014a request that Emperor Zhongzong had repeatedly rebuffed.  According to traditional historians, they thus decided to have Emperor Zhongzong killed.  They accomplished this by putting poison in a cake, and after Emperor Zhongzong ate the cake, he died on 3 July, 710.<ref>[http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=1&yy=710&mm=7&dd=3 \u5169\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u897f\u66c6\u8f49\u63db<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814060529/https://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=1&yy=710&mm=7&dd=3 |date=2017-08-14 }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] the Prince of Wen, was named emperor, with Empress Wei retaining power as empress dowager and regent.  Less than a month later, Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] the Prince of Linzi rose in rebellion and killed Empress Wei and Li Guo'er.  Subsequently, Li Dan took the throne again, displacing Emperor Shang.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Zhongzong was buried in an imperial burial, and as Empress Wei was considered unsuitable to be buried with him, Emperor Ruizong was set to bury Emperor Zhongzong's first wife Princess Zhao, whom Emperor Zhongzong had posthumously honored an empress, with him, but Princess Zhao's body could no longer be located.  Therefore, a ceremony was held in which her spirit was summoned to accompany Emperor Zhongzong in death.\n\n==Era names==\n\n===First reign===\n* ''Sisheng'' (\u55e3\u8056 s\u00ec sh\u00e8ng) 684\n\n===Second reign===\n* ''Shenlong'' (\u795e\u9f8d sh\u00e9n l\u00f3ng) 705\u2013707 (inherited from Wu Zetian)\n* ''Jinglong'' (\u666f\u9f8d j\u01d0ng l\u00f3ng) 707\u2013710\n\n==Chancellors during reign==\n\n===First reign===\n* [[Liu Rengui]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Pei Yan]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Guo Daiju]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Cen Changqian]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Guo Zhengyi]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Wei Xuantong]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Liu Jingxian]] (683\u2013684)\n* [[Wei Hongmin]] (684)\n\n===Second reign===\n* [[Wei Anshi]] (705, 705\u2013706, 709\u2013710)\n* [[Cui Xuanwei]] (705)\n* [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]] (705)\n* [[Yang Zaisi]] (705\u2013709)\n* [[Tang Xiujing]] (705\u2013706, 709\u2013710)\n* [[Zhang Jianzhi]] (705)\n* [[Fang Rong]] (705)\n* [[Wei Chengqing]] (705)\n* [[Yuan Shuji]] (705)\n* [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Dan]] (705)\n* [[Jing Hui]] (705)\n* [[Huan Yanfan]] (705)\n* [[Wu Sansi]] (705)\n* [[Zhu Qinming]] (705\u2013706)\n* [[Wei Yuanzhong]] (705\u2013707)\n* [[Li Huaiyuan]] (705\u2013706, 706)\n* [[Doulu Qinwang]] (705\u2013709)\n* [[Wei Juyuan]] (705, 706\u2013710)\n* [[Li Jiao (Tang Dynasty)|Li Jiao]] (706\u2013710)\n* [[Yu Weiqian]] (706\u2013707)\n* [[Su Gui]] (706\u2013707, 709\u2013710)\n* [[Zong Chuke]] (707\u2013710)\n* [[Ji Chuna]] (707\u2013710)\n* [[Xiao Zhizhong]] (707\u2013710)\n* [[Zhang Renyuan]] (708\u2013710)\n* [[Wei Sili]] (709\u2013710)\n* [[Cui Shi]] (709)\n* [[Zhao Yanzhao]] (709\u2013710)\n* [[Wei Wen]] (709\u2013710)\n* [[Zheng Yin (Early Tang)|Zheng Yin]] (709)\n\n==Family==\n* Parents:\n** [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Li Zhi]], Gaozong ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u5b97 \u674e\u6cbb}};

Lewisite immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and is a strong [[irritant]] and [[blistering agent]]. Due to its arsenic center, lewisite may also cause problems similar to arsenic poisonings like stomach ailments and low blood pressure.\n\n===Inhalation===\nInhalation, the most common route of exposure, causes a burning pain and irritation throughout the respiratory tract, [[nosebleed]] (epistaxis), [[laryngitis]], [[Sneeze|sneezing]], [[cough]]ing, [[vomiting]], difficult breathing ([[dyspnea]]).

Lewisite immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and is a strong [[irritant]] and [[blistering agent]]. Due to its arsenic center, lewisite may also cause problems similar to arsenic poisonings like stomach ailments and low blood pressure.\n===Inhalation===\nInhalation, the most common route of exposure, causes a burning pain and irritation throughout the respiratory tract, [[nosebleed]] (epistaxis), [[laryngitis]], [[Sneeze|sneezing]], [[cough]]ing, [[vomiting]], difficult breathing ([[dyspnea]]). From one acute exposure, someone who has inhaled lewisite can develop [[chronic respiratory disease]].<ref name=\":0\"/> In severe cases of exposure, can cause fatal [[pulmonary edema]], [[pneumonitis]], or [[respiratory failure]]. \n===Ingestion===\nIngestion results in severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and tissue damage.<ref name=\":0\"/> Those exposed to lewisite can develop refractory [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) known as Lewisite shock, as well as some features of arsenic toxicity.<ref>Chauhan, S.; Chauhan, S.; D\u2019Cruz, R.; Faruqi, S.; Singh, K. K.; Varma, S.; Singh, M.; Karthik, V. Chemical warfare agents. Environ. Toxicol.

When the blood pressure is low, the kidneys may not receive enough oxygen and can be [[Kidney damage|damaged]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n===Eye Exposure===\nThe results of eye exposure can range from stinging, burning pain and strong irritation to [[blister]]ing and [[Keratitis|scarring of the cornea]], along with [[blepharospasm]], [[lacrimation]], and [[Periorbital edema|edema of the eyelids and periorbital area]]. Eye exposure to lewisite can cause permanent visual impairment or blindness.<ref name=\":0\"/> The eyes can swell shut, which can keep the eyes safe from further exposure. The most severe consequences of eye exposure to lewisite are [[Globe rupture|globe perforation]] and [[Visual impairment|blindness]].<ref name=\":0\"/> Generalised symptoms also include restlessness, weakness, hypothermia and low blood pressure.\n===Chronic Exposure===\nChronic exposure to lewisite can cause [[arsenic poisoning]] and development of a lewisite [[allergy]]. It can also cause various long-term illnesses or permanent damage to organs, depending on where the exposure has occurred, including [[conjunctivitis]], aversion to light ([[photophobia]]), visual impairment, double vision ([[diplopia]]), tearing ([[Tears|lacrimation]]), dry mucous membranes, [[garlic breath]], burning pain in the nose and mouth, [[toxic encephalopathy]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[bronchitis]], [[dermatitis]], [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin ulcers]], [[Basal-cell carcinoma|basal cell carcinoma]], and [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\t\n==Treatment==\t\nBasic first aid for lewisite exposure is [[decontamination]] and [[irrigation]] of any areas that have been exposed, and when necesssary [[airway management]], [[Mechanical ventilation|assisted ventilation]], and [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring of vital signs]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n[[Dimercaprol|British anti-lewisite]], also called [[dimercaprol]], is the antidote for lewisite.

On a shared Mac/non-Mac network, it is possible for the login keychain's password to lose synchronization if the user's login password is changed from a non-Mac system. Also, if the password is changed from a directory service like Active Directory or Open Directory, or if the password is changed from another admin account e.g. using the System Preferences. Some network administrators react to this by deleting the keychain file on logout, so that a new one will be created next time the user logs in. This means keychain passwords will not be remembered from one session to the next, even if the login password has not been changed. If this happens, the user can restore the keychain file in <tt>~/Library/Keychains/</tt> from a backup, but doing so will lock the keychain which will then need to be unlocked at next use.\n\n==Keychain Access==\nKeychain Access is a [[macOS]] application that allows the user to access the Keychain and configure its contents, including [[password]]s for [[website]]s, [[form (web)|web forms]], [[file transfer protocol|FTP servers]], [[secure shell|SSH]] accounts, [[network share]]s, [[wireless network]]s, [[groupware|groupware applications]], [[encryption|encrypted]] [[disk image]]s, etc. It unlocks, locks, and displays passwords saved by the system which are dynamically linked to the user's login password, as well as managing [[root certificate]]s, keys, and secure notes.\n\nIts [[graphical user interface]] displays various keychains, with there usually being at least two: the login keychain and the system keychain. It also includes the Keychain first aid utility (which was removed by the 10.11.2 update) that can repair problems with Keychains. Various events can cause problems with Keychains, and sometimes the only solution to a problem is to delete the Keychain, which also deletes any passwords stored in the Keychain, and create a new one.\n\nIt is usually found in the Utilities folder under Applications in macOS. As an ancillary application to macOS, it is subject to updates via [[Apple Software Update|Software Update]] and thus should not be moved out of the Utilities folder. There is also an included command-line tool to access the keychain, called \"security\".\n\n==History==\nKeychains were initially developed for Apple's e-mail system, [[Apple Open Collaboration Environment|PowerTalk]], in the early 1990s. Among its many features, PowerTalk used [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] that allowed mail to be retrieved from a wide variety of mail servers and online services. The keychain concept naturally \"fell out\" of this code, and was used in PowerTalk to manage all of a user's various login credentials for the various e-mail systems PowerTalk could connect to.\n\nThe passwords were not easily retrievable due to the encryption, yet the simplicity of the interface allowed the user to select a different password for every system without fear of forgetting them, as a single password would open the file and return them all. At the time, implementations of this concept were not available on other platforms. Keychain was one of the few parts of PowerTalk that was obviously useful \"on its own\", which suggested it should be promoted to become a part of the basic Mac OS. But due to internal politics, it was kept inside the PowerTalk system and, therefore, available to very few Mac users.{{citation needed | date = March 2015}}\n\nIt was not until the return of [[Steve Jobs]] in 1997 that Keychain concept was revived from the now-discontinued PowerTalk. By this point in time the concept was no longer so unusual, but it was still rare to see a keychain system that was not associated with a particular piece of application software, typically a [[web browser]]. Keychain was later made a standard part of Mac OS 9, and was included in [[macOS|Mac OS X]] in the first commercial versions.\n\n==Security==\nKeychain is distributed with both iOS and macOS. The iOS version is simpler because applications that run on mobile devices typically need only very basic Keychain features. For example, features such as ACLs (Access Control Lists) and sharing Keychain items between different apps are not present. Thus, iOS Keychain items are only accessible to the app that created them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[List of password managers]]\n* [[Password manager]]\n* [[Cryptography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Apple}}\n{{Mac OS}}\n{{macOS}}\n{{Password managers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keychain}}\n[[Category:MacOS security technology]]\n[[Category:PIM-software for MacOS]]\n[[Category:Free password managers]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apple Public Source License]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2013}}\n{{Primary sources|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox software\n|name = Keychain\n| logo = [[Image:Keychain Access Icon.png|75px|Keychain Icon]]\n| screenshot =\n| caption =\n| developer = [[Apple Inc.]]\n| latest_release_version =\n| latest_release_date =\n| operating_system = [[Mac OS 9]], [[macOS]]\n| genre = [[software utility|system utility]]\n| license = [[Apple Public Source License|APSL]] 2.0\n| website = [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services Keychain Services]\n}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name = Keychain Access\n| logo = [[Image:Keychain Access Icon.png|75px]]\n| screenshot = [[Image:keychainaccess.png|220px]]\n| caption = Screenshot of Keychain Access on [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5]].\n| developer = [[Apple Inc.]]\n| latest_release_version = 10.5 (55237.200.14)\n| latest_release_date = August 21, 2018\n| latest_preview_version = \n| latest_preview_date = \n| operating_system = [[Mac OS 9]], [[macOS]]\n| genre = [[password manager]]\n| license = \n| website = [https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/welcome/mac Keychain Access Help]\n}}\n\n'''Keychain''' is the [[Password manager|password management system]] in [[macOS]], developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].

The keychain concept naturally \"fell out\" of this code, and was used in PowerTalk to manage all of a user's various login credentials for the various e-mail systems PowerTalk could connect to.\n\nThe passwords were not easily retrievable due to the encryption, yet the simplicity of the interface allowed the user to select a different password for every system without fear of forgetting them, as a single password would open the file and return them all. At the time, implementations of this concept were not available on other platforms. Keychain was one of the few parts of PowerTalk that was obviously useful \"on its own\", which suggested it should be promoted to become a part of the basic Mac OS. But due to internal politics, it was kept inside the PowerTalk system and, therefore, available to very few Mac users.{{citation needed | date = March 2015}}\n\nIt was not until the return of [[Steve Jobs]] in 1997 that Keychain concept was revived from the now-discontinued PowerTalk. By this point in time the concept was no longer so unusual, but it was still rare to see a keychain system that was not associated with a particular piece of application software, typically a [[web browser]]. Keychain was later made a standard part of Mac OS 9, and was included in [[macOS|Mac OS X]] in the first commercial versions.\n\n==Security==\nKeychain is distributed with both iOS and MacOS. The iOS version is simpler because applications that run on mobile devices typically need only very basic Keychain features. For example, features such as ACLs (Access Control Lists) and sharing Keychain items between different apps are not present. Thus, iOS Keychain items are only accessible to the app that created them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[List of password managers]]\n* [[Password manager]]\n* [[Cryptography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Apple}}\n{{Mac OS}}\n{{macOS}}\n{{Password managers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keychain}}\n[[Category:MacOS security technology]]\n[[Category:PIM-software for MacOS]]\n[[Category:Free password managers]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apple Public Source License]]\n", "name_user": "Lopifalko", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSecurity:Capitalisation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(software)"}
