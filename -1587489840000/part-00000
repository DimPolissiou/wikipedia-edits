A kiteboarder harnesses the [[wind power|power of the wind]] with a large controllable [[power kite]] to be propelled across the water, land, or snow.\n\nCompared to the other sailing sports, kiteboarding is both among the less expensive (including equipment) and the more convenient. It is also unique in that it harvests the wind energy from a much larger atmosphere volume, comparing to sail size.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nIn the 1800s, George Pocock used [[kite]]s of increased size to propel carts on land and ships on the water, using a four-line control system\u2014the same system in common use today. Both carts and boats were able to turn and sail upwind. The kites could be flown for sustained periods.<ref name=\"Jelling\">Jakob Jelling [http://www.kitesurfingnow.com/kitesurfing-facts/history-of-kitesurfing.shtml History of kitesurfing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129054908/http://www.kitesurfingnow.com/kitesurfing-facts/history-of-kitesurfing.shtml |date=29 November 2006 }} Kitesurfingnow</ref> The intention was to establish kitepower as an alternative to horsepower, partly to avoid the hated \"horse tax\" that was levied at that time.<ref name=\"Lynn1\">Peter Lynn [http://www.aquilandiafestival.com/inter2-surf1.htm A brief history of kitesurfing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819073552/http://www.aquilandiafestival.com/inter2-surf1.htm |date=19 August 2006 }}, Aquilandia.com, 2006</ref> In 1903, aviation pioneer [[Samuel Cody]] developed \"[[man-lifting kite]]s\" and succeeded in crossing the [[English Channel]] in a small collapsible canvas boat powered by a kite<ref>[http://www.design-technology.org/military.htm Samuel Franklin Cody and his man-lifting kite], www.design-technology.org, 2005</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\n\n[[File:US4708078 fig 10.png|thumb|1984 patent of the Legaignoux brothers<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |number= 4708078 |title= Propulsive wing with inflatable armature |pridate= Nov 16, 1984 |inventor= Bruno T.

In 1978, Ian Day's \"FlexiFoil\" kite-powered Tornado [[catamaran]] exceeded 40&nbsp;km/h.\n\nIn October 1977 Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise (Netherlands) received the first patent<ref>[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=NL&NR=7603691&KC=&FT=E], Patent NL7603691  (A) \u2015 11 October 1977</ref> for KiteSurfing. The patent covers, specifically, a water sport using a floating board of a surf board type where a pilot standing up on it is pulled by a wind catching device of a parachute type tied to his harness on a trapeze type belt. Although this patent did not result in any commercial interest, Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise could be considered as the originator of KiteSurfing.\n\nOn 28 August 1982 Greg Locke and Simon Carter, from [[Brighton]] UK, set the world record for kite traction at sea, travelling nearly 26 miles under wind power alone along the English channel.<ref>[http://www.kitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Kite-Lines-v4-3.pdf], Kitelines Vol 4, No. 3, p60</ref> This followed a successful crossing of the English Channel from Sussex to France by Locke & Carter the previous year.\n\nThrough the 1980s, there were occasionally successful attempts to combine kites with canoes, [[ice skate]]s, snow skis,<ref name=Harris1>Mark Harris [http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html Sea kayaking and kites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703034411/http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html |date=3 July 2006 }}, July 2002</ref> [[water ski]]s and [[roller skates]].\n\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Dieter Strasilla from [[Germany]] developed parachute-skiing and later perfected a kite-skiing system using self-made [[paraglider]]s and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to sail upwind and uphill but also to take off into the air at will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skywing.de|title=Dieter Strasilla|publisher=}}</ref> Strasilla and his Swiss friend Andrea Kuhn used this invention also in combination with surfboards and snowboards, grasskies and self-made buggies.<ref>{{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ZzPXzK6wg |title= History of paragliding: Andrea with surfboard and skywing |date= 1987 |author=  Dieter Strasilla}}</ref> One of his patents describes in 1979 the first use of an inflatable kite design for kitesurfing.<ref>Patent DE2933050</ref>\n\nTwo brothers, Bruno Legaignoux and Dominique Legaignoux, from the Atlantic coast of [[France]], developed kites for kitesurfing in the late 1970s and early 1980s and patented an inflatable kite design in November 1984, a design that has been used by companies to develop their own products.\n\nIn 1990, practical [[kite buggy]]ing was pioneered by [[Peter Lynn]] at Argyle Park in [[Ashburton, New Zealand]]. Lynn coupled a three-wheeled buggy with a forerunner of the modern [[parafoil]] kite. Kite buggying proved to be popular worldwide, with over 14,000 buggies sold up to 1999.\n\nThe development of modern-day kitesurfing by the Roeselers in the [[United States]] and the Legaignoux in [[France]] carried on in parallel to buggying. Bill Roeseler, a [[Boeing]] [[aerodynamicist]], and his son Cory Roeseler patented the \"KiteSki\" system which consisted of water skis powered by a two-line delta style kite controlled via a bar mounted combined winch/brake. The KiteSki was commercially available in 1994. The kite had a rudimentary water launch capability and could go upwind. In 1995, Cory Roeseler visited [[Peter Lynn]] at New Zealand's Lake Clearwater in the Ashburton Alpine Lakes area, demonstrating speed, balance and upwind angle on his 'ski'. In the late 1990s, Cory's ski evolved to a single board similar to a surfboard.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kirklandreporter.com/news/inventors-of-kiteboarding-inducted-into-kirkland-plaza-of-champions/ |date= 28 May 2015 |title= Inventors of kiteboarding inducted into Kirkland Plaza of Champions |publisher= Kirkland Reporter}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Laird Hamilton2.jpg|thumb|[[Laird Hamilton]] demonstrated kitesurfing in 1996]]\n\nIn 1996, [[Laird Hamilton]] and [[Manu Bertin]] were instrumental in demonstrating and popularising kitesurfing off the [[Hawaii]] a coast of [[Maui]] while in Florida Rapha\u00ebl Baruch changed the name of the sport from flysurfing to kitesurfing by starting and promoting the first commercial brand of the industry \"Kitesurf\".\n\nIn 1997, the Legaignoux brothers developed and sold the breakthrough \"Wipika\" kite design which had a structure of preformed inflatable tubes and a simple bridle system to the wingtips, both of which greatly assisted water re-launch. Bruno Legaignoux has continued to improve kite designs, including developing the [[bow kite]] design, which has been licensed to many kite manufacturers.\n\nIn 1997, specialized kiteboards were developed by Rapha\u00ebl Salles and Laurent Ness.  By the end of 1998 kitesurfing had become an extreme sport, distributed and taught through a handful group of shops and schools worldwide. The first competition was held on [[Maui]] in September 1998 and won by Flash Austin.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/>\n\nStarting in 1999, kitesurfing became a mainstream sport with the entry of key windsurfing manufacturers namely [[Robby Naish]] and [[Neil Pryde]]. Single direction boards derived from windsurfing and surfing designs became the dominant form of kiteboard.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Action Sport 2 (2).png|thumb|evolution of extreme sports]]\n\nIn 2000, a new freestyle competition, sponsored by [[Red Bull]] was launched in [[Maui]]. The competition, named [[Red Bull King of the Air]], judged riders on height, versatility, and style.

Style<br />!! Description !! Similar sports\n|-\n| '''Freeride'''|| Freeride is anything that you want it to be and the most popular kitesurfing style. Most boards sold today are designed for freeride.  It's about having fun and learning new techniques.  Twintip boards and kites with good relaunch and a wide wind range are commonly used.|| \n|-\n| '''Freestyle'''|| The kite and board are used to get big air (jumps) so that various tricks can be done while airborne.  This style also used for competitive events and is free-format and \"go anywhere\". Smaller twintip boards and kites with good boost and hangtime are used.|| \n|-\n| '''Wave-riding'''|| Wave riding (kitesurfing) in waves is a style that combines kiteboarding with surfing. Locations with a [[Surf break|wave break]] are required. Most kitesurfers use a directional board (either with or without foot straps) that has enough flotation and sufficient turning characteristics to surf the wave. Many kiters use a surfboard that can also be used for regular surfing (with the foot straps removed). The kitesurfer follows the kite when riding the wave, so the pull of the kite is reduced. This style is popular with [[surfers]] since it resembles [[tow-in surfing]]. Some riders ride waves unhooked, and without foot straps. Foot straps dictate the kitesurfer's foot position and how weight and pressure is applied to the board.  Surfers (other than tow-in surfers) do not wear straps and are therefore free to move their feet and position their weight over a greater area of the board to match what is needed to flow with the wave.  Kitesurfing using a board without foot straps is referred to as \"riding strapless\". This allows the kitesurfer's feet to move around the board for optimal performance.  Kitesurfers using foot straps often use the power of the kite to position themselves on a wave and to control their board. That is, they rely on the kite for propulsion rather than the power of the wave to surf.||[[Surfing]], [[tow-in surfing]]\n|-\n| '''Wakestyle'''|| Tricks and aerials, using a wake-style board with bindings.  May also include tricks and jumps involving ramps. Crossover from [[wakeboarding]]. Flat water is perfect for this style, and the use of big twintip boards with high rocker and wake booties is common. This style is commonly practiced by younger riders.|| [[Wakeboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Jumping''' or '''Airstyle'''|| Jumping, arguably a subset of Freeride, consists of jumping high to optionally perform tricks, sometimes also using kiteloops to get extra hang-time. Often shorter lines and smaller kites are used in stronger wind. C-kites and twintip boards are commonly used. An extension of this style is '''Big Air''' as pioneered by [[Ruben Lenten]] where riders go out in gale force conditions and perform high risk moves like kiteloops or more exactly '''megaloops''' || \u2014\n|-\n| '''Wakeskate'''|| Wakeskaters use a strapless twintip board, similar to [[skateboard]]. Flat water and other conditions similar to Wakestyle.|| [[Skateboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Course racing''' || These are racing events - like a yacht race along a course, that involve both speed and tactics.  Special purpose directional race boards with long fins are used. Some raceboards resemble [[windsurfing]] boards. [[Foilboard]]<nowiki/>s are also now used. The goal is to outperform other kiters and come first in the race. || [[Windsurfing]]\n|-\n| '''Speed racing''' || Speed racing is a style practiced at either formal race events or informally, usually with GPS units. Special purpose directional speed boards, or raceboards with long fins are used.  The goal is travel at the maximum possible speed over 500 meters.||\n|-\n|'''Park Riding'''\n|Park riding resembles wakestyle. Riders use wakeboarding obstacles to perform tricks on them. Difficulty, execution and style\n|-\n| '''Foiling'''|| Foiling involves the attachment of a hydrofoil (foil) and mast to the base a board.  The foil allows the board to completely exit the water frees the rider from impact of surface conditions.  The extreme efficiency of a foil allows it's rider to propel themselves with significantly less wind than those riding the on water's surface while greatly increasing upwind ability and speed.  Different sizes and shapes of the wings on the foil allow one to optimize their boards for speed, stability, or waves. \n|}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zanzibar island Copia (22).jpg|Unhooked freestyle\nFile:Board Off - panoramio.jpg|Board Off hooked-in freestyle\nFile:Jesse Richman by MakenaStockMedia 3.jpg|[[Foilboard|Foiling]] with a kite\nFile:Jesse Richman - Pierre Bouras 1.jpg|Wave-riding\nFile:MINI KTE France 2012 (10798352846).jpg|Course racing\nFile:Luderitz Speed Canal.jpg|The [[L\u00fcderitz Speed Challenge]] had set records\n</gallery>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nKiteboarding can pose hazards to surfers, beachgoers, bystanders and others on the water. Many problems and dangers that may be encountered while learning kiting can be avoided or minimized by taking professional instruction through lesson centers. Kitesurfing schools provide courses and lessons to teach skills including kite launching, flying, landing, usage of the bar, lines and safety devices. Basic skills include:\n* Turning, particularly the \"heel turn jibe\"\n* Controlled flying and jumping, the primary attractions of the sport\n* Board grabs, tricks performed while a rider is jumping or has gained air from popping by grabbing the board in a number of positions with either hand. Each grab has a different name dependent on which part of the board is grabbed and with which hand grabs it. The names generally originate from other board sports like [[Grabs (skateboarding)|skateboarding]] and [[snowboarding]]\n<gallery>\nFile:Kitesurf jump aerial.jpg|Jumping\nFile:Kitesurfer1.jpg|Big Air\nFile:Kitedge.jpg|Kiteboarder edging his board\n</gallery>\n\n==The wind==\n[[File:Windvenster.jpg|thumb|The [[wind]] window]]\n\n===Wind strength and kite sizes===\nKitesurfers change kite size and/or line length depending on wind strength \u2014 stronger winds call for a smaller kite to prevent overpower situations. Kitesurfers will determine the wind strength using either an [[anemometer]] or, more typically, visual clues as shown in the [[Beaufort scale]]. Modern kites dedicated to kitesurfing provide a \"depower\" option to reduce the power in the kite. By using depower, the kite's angle of attack to the wind is reduced, thereby catching less wind in the kite and reducing the pull.\n\n[[Bow kite]]s have a wider wind range than C-kites, so two kite sizes (such as 7 m\u00b2 and 12 m\u00b2) could form an effective quiver for winds ranging from 10 to 30+ knots for a 75&nbsp;kg (165&nbsp;lb) rider.<ref>[http://www.kitesurfbarcelona.com/nkb_mnl12_rebel_en.pdf North Rebel Manual 2012North Sails kitesurfbarcelona.com] 1 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Wind direction and speed===\nCross-shore and cross-onshore winds are the best for unassisted kiteboarding. Direct onshore winds carry the risk of being thrown onto land or stuck in shallows. Direct offshore winds pose the danger of being blown away from the shore in the event of equipment failure or loss of control. However offshore winds can be quite suitable in confined waters, like in a lake or estuary, or when a safety boat is assisting.\n\nThe kiter must maintain a clear perception of the wind direction but also of the wind speed. The Beaufort scale<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/beaufort.html|title=Beaufort Wind Scale|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> is of great assistance in helping users assess the situation. A range of wind up to 33 knots covers the conditions for a safe practice for an experienced rider. A less experienced one should avoid riding with more than 15 knots. Most twintip boards and inflatable kites would be barely rideable below 11 knots, therefore for most cases a user should focus on the winds classified as moderate up to strong.\n\n=== Apparent wind ===\nEven if there is no wind blowing, a kiter can act on the kite lines and force it to move, and then, like with a row, it generates some force resulting from the incidence of the air into the kite's surface. In a gentle breeze, if the user action increases the air speed around the kite 10 times, the generated force increases 100 times, since the wind force acting on a kite is proportional to the square of the wind speed acting on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html|title=The Lift Equation|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref> Thus the relevant notion of ''apparent'' wind, which is the actual wind acting on the moving kite, sail or wing.\n\nThe apparent wind is measured taking the moving kite as the reference frame, therefore its other name as ''relative wind''. By opposition, the wind measured relatively to the ground is called ''true wind''.\n\nWhile the other wind sports can generate considerable apparent wind, their wind forces are limited by the movement of the user platform, since it is attached more or less rigidly to the wing or sail. In this aspect, kiteboarding seems unique among other wind sports, since it allows the user to generate apparent wind independently of the movement of the user platform, the board. For instance, in the initiating kiteboard technic called ''waterstart'', while the user prepares to start in the water, the kite is sent aggressively, generating a propulsive impulse. Then the resulting movement of the board increases tension on the kite lines, which the user controls to manage the riding speed and to navigate at will. The composition of the movements of both the kite and the board, offer the user a great deal of navigation flexibility and creativity, including the possibility to jump significantly, making this a true 3-dimensional sport.\n\n=== Wind power, control lines and kite paths ===\nIn some way all wind sports harvest the energy of the wind. The greater the volume of the atmosphere available to be harvested by the sails, the bigger the available energy to propel the users. As a taller sailing ship harvests more energy from the wind, so does a kiteboarder with longer lines. Compared to a kiteboarder, a windsurfer can extract a higher ratio of wind energy from the available atmosphere volume, but since such volume is much smaller, the resulting energy could be much less than in kiteboarding.\n\nTo increase the power, the kiteboarder typically navigates the kite along an S-shape path, increasing the harvesting of energy since it is traversing most of the atmosphere volume around him. This S-shaped movement is most common when the kiters need a moderate improvement of power. If the user needs an intense improvement of power, it loops the kite. Such loops are stronger when the loop radius is large, and traverses a larger atmosphere volume. The kite loop is an advanced practice, and its power can be quite dangerous. With most modern kites and control bars, to end a kite loop the user just pushes away or releases the bar.\n\nRegarding the length of the lines connecting the kite to the user, longer lines allow the user to harvest wind energy in a larger volume.  Due to the boundary layer effect<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/boundlay.html|title=Boundary Layer|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref> longer lines also allow to harvest stronger winds higher up in the atmosphere. But longer lines make the kite slower to respond to the user actions on the control bar, since the lines form a more pronounced spring-like catenary. Therefore, kitesurfers, who need to react fast to incoming waves, tend to use shorter lines than the other kiters. For safety reasons the newcomers to the sport are usually trained with short lines, limiting the power build up.\n\n=== Wind window ===\nThe ''wind window'' is the 180 degree arc of the sky downwind of the rider in which the kite can be flown - roughly one fourth of a sphere's surface, which radius is the length of the lines. It is the atmosphere volume in which the kiter can navigate the kite to harvest wind energy.\n\nIf the rider is facing downwind on a surface, like the ocean, the wind window covers roughly all the area the rider can see, from the rider's peripheral vision on one side, along the horizon to the other side, and then directly overhead back to the first side. If the rider somehow puts the kite out of the window \u2014 for example, by riding downwind too quickly and sending the kite directly overhead and behind, the kite will stall and often fall out of the sky.\n\nThe eventual inefficiency of the kite can obviate for it to reach the edge of the wind window. In such cases the magnitude of the wind window can be reduced to as little as a 120 degree arc, instead of the expected 180 degree.\n\nThe wind window is centered in the user location. Since the user is carried by the board, the wind window is affected by the movement of the board. Therefore, the wind window rotates as the board moves and generates apparent wind into itself. For instance, when the kiter navigates perpendicular to the true wind at a speed equal to the true wind's, the apparent wind felt on the board increases 42% compared to the true wind, but rotates 45\u00ba against the movement. With such rotation, even if the user keeps the kite at the very edge of the wind window for trying to keep it pulling in the travelling direction, the kite lines would be at an angle of 45\u00ba downwind of the board path, forcing the kiter to edge the board to oppose its tendency to slip downwind. Such board edging is an indispensable technique for navigating upwind, and can be made at a much more extreme angle to the kite lines, almost up to 90\u00ba.\n\nThe wind window rotation degrades the performance when riding fast in a path upwind. To minimize the wind window rotation and sail upwind as much as possible, the kiter should keep the slowest board speed without sinking the board by lack of hydrodynamic lift. High flotation boards like surfboards are preferable in such cases. Also, keeping the kite high in window, pulling up the user and the board, is quite efficient in coping both with the reduced hydrodynamic lift of the board and with the intended reduction of the board speed.\n\n=== Arbitrary atmosphere volume swept by the kite ===\nThe kite is a peculiar sail because it can be swept arbitrarily through the atmosphere, usually in specific patterns, so the user can harvest a significant amount of wind energy, much larger than with an equivalent sail fixed to a mast.\n[[File:SweptVolumes.png|thumb|The peculiar travel pattern of a kite, compared to a sail fixed to a mast as in windsurf]]\nThe kite and the lines are light, in the range between 2 and 4&nbsp;kg, but the aerodynamic drag can be significant since the kite can travel much faster than a windsurf sail. Therefore, part of the energy harvested is spent in the movement of the kite itself, but the remainder propels the user and the board.\n\nFor instance, a user riding towards the beach rises the kite to slow it down and convert traction into lift. Then, instead of speed he feels an increase of the force upwards, necessary to keep himself above the breaking waves.\n\nAnother specific advantage of the kite being able to be swept at will, is that the user can take advantage of the atmosphere boundary layer, either rising the kite to harvest the stronger winds blowing in the higher zone of the wind window, or during overpowering gusts he can drive the kite low, skimming the water near the edge of the wind window.\n\n=== Air temperature and humidity ===\nSeasoned kiteboarders frequently attribute to moist and hotter air a notable reduction in kite performance. In fact the [[coefficient of lift|lift force]] of a kite is proportional to the air density. Since both the temperature and the relative humidity are important detrimental factors in the air density, the kiters subjective valuation is correct.\n\nIn the range between 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C a kite loses approximately 0.4% of lift per degree Celsius. It means that a kiter practicing one given day in the Baltic, and then travelling to the Mediterranean, could experience 10% less pull using the very same kite at the very same wind speed.\n\n==Locations==\n\nAny location with consistent, steady side-onshore winds (10 to 35+ knots), large open bodies of water and good launch areas is suitable for kitesurfing. Most kitesurfing takes place along ocean shores, usually off beaches, but it can also be practiced on large lakes and inlets and occasionally on rivers. Since kiteboarding relies heavily on favorable, consistent wind conditions, certain locations tend to become popular and sought out by kiteboarders.\n\n; Boracay, Philippines\n: [[Boracay]] offers constant side onshore winds during the November to April main season in a turquoise shallow water lagoon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whenwherekite.com/Bulabog-beach-Boracay-Philippines.html|title=Wind statistics Bulabog beach}}</ref>\n\n; Cumbuco, Brazil\n: [[Cumbuco]] has strong side shore wind every day and wide sandy beach lagoon, the best season is from August to December, although January and February can be good as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go-kite.com/index.php/kite-brazil-cumbuco/kitesurf|title=Go Kite - Cumbuco, Brazil}}</ref>\n\n; Maui, Hawaii, US\n: in [[Maui]], the tropical Kite Beach has warm waters, steady winds and gentle waves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actionsportsmaui.com/kite-beach/|title=Action Sports Maui - Kite Beach}}</ref>\n\n; Nabq Bay, Egypt\n: [[Sharm El Sheikh]] is a beach town with shallow and flat waters, the wind blows at least 20 knots on most days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripping.com/explore/the-10-best-places-for-kiteboarding-in-the-world|title=Tripping - Nabq Bay, Egypt}}</ref>\n\n; Tarifa, Spain\n: [[Tarifa]] is a 10&nbsp;km long bay with a wide, sandy beach.

Moreover, the sport is convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than most surf and [[paddling]] boards.\n\nEquipment depreciation can cost between \u00a3270 per year for second hand gear, to \u00a31360 per year for brand new, not discounted kites and accessories.<!--ref name=iksurfmagDec2019/-->\nIn 2017, 150,000 kites were sold globally, compared to 400,000 surfboards sold each year.<ref name=iksurfmagDec2019>{{cite news |url= https://www.iksurfmag.com/issue78/?page=51 |title= How Much Does It Cost To Kitesurf? |magazine= iksurfmag |issue= 78 |author= Rou Chater |date= December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Power kites===\n[[File:Lei-bow-foil-kites.svg|thumb|upright|A '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|LEI]]'''(R), '''[[Bow kite|Bow]]'''(L) and '''[[Foil kite|Foil]]'''(T) [[Power kite]]s]]\nA [[power kite]] is available in two major forms: '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|leading edge inflatables]]''' and '''[[foil kite]]s'''.\n\n====Leading edge inflatables====\n[[File:PowerSail detail.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s''', known also as '''inflatables''', '''LEI kites''', are typically made from ripstop polyester with an inflatable plastic bladder that spans the front edge of the kite with separate smaller bladders that are perpendicular to the main bladder to form the chord or foil of the kite.<ref>[http://www.kiteboardingreview.com LEIs], Kiteboarding Review, 27 June 2011</ref> The inflated bladders give the kite its shape and also keep the kite floating once dropped in the water. LEIs are the most popular choice among kitesurfers thanks to their quicker and more direct response to the rider's inputs, easy relaunchability if crashed into the water and resilient nature. If an LEI kite hits the water or ground too hard or is subjected to substantial wave activity, bladders can burst or it can be torn apart.\n\nIn 2005, '''[[Bow kite]]s''' (also known as '''flat LEI kites''') were developed with features including a concave trailing edge, a shallower arc in planform, and a distinctive bridle with multiple attachment points along the leading edge. These features allow the kite's angle of attack to be altered more and thus adjust the amount of power being generated to a much greater degree than previous LEIs. These kites can be fully depowered, which is a significant safety feature. They can also cover a wider wind range than a comparable C-shaped kite. The ability to adjust the angle of attack also makes them easier to re-launch when lying front first on the water. Bow kites are popular with riders from beginner to advanced levels. Most [[LEI kite]] manufacturers developed a variation of the bow kite by 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kitesurfingmag.com/north-kiteboarding-signs-up-for-kite-patent/|title=North signs up for Best Kiteboarding patent - Kitesurfing Magazine|publisher=}}</ref>  Bow kites with a straight trailing edge are named \u00b4delta\u00b4 kites, given their triangular outline.\n\nEarly bow kites had some disadvantages compared to classic LEI kites:\n\n* They can become inverted and then not fly properly\n* They can be twitchy and not as stable\n* Heavier bar pressure makes them more tiring to fly\n* Lack of \"sled boosting\" effect when jumping<ref>[http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm Flat Inflatable Kites, Bow Kites, Flat LEIs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223649/http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm |date=1 June 2007 }}, Kitesufingschool.org, 27 June 2006</ref>\n\nIn 2006, second generation flat LEI kites were developed which combine near total depower and easy, safe relaunch with higher performance, no performance penalties and reduced bar pressure. Called '''Hybrid or SLE kites''' (Supported Leading Edge), these kites are suitable for both beginners and experts.\n\nIn 2008, Naish introduced another kite design, with their \"Sigma Series\" of kites. These kites are a SLE design and feature a unique \"bird in flight\" shape with the center of the kite swept back to put much of the sail area behind the tow point, which Naish claims has multiple benefits.\n\nIn 2009, the performance revolution shows no sign of slowing. Bridled designs feel more like C kites, and five-line hybrids have better depower capability than ever before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|title=2009 Kiteboarding Buyers'Guide|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404021939/http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|archivedate=4 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are more than thirty companies manufacturing [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s. The '''delta-kites''' are growing in popularity since 2008 with around 12 companies offering '''delta-kites''' since 2008/2009.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013 kite technology has continued to grow.  Kites have become lighter, more durable, much easier to launch and safer.  Manufacturers have continued to add new safety features.  This has resulted in a growing number of new riders, both younger and older.  In 2013, there are at least 20 \"major\" kite manufacturers, each with multiple models available.  Many of the manufacturers are on their third or fourth generation of kites.<ref>kiteboardingreview.com</ref>\n\n====Foil kites====\n[[File:LEIpowerKite.jpg|thumb|A [[Foil kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Foil kite]]s''' are also mostly fabric ([[ripstop nylon]]) with air pockets (air cells) to provide it with lift and a fixed bridle to maintain the kite's arc-shape, similar to a [[paraglider]]. Foil kites have the advantage of not needing to have bladders manually inflated, a process which, with an LEI, can take up to ten minutes.\nFoil kites are designed with either an open or closed cell configuration.\n\n; Open Cell\n: Open cell foils rely on a constant airflow against the inlet valves to stay inflated, but are generally impossible to relaunch if they hit the water, because they have no means of avoiding deflation, and quickly become soaked.\n\n; Closed Cell\n: Closed cell foils are almost identical to open cell foils except they are equipped with inlet valves to hold air in the chambers, thus keeping the kite inflated (or, at least, making the deflation extremely slow) even once in the water. Water relaunches with closed cell foil kites are simpler; a steady tug on the power lines typically allows them to take off again. An example for a closed cell kite is the [[Arc Kite]].\n\n====Kite sizes====\nKites come in sizes ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger. In general, the larger the surface area, the more power the kite has. Kite power is also directly linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds. The kite size\u2014wind speed curve tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots. Kites come in a variety of designs. Some kites are more rectangular in shape; others have more tapered ends; each design determines the kite's flying characteristics. 'Aspect ratio' is the ratio of span to length. High aspect ratios (ribbon-like kites) develop more power in lower wind speeds.\n\nSeasoned kiteboarders will likely have three or more kite sizes which are needed to accommodate various wind levels, although bow kites may change this, as they present an enormous wind range; some advanced kiters use only one bow kite. Smaller kites are used by light riders, or in strong wind conditions; larger kites are used by heavier riders or in light wind conditions. Larger and smaller kiteboards have the same effect: with more available power a given rider can ride a smaller board. In general, however, most kiteboarders only need one board and one to three kites (7-12 sq m in size).\n\n===Other equipment===\n[[File:Happy-students-3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|A kitesurfer uses a bar with lines to control the kite, attached to a [[Windsurfing harness|harness]], and can wear a [[wetsuit]]]]\n\n* '''Flying lines''' are made of a strong material such as [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]], to handle the dynamic load in unpredictable wind while maintaining a small cross-sectional profile to minimize drag. They come in lengths generally between seven and thirty-three meters. Experimentation with line lengths is common in kiteboarding. The lines attach the rider's control bar to the kite using attachment cords on the kite edges or its bridle. Most power kites use a [[Kite control systems#5-Line Bars|3, 4 or 5-line]] configuration. Most control bars have 4 lines, 2 for most of the propulsive power and 2 for steering and for control of the angle of attack. The 5th line is used to aid in re-launching or to further adjustment of the kite's angle of attack, mostly in C-kites.\n* The '''control bar''' is a solid metal or composite bar which attaches to the kite via the lines. The rider holds on to this bar and controls the kite by pulling at its ends, causing the kite to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise like a bicycle. Typically a ''chicken loop'' from the control bar is attached to a latch or hook on a spreader bar on the rider's harness. Most bars also provide a quick-release safety-system and a control strap to adjust the kite's minimum [[angle of attack]]. Kite control bars, while lightweight and strong, are usually heavier than water; \"bar floats\" made of foam may be fixed to the lines right above the harness to keep the bar from sinking if lost in the water. Control bars can be specific to a particular kite type and size and not suitable for use with different [[kite types]].\n* A '''kite harness''' comes in seat (with leg loops), waist, or vest types. The harness together with a spreader bar attaches the rider to the control bar. The harness reduces the strain of the kite's pull from the rider's arms, spreading it across part of the rider's body. This allows the rider to perform jumps and other tricks while remaining attached to the kite via the control bar. Waist harnesses are the most popular harnesses among advanced riders, although seat harnesses make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider, and vest harnesses provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite harnesses resemble windsurfing harnesses, but with different construction; a windsurfing harness is likely to fail when used for kiteboarding.\n[[File:Kite-board.jpg|thumb|right|Twin tip kiteboard]]\n* '''Kiteboard''', a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now several types of kiteboards: directional surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids which can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without foot straps much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and are by far the most popular. The boards generally come with sandal-type footstraps that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. Kiteboards come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider's skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.\n[[File:DrySuits.jpg|thumb|right|Kitesurfers wearing [[dry suit]]s on [[Long Island]] in winter when the air and water temperatures are near 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F)]]\n* A '''wetsuit''' is often worn by kitesurfers, except in warmer conditions with light winds. When kitesurfing in strong winds, body heat loss is reduced by wearing a [[wetsuit]]. A \"shortie\" is worn to protect the torso only, and a full suit is used for protection against cool conditions, from marine life such as [[jellyfish]], and also from abrasions if the rider is dragged by the kite. Neoprene boots are required if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks. [[Dry suit]]s are also used to kitesurf in cold conditions in winter.\n* A '''safety hook knife''' is considered required equipment. The corrosion resistant [[stainless steel]] blade is partially protected by a curved plastic hook. It can be used to cut entangled or snagged [[kite line]]s, or to release the kite if the safety release system fails. Some kitesurfing harnesses are equipped with a small pocket for the knife.\n* A '''helmet''' is often worn by kitesurfers to protect the head from [[blunt trauma]]. [[Helmet]]s prevent head [[lacerations]], and can also reduce the severity of impact injuries to the head, as well as compression injuries to the neck and spine.\n* A '''personal flotation device''' or [[Personal flotation device|PFD]] may be required if the kitesurfer is using a boat or [[personal water craft]] for support. It is also recommended for kitesurfing in deep water in case the kitesurfer becomes disabled and must wait for rescue.\n* An '''impact vest''' provides some protection against impacts to the torso area. They also provide some flotation and preclude the harness to climb the chest and hurt the ribs, during high power maneuvers.\n* A '''[[Surfboard leash|board leash]]''' that attaches the board to the kitesurfer's leg or harness is used by some riders. However, many kitesurfing schools discourage the use of board leashes due to the risk of recoil, where the leash can yank the board to impact the rider, which can result in serious injury or even death. Generally, kitesurfers that use a board leash will also wear a helmet to help protect against this.\n* '''Signaling devices''' are useful if the kitesurfer needs to be rescued. This may be as simple as a whistle attached to the knife, or [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] tape applied to the helmet. Some kitesurfers carry a [[mobile phone]] or [[two-way radio]] in a waterproof pouch to use in an emergency. A small [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]] (EPIRB) can be carried and activated to send out a distress signal.\n* A '''buddy''' is important to help with launching and retrieving the kite, and to assist in an emergency.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/faq FAQ], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n* A '''[[GPS]]''' can be used to measure distance travelled, tracks and speed during a session.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/gear/gps-for-kitesurfing GPS for kitesurfing], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n\n== Physical practice ==\n\nKiteboarding is seen as a mid to high intensity exercise, but freeriding can be a low intensity practice like walking, and is usually done in long sessions of up to 2\u20133 hours. It is amenable to almost all ages, at least from teenagers up to 70 years old or more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mpora.com/windsurfing-kitesurfing/77-year-old-surf-1|title=Meet David: The 77 Year Old Kite Surfer Showing The Rest Of Us How It's Done - Mpora|work=Mpora|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref> It can be seen as a supplement or a substitute for other fitness practices.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[Power kite]]s are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in [[wakeboarding]] and to lift their users to [[Diving (sport)|diving]] heights. An uncontrolled kite can be dangerous, especially in difficult environments. A rider can lose control from falling or from sudden wind gusts, which can occur in the presence of strong winds from squalls or storms (\"collard\").\n\nIt is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height (\"kitemare\", a [[portmanteau]] of kite and nightmare). Adequate quality professional kiteboarding [[training]], careful development of [[experience]] and consistent use of good judgement and [[safety gear]] should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding.\n\n=== Weather ===\n\n[[Weather forecasting]] and awareness is the principal factor to safe kiteboarding. Lack of weather awareness and understanding the figures is frequent, but avoiding weather problems is possible.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=9528|title= Kiteboarding weather planning and monitoring|author= Rick Iossi|publisher= Florida KiteSurfing Association Forum}}</ref> Choice of inappropriate locations for kiteboarding where the wind passes over land creating wind shadow, rotor with pronounced gusts and lulls has also factored in many accidents.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=7879|title= Shadow Blasted ...

Jumping and being airborne at inappropriate places such as shallow water or near fixed or floating objects can be hazardous. [[Collision]]s with wind surfers, other kite boarders or water craft are hazards, particularly at busy locations.\n\nSolo kiteboarding has been a frequent contributing cause to accidents; kiteboarders should try to kite with friends and keep an eye on one another. A kitesurfer can get farther from [[shore]] than an easy [[Human swimming|swim]], which is the primary reason kitesurfing in directly offshore winds is discouraged. Marine hazards include [[sharks]], [[jellyfish]], [[sea otters]], [[dolphins]], and even [[crocodile]]s, depending on the location. [[Drowning]] has been a factor in severe accidents as well and may have been avoided in some cases through the use of an appropriate flotation aid or impact vest and development of acceptable swimming skills.\n\n=== Safety equipment ===\n\nSome kite designs from late 2005 and onwards have included immediate and almost full depower integrated with the control bar and improved quick release mechanisms, both of which are making the sport much safer. However, lack of sufficient practice of emergency depowering the kite and going out in excessively strong or unstable weather can reduce the benefit of high depower kites.<br />Another important part of the safety equipment is the impact vest, which doubles as an improved floatation device. It reduces the severity of eventual impacts, but also improves the user endurance in the long procedures of self-rescue in deep waters, which almost every freeriding kiter experiences sooner or later. It is also important and overlooked as a complement to the harness, precluding it to climb along the chest during powerful kite loops, which otherwise would hurt the ribs.<br />The other important pieces of a reasonable safety kit are the safety hook knife to cut tangled lines, the helmet in a high visibility colour, a wet suit of reasonable thickness, depending on the water temperature, and possibly neoprene boots if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks.\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n[[Accidents]] can generate serious injuries or even be deadly. 105 accidents were reported in the Kiteboarding Safety Information Database between 2000 and September 2003, with 14 [[Death|fatalities]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kitesurfingschool.org/safety.htm |title= Kitesurfing Safety |date= 7 May 2007 |publisher= KitesurfingSchool }}</ref> In South Africa between October 2003 and April 2004, 83% of [[search & rescue]] missions involving kitesurf were in offshore winds with the kite still attached to the harness, uncontrolled in strong winds or impossible to relaunch in weak winds.

Kiteboarding lends itself to a rather frequent practice, much like a gym program, arguably more frequent than other risky sports like scuba diving. Therefore, further data is required to properly evaluate the risk associated with kiteboarding.\n\n==== Reports of casualties ====\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/kitesurfer-70-killed-at-remote-beach-20120206-1r0oi.html |title= Kitesurfer, 70, killed at remote beach |date= 6 February 2012 |publisher= [[WA Today]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/kite-surfer-killedat-redcliffe-20120306-1ui3g.html#ixzz1uiyfm54z |title= Kite surfer killed at Redcliffe |date= 6 March 2012 |publisher= [[Brisbane Times]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2012/03/dante_torres_malibu_kite_surfer_dies_kelp.php |title= Dante Torres, Malibu Kite Surfer Dies in Tragic Kelp Accident |publisher= [[LA Weekly]] Blogs |date= 13 March 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Phuket-beach-toll-rises-kitesurfing-American-dies |title= Phuket beach toll rises as kitesurfing American dies |publisher= [[Phuket Gazette]] |date= 31 May 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |title= Kiteboarder killed at Cheney Lake identified |date= 6 August 2012 |publisher= [[KWCH-TV]] |access-date= 14 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120810040308/http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |archive-date= 10 August 2012 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-33415791 |title= Sean Sands: Hunstanton kite surfing death 'accidental' |date= 6 July 2015 |publisher= [[BBC]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/14294364.Southend_kitesurfer_killed_in_accident/ |title= Mark Paxton: Southend kitesurfer has died in a freak accident at Ray Creek, Point Clear, Clacton |date= 21 February 2016|publisher= [[Clacton Gazette]]}}\n\n===Kitesurfing safety rules===\nWhile some countries have specific regulations on flying kites that may also apply to kitesurfing,<ref>[http://www.kiteman.co.uk/Kite%20Safty.html \"Kite Safety\"] www.kiteman.co.uk</ref> most don't. However a kitesurfer should comply to the sailing rules regulating water crafts in many countries, like the U.S. Coast Guard regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=rightOfWay|title=Right Of Way|website=www.navcen.uscg.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> Developed from such generic rules a set of kitesurf specific rules or recommendations has been taking form since the beginning of the sport.\n\n{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}\nThe first such rule is '''the prudential rule''': with so many people just discovering water sports, a kiter shouldn't assume others adequate knowledge, training or even proper attitude, and be prepared to observe self-preserving distances and always let the others perceive clearly its intentions and its intended path.\n\n'''Waterstarters have priority''': the rider going out from the beach has always priority over the riders coming in.\n\n'''Kite High Rule''' - A kiter who is upwind (closest to the wind) must keep their kite high to avoid their lines crossing those of downwind kiters. Similarly, the downwind kiter must keep their kite low to avoid their lines crossing upwind kites. This applies regardless of whether kiters are on the same, or opposing courses.\n\n'''Clearance Rule''' - A kiter while jumping must have a clear safety zone of at least 50m downwind because they will move downwind during the jump. A rider must also have a clear safety zone of 30m upwind to jump as his lines could touch the kite or the lines of another rider kiteboarding close by (see Kite High rule). It's important to also consider potential hazards downwind and crosswind of the rider such as people, buildings, trees and other fixed obstacles. Because of the clearance rule a jumper never has the right of way.\n\nKiters are also considered as sailing vessels \u2013 so all the standard sailing rules apply such as:\n\n'''Starboard Rule''' When kiters approach from opposite directions the kiter who has the wind on the starboard (right side, right leg/arm leads in direction of travel) has right of way. The kiter who has the wind on the port side (left side, left leg/arm are leads in direction of travel) shall keep out of the way of the other. In simple terms, this means \"keep right\" with the kiter coming in the opposite direction passing on the left.\n\nIn sailing terms, a sailor or kiter with right of way is entitled to \"insist\" on exercising that right (warning opposing kiters) by shouting \"starboard\" clearly and in good time.\n\nMany of the sailing rules of right of way are different expressions that the most maneuverable craft should give way to the less maneuverable one. Therefore, kiters should give way to fishing vessels, but not to a jet ski. Other '''boating rules''' such as no-go zones, distance from shore and swimmers also apply.<ref>[http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm Are you kiting Safely?? Are you aware of the Rules??] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326020626/http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm |date=26 March 2009 }}, kbv.org.au</ref> Also '''surfing rules''' do apply, so for instance, the rider to catch a wave closer to the crest has the right of way even if not on a starboard tack, freeriders included.\n\n== Terminology and jargon ==\n* '''Air time''': the amount of time spent in the air while jumping. This can be remarkably long; the record is [[Jesse Richman|Jesse Richman's]] 22 second long jump. Five to ten seconds is not unusual.\n* '''Apparent wind''': the kite's speed relative to the surrounding air. When kitesurfing in a straight line, the kite's apparent wind is a combination of the wind speed and the speed of the kite over the surface, but since the kite is highly steerable the apparent wind can vary widely depending on how the kite is being flown. Most ways of increasing power from the kite involve giving it a higher apparent wind somehow, i.e. diving the kite, riding faster, or riding at a greater angle into the wind. Any of these raises the kite's apparent wind speed.\n* '''Back stall''': A condition in which the kite ceases to move forward through the air and becomes difficult to control, often resulting in the kite flying backwards and crashing.  Back stall is often caused by lack of wind or by flying the kite with too great of an angle of attack. \n* '''Big air''': performing a high jump utilizing the lift of the kite. The jump is often assisted in its initial stage by the rider being catapulted off the lip of a wave.\n* '''Body dragging''': being pulled through the water without standing on a board. This is an early step in the learning process, and is essential before trying the board after flying a trainer kite.\n* '''Boost''': to suddenly become airborne\n* '''Brain fart''': to forget what trick you intended to perform mid air and end up crashing or landing on the water.\n* '''Charlie browner''': same as kiteboarder or kitesurfer.\n* '''Chicken loop''': a hard rubber loop attached to the middle line which has been fed through the control bar. It is used to attach the control bar to the harness so the kitesurfer can produce tension in the lines using their entire bodyweight instead of using purely arm strength.\n* '''Chicken bone/chicken finger/donkey dick / Donkey tail''': a hard rubber \"tongue\" attached to the chicken loop which the rider feeds through the spreader bar hook to prevent the rider from becoming \"unhooked\".\n* '''De-power''': to reduce the kite's power (pull), generally by adjusting the angle of attack of the kite. Most kites and control bars now allow a rider to rig a kite for a number of different power levels before launching, in addition to powering the kite up and down \"on the fly\" by moving the bar up and down. Depowerability makes a kite safer and easier to handle. Some new kite models, especially \"bow\" kites, can be de-powered to practically zero power, giving them an enormous wind range.\n* '''DP''': dawn patrol; an early morning session.\n* '''Downwind''': the direction the wind is blowing towards; to leeward. When a rider is facing '''downwind''' the wind is at their back.\n* '''Downwinder''': a kitesurfing \"trip\" (could actually be as short as a few minutes) where the rider starts at one point and ends up at another point downwind of their original position.\n* '''Edge''': tilting the board with its edge into the water. Used to control the direction of travel. Learning to edge properly is critical for learning to tack upwind. Edging is one of the fundamental skills of kitesurfing and is one of the ways kitesurfing is different from windsurfing or wakeboarding. While windsurf boards have daggerboards and/or skegs to steer the board upwind while lift and planing is provided by the board itself, generally kiteboards actually combine both functions and the bottom of the board lifts the rider and steers simultaneously. Kiteboard fins are generally much smaller and are for keeping the board in the water (see \"'''tea-bagging'''\"), but are not essential. Because kite boards have a small rocker, a deep edge can allow the board to act as a large low drag fin. Edging in wakeboarding is used for steering the board; whereas in kite boarding not only does edging steer the kite board, it is essential for kite control and controlling board speed. Riding downwind towards the kite subtracts massively from the kite's power and helps control board speed as well.\n* '''Facial''': total loss of flying kite control while on the beach, resulting in the harnessed rider being dragged face first downwind across rocks and sand.\n* '''Freeride''': kiteboarding style. Plain kiteboarding that does not involve tricks or jumping. The main goal is keeping a good edge and ability to traverse upwind. This would normally require a board with little rocker.\n* '''Freestyle''': kiteboarding style. Freestyle involves tricks (or combinations of tricks) where the rider is jumping off the water and experiencing enhanced elevation using lift generated from the kite. Freestyle is, weather-wise, a multi-condition concept and is to some degree equipment-specific. \"Big air\" is commonly associated with freestyle.\n* '''Goofy''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the right foot leading.\n* '''Guinea pig''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Wind-dummy'''.\n* '''Heel side''': the side of a board on the edge where a rider's heels are (opposite of toe side). \"Riding heel side\" is riding with heels down.\n* '''Hindenburg''': (a reference to the Hindenburg Airship disaster of 1937) a kite falling out of the air due to the loss of tension in the control lines, and therefore the loss of kite control. Hindenburging can be caused either by lack of wind or by the kite advancing to a position upwind of the kitesurfer in the wind window, also called \"overflying the kite\".\n* '''Handlepass''': while unhooked, passing the control bar behind a riders back while in the air.\n* '''Hot launch''': recovering and launching the kite from a position deep inside the wind window so the kite is immediately under maximum power (potentially dangerous). \n* '''Kiter''': the person driving the kite. \n* '''Kiteloop''': is a powered group of tricks where a rider loops the kite through the power zone.\n* '''Kitemare''': a kiteboardsurfing accident or dangerous mishap. Kitemares can be deadly.\n* '''Launch''': getting the kite in the air. The kite may be launched assisted or unassisted. An assisted launch is generally safer than an unassisted launch.\n* '''Lofted''': to get lifted vertically into the air by the kite due to a strong gust of wind. Being lofted has resulted in fatalities when kiters on or near land were dragged into obstacles. The danger can be avoided by minimizing time on land with the kite flying directly overhead, and by not kiting in overpowered situations.\n* '''Luff''' : when the air flow stalls around the kite. It may then stall and fall out of the sky. Like sails, a luffing kite has rippling and flapping panels. When launching the kite, if the kite is luffing, the rider should move farther upwind, or the person holding the kite should move downwind.\n* '''Mobe''': this term has two meanings: either a class of wakestyle tricks involving an invert with a 360-degree spin or a specific trick involving a back roll with a frontside 360 handlepass (while keeping the kite below 45 degrees).  The former meaning stems from the latter, which was the first type of mobe to ever be landed. Other types of mobes include: mobe 540, mobe 720, slim chance, KGB, crow mobe, moby dick, Pete Rose, blind pete, crow mobe 540, etc.\n* '''Nuking''': wind blowing at great speeds (30-40 knots). These extreme conditions are dangerous for most riders.\n* '''Offshore''': wind blowing at the water from the shore. Never ride in offshore winds without some means of recovery, i.e. a chase boat. This is somewhat less important in smaller bodies of water, of course.\n* '''Onshore''': wind blowing perpendicular to and directly at the shore from the water. A challenging condition for beginners, especially if waves are present.\n* '''Dookie dive''': loss of power during air time resulting in a crash into the water.\n* '''O-Shit loop''': two loops on either ends of the bar that are attached to the kite lines and run through rings attached to the bar. A standard leash attachment point.\n* '''Overhead waves''': waves {{convert|2|m|ft||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or larger from trough to crest;\n* '''Overpowered''': the condition of having too much power from the kite. Can be a result of an increase in wind, incorrect kite choice (too large for the conditions), incorrect adjustment, simply going too fast, etc. Experienced riders who are overpowered can switch to a smaller board to compensate, to a degree, although it's common to have just one board.\n* '''Pop''': height gained above the water using only the board and tension in the lines to get lift, with the kite usually positioned at 45 degrees. Lower kite angles are possible for more experienced riders. Used as a basis for many tricks and regarded as an essential skill for progressing.\n* '''[[Port]]''' the left side of a vehicle, as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Power up''': when the kite's power increases (suddenly), because of wind gusts or the kite's movement.\n* '''Power zone''': is the area in the sky where the kite generates the most lift (pull), this is generally between 0 and 60 degrees arc from the center of the downwind direction.\n* '''Raley''': a trick where the rider unhooks and then pops in order to fully extend his body into a \"superman\" position, before landing. This is a power move that's often performed relatively low to the water and forms the basis of more advanced tricks.\n* '''Regular''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the left foot leading.\n* '''Re-launch''': a general term for getting the kite back up in the air after crashing it (on land or water). A relaunch is unassisted and requires the rider to follow a kite-specific procedure (check the manual). As years of development have gone by, the more recent kites are easier to relaunch.\n* '''Rider''': kiteboarder.\n* '''S-Bend''': when the rider unhooks and performs a raley followed by a front roll. \n* '''Self rescue''': a maneuver by which a rider with a downed kite manipulates the kite in the water to assist them in swimming back to shore.  The rider generally wraps up their lines until they reach their kite, then positions their kite so that it is on its back as it would be carried on land but with the wing-tip closer to shore catching the wind.  This wing tip acts as a sail and helps pull the rider to shore.  This is considered an important manoeuvre to learn.\n* '''Send it''': to move the kite aggressively up through the power zone.\n* '''Schlogging''': this is riding extremely underpowered. A rider has no power to plane and definitely not enough to jump. A rider and their board bounce from planing on the surface to being dragged in the water.\n* '''Shit hot''': the art of stylish smooth moves.\n* '''SLE''': Supported Leading Edge. A C shaped kite with an inflatable leading edge, currently the most advanced kite design available allowing massive de-power.\n* '''Side offshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle away from the shore.\n* '''Side onshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle towards the shore.\n* '''side shore''': winds blowing parallel to the shore. Usually the most desirable direction for kitesurfing.\n* '''Spreader bar''': a stainless steel bar that attaches to the rider's harness. It has a hook that holds the \"chicken loop\" when riding hooked in.\n* '''[[Starboard]]''' the right side of a vehicle as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Stomp''': to successfully perform a trick.\n* '''Surfstyle:''' Wave riding using surfboards. Ideal conditions are cross shore to cross offshore with the wind blowing in the same direction that the wave is breaking. Boards can be ridden with or without foot straps.\n* '''Tack''': the direction which is being sailed, normally either starboard tack or port tack. In a starboard tack the wind is coming in from the rider's starboard (right-hand) side, similar to sailing a boat. In normal riding, the kitesurfer takes a heading which is as close to into the wind as possible, and in any event leads at some angle slightly upwind, sometimes as much as 45 degrees; jumping or wave riding usually results in traveling downwind, so the net result is to maintain relative position. Alternatively, see \"'''downwinder'''\".\n* '''Tea-bagging''': popping out of and falling back into the water intermittently due to light or gusty wind, poor flying skills, twisted lines etc.\n* '''Toe side''': the side of a board on the edge where a riders toes are (opposite of heel side). \"Riding toe side\" is riding with toes down.\n* '''Underpowered''': the condition of having insufficient power from the kite. Can be a result of insufficient wind, choosing a kite that is too small for the wind, rigging incorrectly, board too small, water current in the same direction as the wind, not riding fast enough, etc. A rider who is continuously diving the kite and sending it back up in a sine-wave pattern is usually underpowered.\n* '''Unhooked''' is when a kitesurfer is riding while the chicken loop is not attached to the rider's harness.\n* '''Upwind''': the direction from which the wind is blowing; windward; into the wind.\n* '''VaS conditions''': [[Victory at Sea]]; rough sea conditions characterized by overhead wind waves causing severe shore break.\n* '''Wakestyle''': A style of kiteboarding in which the rider usually uses wakeboarding (or kiteboarding) \"boots\" for their kiteboard (as opposed to straps and pads), ensuring their feet remain firmly attached at all times (hense the term \"Wakestyle\").  This style is also associated with performing powered tricks with the kite as low to the water as possible (something generally perceived by kiteboarders to be more difficult and stylish).\n* '''Walk of shame''' is the act of beach walking back upwind to the location where the kite was originally launched. It could mean that the kiter wasn't able to sail upwind.\n* '''Wind-dummy''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Guinea pig'''.\n* '''Zenith''' the location in the wind window directly over the kiter's head. This is the neutral position where kitesurfers can place the kite to stop moving or prior to movement. This places the kite in a more vulnerable to \"Hindenburgs\" position than any other.\n\n== Market data ==\n{{As of|2012|alt=In 2012}}, the number of kitesurfers was estimated by the [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] and [[International Kiteboarding Association|IKA]] at 1.5 million persons worldwide<ref name=\":3\" /> (pending review). The global market for kite gear sales is worth US$250 million.<ref name=\":4\" /> The markets related to kiteboarding keep developing at a very interesting pace, as seen in these statistics from 2012:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiteforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=2387270|title=Kite sales statistics - 2014 - Kiteforum.com|website=www.kiteforum.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>\n\n* 60,000 new kiters annually \n* 180,000 kites sold annually \n* 75,000 boards sold annually \n* 14 board builders \n* 19 kite builders\n\nEvolution of kite sales, worldwide:\n\n* 1999:  29,000\n* 2006: 114,465\n* 2008: 140,000\n* 2012: 180,000\n\nKeep in mind that a kiteboarding quiver for a single user could typically include 2-4 kites and 2-3 boards. With the innovation associated with foil boards and foil kites these numbers will increase. With the exception of foil kites, these equipment pieces are quite rugged and would last from 3 up to 10 years of active use, and be repaired and resold several times. This aftermarket further improves the market development, removing cost barriers for newbies which improves the popularity of the sport, and eventually could bring up new products and services based on a much larger market scale. In locations like Portugal in 2018, a newcomer to kiteboarding typically buys a proper hands-on tutorial and then buys a basic set of used equipment for an overall total below \u20ac1000.\n\nThe sport is utterly convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than surf and paddling boards. Compared to other sailing sports, kiteboarding is among the less expensive and more convenient. Moreover, nearby most metropolitan areas, it can be practised almost all year long, since it just requires some wind and a reasonably flat surface, like an estuary, a lake, a sandy strip, or a snow flat.\n\nDespite the image of a youth radical sport, many newcomers are middle age, older than the typical wakeboard or snowboard practitioners. Such trends are quite conspicuous, not so much in the trendy summer holiday locations, but in the low season in metropolitan areas around the globe, where kiteboarding is becoming a regular practice for people of middle income, living in apartments not so close to the waterfront, for a short evasion and substituting for the gym.\n\n==Compared to windsurfing==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!   !!

Upwind riders adopt a similar stance to kite fliers onshore, who slide their feet forward in the beach sand to brake the kite. The kite board's center line is way off the track line, dramatically reducing speed.|| About 45\u00b0 from wind direction depending on the skills of the rider. The sail board's center line runs virtually parallel to the track line, as most lateral forces are encountered by the tail fin and little edging is required. Because of this, upwind courses are fairly fast.  Fastest speeds are achieved at [[Points of sail|broad reach]].\n|-\n| '''Theory''' || The faster the kite moves the more force it develops. Standing still and actively steering the kite up and down (pumping) one can almost immediately create a lot of force. It is almost always possible to have the kite travel faster (much) than the board. The dynamic nature of the kiter/kite system is why kites have so much range (wind range). || The sail and board move at the same speed. With pumping one can sometimes push oneself onto a plane or maintain planing in marginal conditions. But sail and board travel at basically the same speed. This is the main reason why windsurfing requires a lot of equipment. The equipment must match the wind conditions much closer than kiting.\n|-\n| '''Physical Strain on Rider''' || The traction force of the kite is solely transferred to the rider via the harness loop attached to the harness hook when hooked in. When \"hooked in\" the rider uses muscle strength (thumb and index finger suffice) to steer the kite and control the kite power by pushing the bar in and out (depending on setup one might actually notice a slight effort). When \"unhooked\" the rider steers the kite using their arms with no depower, which can be strenuous. Generally, kitesurfing is more of a light cardio training. || Windsurfing without a harness requires a lot of physical effort, especially in strong wind. With a harness, recovering from a fall or when maneuvering (jibing, tacking, ...) the rider needs to detach the harness completely from the sail, which means that both traction and steering forces are to be countered solely by the rider's muscle. For jibing maneuvers, muscle effort diminishes as the rider becomes more skilled in maintaining board speed in the jibe. In race conditions it can get quite physical as well, planing \"over the top\" of wave sets keeping the board absolutely level and the sail well powered. In the strongest winds it can get physical as well due to the sheer force of the wind, but that is attributed to poor choice of equipment or lack of skill.\n|-\n| '''Fall Recovery''' || The kite is fairly easy to keep flying during a fall, with 'Hindenburgs' being rather exceptional. The rider can be pulled out of the water by the force of the moving kite. The kite power can be regulated by changing the [[angle of attack]] of the kite. In light winds the kite may fall into the water and stay there. || In light winds (non planing conditions), the rider needs to get on the board and pull the sail out of the water. However, in stronger winds (planing conditions (depending of equipment/weight/experience approx. from 9 knots on)), water starting is a better option.  This means positioning the board-sail combination through aligning the sail into the right wind angle, allowing the wind to pull the body out of the water onto the board using the sail, and then easily hooking back in and stepping into foot straps. This maneuver actually requires slightly less than planing conditions. \n|-\n| '''[[Glossary of nautical terms|Tacking and Jibing]]''' || Twin tip kiteboards (the majority of kiteboards) are designed to be bidirectional. If the rider wants to start the next tack only the kite's sailing direction must be reversed. The \"stern\" of the board now becomes the \"bow\", so the feet can be kept in the footstraps. Since the windward edge of the board doesn't change sides, the terms \"jibing\" or \"tacking\" are somewhat of a misnomer. Falling into the water is not a major problem, as even beginning riders can quickly and fairly effortlessly execute a water start using the kite to pull them out of the water. Nower days many kiters use directionals as well (all wave, racing as well as foils). These need to be jibed or tacked. This actually requires practice. Full planing race jibes are almost as difficult as in windsurfing. || The rider has the choice between tacking or jibing. In both cases the windward edge changes sides, so the rider will need to change footstraps. At high winds the only option to change tacks while maintaining speed is to carve jibe, which is a maneuver that requires many practise hours for it to be performed with a reasonably low risk of falling. . \n|-\n| '''Jumping''' || Kitesurfers can use their kite to \"jump\" (actually using it as a [[Paragliding|paraglider]]), without the need for a launch wave. Jumping is relatively easy but can be hazardous. Being launched (jumping) can also happen unintended, even to beginners, especially in shifting winds or fast kite movements, where the rider can get pulled into the air as the kite reverses direction. || The rider needs considerable forward speed and ideally a \"ramp wave\" to get airborne. When the wave is not large enough, the riders must initiate the jump by kicking down the tail of the board. Unintended jumps rarely occur (unless bouncing over waves, ...), as jumping requires active rider input. Jumping requires skill and can generally only be executed by advanced riders.\n|-\n| '''Aerobatics''' || Most aerobatics and tricks (tail grab, [[barrel roll]] etc.) can be executed without the airfoil's position in the air having to change. Therefore, executing \"aerobatics\" is only marginally different from executing them on shore suspended by the harness from some fixed point. Beginners with a lot of caution may start attempting some basic tricks after the first few weeks or even days. This part of kiting can actually be physical. || With most aerobatics the airfoil's position in the air changes dramatically. Each figure has its own ideal airfoil movement. With some aerobatics like the barrel roll, the rider needs to jump sufficiently high to allow the full length of the mast to rotate forward underneath. Often the risks to the rider of having fast moving and relatively heavy (board + mast + sail) gear so close by are substantial. As aerobatics are considerably more complicated than jumping, they are the done by the most experienced of riders, commanding huge respect within the sail boarding community.\n|-\n| '''Clearance''' || Clearance of at least 50 meters upwind (from any object) and 30 meters downwind (from another kitesurfer) is required. The risk of being blown into an airborne situation by a strong wind gust is real, effectively turning the kite boarder into an uncontrolled [[Paragliding|para-glider]] in risk of hitting any object downwind. || Since there are no kite lines, no upwind or downwind clearance is required from any object other than a kite surfer or fishing lines, which means that windsurfers do not need to worry about 'rotor' or strong wind gusts. Also, they can emergency stop almost immediately. Experienced riders will do this by 'crashing' while beginning riders (who typically do not wear a harness) can depower the sail instantly by releasing the back hand or letting the mast fall on water. The risk of hitting hard objects or other water-goers is therefore minimal.\n|-\n| '''Learning Curve''' || Kiteboarding has a different learning curve from windsurfing.  At the beginning the handling the kite can be largely taught on shore, as kite boarding evolved from beach [[Kite|kiting]]. However once on the water you need to be safely guided by an instructor until you learn the basics.  After you have the basics and are independent you will progress much faster than in windsurfing.\nRecovery from falling is relatively easy (the kites, especially the newest models, stay normally aloft to pull the rider out of the water, with little effort) as is changing tacks, even in strong wind. Staying upwind is regarded as an advanced technique. Light wind kiting (<9 knots) is also an advanced technique: traveling much faster than the wind any mistake can lead to loss of apparent wind -> kite falls into the drink and stays there. \n|| The learning curve for windsurfing is gradual, and rewarding as the rider progresses through each stage of learning, and one can engage in solo practice. Initially handling of the airfoil (sail) can be learned on the water or on land. Once on the water it takes much of practice to improve.\n\nRecovery from falling takes more effort than kiting. The rider needs to either up haul the sail standing on the board or water start, which both take some balance. Up hauling large sails can be a bit of work. Falling into the water is part of the overall experience.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Safety''' || In case of material failure or accidents, normal kitesurfing equipment offers limited rescue possibilities. Kitesurfers can perform a self rescue and use their kite to sail back to shore. The last option for the rider is to abandon the kite and kiteboard and swim to shore. || Any sail board will allow the rider to keep the body sufficiently out of the water to postpone or avoid [[hypothermia]]. Smaller boards may require that the mast be detached, to avoid sinking. Thus, as a rule, a rider should never abandon the board. Windsurfing equipment is inherently safe in high winds against tea bagging or collisions due to loss of control: In case of too strong wind, the rider can depower the sail instantly by letting go with the back hand or letting the sail drop on water. Doing so (or falling) means that the board stops almost immediately as the sail will act as a floating anchor in water.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Transport''' || A kite and kiteboard will fit in most vehicles. An average rider may need two to three kites and one board to ride in a wide range of wind strength. || The sail board and sail mast (even telescopic) do not fit in most vehicles, and need to be transported on a roof rack or trailer. If they do, they will often exclude passengers from the vehicle. Several different sails and boards (and often masts and booms) are necessary to cover the full range of rideable conditions.\n|}\n\n== World Champions ==\n[[File:Aaron Hadlow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aaron Hadlow]] dominated Freestyle from 2004 to 2008]] \n[[File:Gisela Pulido Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|{{ill|Gisela Pulido|es|vertical-align=sup}} is ten times Freestyle Champion]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Freestyle PKRA/VKWC/WKL/GKA Sanctioned Tours\n!

A kiteboarder harnesses the [[wind power|power of the wind]] with a large controllable [[power kite]] to be propelled across the water, land, or snow.\n\nCompared to the other sailing sports, kiteboarding is both among the less expensive (including equipment) and the more convenient. It is also unique in that it harvests the wind energy from a much larger atmosphere volume, comparing to sail size.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nIn the 1800s, George Pocock used [[kite]]s of increased size to propel carts on land and ships on the water, using a four-line control system\u2014the same system in common use today. Both carts and boats were able to turn and sail upwind.

In 1978, Ian Day's \"FlexiFoil\" kite-powered Tornado [[catamaran]] exceeded 40&nbsp;km/h.\n\nIn October 1977 Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise (Netherlands) received the first patent<ref>[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=NL&NR=7603691&KC=&FT=E], Patent NL7603691  (A) \u2015 11 October 1977</ref> for KiteSurfing. The patent covers, specifically, a water sport using a floating board of a surf board type where a pilot standing up on it is pulled by a wind catching device of a parachute type tied to his harness on a trapeze type belt. Although this patent did not result in any commercial interest, Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise could be considered as the originator of KiteSurfing.\n\nOn 28 August 1982 Greg Locke and Simon Carter, from [[Brighton]] UK, set the world record for kite traction at sea, travelling nearly 26 miles under wind power alone along the English channel.<ref>[http://www.kitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Kite-Lines-v4-3.pdf], Kitelines Vol 4, No. 3, p60</ref> This followed a successful crossing of the English Channel from Sussex to France by Locke & Carter the previous year.\n\nThrough the 1980s, there were occasionally successful attempts to combine kites with canoes, [[ice skate]]s, snow skis,<ref name=Harris1>Mark Harris [http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html Sea kayaking and kites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703034411/http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html |date=3 July 2006 }}, July 2002</ref> [[water ski]]s and [[roller skates]].\n\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Dieter Strasilla from [[Germany]] developed parachute-skiing and later perfected a kite-skiing system using self-made [[paraglider]]s and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to sail upwind and uphill but also to take off into the air at will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skywing.de|title=Dieter Strasilla|publisher=}}</ref> Strasilla and his Swiss friend Andrea Kuhn used this invention also in combination with surfboards and snowboards, grasskies and self-made buggies.<ref>{{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ZzPXzK6wg |title= History of paragliding: Andrea with surfboard and skywing |date= 1987 |author=  Dieter Strasilla}}</ref> One of his patents describes in 1979 the first use of an inflatable kite design for kitesurfing.<ref>Patent DE2933050</ref>\n\nTwo brothers, Bruno Legaignoux and Dominique Legaignoux, from the Atlantic coast of [[France]], developed kites for kitesurfing in the late 1970s and early 1980s and patented an inflatable kite design in November 1984, a design that has been used by companies to develop their own products.\n\nIn 1990, practical [[kite buggy]]ing was pioneered by [[Peter Lynn]] at Argyle Park in [[Ashburton, New Zealand]]. Lynn coupled a three-wheeled buggy with a forerunner of the modern [[parafoil]] kite. Kite buggying proved to be popular worldwide, with over 14,000 buggies sold up to 1999.\n\nThe development of modern-day kitesurfing by the Roeselers in the [[United States]] and the Legaignoux in [[France]] carried on in parallel to buggying. Bill Roeseler, a [[Boeing]] [[aerodynamicist]], and his son Cory Roeseler patented the \"KiteSki\" system which consisted of water skis powered by a two-line delta style kite controlled via a bar mounted combined winch/brake. The KiteSki was commercially available in 1994. The kite had a rudimentary water launch capability and could go upwind. In 1995, Cory Roeseler visited [[Peter Lynn]] at New Zealand's Lake Clearwater in the Ashburton Alpine Lakes area, demonstrating speed, balance and upwind angle on his 'ski'. In the late 1990s, Cory's ski evolved to a single board similar to a surfboard.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kirklandreporter.com/news/inventors-of-kiteboarding-inducted-into-kirkland-plaza-of-champions/ |date= 28 May 2015 |title= Inventors of kiteboarding inducted into Kirkland Plaza of Champions |publisher= Kirkland Reporter}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Laird Hamilton2.jpg|thumb|[[Laird Hamilton]] demonstrated kitesurfing in 1996]]\n\nIn 1996, [[Laird Hamilton]] and [[Manu Bertin]] were instrumental in demonstrating and popularising kitesurfing off the [[Hawaii]] a coast of [[Maui]] while in Florida Rapha\u00ebl Baruch changed the name of the sport from flysurfing to kitesurfing by starting and promoting the first commercial brand of the industry \"Kitesurf\".\n\nIn 1997, the Legaignoux brothers developed and sold the breakthrough \"Wipika\" kite design which had a structure of preformed inflatable tubes and a simple bridle system to the wingtips, both of which greatly assisted water re-launch. Bruno Legaignoux has continued to improve kite designs, including developing the [[bow kite]] design, which has been licensed to many kite manufacturers.\n\nIn 1997, specialized kiteboards were developed by Rapha\u00ebl Salles and Laurent Ness.  By the end of 1998 kitesurfing had become an extreme sport, distributed and taught through a handful group of shops and schools worldwide. The first competition was held on [[Maui]] in September 1998 and won by Flash Austin.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/>\n\nStarting in 1999, kitesurfing became a mainstream sport with the entry of key windsurfing manufacturers namely [[Robby Naish]] and [[Neil Pryde]]. Single direction boards derived from windsurfing and surfing designs became the dominant form of kiteboard.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Action Sport 2 (2).png|thumb|evolution of extreme sports]]\n\nIn 2000, a new freestyle competition, sponsored by [[Red Bull]] was launched in [[Maui]].

Style<br />!! Description !! Similar sports\n|-\n| '''Freeride'''|| Freeride is anything that you want it to be and the most popular kitesurfing style. Most boards sold today are designed for freeride.  It's about having fun and learning new techniques.  Twintip boards and kites with good relaunch and a wide wind range are commonly used.|| \n|-\n| '''Freestyle'''|| The kite and board are used to get big air (jumps) so that various tricks can be done while airborne.  This style also used for competitive events and is free-format and \"go anywhere\". Smaller twintip boards and kites with good boost and hangtime are used.|| \n|-\n| '''Wave-riding'''|| Wave riding (kitesurfing) in waves is a style that combines kiteboarding with surfing. Locations with a [[Surf break|wave break]] are required. Most kitesurfers use a directional board (either with or without foot straps) that has enough flotation and sufficient turning characteristics to surf the wave. Many kiters use a surfboard that can also be used for regular surfing (with the foot straps removed). The kitesurfer follows the kite when riding the wave, so the pull of the kite is reduced. This style is popular with [[surfers]] since it resembles [[tow-in surfing]]. Some riders ride waves unhooked, and without foot straps. Foot straps dictate the kitesurfer's foot position and how weight and pressure is applied to the board.  Surfers (other than tow-in surfers) do not wear straps and are therefore free to move their feet and position their weight over a greater area of the board to match what is needed to flow with the wave.  Kitesurfing using a board without foot straps is referred to as \"riding strapless\". This allows the kitesurfer's feet to move around the board for optimal performance.  Kitesurfers using foot straps often use the power of the kite to position themselves on a wave and to control their board. That is, they rely on the kite for propulsion rather than the power of the wave to surf.||[[Surfing]], [[tow-in surfing]]\n|-\n| '''Wakestyle'''|| Tricks and aerials, using a wake-style board with bindings.  May also include tricks and jumps involving ramps. Crossover from [[wakeboarding]]. Flat water is perfect for this style, and the use of big twintip boards with high rocker and wake booties is common. This style is commonly practiced by younger riders.|| [[Wakeboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Jumping''' or '''Airstyle'''|| Jumping, arguably a subset of Freeride, consists of jumping high to optionally perform tricks, sometimes also using kiteloops to get extra hang-time. Often shorter lines and smaller kites are used in stronger wind. C-kites and twintip boards are commonly used. An extension of this style is '''Big Air''' as pioneered by [[Ruben Lenten]] where riders go out in gale force conditions and perform high risk moves like kiteloops or more exactly '''megaloops''' || \u2014\n|-\n| '''Wakeskate'''|| Wakeskaters use a strapless twintip board, similar to [[skateboard]]. Flat water and other conditions similar to Wakestyle.|| [[Skateboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Course racing''' || These are racing events - like a yacht race along a course, that involve both speed and tactics.  Special purpose directional race boards with long fins are used. Some raceboards resemble [[windsurfing]] boards. [[Foilboard]]<nowiki/>s are also now used. The goal is to outperform other kiters and come first in the race. || [[Windsurfing]]\n|-\n| '''Speed racing''' || Speed racing is a style practiced at either formal race events or informally, usually with GPS units. Special purpose directional speed boards, or raceboards with long fins are used.  The goal is travel at the maximum possible speed over 500 meters.||\n|-\n|'''Park Riding'''\n|Park riding resembles wakestyle. Riders use wakeboarding obstacles to perform tricks on them. Difficulty, execution and style\n|-\n| '''Foiling'''|| Foiling involves the attachment of a hydrofoil (foil) and mast to the base a board.  The foil allows the board to completely exit the water frees the rider from impact of surface conditions.  The extreme efficiency of a foil allows it's rider to propel themselves with significantly less wind than those riding the on water's surface while greatly increasing upwind ability and speed.  Different sizes and shapes of the wings on the foil allow one to optimize their boards for speed, stability, or waves. \n|}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zanzibar island Copia (22).jpg|Unhooked freestyle\nFile:Board Off - panoramio.jpg|Board Off hooked-in freestyle\nFile:Jesse Richman by MakenaStockMedia 3.jpg|[[Foilboard|Foiling]] with a kite\nFile:Jesse Richman - Pierre Bouras 1.jpg|Wave-riding\nFile:MINI KTE France 2012 (10798352846).jpg|Course racing\nFile:Luderitz Speed Canal.jpg|The [[L\u00fcderitz Speed Challenge]] had set records\n</gallery>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nKiteboarding can pose hazards to surfers, beachgoers, bystanders and others on the water. Many problems and dangers that may be encountered while learning kiting can be avoided or minimized by taking professional instruction through lesson centers. Kitesurfing schools provide courses and lessons to teach skills including kite launching, flying, landing, usage of the bar, lines and safety devices. Basic skills include:\n* Turning, particularly the \"heel turn jibe\"\n* Controlled flying and jumping, the primary attractions of the sport\n* Board grabs, tricks performed while a rider is jumping or has gained air from popping by grabbing the board in a number of positions with either hand. Each grab has a different name dependent on which part of the board is grabbed and with which hand grabs it. The names generally originate from other board sports like [[Grabs (skateboarding)|skateboarding]] and [[snowboarding]]\n<gallery>\nFile:Kitesurf jump aerial.jpg|Jumping\nFile:Kitesurfer1.jpg|Big Air\nFile:Kitedge.jpg|Kiteboarder edging his board\n</gallery>\n\n==The wind==\n[[File:Windvenster.jpg|thumb|The [[wind]] window]]\n\n===Wind strength and kite sizes===\nKitesurfers change kite size and/or line length depending on wind strength \u2014 stronger winds call for a smaller kite to prevent overpower situations. Kitesurfers will determine the wind strength using either an [[anemometer]] or, more typically, visual clues as shown in the [[Beaufort scale]]. Modern kites dedicated to kitesurfing provide a \"depower\" option to reduce the power in the kite. By using depower, the kite's angle of attack to the wind is reduced, thereby catching less wind in the kite and reducing the pull.\n\n[[Bow kite]]s have a wider wind range than C-kites, so two kite sizes (such as 7 m\u00b2 and 12 m\u00b2) could form an effective quiver for winds ranging from 10 to 30+ knots for a 75&nbsp;kg (165&nbsp;lb) rider.<ref>[http://www.kitesurfbarcelona.com/nkb_mnl12_rebel_en.pdf North Rebel Manual 2012North Sails kitesurfbarcelona.com] 1 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Wind direction and speed===\nCross-shore and cross-onshore winds are the best for unassisted kiteboarding. Direct onshore winds carry the risk of being thrown onto land or stuck in shallows. Direct offshore winds pose the danger of being blown away from the shore in the event of equipment failure or loss of control. However offshore winds can be quite suitable in confined waters, like in a lake or estuary, or when a safety boat is assisting.\n\nThe kiter must maintain a clear perception of the wind direction but also of the wind speed. The Beaufort scale<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/beaufort.html|title=Beaufort Wind Scale|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> is of great assistance in helping users assess the situation. A range of wind up to 33 knots covers the conditions for a safe practice for an experienced rider. A less experienced one should avoid riding with more than 15 knots. Most twintip boards and inflatable kites would be barely rideable below 11 knots, therefore for most cases a user should focus on the winds classified as moderate up to strong.\n\n=== Apparent wind ===\nEven if there is no wind blowing, a kiter can act on the kite lines and force it to move, and then, like with a row, it generates some force resulting from the incidence of the air into the kite's surface. In a gentle breeze, if the user action increases the air speed around the kite 10 times, the generated force increases 100 times, since the wind force acting on a kite is proportional to the square of the wind speed acting on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html|title=The Lift Equation|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref> Thus the relevant notion of ''apparent'' wind, which is the actual wind acting on the moving kite, sail or wing.\n\nThe apparent wind is measured taking the moving kite as the reference frame, therefore its other name as ''relative wind''. By opposition, the wind measured relatively to the ground is called ''true wind''.\n\nWhile the other wind sports can generate considerable apparent wind, their wind forces are limited by the movement of the user platform, since it is attached more or less rigidly to the wing or sail. In this aspect, kiteboarding seems unique among other wind sports, since it allows the user to generate apparent wind independently of the movement of the user platform, the board. For instance, in the initiating kiteboard technic called ''waterstart'', while the user prepares to start in the water, the kite is sent aggressively, generating a propulsive impulse. Then the resulting movement of the board increases tension on the kite lines, which the user controls to manage the riding speed and to navigate at will. The composition of the movements of both the kite and the board, offer the user a great deal of navigation flexibility and creativity, including the possibility to jump significantly, making this a true 3-dimensional sport.\n\n=== Wind power, control lines and kite paths ===\nIn some way all wind sports harvest the energy of the wind. The greater the volume of the atmosphere available to be harvested by the sails, the bigger the available energy to propel the users. As a taller sailing ship harvests more energy from the wind, so does a kiteboarder with longer lines. Compared to a kiteboarder, a windsurfer can extract a higher ratio of wind energy from the available atmosphere volume, but since such volume is much smaller, the resulting energy could be much less than in kiteboarding.\n\nTo increase the power, the kiteboarder typically navigates the kite along an S-shape path, increasing the harvesting of energy since it is traversing most of the atmosphere volume around him. This S-shaped movement is most common when the kiters need a moderate improvement of power. If the user needs an intense improvement of power, it loops the kite. Such loops are stronger when the loop radius is large, and traverses a larger atmosphere volume. The kite loop is an advanced practice, and its power can be quite dangerous. With most modern kites and control bars, to end a kite loop the user just pushes away or releases the bar.\n\nRegarding the length of the lines connecting the kite to the user, longer lines allow the user to harvest wind energy in a larger volume.  Due to the boundary layer effect<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/boundlay.html|title=Boundary Layer|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref> longer lines also allow to harvest stronger winds higher up in the atmosphere. But longer lines make the kite slower to respond to the user actions on the control bar, since the lines form a more pronounced spring-like catenary. Therefore, kitesurfers, who need to react fast to incoming waves, tend to use shorter lines than the other kiters. For safety reasons the newcomers to the sport are usually trained with short lines, limiting the power build up.\n\n=== Wind window ===\nThe ''wind window'' is the 180 degree arc of the sky downwind of the rider in which the kite can be flown - roughly one fourth of a sphere's surface, which radius is the length of the lines. It is the atmosphere volume in which the kiter can navigate the kite to harvest wind energy.\n\nIf the rider is facing downwind on a surface, like the ocean, the wind window covers roughly all the area the rider can see, from the rider's peripheral vision on one side, along the horizon to the other side, and then directly overhead back to the first side. If the rider somehow puts the kite out of the window \u2014 for example, by riding downwind too quickly and sending the kite directly overhead and behind, the kite will stall and often fall out of the sky.\n\nThe eventual inefficiency of the kite can obviate for it to reach the edge of the wind window. In such cases the magnitude of the wind window can be reduced to as little as a 120 degree arc, instead of the expected 180 degree.\n\nThe wind window is centered in the user location. Since the user is carried by the board, the wind window is affected by the movement of the board. Therefore, the wind window rotates as the board moves and generates apparent wind into itself. For instance, when the kiter navigates perpendicular to the true wind at a speed equal to the true wind's, the apparent wind felt on the board increases 42% compared to the true wind, but rotates 45\u00ba against the movement. With such rotation, even if the user keeps the kite at the very edge of the wind window for trying to keep it pulling in the travelling direction, the kite lines would be at an angle of 45\u00ba downwind of the board path, forcing the kiter to edge the board to oppose its tendency to slip downwind. Such board edging is an indispensable technique for navigating upwind, and can be made at a much more extreme angle to the kite lines, almost up to 90\u00ba.\n\nThe wind window rotation degrades the performance when riding fast in a path upwind. To minimize the wind window rotation and sail upwind as much as possible, the kiter should keep the slowest board speed without sinking the board by lack of hydrodynamic lift. High flotation boards like surfboards are preferable in such cases. Also, keeping the kite high in window, pulling up the user and the board, is quite efficient in coping both with the reduced hydrodynamic lift of the board and with the intended reduction of the board speed.\n\n=== Arbitrary atmosphere volume swept by the kite ===\nThe kite is a peculiar sail because it can be swept arbitrarily through the atmosphere, usually in specific patterns, so the user can harvest a significant amount of wind energy, much larger than with an equivalent sail fixed to a mast.\n[[File:SweptVolumes.png|thumb|The peculiar travel pattern of a kite, compared to a sail fixed to a mast as in windsurf]]\nThe kite and the lines are light, in the range between 2 and 4&nbsp;kg, but the aerodynamic drag can be significant since the kite can travel much faster than a windsurf sail. Therefore, part of the energy harvested is spent in the movement of the kite itself, but the remainder propels the user and the board.\n\nFor instance, a user riding towards the beach rises the kite to slow it down and convert traction into lift. Then, instead of speed he feels an increase of the force upwards, necessary to keep himself above the breaking waves.\n\nAnother specific advantage of the kite being able to be swept at will, is that the user can take advantage of the atmosphere boundary layer, either rising the kite to harvest the stronger winds blowing in the higher zone of the wind window, or during overpowering gusts he can drive the kite low, skimming the water near the edge of the wind window.\n\n=== Air temperature and humidity ===\nSeasoned kiteboarders frequently attribute to moist and hotter air a notable reduction in kite performance. In fact the [[coefficient of lift|lift force]] of a kite is proportional to the air density. Since both the temperature and the relative humidity are important detrimental factors in the air density, the kiters subjective valuation is correct.\n\nIn the range between 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C a kite loses approximately 0.4% of lift per degree Celsius. It means that a kiter practicing one given day in the Baltic, and then travelling to the Mediterranean, could experience 10% less pull using the very same kite at the very same wind speed.\n\n==Locations==\n\nAny location with consistent, steady side-onshore winds (10 to 35+ knots), large open bodies of water and good launch areas is suitable for kitesurfing. Most kitesurfing takes place along ocean shores, usually off beaches, but it can also be practiced on large lakes and inlets and occasionally on rivers. Since kiteboarding relies heavily on favorable, consistent wind conditions, certain locations tend to become popular and sought out by kiteboarders.\n\n; Boracay, Philippines\n: [[Boracay]] offers constant side onshore winds during the November to April main season in a turquoise shallow water lagoon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whenwherekite.com/Bulabog-beach-Boracay-Philippines.html|title=Wind statistics Bulabog beach}}</ref>\n\n; Cumbuco, Brazil\n: [[Cumbuco]] has strong side shore wind every day and wide sandy beach lagoon, the best season is from August to December, although January and February can be good as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go-kite.com/index.php/kite-brazil-cumbuco/kitesurf|title=Go Kite - Cumbuco, Brazil}}</ref>\n\n; Maui, Hawaii, US\n: in [[Maui]], the tropical Kite Beach has warm waters, steady winds and gentle waves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actionsportsmaui.com/kite-beach/|title=Action Sports Maui - Kite Beach}}</ref>\n\n; Nabq Bay, Egypt\n: [[Sharm El Sheikh]] is a beach town with shallow and flat waters, the wind blows at least 20 knots on most days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripping.com/explore/the-10-best-places-for-kiteboarding-in-the-world|title=Tripping - Nabq Bay, Egypt}}</ref>\n\n; Tarifa, Spain\n: [[Tarifa]] is a 10&nbsp;km long bay with a wide, sandy beach.

Moreover, the sport is convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than most surf and [[paddling]] boards.\n\nEquipment depreciation can cost between \u00a3270 per year for second hand gear, to \u00a31360 per year for brand new, not discounted kites and accessories.<!--ref name=iksurfmagDec2019/-->\nIn 2017, 150,000 kites were sold globally, compared to 400,000 surfboards sold each year.<ref name=iksurfmagDec2019>{{cite news |url= https://www.iksurfmag.com/issue78/?page=51 |title= How Much Does It Cost To Kitesurf? |magazine= iksurfmag |issue= 78 |author= Rou Chater |date= December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Power kites===\n[[File:Lei-bow-foil-kites.svg|thumb|upright|A '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|LEI]]'''(R), '''[[Bow kite|Bow]]'''(L) and '''[[Foil kite|Foil]]'''(T) [[Power kite]]s]]\nA [[power kite]] is available in two major forms: '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|leading edge inflatables]]''' and '''[[foil kite]]s'''.\n\n====Leading edge inflatables====\n[[File:PowerSail detail.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s''', known also as '''inflatables''', '''LEI kites''', are typically made from ripstop polyester with an inflatable plastic bladder that spans the front edge of the kite with separate smaller bladders that are perpendicular to the main bladder to form the chord or foil of the kite.<ref>[http://www.kiteboardingreview.com LEIs], Kiteboarding Review, 27 June 2011</ref> The inflated bladders give the kite its shape and also keep the kite floating once dropped in the water. LEIs are the most popular choice among kitesurfers thanks to their quicker and more direct response to the rider's inputs, easy relaunchability if crashed into the water and resilient nature. If an LEI kite hits the water or ground too hard or is subjected to substantial wave activity, bladders can burst or it can be torn apart.\n\nIn 2005, '''[[Bow kite]]s''' (also known as '''flat LEI kites''') were developed with features including a concave trailing edge, a shallower arc in planform, and a distinctive bridle with multiple attachment points along the leading edge. These features allow the kite's angle of attack to be altered more and thus adjust the amount of power being generated to a much greater degree than previous LEIs. These kites can be fully depowered, which is a significant safety feature. They can also cover a wider wind range than a comparable C-shaped kite. The ability to adjust the angle of attack also makes them easier to re-launch when lying front first on the water. Bow kites are popular with riders from beginner to advanced levels. Most [[LEI kite]] manufacturers developed a variation of the bow kite by 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kitesurfingmag.com/north-kiteboarding-signs-up-for-kite-patent/|title=North signs up for Best Kiteboarding patent - Kitesurfing Magazine|publisher=}}</ref>  Bow kites with a straight trailing edge are named \u00b4delta\u00b4 kites, given their triangular outline.\n\nEarly bow kites had some disadvantages compared to classic LEI kites:\n\n* They can become inverted and then not fly properly\n* They can be twitchy and not as stable\n* Heavier bar pressure makes them more tiring to fly\n* Lack of \"sled boosting\" effect when jumping<ref>[http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm Flat Inflatable Kites, Bow Kites, Flat LEIs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223649/http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm |date=1 June 2007 }}, Kitesufingschool.org, 27 June 2006</ref>\n\nIn 2006, second generation flat LEI kites were developed which combine near total depower and easy, safe relaunch with higher performance, no performance penalties and reduced bar pressure. Called '''Hybrid or SLE kites''' (Supported Leading Edge), these kites are suitable for both beginners and experts.\n\nIn 2008, Naish introduced another kite design, with their \"Sigma Series\" of kites. These kites are a SLE design and feature a unique \"bird in flight\" shape with the center of the kite swept back to put much of the sail area behind the tow point, which Naish claims has multiple benefits.\n\nIn 2009, the performance revolution shows no sign of slowing. Bridled designs feel more like C kites, and five-line hybrids have better depower capability than ever before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|title=2009 Kiteboarding Buyers'Guide|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404021939/http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|archivedate=4 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are more than thirty companies manufacturing [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s. The '''delta-kites''' are growing in popularity since 2008 with around 12 companies offering '''delta-kites''' since 2008/2009.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013 kite technology has continued to grow.  Kites have become lighter, more durable, much easier to launch and safer.  Manufacturers have continued to add new safety features.  This has resulted in a growing number of new riders, both younger and older.  In 2013, there are at least 20 \"major\" kite manufacturers, each with multiple models available.  Many of the manufacturers are on their third or fourth generation of kites.<ref>kiteboardingreview.com</ref>\n\n====Foil kites====\n[[File:LEIpowerKite.jpg|thumb|A [[Foil kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Foil kite]]s''' are also mostly fabric ([[ripstop nylon]]) with air pockets (air cells) to provide it with lift and a fixed bridle to maintain the kite's arc-shape, similar to a [[paraglider]]. Foil kites have the advantage of not needing to have bladders manually inflated, a process which, with an LEI, can take up to ten minutes.\nFoil kites are designed with either an open or closed cell configuration.\n\n; Open Cell\n: Open cell foils rely on a constant airflow against the inlet valves to stay inflated, but are generally impossible to relaunch if they hit the water, because they have no means of avoiding deflation, and quickly become soaked.\n\n; Closed Cell\n: Closed cell foils are almost identical to open cell foils except they are equipped with inlet valves to hold air in the chambers, thus keeping the kite inflated (or, at least, making the deflation extremely slow) even once in the water. Water relaunches with closed cell foil kites are simpler; a steady tug on the power lines typically allows them to take off again. An example for a closed cell kite is the [[Arc Kite]].\n\n====Kite sizes====\nKites come in sizes ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger. In general, the larger the surface area, the more power the kite has. Kite power is also directly linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds. The kite size\u2014wind speed curve tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots. Kites come in a variety of designs. Some kites are more rectangular in shape; others have more tapered ends; each design determines the kite's flying characteristics. 'Aspect ratio' is the ratio of span to length. High aspect ratios (ribbon-like kites) develop more power in lower wind speeds.\n\nSeasoned kiteboarders will likely have three or more kite sizes which are needed to accommodate various wind levels, although bow kites may change this, as they present an enormous wind range; some advanced kiters use only one bow kite. Smaller kites are used by light riders, or in strong wind conditions; larger kites are used by heavier riders or in light wind conditions. Larger and smaller kiteboards have the same effect: with more available power a given rider can ride a smaller board. In general, however, most kiteboarders only need one board and one to three kites (7-12 sq m in size).\n\n===Other equipment===\n[[File:Happy-students-3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|A kitesurfer uses a bar with lines to control the kite, attached to a [[Windsurfing harness|harness]], and can wear a [[wetsuit]]]]\n\n* '''Flying lines''' are made of a strong material such as [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]], to handle the dynamic load in unpredictable wind while maintaining a small cross-sectional profile to minimize drag. They come in lengths generally between seven and thirty-three meters. Experimentation with line lengths is common in kiteboarding. The lines attach the rider's control bar to the kite using attachment cords on the kite edges or its bridle. Most power kites use a [[Kite control systems#5-Line Bars|3, 4 or 5-line]] configuration. Most control bars have 4 lines, 2 for most of the propulsive power and 2 for steering and for control of the angle of attack. The 5th line is used to aid in re-launching or to further adjustment of the kite's angle of attack, mostly in C-kites.\n* The '''control bar''' is a solid metal or composite bar which attaches to the kite via the lines. The rider holds on to this bar and controls the kite by pulling at its ends, causing the kite to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise like a bicycle. Typically a ''chicken loop'' from the control bar is attached to a latch or hook on a spreader bar on the rider's harness. Most bars also provide a quick-release safety-system and a control strap to adjust the kite's minimum [[angle of attack]]. Kite control bars, while lightweight and strong, are usually heavier than water; \"bar floats\" made of foam may be fixed to the lines right above the harness to keep the bar from sinking if lost in the water. Control bars can be specific to a particular kite type and size and not suitable for use with different [[kite types]].\n* A '''kite harness''' comes in seat (with leg loops), waist, or vest types. The harness together with a spreader bar attaches the rider to the control bar. The harness reduces the strain of the kite's pull from the rider's arms, spreading it across part of the rider's body. This allows the rider to perform jumps and other tricks while remaining attached to the kite via the control bar. Waist harnesses are the most popular harnesses among advanced riders, although seat harnesses make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider, and vest harnesses provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite harnesses resemble windsurfing harnesses, but with different construction; a windsurfing harness is likely to fail when used for kiteboarding.\n[[File:Kite-board.jpg|thumb|right|Twin tip kiteboard]]\n* '''Kiteboard''', a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now several types of kiteboards: directional surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids which can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without foot straps much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and are by far the most popular. The boards generally come with sandal-type footstraps that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. Kiteboards come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider's skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.\n[[File:DrySuits.jpg|thumb|right|Kitesurfers wearing [[dry suit]]s on [[Long Island]] in winter when the air and water temperatures are near 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F)]]\n* A '''wetsuit''' is often worn by kitesurfers, except in warmer conditions with light winds. When kitesurfing in strong winds, body heat loss is reduced by wearing a [[wetsuit]]. A \"shortie\" is worn to protect the torso only, and a full suit is used for protection against cool conditions, from marine life such as [[jellyfish]], and also from abrasions if the rider is dragged by the kite. Neoprene boots are required if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks. [[Dry suit]]s are also used to kitesurf in cold conditions in winter.\n* A '''safety hook knife''' is considered required equipment. The corrosion resistant [[stainless steel]] blade is partially protected by a curved plastic hook. It can be used to cut entangled or snagged [[kite line]]s, or to release the kite if the safety release system fails. Some kitesurfing harnesses are equipped with a small pocket for the knife.\n* A '''helmet''' is often worn by kitesurfers to protect the head from [[blunt trauma]]. [[Helmet]]s prevent head [[lacerations]], and can also reduce the severity of impact injuries to the head, as well as compression injuries to the neck and spine.\n* A '''personal flotation device''' or [[Personal flotation device|PFD]] may be required if the kitesurfer is using a boat or [[personal water craft]] for support. It is also recommended for kitesurfing in deep water in case the kitesurfer becomes disabled and must wait for rescue.\n* An '''impact vest''' provides some protection against impacts to the torso area. They also provide some flotation and preclude the harness to climb the chest and hurt the ribs, during high power maneuvers.\n* A '''[[Surfboard leash|board leash]]''' that attaches the board to the kitesurfer's leg or harness is used by some riders. However, many kitesurfing schools discourage the use of board leashes due to the risk of recoil, where the leash can yank the board to impact the rider, which can result in serious injury or even death. Generally, kitesurfers that use a board leash will also wear a helmet to help protect against this.\n* '''Signaling devices''' are useful if the kitesurfer needs to be rescued. This may be as simple as a whistle attached to the knife, or [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] tape applied to the helmet. Some kitesurfers carry a [[mobile phone]] or [[two-way radio]] in a waterproof pouch to use in an emergency. A small [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]] (EPIRB) can be carried and activated to send out a distress signal.\n* A '''buddy''' is important to help with launching and retrieving the kite, and to assist in an emergency.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/faq FAQ], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n* A '''[[GPS]]''' can be used to measure distance travelled, tracks and speed during a session.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/gear/gps-for-kitesurfing GPS for kitesurfing], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n\n== Physical practice ==\n\nKiteboarding is seen as a mid to high intensity exercise, but freeriding can be a low intensity practice like walking, and is usually done in long sessions of up to 2\u20133 hours. It is amenable to almost all ages, at least from teenagers up to 70 years old or more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mpora.com/windsurfing-kitesurfing/77-year-old-surf-1|title=Meet David: The 77 Year Old Kite Surfer Showing The Rest Of Us How It's Done - Mpora|work=Mpora|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref> It can be seen as a supplement or a substitute for other fitness practices.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[Power kite]]s are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in [[wakeboarding]] and to lift their users to [[Diving (sport)|diving]] heights. An uncontrolled kite can be dangerous, especially in difficult environments. A rider can lose control from falling or from sudden wind gusts, which can occur in the presence of strong winds from squalls or storms (\"collard\").\n\nIt is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height (\"kitemare\", a [[portmanteau]] of kite and nightmare). Adequate quality professional kiteboarding [[training]], careful development of [[experience]] and consistent use of good judgement and [[safety gear]] should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding.\n\n=== Weather ===\n\n[[Weather forecasting]] and awareness is the principal factor to safe kiteboarding. Lack of weather awareness and understanding the figures is frequent, but avoiding weather problems is possible.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=9528|title= Kiteboarding weather planning and monitoring|author= Rick Iossi|publisher= Florida KiteSurfing Association Forum}}</ref> Choice of inappropriate locations for kiteboarding where the wind passes over land creating wind shadow, rotor with pronounced gusts and lulls has also factored in many accidents.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=7879|title= Shadow Blasted ...

Jumping and being airborne at inappropriate places such as shallow water or near fixed or floating objects can be hazardous. [[Collision]]s with wind surfers, other kite boarders or water craft are hazards, particularly at busy locations.\n\nSolo kiteboarding has been a frequent contributing cause to accidents; kiteboarders should try to kite with friends and keep an eye on one another. A kitesurfer can get farther from [[shore]] than an easy [[Human swimming|swim]], which is the primary reason kitesurfing in directly offshore winds is discouraged. Marine hazards include [[sharks]], [[jellyfish]], [[sea otters]], [[dolphins]], and even [[crocodile]]s, depending on the location. [[Drowning]] has been a factor in severe accidents as well and may have been avoided in some cases through the use of an appropriate flotation aid or impact vest and development of acceptable swimming skills.\n\n=== Safety equipment ===\n\nSome kite designs from late 2005 and onwards have included immediate and almost full depower integrated with the control bar and improved quick release mechanisms, both of which are making the sport much safer. However, lack of sufficient practice of emergency depowering the kite and going out in excessively strong or unstable weather can reduce the benefit of high depower kites.<br />Another important part of the safety equipment is the impact vest, which doubles as an improved floatation device. It reduces the severity of eventual impacts, but also improves the user endurance in the long procedures of self-rescue in deep waters, which almost every freeriding kiter experiences sooner or later. It is also important and overlooked as a complement to the harness, precluding it to climb along the chest during powerful kite loops, which otherwise would hurt the ribs.<br />The other important pieces of a reasonable safety kit are the safety hook knife to cut tangled lines, the helmet in a high visibility colour, a wet suit of reasonable thickness, depending on the water temperature, and possibly neoprene boots if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks.\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n[[Accidents]] can generate serious injuries or even be deadly. 105 accidents were reported in the Kiteboarding Safety Information Database between 2000 and September 2003, with 14 [[Death|fatalities]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kitesurfingschool.org/safety.htm |title= Kitesurfing Safety |date= 7 May 2007 |publisher= KitesurfingSchool }}</ref> In South Africa between October 2003 and April 2004, 83% of [[search & rescue]] missions involving kitesurf were in offshore winds with the kite still attached to the harness, uncontrolled in strong winds or impossible to relaunch in weak winds.

Kiteboarding lends itself to a rather frequent practice, much like a gym program, arguably more frequent than other risky sports like scuba diving. Therefore, further data is required to properly evaluate the risk associated with kiteboarding.\n\n==== Reports of casualties ====\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/kitesurfer-70-killed-at-remote-beach-20120206-1r0oi.html |title= Kitesurfer, 70, killed at remote beach |date= 6 February 2012 |publisher= [[WA Today]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/kite-surfer-killedat-redcliffe-20120306-1ui3g.html#ixzz1uiyfm54z |title= Kite surfer killed at Redcliffe |date= 6 March 2012 |publisher= [[Brisbane Times]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2012/03/dante_torres_malibu_kite_surfer_dies_kelp.php |title= Dante Torres, Malibu Kite Surfer Dies in Tragic Kelp Accident |publisher= [[LA Weekly]] Blogs |date= 13 March 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Phuket-beach-toll-rises-kitesurfing-American-dies |title= Phuket beach toll rises as kitesurfing American dies |publisher= [[Phuket Gazette]] |date= 31 May 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |title= Kiteboarder killed at Cheney Lake identified |date= 6 August 2012 |publisher= [[KWCH-TV]] |access-date= 14 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120810040308/http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |archive-date= 10 August 2012 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-33415791 |title= Sean Sands: Hunstanton kite surfing death 'accidental' |date= 6 July 2015 |publisher= [[BBC]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/14294364.Southend_kitesurfer_killed_in_accident/ |title= Mark Paxton: Southend kitesurfer has died in a freak accident at Ray Creek, Point Clear, Clacton |date= 21 February 2016|publisher= [[Clacton Gazette]]}}\n\n===Kitesurfing safety rules===\nWhile some countries have specific regulations on flying kites that may also apply to kitesurfing,<ref>[http://www.kiteman.co.uk/Kite%20Safty.html \"Kite Safety\"] www.kiteman.co.uk</ref> most don't. However a kitesurfer should comply to the sailing rules regulating water crafts in many countries, like the U.S. Coast Guard regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=rightOfWay|title=Right Of Way|website=www.navcen.uscg.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> Developed from such generic rules a set of kitesurf specific rules or recommendations has been taking form since the beginning of the sport.\n\n{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}\nThe first such rule is '''the prudential rule''': with so many people just discovering water sports, a kiter shouldn't assume others adequate knowledge, training or even proper attitude, and be prepared to observe self-preserving distances and always let the others perceive clearly its intentions and its intended path.\n\n'''Waterstarters have priority''': the rider going out from the beach has always priority over the riders coming in.\n\n'''Kite High Rule''' - A kiter who is upwind (closest to the wind) must keep their kite high to avoid their lines crossing those of downwind kiters. Similarly, the downwind kiter must keep their kite low to avoid their lines crossing upwind kites. This applies regardless of whether kiters are on the same, or opposing courses.\n\n'''Clearance Rule''' - A kiter while jumping must have a clear safety zone of at least 50m downwind because they will move downwind during the jump. A rider must also have a clear safety zone of 30m upwind to jump as his lines could touch the kite or the lines of another rider kiteboarding close by (see Kite High rule). It's important to also consider potential hazards downwind and crosswind of the rider such as people, buildings, trees and other fixed obstacles. Because of the clearance rule a jumper never has the right of way.\n\nKiters are also considered as sailing vessels \u2013 so all the standard sailing rules apply such as:\n\n'''Starboard Rule''' When kiters approach from opposite directions the kiter who has the wind on the starboard (right side, right leg/arm leads in direction of travel) has right of way. The kiter who has the wind on the port side (left side, left leg/arm are leads in direction of travel) shall keep out of the way of the other. In simple terms, this means \"keep right\" with the kiter coming in the opposite direction passing on the left.\n\nIn sailing terms, a sailor or kiter with right of way is entitled to \"insist\" on exercising that right (warning opposing kiters) by shouting \"starboard\" clearly and in good time.\n\nMany of the sailing rules of right of way are different expressions that the most maneuverable craft should give way to the less maneuverable one. Therefore, kiters should give way to fishing vessels, but not to a jet ski. Other '''boating rules''' such as no-go zones, distance from shore and swimmers also apply.<ref>[http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm Are you kiting Safely?? Are you aware of the Rules??] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326020626/http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm |date=26 March 2009 }}, kbv.org.au</ref> Also '''surfing rules''' do apply, so for instance, the rider to catch a wave closer to the crest has the right of way even if not on a starboard tack, freeriders included.\n\n== Terminology and jargon ==\n* '''Air time''': the amount of time spent in the air while jumping. This can be remarkably long; the record is [[Jesse Richman|Jesse Richman's]] 22 second long jump. Five to ten seconds is not unusual.\n* '''Apparent wind''': the kite's speed relative to the surrounding air. When kitesurfing in a straight line, the kite's apparent wind is a combination of the wind speed and the speed of the kite over the surface, but since the kite is highly steerable the apparent wind can vary widely depending on how the kite is being flown. Most ways of increasing power from the kite involve giving it a higher apparent wind somehow, i.e. diving the kite, riding faster, or riding at a greater angle into the wind. Any of these raises the kite's apparent wind speed.\n* '''Back stall''': A condition in which the kite ceases to move forward through the air and becomes difficult to control, often resulting in the kite flying backwards and crashing.  Back stall is often caused by lack of wind or by flying the kite with too great of an angle of attack. \n* '''Big air''': performing a high jump utilizing the lift of the kite. The jump is often assisted in its initial stage by the rider being catapulted off the lip of a wave.\n* '''Body dragging''': being pulled through the water without standing on a board. This is an early step in the learning process, and is essential before trying the board after flying a trainer kite.\n* '''Boost''': to suddenly become airborne\n* '''Brain fart''': to forget what trick you intended to perform mid air and end up crashing or landing on the water.\n* '''Charlie browner''': same as kiteboarder or kitesurfer.\n* '''Chicken loop''': a hard rubber loop attached to the middle line which has been fed through the control bar. It is used to attach the control bar to the harness so the kitesurfer can produce tension in the lines using their entire bodyweight instead of using purely arm strength.\n* '''Chicken bone/chicken finger/donkey dick / Donkey tail''': a hard rubber \"tongue\" attached to the chicken loop which the rider feeds through the spreader bar hook to prevent the rider from becoming \"unhooked\".\n* '''De-power''': to reduce the kite's power (pull), generally by adjusting the angle of attack of the kite. Most kites and control bars now allow a rider to rig a kite for a number of different power levels before launching, in addition to powering the kite up and down \"on the fly\" by moving the bar up and down. Depowerability makes a kite safer and easier to handle. Some new kite models, especially \"bow\" kites, can be de-powered to practically zero power, giving them an enormous wind range.\n* '''DP''': dawn patrol; an early morning session.\n* '''Downwind''': the direction the wind is blowing towards; to leeward. When a rider is facing '''downwind''' the wind is at their back.\n* '''Downwinder''': a kitesurfing \"trip\" (could actually be as short as a few minutes) where the rider starts at one point and ends up at another point downwind of their original position.\n* '''Edge''': tilting the board with its edge into the water. Used to control the direction of travel. Learning to edge properly is critical for learning to tack upwind. Edging is one of the fundamental skills of kitesurfing and is one of the ways kitesurfing is different from windsurfing or wakeboarding. While windsurf boards have daggerboards and/or skegs to steer the board upwind while lift and planing is provided by the board itself, generally kiteboards actually combine both functions and the bottom of the board lifts the rider and steers simultaneously. Kiteboard fins are generally much smaller and are for keeping the board in the water (see \"'''tea-bagging'''\"), but are not essential. Because kite boards have a small rocker, a deep edge can allow the board to act as a large low drag fin. Edging in wakeboarding is used for steering the board; whereas in kite boarding not only does edging steer the kite board, it is essential for kite control and controlling board speed. Riding downwind towards the kite subtracts massively from the kite's power and helps control board speed as well.\n* '''Facial''': total loss of flying kite control while on the beach, resulting in the harnessed rider being dragged face first downwind across rocks and sand.\n* '''Freeride''': kiteboarding style. Plain kiteboarding that does not involve tricks or jumping. The main goal is keeping a good edge and ability to traverse upwind. This would normally require a board with little rocker.\n* '''Freestyle''': kiteboarding style. Freestyle involves tricks (or combinations of tricks) where the rider is jumping off the water and experiencing enhanced elevation using lift generated from the kite. Freestyle is, weather-wise, a multi-condition concept and is to some degree equipment-specific. \"Big air\" is commonly associated with freestyle.\n* '''Goofy''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the right foot leading.\n* '''Guinea pig''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Wind-dummy'''.\n* '''Heel side''': the side of a board on the edge where a rider's heels are (opposite of toe side). \"Riding heel side\" is riding with heels down.\n* '''Hindenburg''': (a reference to the Hindenburg Airship disaster of 1937) a kite falling out of the air due to the loss of tension in the control lines, and therefore the loss of kite control. Hindenburging can be caused either by lack of wind or by the kite advancing to a position upwind of the kitesurfer in the wind window, also called \"overflying the kite\".\n* '''Handlepass''': while unhooked, passing the control bar behind a riders back while in the air.\n* '''Hot launch''': recovering and launching the kite from a position deep inside the wind window so the kite is immediately under maximum power (potentially dangerous). \n* '''Kiter''': the person driving the kite. \n* '''Kiteloop''': is a powered group of tricks where a rider loops the kite through the power zone.\n* '''Kitemare''': a kiteboardsurfing accident or dangerous mishap. Kitemares can be deadly.\n* '''Launch''': getting the kite in the air. The kite may be launched assisted or unassisted. An assisted launch is generally safer than an unassisted launch.\n* '''Lofted''': to get lifted vertically into the air by the kite due to a strong gust of wind. Being lofted has resulted in fatalities when kiters on or near land were dragged into obstacles. The danger can be avoided by minimizing time on land with the kite flying directly overhead, and by not kiting in overpowered situations.\n* '''Luff''' : when the air flow stalls around the kite. It may then stall and fall out of the sky. Like sails, a luffing kite has rippling and flapping panels. When launching the kite, if the kite is luffing, the rider should move farther upwind, or the person holding the kite should move downwind.\n* '''Mobe''': this term has two meanings: either a class of wakestyle tricks involving an invert with a 360-degree spin or a specific trick involving a back roll with a frontside 360 handlepass (while keeping the kite below 45 degrees).  The former meaning stems from the latter, which was the first type of mobe to ever be landed. Other types of mobes include: mobe 540, mobe 720, slim chance, KGB, crow mobe, moby dick, Pete Rose, blind pete, crow mobe 540, etc.\n* '''Nuking''': wind blowing at great speeds (30-40 knots). These extreme conditions are dangerous for most riders.\n* '''Offshore''': wind blowing at the water from the shore. Never ride in offshore winds without some means of recovery, i.e. a chase boat. This is somewhat less important in smaller bodies of water, of course.\n* '''Onshore''': wind blowing perpendicular to and directly at the shore from the water. A challenging condition for beginners, especially if waves are present.\n* '''Dookie dive''': loss of power during air time resulting in a crash into the water.\n* '''O-Shit loop''': two loops on either ends of the bar that are attached to the kite lines and run through rings attached to the bar. A standard leash attachment point.\n* '''Overhead waves''': waves {{convert|2|m|ft||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or larger from trough to crest;\n* '''Overpowered''': the condition of having too much power from the kite. Can be a result of an increase in wind, incorrect kite choice (too large for the conditions), incorrect adjustment, simply going too fast, etc. Experienced riders who are overpowered can switch to a smaller board to compensate, to a degree, although it's common to have just one board.\n* '''Pop''': height gained above the water using only the board and tension in the lines to get lift, with the kite usually positioned at 45 degrees. Lower kite angles are possible for more experienced riders. Used as a basis for many tricks and regarded as an essential skill for progressing.\n* '''[[Port]]''' the left side of a vehicle, as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Power up''': when the kite's power increases (suddenly), because of wind gusts or the kite's movement.\n* '''Power zone''': is the area in the sky where the kite generates the most lift (pull), this is generally between 0 and 60 degrees arc from the center of the downwind direction.\n* '''Raley''': a trick where the rider unhooks and then pops in order to fully extend his body into a \"superman\" position, before landing. This is a power move that's often performed relatively low to the water and forms the basis of more advanced tricks.\n* '''Regular''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the left foot leading.\n* '''Re-launch''': a general term for getting the kite back up in the air after crashing it (on land or water). A relaunch is unassisted and requires the rider to follow a kite-specific procedure (check the manual). As years of development have gone by, the more recent kites are easier to relaunch.\n* '''Rider''': kiteboarder.\n* '''S-Bend''': when the rider unhooks and performs a raley followed by a front roll. \n* '''Self rescue''': a maneuver by which a rider with a downed kite manipulates the kite in the water to assist them in swimming back to shore.  The rider generally wraps up their lines until they reach their kite, then positions their kite so that it is on its back as it would be carried on land but with the wing-tip closer to shore catching the wind.  This wing tip acts as a sail and helps pull the rider to shore.  This is considered an important manoeuvre to learn.\n* '''Send it''': to move the kite aggressively up through the power zone.\n* '''Schlogging''': this is riding extremely underpowered. A rider has no power to plane and definitely not enough to jump. A rider and their board bounce from planing on the surface to being dragged in the water.\n* '''Shit hot''': the art of stylish smooth moves.\n* '''SLE''': Supported Leading Edge. A C shaped kite with an inflatable leading edge, currently the most advanced kite design available allowing massive de-power.\n* '''Side offshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle away from the shore.\n* '''Side onshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle towards the shore.\n* '''side shore''': winds blowing parallel to the shore. Usually the most desirable direction for kitesurfing.\n* '''Spreader bar''': a stainless steel bar that attaches to the rider's harness. It has a hook that holds the \"chicken loop\" when riding hooked in.\n* '''[[Starboard]]''' the right side of a vehicle as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Stomp''': to successfully perform a trick.\n* '''Surfstyle:''' Wave riding using surfboards. Ideal conditions are cross shore to cross offshore with the wind blowing in the same direction that the wave is breaking. Boards can be ridden with or without foot straps.\n* '''Tack''': the direction which is being sailed, normally either starboard tack or port tack. In a starboard tack the wind is coming in from the rider's starboard (right-hand) side, similar to sailing a boat. In normal riding, the kitesurfer takes a heading which is as close to into the wind as possible, and in any event leads at some angle slightly upwind, sometimes as much as 45 degrees; jumping or wave riding usually results in traveling downwind, so the net result is to maintain relative position. Alternatively, see \"'''downwinder'''\".\n* '''Tea-bagging''': popping out of and falling back into the water intermittently due to light or gusty wind, poor flying skills, twisted lines etc.\n* '''Toe side''': the side of a board on the edge where a riders toes are (opposite of heel side). \"Riding toe side\" is riding with toes down.\n* '''Underpowered''': the condition of having insufficient power from the kite. Can be a result of insufficient wind, choosing a kite that is too small for the wind, rigging incorrectly, board too small, water current in the same direction as the wind, not riding fast enough, etc. A rider who is continuously diving the kite and sending it back up in a sine-wave pattern is usually underpowered.\n* '''Unhooked''' is when a kitesurfer is riding while the chicken loop is not attached to the rider's harness.\n* '''Upwind''': the direction from which the wind is blowing; windward; into the wind.\n* '''VaS conditions''': [[Victory at Sea]]; rough sea conditions characterized by overhead wind waves causing severe shore break.\n* '''Wakestyle''': A style of kiteboarding in which the rider usually uses wakeboarding (or kiteboarding) \"boots\" for their kiteboard (as opposed to straps and pads), ensuring their feet remain firmly attached at all times (hense the term \"Wakestyle\").  This style is also associated with performing powered tricks with the kite as low to the water as possible (something generally perceived by kiteboarders to be more difficult and stylish).\n* '''Walk of shame''' is the act of beach walking back upwind to the location where the kite was originally launched. It could mean that the kiter wasn't able to sail upwind.\n* '''Wind-dummy''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Guinea pig'''.\n* '''Zenith''' the location in the wind window directly over the kiter's head. This is the neutral position where kitesurfers can place the kite to stop moving or prior to movement. This places the kite in a more vulnerable to \"Hindenburgs\" position than any other.\n\n== Market data ==\n{{As of|2012|alt=In 2012}}, the number of kitesurfers was estimated by the [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] and [[International Kiteboarding Association|IKA]] at 1.5 million persons worldwide<ref name=\":3\" /> (pending review). The global market for kite gear sales is worth US$250 million.<ref name=\":4\" /> The markets related to kiteboarding keep developing at a very interesting pace, as seen in these statistics from 2012:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiteforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=2387270|title=Kite sales statistics - 2014 - Kiteforum.com|website=www.kiteforum.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>\n\n* 60,000 new kiters annually \n* 180,000 kites sold annually \n* 75,000 boards sold annually \n* 14 board builders \n* 19 kite builders\n\nEvolution of kite sales, worldwide:\n\n* 1999:  29,000\n* 2006: 114,465\n* 2008: 140,000\n* 2012: 180,000\n\nKeep in mind that a kiteboarding quiver for a single user could typically include 2-4 kites and 2-3 boards. With the innovation associated with foil boards and foil kites these numbers will increase. With the exception of foil kites, these equipment pieces are quite rugged and would last from 3 up to 10 years of active use, and be repaired and resold several times. This aftermarket further improves the market development, removing cost barriers for newbies which improves the popularity of the sport, and eventually could bring up new products and services based on a much larger market scale. In locations like Portugal in 2018, a newcomer to kiteboarding typically buys a proper hands-on tutorial and then buys a basic set of used equipment for an overall total below \u20ac1000.\n\nThe sport is utterly convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than surf and paddling boards. Compared to other sailing sports, kiteboarding is among the less expensive and more convenient. Moreover, nearby most metropolitan areas, it can be practised almost all year long, since it just requires some wind and a reasonably flat surface, like an estuary, a lake, a sandy strip, or a snow flat.\n\nDespite the image of a youth radical sport, many newcomers are middle age, older than the typical wakeboard or snowboard practitioners. Such trends are quite conspicuous, not so much in the trendy summer holiday locations, but in the low season in metropolitan areas around the globe, where kiteboarding is becoming a regular practice for people of middle income, living in apartments not so close to the waterfront, for a short evasion and substituting for the gym.\n\n==Compared to windsurfing==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!   !!

Upwind riders adopt a similar stance to kite fliers onshore, who slide their feet forward in the beach sand to brake the kite. The kite board's center line is way off the track line, dramatically reducing speed.|| About 45\u00b0 from wind direction depending on the skills of the rider. The sail board's center line runs virtually parallel to the track line, as most lateral forces are encountered by the tail fin and little edging is required. Because of this, upwind courses are fairly fast.  Fastest speeds are achieved at [[Points of sail|broad reach]].\n|-\n| '''Theory''' || The faster the kite moves the more force it develops. Standing still and actively steering the kite up and down (pumping) one can almost immediately create a lot of force. It is almost always possible to have the kite travel faster (much) than the board. The dynamic nature of the kiter/kite system is why kites have so much range (wind range). || The sail and board move at the same speed. With pumping one can sometimes push oneself onto a plane or maintain planing in marginal conditions. But sail and board travel at basically the same speed. This is the main reason why windsurfing requires a lot of equipment. The equipment must match the wind conditions much closer than kiting.\n|-\n| '''Physical Strain on Rider''' || The traction force of the kite is solely transferred to the rider via the harness loop attached to the harness hook when hooked in. When \"hooked in\" the rider uses muscle strength (thumb and index finger suffice) to steer the kite and control the kite power by pushing the bar in and out (depending on setup one might actually notice a slight effort). When \"unhooked\" the rider steers the kite using their arms with no depower, which can be strenuous. Generally, kitesurfing is more of a light cardio training. || Windsurfing without a harness requires a lot of physical effort, especially in strong wind. With a harness, recovering from a fall or when maneuvering (jibing, tacking, ...) the rider needs to detach the harness completely from the sail, which means that both traction and steering forces are to be countered solely by the rider's muscle. For jibing maneuvers, muscle effort diminishes as the rider becomes more skilled in maintaining board speed in the jibe. In race conditions it can get quite physical as well, planing \"over the top\" of wave sets keeping the board absolutely level and the sail well powered. In the strongest winds it can get physical as well due to the sheer force of the wind, but that is attributed to poor choice of equipment or lack of skill.\n|-\n| '''Fall Recovery''' || The kite is fairly easy to keep flying during a fall, with 'Hindenburgs' being rather exceptional. The rider can be pulled out of the water by the force of the moving kite. The kite power can be regulated by changing the [[angle of attack]] of the kite. In light winds the kite may fall into the water and stay there. || In light winds (non planing conditions), the rider needs to get on the board and pull the sail out of the water. However, in stronger winds (planing conditions (depending of equipment/weight/experience approx. from 9 knots on)), water starting is a better option.  This means positioning the board-sail combination through aligning the sail into the right wind angle, allowing the wind to pull the body out of the water onto the board using the sail, and then easily hooking back in and stepping into foot straps. This maneuver actually requires slightly less than planing conditions. \n|-\n| '''[[Glossary of nautical terms|Tacking and Jibing]]''' || Twin tip kiteboards (the majority of kiteboards) are designed to be bidirectional. If the rider wants to start the next tack only the kite's sailing direction must be reversed. The \"stern\" of the board now becomes the \"bow\", so the feet can be kept in the footstraps. Since the windward edge of the board doesn't change sides, the terms \"jibing\" or \"tacking\" are somewhat of a misnomer. Falling into the water is not a major problem, as even beginning riders can quickly and fairly effortlessly execute a water start using the kite to pull them out of the water. Nower days many kiters use directionals as well (all wave, racing as well as foils). These need to be jibed or tacked. This actually requires practice. Full planing race jibes are almost as difficult as in windsurfing. || The rider has the choice between tacking or jibing. In both cases the windward edge changes sides, so the rider will need to change footstraps. At high winds the only option to change tacks while maintaining speed is to carve jibe, which is a maneuver that requires many practise hours for it to be performed with a reasonably low risk of falling. . \n|-\n| '''Jumping''' || Kitesurfers can use their kite to \"jump\" (actually using it as a [[Paragliding|paraglider]]), without the need for a launch wave. Jumping is relatively easy but can be hazardous. Being launched (jumping) can also happen unintended, even to beginners, especially in shifting winds or fast kite movements, where the rider can get pulled into the air as the kite reverses direction. || The rider needs considerable forward speed and ideally a \"ramp wave\" to get airborne. When the wave is not large enough, the riders must initiate the jump by kicking down the tail of the board. Unintended jumps rarely occur (unless bouncing over waves, ...), as jumping requires active rider input. Jumping requires skill and can generally only be executed by advanced riders.\n|-\n| '''Aerobatics''' || Most aerobatics and tricks (tail grab, [[barrel roll]] etc.) can be executed without the airfoil's position in the air having to change. Therefore, executing \"aerobatics\" is only marginally different from executing them on shore suspended by the harness from some fixed point. Beginners with a lot of caution may start attempting some basic tricks after the first few weeks or even days. This part of kiting can actually be physical. || With most aerobatics the airfoil's position in the air changes dramatically. Each figure has its own ideal airfoil movement. With some aerobatics like the barrel roll, the rider needs to jump sufficiently high to allow the full length of the mast to rotate forward underneath. Often the risks to the rider of having fast moving and relatively heavy (board + mast + sail) gear so close by are substantial. As aerobatics are considerably more complicated than jumping, they are the done by the most experienced of riders, commanding huge respect within the sail boarding community.\n|-\n| '''Clearance''' || Clearance of at least 50 meters upwind (from any object) and 30 meters downwind (from another kitesurfer) is required. The risk of being blown into an airborne situation by a strong wind gust is real, effectively turning the kite boarder into an uncontrolled [[Paragliding|para-glider]] in risk of hitting any object downwind. || Since there are no kite lines, no upwind or downwind clearance is required from any object other than a kite surfer or fishing lines, which means that windsurfers do not need to worry about 'rotor' or strong wind gusts. Also, they can emergency stop almost immediately. Experienced riders will do this by 'crashing' while beginning riders (who typically do not wear a harness) can depower the sail instantly by releasing the back hand or letting the mast fall on water. The risk of hitting hard objects or other water-goers is therefore minimal.\n|-\n| '''Learning Curve''' || Kiteboarding has a different learning curve from windsurfing.  At the beginning the handling the kite can be largely taught on shore, as kite boarding evolved from beach [[Kite|kiting]]. However once on the water you need to be safely guided by an instructor until you learn the basics.  After you have the basics and are independent you will progress much faster than in windsurfing.\nRecovery from falling is relatively easy (the kites, especially the newest models, stay normally aloft to pull the rider out of the water, with little effort) as is changing tacks, even in strong wind. Staying upwind is regarded as an advanced technique. Light wind kiting (<9 knots) is also an advanced technique: traveling much faster than the wind any mistake can lead to loss of apparent wind -> kite falls into the drink and stays there. \n|| The learning curve for windsurfing is gradual, and rewarding as the rider progresses through each stage of learning, and one can engage in solo practice. Initially handling of the airfoil (sail) can be learned on the water or on land. Once on the water it takes much of practice to improve.\n\nRecovery from falling takes more effort than kiting. The rider needs to either up haul the sail standing on the board or water start, which both take some balance. Up hauling large sails can be a bit of work. Falling into the water is part of the overall experience.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Safety''' || In case of material failure or accidents, normal kitesurfing equipment offers limited rescue possibilities. Kitesurfers can perform a self rescue and use their kite to sail back to shore. The last option for the rider is to abandon the kite and kiteboard and swim to shore. || Any sail board will allow the rider to keep the body sufficiently out of the water to postpone or avoid [[hypothermia]]. Smaller boards may require that the mast be detached, to avoid sinking. Thus, as a rule, a rider should never abandon the board. Windsurfing equipment is inherently safe in high winds against tea bagging or collisions due to loss of control: In case of too strong wind, the rider can depower the sail instantly by letting go with the back hand or letting the sail drop on water. Doing so (or falling) means that the board stops almost immediately as the sail will act as a floating anchor in water.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Transport''' || A kite and kiteboard will fit in most vehicles. An average rider may need two to three kites and one board to ride in a wide range of wind strength. || The sail board and sail mast (even telescopic) do not fit in most vehicles, and need to be transported on a roof rack or trailer. If they do, they will often exclude passengers from the vehicle. Several different sails and boards (and often masts and booms) are necessary to cover the full range of rideable conditions.\n|}\n\n== World Champions ==\n[[File:Aaron Hadlow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aaron Hadlow]] dominated Freestyle from 2004 to 2008]] \n[[File:Gisela Pulido Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|{{ill|Gisela Pulido|es|vertical-align=sup}} is ten times Freestyle Champion]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Freestyle PKRA/VKWC/WKL/GKA Sanctioned Tours\n!

He made a split from his initial camp, the PFN group and used his relationships with SDP state party chairmen to build his campaign. He lost the keenly contested primary conducted in Jos but after much prodding from SDP governors, he was selected by the primary winner, [[MKO Abiola]] as [[Vice-President of Nigeria|Vice-presidential]] running mate, creating a Muslim-Muslim ticket which was initially thought to be a deal breaker in the general elections.

Criers often dress elaborately, by a tradition dating to the 18th century, in a red and gold coat, white breeches, black boots and a [[tricorne]] hat.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, they carried a [[handbell]] to attract people's attention, as they shouted the words \"[[Oyez]], Oyez, Oyez!\" before making their announcements. The word \"Oyez\" means \"hear ye,\" which is a call for silence and attention. ''Oyez'' derives from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] word for ''listen'' (modern French, ''oyez'', infinitive, ''ou\u00efr'', but has been largely replaced by the verb ''\u00e9couter''). The proclamations book in [[Chester]] from the early 19th century records this as \"O Yes, O Yes!\"\n\n==History==\n\n===Europe===\nPrior to widespread literacy, town criers were the means of communication with the people of the town since many people could not read or write. Proclamations, local bylaws, market days, adverts, were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier.\n\nIn [[ancient Rome]], they typically proclaimed public business during the [[nundinae|market days]] that formed a kind of [[weekend]] every eight days.<ref name=homestruck>{{harvp|Struck|2009|loc=[http://www.classics.upenn.edu/myth/php/tools/dictionary.php?method=did&regexp=578 \"Nundinae\"]}}.</ref>\n\nIn Goslar, Germany, a crier was employed to remind the local populace not to urinate or defecate in the river the day before water was drawn for brewing beer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.windsortowncrier.com/twin-town-crier/ |first=Chris |last=Brown |title=Twin Town Crier helps keep the beer flowing |work=Windsor and Maidenhead Town Crier |date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriers were not always men, many town criers were women.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Bells were not the only attention-getting device\u2014in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], a [[gong]] was the instrument of choice for many, and in [[France]] a drum was used, or a [[Horn (instrument)|hunting horn]].\n\nIn the observance of [[Allhallowtide]], \"it was customary for criers dressed in black to parade the streets, ringing a bell of mournful sound and calling on all good Christians to remember the poor [[soul in the Bible|souls]].\"<ref>''The World Review'', Volume 4, University of Minnesota, p.255.</ref>\n\n====England====\nIn order to gain the attention of the crowd, the crier would yell, \"Hear ye\" \u2013 \"[[Oyez]]\".\n[[File: Town crier Peter Moore.JPG|thumb|150px|left|upright|[[Peter Moore (town crier)|Peter Moore]], the late Town crier to the Mayor of London and The Greater London Authority.]]\nIn [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[England]], town criers were the chief means of news communication with the townspeople, since many were [[Illiteracy|illiterate]] in a period before the [[moveable type]] was invented.

During public [[hanging]]s he read out why the person was being hanged, and helped to cut him or her down.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-04-09/news/1994099060_1_town-crier-alford-oyez |first=Carl |last=Schoettler |title=Town crier: a venerable calling that speaks volumes |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=9 April 1994}}</ref>\n\nChester records of 1540 show fees due to the bellman included:\n{{quote|\"of every worshipful gentyllman that goyth onye gounes at ther buryall ...one goune [at funerals gowns would be given to mourners]. when he gythe or aneything that is lost ...jd [one penny]. for every bote lode with powder mellwylle [salted fish] ...one fyshe, for every boute lode with fresh fyshe that he goeth for ...jd [one penny].\"}}\n\nIn 1620, there was a fight at the Chester cross between the butchers and the bakers where the \"Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them\". In 1607, one public notice read by George Tunnall, the bellman, forbade tipping rubbish in the river.\n\nIn 1715, a local man recorded that the:\n{{quote|\"Belman at the Cross \u2026 Reads publicly a proclamation in the Mayor's name, commanding all persons in the City to be of peaceable and civil behaviour, not to walk around the Streets or Rows at unreasonable hours of night.\"}}\n\nSalmon fishing season was also closed by the bellman.<ref>''Courant'', 17 April 1792.\n:A few days ago some persons were brought before our magistrates, charged with angling and catching salmon fry in the River Dee, As the law expressly forbids the young salmon to be taken, either with nets or other engines, the bellman had orders to give notice to the inhabitants, that prosecutions would be commenced against any persons offending in the like manner.</ref><ref>''Chronicle'', 12 December 1845.\n:Illegal Fishing\n:On Saturday last, four fishermen, named William Gibson, William Hand, Robert Barlow, and William Banks, appeared at Chester Police Court, to answer an information preferred against them by Buckley, the constable appointed by the River Dee Conservancy, for being out night  fishing with illegal nets (less than 2\u00bd inches in the mesh), and also for taking unsizeable fish. The information was laid under the 1st George 1. c. 18, s.4. Immediately upon being placed before the Bench, a somewhat noisy colloquy commenced between the Supt. of Police, the court and the defendants; the latter stoutly denying that to use small nets would be to ensure the escape of all other fish. On being told that at this season of the year they could catch nothing but salmon, Barlow stated that the other night they had caught nine shillings worth of flukes, and we have good authority for saying that this statement was correct. Gibson, striking his fist on the table, solemnly swore that, \"he had not killed a salmon since they were cried down\" and another affirmed that it would be no use killing them as \"they were not fit for pigs, much less Christians.\" After a long debate between the Court and the defendants, in which the latter seemed strongly disposed to try elsewhere the right of the Magistrates to prevent them fishing with nets of any size, providing they took no salmon, a reluctant  promise was wrung from them, that they would not offend in a similar way in the future and they were discharged.</ref>\n\nThe term \"Posting A Notice\" comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn. Some newspapers took the name \"The Post\" for this reason.\n\nTown criers were protected by law, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases. Anything done by the town crier was done in the name of the ruling monarch and harming a town crier was considered to be treason.<ref name=\"BBCAug2010\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bradford/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8931000/8931369.stm |title=Top town crier to be crowned as Hebden Bridge hits 500 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 August 2010}}</ref> The phrase \"[[Shooting the messenger|don't shoot the messenger]]\" was a real command.<ref name=\"BBCAug2010\"/>\n\nThere are two organizations representing town criers including the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers and Loyal Company of Town Criers.\n\nA copy of a royal proclamation announcing the [[dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]] is delivered by hand from the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]] to [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] in the [[City of London]].

There are records throughout the 16th century of town criers in Mexico, Peru, and Panama. During the 1830s and 40s Halifax, [[Nova Scotia]] had as many as four in the city. All through the American Colonies and beyond, such as Santa Fe, New Mexico; Boston, Massachusetts and Stamford, Connecticut had criers during the mid 17th century. In some places, the office of town crier persisted into the early 20th century. At least as recently as 1904, [[Los Angeles]] and several adjacent towns had official town criers.<ref>{{cite book |first=George Wharton |last=James |title=Travelers\u2019 handbook to southern California |url=https://archive.org/details/travelershandboo00jame |location=Pasadena, California |publisher=G.W.

The message had a typical flow, starting with \"people of (...) village, the headman would like to announce that...\" followed by the message.\n\n====Nepal====\nIn Nepal, the town crier is called a ''katuwal'' which derives from local Tibetic, ''kat'' 'voice' + an Indic suffix ''-wal'' 'kind of person' (see TGTM *''kat'' 'voice' in <ref>{{cite book |first=Martine |last=Mazaudon |title=Consonantal mutation and tonal split in the Tamang sub-family of Tibeto-Burman.

The town crier is paid traditionally in grain after each harvest, a portion from each family in the village. The town crier not only makes public announcements, but makes announcements in particular neighborhoods when more labor or help is needed for daily work by other families out in the fields. This ensures that labor demands are met during more intensive work activities such as harvests, weeding, and planting.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nIn Sri Lanka, traditionally criers would carry a [[Sri Lanka drums|specific drum]] to call public attention (called tom-tom beating), following up with the message. The practice dates back from ancient times as it was used by Sri Lankan kingdoms through the colonial period up on to the modern times and was known as ''Ana Bera'' (Announcement drum beating). The practice was used by municipal or village councils until the late ninetieth century when the practice was replaced by modern communication mediums. The use of a tom-tom beating announcer is still defined in legal statutes for situations for public notification in situations such as partition of lands. It is however not practiced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/2003/10/05/featur01.html|title=featur01|website=www.island.lk|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2017/06/09/features/118360/rhythm-and-moves-sri-lankan-drumming|title=Rhythm and Moves with Sri Lankan drumming|website=Daily News|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:Native town crier, Belgian Congo.jpg|thumb|Congolese town crier]]\nTown criers were prominent in the precolonial and colonial eras of [[Igboland]], a West African region in the present-day [[Nigeria]].

The word \"Oyez\" means \"hear ye,\" which is a call for silence and attention. ''Oyez'' derives from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] word for ''listen'' (modern French, ''oyez'', infinitive, ''ou\u00efr'', but has been largely replaced by the verb ''\u00e9couter'').

The information was laid under the 1st George 1. c. 18, s.4. Immediately upon being placed before the Bench, a somewhat noisy colloquy commenced between the Supt. of Police, the court and the defendants; the latter stoutly denying that to use small nets would be to ensure the escape of all other fish. On being told that at this season of the year they could catch nothing but salmon, Barlow stated that the other night they had caught nine shillings worth of flukes, and we have good authority for saying that this statement was correct. Gibson, striking his fist on the table, solemnly swore that, \"he had not killed a salmon since they were cried down\" and another affirmed that it would be no use killing them as \"they were not fit for pigs, much less Christians.\" After a long debate between the Court and the defendants, in which the latter seemed strongly disposed to try elsewhere the right of the Magistrates to prevent them fishing with nets of any size, providing they took no salmon, a reluctant  promise was wrung from them, that they would not offend in a similar way in the future and they were discharged.</ref>\n\nThe term \"Posting A Notice\" comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn. Some newspapers took the name \"The Post\" for this reason.\n\nTown criers were protected by law, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases.

While many dishes originated from [[Manchu cuisine]], it is also heavily influenced by the cuisines of [[Russian cuisine|Russia]], [[Beijing cuisine|Beijing]], [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolia]], and [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]]. It partially relies on preserved foods and large portions due to the region's harsh winters and relatively short growing seasons. The fertile land produces the best rice in China. \n\nPickling is a very common form of food preservation, and [[suan cai|pickled cabbage]] is traditionally made by most households in giant clay pickling vats. Perhaps the most important characteristic of Northeastern Chinese cuisine is its use of ''[[suan cai]]'', a traditional pickled [[Chinese cabbage]]. Another distinct feature that distinguishes Northeastern cuisine from other Chinese cuisines is the serving of more raw vegetables and raw seafood in the coastal areas.\n\n[[Simmering]], [[braising]] and [[saut\u00e9ing]] are ubiquitous cooking techniques used in the Northeast, producing many of the region's signatures dishes.\n\nLike [[Northern and southern China|southern China]], where the [[staple crop]] is [[rice]]. Northeast Chinese also include a large component of [[wheat]] and [[maize]] in their daily diet in the form of noodles, [[steamed bun]] and [[wotou|cornbread]]. Popular dishes include pork and chive [[jiaozi|dumpling]]s, [[suan cai]] [[hot pot]], [[cumin]] and caraway lamb, [[congee]], [[tea egg]]s, ''[[nian doubao]]'' ([[sticky rice]] buns with sweet [[red bean paste]] filling, and unsweetened version with other types of beans also), congee with several types of pickles (mustard root is highly popular), [[sachima]] (traditional Manchu sweet) and cornmeal congee.\n\nDue to its riverine environment, the [[Heilongjiang]] style of Northeastern Chinese cuisine is famed for its fish banquet, specialising in [[anadromous]] fish such as the trout banquet and the sturgeon banquet, and similarly, due to its mountainous environment, the [[Jilin]] style of Northeastern Chinese cuisine is famed for its dishes that use game animals even though only farm-raised animals are allowed for culinary use under the law.

{"title_page": "Mundaka wave", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=May 2011}}\n[[Image:MundakaCoast.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Coast near Mundaka, Biscay]]\nThe '''Mundaka wave''', at [[Mundaka]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], northern [[Spain]], is a [[surfing]] location considered one of the best lefts of the world.\n\n== Surfing ==\n[[Image:Mundaka.JPG|thumb|right|Mundaka]]\n[[Image:PortMundaka.jpg|thumb|right|Mundaka's port]]\n[[Image:Mundaka surf txapelketa.jpg|thumb|right|Mundaka surf championship]]\nHuge swells roll in from the [[Bay of Biscay]] and slam into the rocky coastline of the Basque Country. The estuary at Mundaka has created a perfect sandbar which forms hollow waves that can be watched from the town's harbor wall. Mundaka was formerly one of the sites of the World Championship Tour of Surfing. Some great surfers have marked their legacy on Mundaka such as [[Andy Irons]], [[Taj Burrow]], [[Kelly Slater]], Mark Occilupo and [[Joel Parkinson]].\n\nThe wave of [[Mundaka]] is \u201cperfect\u201d for surfing one of every three days of the year. During the months of [[winter]], the possibility of surfing increases until surpassing 50%. And it is the month of January, with a 62% of surfable days, when the bar of Mundaka displays the best scene for the lovers of this sport.\n\n==History of Billabong Pro Mundaka==\nBillabong Pro Mundaka is one of the most important tests of the ASP World Tour. It is celebrated in Mundaka from the beginning of  October until mid October. In eight years the event has had to be suspended twice. First, in 2001, due to the 9/11 attacks in New York. Second, in 2005 by the hand of the man.\n\n==Disappearance of the wave==\nThe wave of Mundaka is seriously damaged. Its situation is critical although non irreversible. This is what the surfers want to think due to the fact that they have seen how their appraised jewel has not done act of appearance in the last months. Everything began when in 2003, the [[Murueta]] shipyard coat 57 tons of laughs of mundaca, with the aim of making it more passable for the different ships. Consequently, the sea of Mundaka has suffered the disappearance of one of its most wanted waves and in this way, the disappearance of Mundaka, from the professional circuit of surfing.\n\n==Cancellation of the test in 2005 ==\nThe extraction in 2003 of almost 300,000 cubic meters of sand laughs of Urdaibai, caused that the most famous left of Europe  would lose its position in match WCT of the ASP{{clarify|date=October 2015}}. The characteristics of the wave changed as if a disease had seized her. The tube of 400 meters that formed diminished until 40 meters long, starting to disappear. A diving lead the consequence that, lamentably, all saw come: that the ASP suspended the test of 2005. Mundaca, which had received an average of 10,000 visitors with the event, lost its main reclamation and sectors of the region as the guest houses entered into an enormous crisis. Studies of the department of Environment and the University of the Basque Country (UPV) agreed upon indicating that the wave was debilitated by the drainage realised by the [[shipyard]] of [[Murueta]]. The sand was deposited on the beach of Laida and finished changing to the structure of the marine bottom and the flow of the currents. The investigations also kept awake that the own Nature was in charge to forge a similar morphology to which existed before 2003. The force of the sea returned to give to hope to Mundaca and the Billabong Pro.

The estuary at Mundaka has created a perfect sandbar which forms hollow waves that can be watched from the town's harbor wall. Mundaka was formerly one of the sites of the World Championship Tour of Surfing. Some great surfers have marked their legacy on Mundaka such as [[Andy Irons]], [[Taj Burrow]], [[Kelly Slater]], Mark Occilupo and [[Joel Parkinson]].\n\nThe wave of [[Mundaka]] is \u201cperfect\u201d for surfing one of every three days of the year. During the months of [[winter]], the possibility of surfing increases until surpassing 50%. And it is the month of January, with a 62% of surfable days, when the bar of Mundaka displays the best scene for the lovers of this sport.\n\n==History of Billabong Pro Mundaka==\nBillabong Pro Mundaka is one of the most important tests of the ASP World Tour. It is celebrated in Mundaka from the beginning of  October until mid October. In eight years the event has had to be suspended twice. First, in 2001, due to the 9/11 attacks in New York. Second, in 2005 by the hand of the man.\n\n==Disappearance of the wave==\nThe wave of Mundaka is seriously damaged. Its situation is critical although non irreversible. This is what the surfers want to think due to the fact that they have seen how their appraised jewel has not done act of appearance in the last months. Everything began when in 2003, the [[Murueta]] shipyard coat 57 tons of laughs of mundaca, with the aim of making it more passable for the different ships. Consequently, the sea of Mundaka has suffered the disappearance of one of its most wanted waves and in this way, the disappearance of Mundaka, from the professional circuit of surfing.\n\n==Cancellation of the test in 2005 ==\nThe extraction in 2003 of almost 300,000 cubic meters of sand laughs of Urdaibai, caused that the most famous left of Europe  would lose its position in match WCT of the ASP{{clarify|date=October 2015}}. The characteristics of the wave changed as if a disease had seized her. The tube of 400 meters that formed diminished until 40 meters long, starting to disappear. A diving lead the consequence that, lamentably, all saw come: that the ASP suspended the test of 2005. Mundaca, which had received an average of 10,000 visitors with the event, lost its main reclamation and sectors of the region as the guest houses entered into an enormous crisis. Studies of the department of Environment and the University of the Basque Country (UPV) agreed upon indicating that the wave was debilitated by the drainage realised by the [[shipyard]] of [[Murueta]]. The sand was deposited on the beach of Laida and finished changing to the structure of the marine bottom and the flow of the currents. The investigations also kept awake that the own Nature was in charge to forge a similar morphology to which existed before 2003. The force of the sea returned to give to hope to Mundaca and the Billabong Pro. After months of exhaustive study, as much the ASP as the sponsor of the event, [[Billabong]], gave the green light around Mundaca to the calendar of the maximum worldwide surfer competition.\n\n==Last champions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!Champion\n!Nacionality\n|-\n|2009\n|[[Adriano de Souza]]\n|[[Brazil]] \n|-\n|2008\n|[[C.
