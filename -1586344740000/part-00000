It had also once been a chain of restaurants for over 90 years and its name was widely known for that alone. Founded by [[Howard Deering Johnson]], it was the largest restaurant chain in the U.S. throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with more than 1,000 combined company-owned and franchised outlets.\n\nHoward Johnson hotels and motels are now part of [[Wyndham Hotels and Resorts]]. Howard Johnson's restaurants were franchised separately from the hotel brand beginning in 1986, but in the years that followed, severely dwindled in number and all but disappeared by the turn of the century.

Johnson was surprised to find it easy to pay back the money lent to him, after discovering his recently installed [[soda fountain]] had become the busiest part of his drugstore. Eager to ensure that his store would remain successful, Johnson decided to devise a new ice cream recipe. Some sources say the recipe was based on his mother's homemade ice creams and desserts,<ref>{{cite book|last=Sugars |first=Bradley J. |title=Successful Franchising: Expert Advice on Buying, Selling and Creating Winning Franchises |publisher= McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2005 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEG72jRjj9gC&pg=PA2&dq=Howard+Johnson%27s+ice+cream+recepie |isbn=978-0-07-146671-4 |accessdate=18 September 2012 }}</ref><ref name=culture>{{cite book|last=Hinckley |first=Jim |last2=Robinson |first2=Jon G. |title=The Big Book of Car Culture: The Armchair Guide to Automotive Americana |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI |year=2005 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NorSiqCb9mMC&pg=PA24&dq=Howard+Johnson%27s+ice+cream+recepie |isbn=978-0-7603-1965-9 |accessdate=18 September 2012 }}</ref> while others say that it was from a local [[German American|German]] [[immigrant]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyett |first= Joseph H. |last2=Boyett |first2= Jimmie T. |title=The Guru Guide to Entrepreneurship: A Concise Guide to the Best Ideas from the World's Top Entrepreneurs |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2002 |page=275 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zBIR9flC9wC&pg=PA275&dq=Howard+Johnson%27s+ice+cream+recepie |isbn=978-0-471-43686-7 |accessdate=18 September 2012 }}</ref> who either sold or gave Johnson the ice cream recipe. The new recipe made the ice cream more flavorful due to increased [[butterfat]] content. Eventually Johnson created 28 flavors of ice cream. He is quoted as saying, \"I thought I had every flavor in the world. That '28' (flavors of ice cream) became my [[trademark]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=The Nation's Business |title=Lessons of Leadership: 21 Top Executives Speak Out on Creating, Developing, and Managing Success |publisher=Doubleday|year=1968 |page=48 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the summers of the late 1920s, Johnson opened concession stands on beachfront property along the coast of Massachusetts. The stands sold soft drinks, hot dogs, and ice cream. Each stand was successful. With his success becoming more noticeable every year, Johnson convinced local bankers to lend him funds to operate a sit-down restaurant. Negotiations were made and, toward the end of the decade, the first Howard Johnson's restaurant opened in Quincy. It featured fried [[clam]]s, baked beans, chicken pot pies, frankfurters, ice cream, and soft drinks.\n\nThe first Howard Johnson's restaurant received a tremendous boost in 1929, owing to an unusual set of circumstances: The mayor of nearby [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Malcolm Nichols]], [[Banned in Boston|banned]] the production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s play, ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' in Boston. Rather than fight the mayor, the [[Theatre Guild]] moved the production to Quincy. The five-hour play was presented in two parts with a dinner break. The first Howard Johnson's restaurant was near the theater, and hundreds of influential Bostonians flocked to the restaurant. Through word of mouth, more Americans became familiar with the Howard Johnson's company.<ref>{{cite journal|title=28 Flavors Head West|work=Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71|date=6 September 1948|publisher=Time Inc|pages=71|issn=0024-3019}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion in the 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:howardjohnsonwwII.png|thumb|right|Corporate logo of the Howard Johnson's company, circa World War II, showing a depiction of an orange-roofed restaurant, characteristic typeface, and \"Simple Simon and the Pieman\" logo.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnson Logo 1930s-1985.svg|thumb|right|Howard Johnson's second logo used throughout the Howard Johnson Company's existence.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnson's advertisement in National Air and Space museum.jpg|thumb|right|Howard Johnson entered the airline catering market segment.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnson Chestnut Hill MA Dairy Bar 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Most Howard Johnson's restaurants featured a food counter known as a \"Dairy Bar\" on one wing of the building, such as this Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts unit photographed in 1959.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnsons restaurant 1999 PA entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Howard Johnsons restaurant entrance with emblematic weathervane.]]\n\nJohnson wanted to expand his company, but the [[stock market crash of 1929]] prevented this. After waiting a few years and maintaining his business, Johnson persuaded an acquaintance in 1932 to open a second Howard Johnson's restaurant in [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]. The second restaurant was franchised and not company-owned. This was one of America's first franchising agreements.\n\nBy the end of 1936 there were 39 more franchised restaurants, creating a total of 41 Howard Johnson's restaurants. By 1939, there were 107 Howard Johnson's restaurants along American East Coast highways, generating revenues of $10.5 million. In less than 14 years, Johnson directed a franchise network of over 10,000 employees with 170 restaurants, many serving 1.5 million people a year.\n\nThe unique icons of orange roofs, cupolas, and weather vanes on Howard Johnson properties helped patrons identify the chain's restaurants and motels. The restaurant's trademark [[Simple Simon (nursery rhyme)|Simple Simon and the Pieman]] logo was created by artist John Alcott in the 1930s.<ref name=culture/>\n\nThere were 200 Howard Johnson's restaurants when America entered [[World War II]].\n\nBy 1944, only 12 Howard Johnson's restaurants remained in business. The effects of war rationing had crippled the company. Johnson managed to maintain his business by serving [[commissary]] food to war workers and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] recruits. When the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] (1940), and later the [[Ohio Turnpike]], [[New Jersey Turnpike]] and [[Connecticut Turnpike]] were built, Johnson bid for and won exclusive rights to serve drivers at service station turnoffs through the turnpike systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/28/nyregion/survey-to-study-turnpike-dining.html|title=Survey to Study Turnpike Dining|first=Robert E.|last=Tomasson|date=28 August 1983|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the process of recovering from these losses, in 1947 the Howard Johnson's company began construction of 200 new restaurants throughout the American [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Midwest]]. By 1951, the sales of the Howard Johnson's company totaled $115 million.\n\n=== Entering the hotel business ===\n[[File:Howard Johnson's motel historic lamplighter sign NY.jpg|thumb|right|HoJo motor lodges used a lamplighter character lighting a lamppost with the Simple Simon character pointing to the light.]]\n\nBy 1954, there were 400 Howard Johnson's restaurants in 32 states, about 10% of which were extremely profitable company-owned turnpike restaurants; the rest were franchises. This was one of the first nationwide restaurant chains.\n\nWhile many places sold \"fried clams\", they were whole, which was not universally accepted by the American dining public. Howard Johnson popularized [[Thomas N. Soffron|Soffron Brothers Clam Company]]'s fried clam strips, the \"foot\" of hard-shelled sea clams. They became popular to eat in this fashion throughout the country.<ref>{{cite news |title=Thomas Soffron, 96, Creator of Clam Strips |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/business/thomas-soffron-96-creator-of-clam-strips.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 February 2004 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=cnn>{{cite news |first= Nina|last= Sovich |title=Clam King |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2004/05/01/370018/index.htm |quote=Like many famous Greeks, and not a few New Englanders, Thomas Soffron found his fortune at sea. An immigrant from [[Kalamata|Calamata]], Greece, Soffron invented clam strips: battered and fried slices from the \"foot\" of hard-shelled sea clams (which held up better when frozen than did the coastal variety). For years Soffron Brothers Clam Co., based in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], served as the exclusive supplier of clam strips to the Howard Johnson's restaurant chain, which sold the whole country on this Down East delicacy. Few HoJos are left, but the clam strip's enduring popularity stands as its creator's legacy. Soffron died on February 21, 2004 at age 96 in Ipswich, his hometown. |publisher=CNN |date=1 May 2004 |access-date=18 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the company opened the first Howard Johnson's motor lodge in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The company employed architects Rufus Nims and Karl Koch to oversee the design of the rooms and gate lodge. Nims had previously worked with the company, designing restaurants. The restaurant's trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman was now joined by a [[Lamplighter|lamplighter]] character in the firm's marketing of its motels. According to cultural historians, the chain became synonymous with travel among American motorists and vacationers in part because of Johnson's ubiquitous outdoor advertising displays.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rubenstein Library / ROAD / 1920-1929 (Outdoor Advertising Timeline: 1920-1929) |publisher=Duke Libraries |url =http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingdb/road/timeline/1920-1929/ |access-date=18 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Howard Deering Johnson, who had founded and managed the company since 1925, turned control over to his son, then 26-year-old Howard Brennan Johnson. The elder Johnson observed his son's running of the company until his death in 1972 at the age of 75.\n\nHoward Johnson's Company went public in 1961; there were 605 restaurants, 265 company-owned and 340 franchised, as well as 88 franchised Howard Johnson's motor lodges in 32 states and [[The Bahamas]].\n\nIn 1961, Johnson hired New York chefs [[Pierre Franey]] and [[Jacques P\u00e9pin]] to oversee food development at the company's main commissary in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]]. Franey and P\u00e9pin developed recipes for the company's signature dishes that could be [[Flash freezing|flash frozen]] and delivered across the country, guaranteeing a consistent product.\n\n=== Segregation and desegregation ===\nWhile the landmark ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1954 struck down segregation in public schools, the segregation and maintenance of whites-only public facilities continued in other domains, including the Howard Johnson chain. Segregation in Howard Johnson's restaurants provoked an international crisis in 1957, when a Howard Johnson eatery in [[Dover, Delaware]] refused service to [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah]], the finance minister of [[Ghana]], prompting a public apology from President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/this-day-in-politics-098073 |title=Ghana finance minister denied service, Oct. 10, 1957}}</ref> The [[Congress of Racial Equality]], or CORE, was instrumental in organizing protests and sit-ins at Howard Johnson locations in multiple states.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1962/10/6/core-protests-against-howard-johnson-chain/ |title=CORE Protests Against Howard Johnson Chain}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Durham, North Carolina]], became notable as a focus for action against segregated restaurants and hotels, including Howard Johnson's. On 12 August 1962, attorney and civil rights activist [[Floyd McKissick]] initiated the first of multiple rallies and demonstrations against segregated establishments in Durham, including the Howard Johnson's restaurant on Chapel Hill Boulevard,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://durhamcountylibrary.org/exhibits/dcrhp/howardjohnson.php |title=Durham Civil Rights Heritage Project : Howard Johnson's Restaurant - 1962}}</ref> culminating in multiple protests on 18\u201320 May 1963 resulting in mass arrests as well as an eventual rapprochement with the city government. Future senator and presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]], while a student at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1962, helped organize picketing of a Howard Johnson's location in [[Cicero, Illinois]], during his time as a student activist for CORE.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/02/bernie-sanders-core-university-chicago |title=Here's What Bernie Sanders Actually Did in the Civil Rights Movement}}</ref>\n\n=== New chains and a changing public ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nIn the 1930s, H.D. Johnson bought the '''Wayland Red Coach Grill''' and used it as the model for a new concept, a more upscale steakhouse restaurant chain called '''Red Coach Grills'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highwayhost.org/Massachusetts/RedCoach/redcoach2.html|title=Red Coach Grills|website=www.highwayhost.org}}</ref>\nWhile they had some success, they were not sufficiently profitable. Eventually the last 15 Red Coach Grills were sold in 1983 to a company executive who closed them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thayerventures.com/burton-skip-sack|title=Burton \"Skip\" Sack - Thayer Ventures|website=www.thayerventures.com}}</ref>\nIn 1969, Johnson again tried a new restaurant concept, '''[[Ground Round]]'''. It was successful. Though not a Howard Johnson's restaurant, the Ground Round chain was company-owned and -franchised, thus increasing the Howard Johnson's company profit.\n\nBy 1975, the Howard Johnson's company had more than 1,000 restaurants and more than 500 motor lodges in 42 states and Canada. The company reached its peak that year, but the late 1970s marked the beginning of the end for the Howard Johnson's company. Because of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargo of 1974]], the Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges, which received 85% of revenue from travelers, lost profits when Americans could not afford long trips or frequent vacations. Also, the company model of serving pre-made food with high-quality ingredients in traditional dining rooms was costly when compared to the innovations introduced by fast food outlets like [[McDonald's]], which designed its products and restaurants to appeal to families with younger children. Around this time, the chain introduced \u201cHojo Cola\u201d and other private-label sodas, which disappointed some customers who preferred familiar products such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi.\n\nThe company suffered from two infamous incidents at a property in the [[New Orleans]] [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]] within 18 months of one another. The first was a July 1971 fire, set by two irate guests who had been ejected from the hotel, which killed six people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nfpa.typepad.com/nfpablog/2011/07/today-in-fire-history-hotel-fire-kills-six.html |title=Today in fire history: hotel fire kills six |work=National Fire Protection Association Blog |last=Evarts |first=Ben |date=23 July 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206203641/http://nfpa.typepad.com/nfpablog/2011/07/today-in-fire-history-hotel-fire-kills-six.html |archive-date=6 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The second, in January 1973, was a harrowing day-long siege. Former [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Mark Essex]] used the hotel's roof as a sniper's perch, killing three police officers, the hotel's general manager and assistant general manager, and a couple from [[Virginia]], who were on a belated honeymoon. He also wounded policemen, firemen and civilians. Then, in [[Jericho, New York]], on November 8, 1974, singer-actress [[Connie Francis]] was raped at the Jericho Turnpike Howard Johnson's Lodge. She sued the motel chain for their lapse in security and won a judgment of $2.5 million, one of the largest such judgments at that time, leading to a reform in hotel security. Her rapist was never found.\n\nH. B. Johnson attempted to streamline company operations and cut costs, such as serving cheaper food and having fewer employees. This strategy was unsuccessful, because patrons compared this new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges unfavorably to the services they had previously come to know. In a further effort to make the company more successful and profitable, Johnson created other concepts, such as HoJos Campgrounds and 3 Penny Inns for lodging, as well as Deli Baker Ice Cream Maker, and Chatt's for restaurants. All of these concepts failed, furthering the company's demise.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Howard Johnson's Candy Factory and Executive Offices in [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston]] were purchased and renovated by the [[Eastern Nazarene College]] to form the Adams Executive Center.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cecil R. Paul Center for Business |publisher=Eastern Nazarene College |url= http://www1.enc.edu/About-ENC/Campus-Tour/Cecil-R--Paul-Center-for-Business/ |accessdate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Changes in ownership ===\nIn 1979, Johnson accepted an acquisition  bid of more than $630 million from [[Imperial Brands|Imperial Group PLC]] of London, England. Imperial obtained 1,040 restaurants (75% company owned/25% franchised) and 520 motor lodges (75% franchised/25% company owned). In 1981 Imperial recruited G. Michael Hostage, then CEO of Continental Baking Company and formerly executive vice president of Marriott Corporation, to replace Johnson as CEO. After four years, despite progress in a turnaround, Imperial reversed course and sold the company. Having declined to entertain Hostage's proposal to lead a leveraged buyout, Imperial employed Goldman Sachs who, with Hostage's assistance, sold the company to Marriott in 1986. In a contemporaneous transaction, Marriott sold the motor lodge business and the Howard Johnson trademark to Prime Motor Inns, a New Jersey company.\n\n[[File:Howard Johnson's on Afton Mountain, 2003 closeup.jpg|thumb|Howard Johnson's restaurant painted in 1970s \"environmental\" color scheme]]\n[[File:Bay city hojo.jpg|thumb|A former Howard Johnson's restaurant in [[Bay City, Michigan]], which closed in 2005. Note the adjacent former motor lodge, now occupied by [[Econo Lodge]].]]\n\nMarriott was interested in the company-owned restaurants for the real estate. Marriott already owned [[Big Boy Restaurants]] and [[Roy Rogers Restaurants]]. In 1982, it acquired [[Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company|Host International]], which had operated a number of highway rest stops. Many of the established Howard Johnson sites were in prime highway locations which could be profitably converted to Big Boy or various [[fast food]] banners. As Marriott quickly demolished the company owned restaurants or converted them to the [[Bob's Big Boy]] restaurant chain,<ref name=\"lat-1985sep25\">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-25/business/fi-19966_1_howard-johnson-chain |title=Marriott and Partner Buy Howard Johnson |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 25, 1985 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt-1985sep25\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/25/business/howard-johnson-acquired.html?pagewanted=all |title=Howard Johnson Acquired |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 25, 1985 |first=Lee A. |last=Daniels}}</ref> the number of Howard Johnson's restaurants remaining circa 1985 was sharply reduced. Only the franchised restaurants remained untouched.\n\nMarriott left all company-owned and franchised motor lodges untouched, as the deal called for them to be sold a year later (in 1986) to Prime Motors Inns, an existing franchisee with 63 motels.<ref name=\"lat-1985sep25\" />\n\n== Divestment of motor lodges ==\nPrime Motors Inns continued to preserve the lodges, just as Marriott had, until weak hotel and real estate markets caused it to sell off its assets and cease operations in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/15/business/company-news-prime-motor-inns-in-trouble.html |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Company News; Prime Motor Inns in Trouble |date=15 September 1990 |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> Those involved with the company owned and franchised motor lodges banded together and formed the Howard Johnson Acquisition Corporation. They successfully obtained all the rights to operate and maintain the company owned and franchised lodges. With these rights maintained, they changed their name to \"Howard Johnson International Incorporated,\" which became a subsidiary of \"Hospitality Franchise Systems Incorporated,\" which eventually merged with other companies to form [[Cendant]]. In 2006, Cendant split itself into [[Wyndham Worldwide]] and three other companies.\n\nWyndham operated the Howard Johnson brand under many \"tiers\" based on price, level of amenities, and services offered. Under Cendant/Wyndham, the chain became a parking place for franchise conversions, which were existing independent motels which had been renovated and added to the chain in order to provide them with access to a nationally recognised name and central reservation infrastructure. As these properties were not originally constructed as Howard Johnson sites, they lacked the distinctive architecture and some had no restaurant at all.\n[[File:Howard_Johnson_Renew.svg|thumb|right|Howard Johnson's proposed revitalization project became known as the Renew project and commenced in 2015.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://lodgingmagazine.com/howard-johnson-wildwood-boardwalk-pays-homage-to-history/ |title=Howard Johnson Wildwood Boardwalk Pays Homage to History |date=31 May 2017 |publisher=Lodging Magazine |accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref>]]\nHoward Johnson Express Inns, Howard Johnson Inns, Howard Johnson Hotels, and Howard Johnson Plaza Hotels range from limited-service motels to full-service properties with on-site concierges and business centers. Howard Johnson began offering a \"Rise 'N' Dine\" continental breakfast at some economy limited service locations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hojo.com/HowardJohnson/control/tiers?intcmp=about_us_subpage_tiers|publisher=Howard Johnson International |title=Howard Johnson Tiers |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref> The chain abolished the multiple price tiers by 2015.\n\n== Divestment of restaurant brand ==\nWhile the Howard Johnson's company-owned and franchised motor lodges have stood the test of time since being sold by the Howard Johnson's Company in 1979, the restaurants have not. Because Marriott eliminated all the company-owned restaurants, the owners of the franchised restaurants feared elimination and banded together in 1986 and created \"Franchise Associates Incorporated\" or (FAI). In 1986, Marriott gave FAI the rights to operate and maintain Howard Johnson's restaurants. When [[Cendant]] acquired the Howard Johnson's motor lodges, they offered to work together with FAI to ensure the expansion of the restaurant chain.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs early as 1987, FAI chairman George Carter acknowledged that \"We have the concept, but it desperately needs to be modernized, internally and externally. Howard Johnson was allowed to become tired and stale. We must get rid of that plastic image... Anything can be salvageable if a great deal of time and money and effort is put in it. And Howard Johnson needs all those same things.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-04-30/business/0120410149_1_howard-johnson-restaurants-carter-fai |title=Restaurant Chain Fights Stale Image Operators Hope To End Howard Johnson Slump |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=30 April 1987 |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> Attempts were made to revamp 25% of the menu and create new signage, but these efforts proved insufficient as the long-neglected chain continued to lose ground to mass-market fast food operations. By March 1995, FAI's official restaurant directory listed 84 remaining restaurants in the US and Canada.\n\nWhile the Howard Johnson's restaurant chain was preserved, FAI did not have enough money to expand to new locations or revamp the brand. With the exception of one Howard Johnson's ice cream parlor in [[Puerto Rico]], FAI never opened a new restaurant or expanded the chain. An existing restaurant in [[Canton, Massachusetts]] was remodeled as a [[prototype]] for a new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants, but the concept failed, and after less than a decade of operation, the prototype restaurant closed in 2000.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===2000s===\nBy 2005, there were fewer than eight surviving restaurants. A combination of no vision, no reinvestment of capital, aging restaurants, a stale menu, lack of marketing or new ideas, and competition from other chains had taken their toll; restaurants were closing their doors.<ref>{{cite news\n| author                = Clarke Canfield\n| date                  = May 14, 2005\n| year                  = \n| title                 = HoJo restaurants fading fast\n|trans-title=| url                   = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7864772/ns/business/t/hojo-restaurants-fading-fast/ <!--\n| url1                  = http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/may/16/howard-johnsons-restaurant-chain-slowly-melting-aw/\n| url2                  = http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050514/news_1b14hojo.html\n| url3                  = http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2005/05/16/in_chains_twilight_a_few_hojos_hang_on/ -->\n| department            = \n| newspaper             = \n| type                  = \n| series                = \n| language              = \n| volume                = \n| issue                 = \n| others                = \n| edition               = \n| location              = Bangor, Maine\n| publisher             = \n| publication-date      = \n| agency                = Associated Press\n| page                  = \n| pages                 = \n| accessdate            = \n| via                   = \n| registration          = \n| subscription          = \n| layurl                = \n| laysource             = \n| laydate               = \n| quote                 = \n| separator             = \n| postscript            = \n| ref                   = \n}}</ref> FAI ceased operations in 2005, the same year that the [[Springfield, Vermont]], location and the last [[New York City]] restaurant in the chain closed.\n\nCendant acquired the rights to operate and maintain the remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants.

That '28' (flavors of ice cream) became my [[trademark]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=The Nation's Business |title=Lessons of Leadership: 21 Top Executives Speak Out on Creating, Developing, and Managing Success |publisher=Doubleday|year=1968 |page=48 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the summers of the late 1920s, Johnson opened concession stands on beachfront property along the coast of Massachusetts. The stands sold soft drinks, hot dogs, and ice cream. Each stand was successful. With his success becoming more noticeable every year, Johnson convinced local bankers to lend him funds to operate a sit-down restaurant. Negotiations were made and, toward the end of the decade, the first Howard Johnson's restaurant opened in Quincy. It featured fried [[clam]]s, baked beans, chicken pot pies, frankfurters, ice cream, and soft drinks.\n\nThe first Howard Johnson's restaurant received a tremendous boost in 1929, owing to an unusual set of circumstances: The mayor of nearby [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Malcolm Nichols]], [[Banned in Boston|banned]] the production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s play, ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' in Boston. Rather than fight the mayor, the [[Theatre Guild]] moved the production to Quincy. The five-hour play was presented in two parts with a dinner break. The first Howard Johnson's restaurant was near the theater, and hundreds of influential Bostonians flocked to the restaurant. Through word of mouth, more Americans became familiar with the Howard Johnson's company.<ref>{{cite journal|title=28 Flavors Head West|work=Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71|date=6 September 1948|publisher=Time Inc|pages=71|issn=0024-3019}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion in the 1930s and 1940s ===\n[[File:howardjohnsonwwII.png|thumb|right|Corporate logo of the Howard Johnson's company, circa World War II, showing a depiction of an orange-roofed restaurant, characteristic typeface, and \"Simple Simon and the Pieman\" logo.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnson Logo 1930s-1985.svg|thumb|right|Howard Johnson's second logo used throughout the Howard Johnson Company's existence.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnson's advertisement in National Air and Space museum.jpg|thumb|right|Howard Johnson entered the airline catering market segment.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnson Chestnut Hill MA Dairy Bar 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Most Howard Johnson's restaurants featured a food counter known as a \"Dairy Bar\" on one wing of the building, such as this Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts unit photographed in 1959.]]\n[[File:Howard Johnsons restaurant 1999 PA entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Howard Johnsons restaurant entrance with emblematic weathervane.]]\n\nJohnson wanted to expand his company, but the [[stock market crash of 1929]] prevented this. After waiting a few years and maintaining his business, Johnson persuaded an acquaintance in 1932 to open a second Howard Johnson's restaurant in [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]. The second restaurant was franchised and not company-owned. This was one of America's first franchising agreements.\n\nBy the end of 1936 there were 39 more franchised restaurants, creating a total of 41 Howard Johnson's restaurants. By 1939, there were 107 Howard Johnson's restaurants along American East Coast highways, generating revenues of $10.5 million. In less than 14 years, Johnson directed a franchise network of over 10,000 employees with 170 restaurants, many serving 1.5 million people a year.\n\nThe unique icons of orange roofs, cupolas, and weather vanes on Howard Johnson properties helped patrons identify the chain's restaurants and motels. The restaurant's trademark [[Simple Simon (nursery rhyme)|Simple Simon and the Pieman]] logo was created by artist John Alcott in the 1930s.<ref name=culture/>\n\nThere were 200 Howard Johnson's restaurants when America entered [[World War II]].\n\nBy 1944, only 12 Howard Johnson's restaurants remained in business. The effects of war rationing had crippled the company. Johnson managed to maintain his business by serving [[commissary]] food to war workers and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] recruits. When the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] (1940), and later the [[Ohio Turnpike]], [[New Jersey Turnpike]] and [[Connecticut Turnpike]] were built, Johnson bid for and won exclusive rights to serve drivers at service station turnoffs through the turnpike systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/28/nyregion/survey-to-study-turnpike-dining.html|title=Survey to Study Turnpike Dining|first=Robert E.|last=Tomasson|date=28 August 1983|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the process of recovering from these losses, in 1947 the Howard Johnson's company began construction of 200 new restaurants throughout the American [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Midwest]]. By 1951, the sales of the Howard Johnson's company totaled $115 million.\n\n=== Entering the hotel business ===\n[[File:Howard Johnson's motel historic lamplighter sign NY.jpg|thumb|right|HoJo motor lodges used a lamplighter character lighting a lamppost with the Simple Simon character pointing to the light.]]\n\nBy 1954, there were 400 Howard Johnson's restaurants in 32 states, about 10% of which were extremely profitable company-owned turnpike restaurants; the rest were franchises. This was one of the first nationwide restaurant chains.\n\nWhile many places sold \"fried clams\", they were whole, which was not universally accepted by the American dining public. Howard Johnson popularized [[Thomas N. Soffron|Soffron Brothers Clam Company]]'s fried clam strips, the \"foot\" of hard-shelled sea clams. They became popular to eat in this fashion throughout the country.<ref>{{cite news |title=Thomas Soffron, 96, Creator of Clam Strips |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/business/thomas-soffron-96-creator-of-clam-strips.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 February 2004 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=cnn>{{cite news |first= Nina|last= Sovich |title=Clam King |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2004/05/01/370018/index.htm |quote=Like many famous Greeks, and not a few New Englanders, Thomas Soffron found his fortune at sea. An immigrant from [[Kalamata|Calamata]], Greece, Soffron invented clam strips: battered and fried slices from the \"foot\" of hard-shelled sea clams (which held up better when frozen than did the coastal variety). For years Soffron Brothers Clam Co., based in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], served as the exclusive supplier of clam strips to the Howard Johnson's restaurant chain, which sold the whole country on this Down East delicacy. Few HoJos are left, but the clam strip's enduring popularity stands as its creator's legacy. Soffron died on February 21, 2004 at age 96 in Ipswich, his hometown. |publisher=CNN |date=1 May 2004 |access-date=18 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the company opened the first Howard Johnson's motor lodge in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The company employed architects Rufus Nims and Karl Koch to oversee the design of the rooms and gate lodge. Nims had previously worked with the company, designing restaurants. The restaurant's trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman was now joined by a [[Lamplighter|lamplighter]] character in the firm's marketing of its motels. According to cultural historians, the chain became synonymous with travel among American motorists and vacationers in part because of Johnson's ubiquitous outdoor advertising displays.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rubenstein Library / ROAD / 1920-1929 (Outdoor Advertising Timeline: 1920-1929) |publisher=Duke Libraries |url =http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingdb/road/timeline/1920-1929/ |access-date=18 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Howard Deering Johnson, who had founded and managed the company since 1925, turned control over to his son, then 26-year-old Howard Brennan Johnson. The elder Johnson observed his son's running of the company until his death in 1972 at the age of 75.\n\nHoward Johnson's Company went public in 1961; there were 605 restaurants, 265 company-owned and 340 franchised, as well as 88 franchised Howard Johnson's motor lodges in 32 states and [[The Bahamas]].\n\nIn 1961, Johnson hired New York chefs [[Pierre Franey]] and [[Jacques P\u00e9pin]] to oversee food development at the company's main commissary in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]]. Franey and P\u00e9pin developed recipes for the company's signature dishes that could be [[Flash freezing|flash frozen]] and delivered across the country, guaranteeing a consistent product.\n\n=== Segregation and desegregation ===\nWhile the landmark ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1954 struck down segregation in public schools, the segregation and maintenance of whites-only public facilities continued in other domains, including the Howard Johnson chain. Segregation in Howard Johnson's restaurants provoked an international crisis in 1957, when a Howard Johnson eatery in [[Dover, Delaware]] refused service to [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah]], the finance minister of [[Ghana]], prompting a public apology from President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/this-day-in-politics-098073 |title=Ghana finance minister denied service, Oct. 10, 1957}}</ref> The [[Congress of Racial Equality]], or CORE, was instrumental in organizing protests and sit-ins at Howard Johnson locations in multiple states.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1962/10/6/core-protests-against-howard-johnson-chain/ |title=CORE Protests Against Howard Johnson Chain}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Durham, North Carolina]], became notable as a focus for action against segregated restaurants and hotels, including Howard Johnson's. On 12 August 1962, attorney and civil rights activist [[Floyd McKissick]] initiated the first of multiple rallies and demonstrations against segregated establishments in Durham, including the Howard Johnson's restaurant on Chapel Hill Boulevard,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://durhamcountylibrary.org/exhibits/dcrhp/howardjohnson.php |title=Durham Civil Rights Heritage Project : Howard Johnson's Restaurant - 1962}}</ref> culminating in multiple protests on 18\u201320 May 1963 resulting in mass arrests as well as an eventual rapprochement with the city government. Future senator and presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]], while a student at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1962, helped organize picketing of a Howard Johnson's location in [[Cicero, Illinois]], during his time as a student activist for CORE.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/02/bernie-sanders-core-university-chicago |title=Here's What Bernie Sanders Actually Did in the Civil Rights Movement}}</ref>\n\n=== New chains and a changing public ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nIn the 1930s, H.D. Johnson bought the '''Wayland Red Coach Grill''' and used it as the model for a new concept, a more upscale steakhouse restaurant chain called '''Red Coach Grills'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highwayhost.org/Massachusetts/RedCoach/redcoach2.html|title=Red Coach Grills|website=www.highwayhost.org}}</ref>\nWhile they had some success, they were not sufficiently profitable. Eventually the last 15 Red Coach Grills were sold in 1983 to a company executive who closed them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thayerventures.com/burton-skip-sack|title=Burton \"Skip\" Sack - Thayer Ventures|website=www.thayerventures.com}}</ref>\nIn 1969, Johnson again tried a new restaurant concept, '''[[Ground Round]]'''. It was successful. Though not a Howard Johnson's restaurant, the Ground Round chain was company-owned and -franchised, thus increasing the Howard Johnson's company profit.\n\nBy 1975, the Howard Johnson's company had more than 1,000 restaurants and more than 500 motor lodges in 42 states and Canada. The company reached its peak that year, but the late 1970s marked the beginning of the end for the Howard Johnson's company. Because of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargo of 1974]], the Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges, which received 85% of revenue from travelers, lost profits when Americans could not afford long trips or frequent vacations. Also, the company model of serving pre-made food with high-quality ingredients in traditional dining rooms was costly when compared to the innovations introduced by fast food outlets like [[McDonald's]], which designed its products and restaurants to appeal to families with younger children. Around this time, the chain introduced \u201cHojo Cola\u201d and other private-label sodas, which disappointed some customers who preferred familiar products such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi.\n\nThe company suffered from two infamous incidents at a property in the [[New Orleans]] [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]] within 18 months of one another. The first was a July 1971 fire, set by two irate guests who had been ejected from the hotel, which killed six people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nfpa.typepad.com/nfpablog/2011/07/today-in-fire-history-hotel-fire-kills-six.html |title=Today in fire history: hotel fire kills six |work=National Fire Protection Association Blog |last=Evarts |first=Ben |date=23 July 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206203641/http://nfpa.typepad.com/nfpablog/2011/07/today-in-fire-history-hotel-fire-kills-six.html |archive-date=6 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The second, in January 1973, was a harrowing day-long siege. Former [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Mark Essex]] used the hotel's roof as a sniper's perch, killing three police officers, the hotel's general manager and assistant general manager, and a couple from [[Virginia]], who were on a belated honeymoon. He also wounded policemen, firemen and civilians. Then, in [[Jericho, New York]], on November 8, 1974, singer-actress [[Connie Francis]] was raped at the Jericho Turnpike Howard Johnson's Lodge. She sued the motel chain for their lapse in security and won a judgment of $2.5 million, one of the largest such judgments at that time, leading to a reform in hotel security. Her rapist was never found.\n\nH. B. Johnson attempted to streamline company operations and cut costs, such as serving cheaper food and having fewer employees. This strategy was unsuccessful, because patrons compared this new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges unfavorably to the services they had previously come to know. In a further effort to make the company more successful and profitable, Johnson created other concepts, such as HoJos Campgrounds and 3 Penny Inns for lodging, as well as Deli Baker Ice Cream Maker, and Chatt's for restaurants. All of these concepts failed, furthering the company's demise.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Howard Johnson's Candy Factory and Executive Offices in [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston]] were purchased and renovated by the [[Eastern Nazarene College]] to form the Adams Executive Center.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cecil R. Paul Center for Business |publisher=Eastern Nazarene College |url= http://www1.enc.edu/About-ENC/Campus-Tour/Cecil-R--Paul-Center-for-Business/ |accessdate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Changes in ownership ===\nIn 1979, Johnson accepted an acquisition  bid of more than $630 million from [[Imperial Brands|Imperial Group PLC]] of London, England. Imperial obtained 1,040 restaurants (75% company owned/25% franchised) and 520 motor lodges (75% franchised/25% company owned). In 1981 Imperial recruited G. Michael Hostage, then CEO of Continental Baking Company and formerly executive vice president of Marriott Corporation, to replace Johnson as CEO. After four years, despite progress in a turnaround, Imperial reversed course and sold the company. Having declined to entertain Hostage's proposal to lead a leveraged buyout, Imperial employed Goldman Sachs who, with Hostage's assistance, sold the company to Marriott in 1986. In a contemporaneous transaction, Marriott sold the motor lodge business and the Howard Johnson trademark to Prime Motor Inns, a New Jersey company.\n\n[[File:Howard Johnson's on Afton Mountain, 2003 closeup.jpg|thumb|Howard Johnson's restaurant painted in 1970s \"environmental\" color scheme]]\n[[File:Bay city hojo.jpg|thumb|A former Howard Johnson's restaurant in [[Bay City, Michigan]], which closed in 2005. Note the adjacent former motor lodge, now occupied by [[Econo Lodge]].]]\n\nMarriott was interested in the company-owned restaurants for the real estate. Marriott already owned [[Big Boy Restaurants]] and [[Roy Rogers Restaurants]]. In 1982, it acquired [[Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company|Host International]], which had operated a number of highway rest stops. Many of the established Howard Johnson sites were in prime highway locations which could be profitably converted to Big Boy or various [[fast food]] banners. As Marriott quickly demolished the company owned restaurants or converted them to the [[Bob's Big Boy]] restaurant chain,<ref name=\"lat-1985sep25\">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-25/business/fi-19966_1_howard-johnson-chain |title=Marriott and Partner Buy Howard Johnson |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 25, 1985 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt-1985sep25\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/25/business/howard-johnson-acquired.html?pagewanted=all |title=Howard Johnson Acquired |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 25, 1985 |first=Lee A. |last=Daniels}}</ref> the number of Howard Johnson's restaurants remaining circa 1985 was sharply reduced. Only the franchised restaurants remained untouched.\n\nMarriott left all company-owned and franchised motor lodges untouched, as the deal called for them to be sold a year later (in 1986) to Prime Motors Inns, an existing franchisee with 63 motels.<ref name=\"lat-1985sep25\" />\n\n== Divestment of motor lodges ==\nPrime Motors Inns continued to preserve the lodges, just as Marriott had, until weak hotel and real estate markets caused it to sell off its assets and cease operations in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/15/business/company-news-prime-motor-inns-in-trouble.html |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Company News; Prime Motor Inns in Trouble |date=15 September 1990 |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> Those involved with the company owned and franchised motor lodges banded together and formed the Howard Johnson Acquisition Corporation. They successfully obtained all the rights to operate and maintain the company owned and franchised lodges. With these rights maintained, they changed their name to \"Howard Johnson International Incorporated,\" which became a subsidiary of \"Hospitality Franchise Systems Incorporated,\" which eventually merged with other companies to form [[Cendant]]. In 2006, Cendant split itself into [[Wyndham Worldwide]] and three other companies.\n\nWyndham operated the Howard Johnson brand under many \"tiers\" based on price, level of amenities, and services offered. Under Cendant/Wyndham, the chain became a parking place for franchise conversions, which were existing independent motels which had been renovated and added to the chain in order to provide them with access to a nationally recognised name and central reservation infrastructure. As these properties were not originally constructed as Howard Johnson sites, they lacked the distinctive architecture and some had no restaurant at all.\n[[File:Howard_Johnson_Renew.svg|thumb|right|Howard Johnson's proposed revitalization project became known as the Renew project and commenced in 2015.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://lodgingmagazine.com/howard-johnson-wildwood-boardwalk-pays-homage-to-history/ |title=Howard Johnson Wildwood Boardwalk Pays Homage to History |date=31 May 2017 |publisher=Lodging Magazine |accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref>]]\nHoward Johnson Express Inns, Howard Johnson Inns, Howard Johnson Hotels, and Howard Johnson Plaza Hotels range from limited-service motels to full-service properties with on-site concierges and business centers. Howard Johnson began offering a \"Rise 'N' Dine\" continental breakfast at some economy limited service locations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hojo.com/HowardJohnson/control/tiers?intcmp=about_us_subpage_tiers|publisher=Howard Johnson International |title=Howard Johnson Tiers |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref> The chain abolished the multiple price tiers by 2015.\n\n== Divestment of restaurant brand ==\nWhile the Howard Johnson's company-owned and franchised motor lodges have stood the test of time since being sold by the Howard Johnson's Company in 1979, the restaurants have not. Because Marriott eliminated all the company-owned restaurants, the owners of the franchised restaurants feared elimination and banded together in 1986 and created \"Franchise Associates Incorporated\" or (FAI). In 1986, Marriott gave FAI the rights to operate and maintain Howard Johnson's restaurants. When [[Cendant]] acquired the Howard Johnson's motor lodges, they offered to work together with FAI to ensure the expansion of the restaurant chain.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nAs early as 1987, FAI chairman George Carter acknowledged that \"We have the concept, but it desperately needs to be modernized, internally and externally. Howard Johnson was allowed to become tired and stale. We must get rid of that plastic image... Anything can be salvageable if a great deal of time and money and effort is put in it.

By March 1995, FAI's official restaurant directory listed 84 remaining restaurants in the US and Canada.\n\nWhile the Howard Johnson's restaurant chain was preserved, FAI did not have enough money to expand to new locations or revamp the brand. With the exception of one Howard Johnson's ice cream parlor in [[Puerto Rico]], FAI never opened a new restaurant or expanded the chain. An existing restaurant in [[Canton, Massachusetts]] was remodeled as a [[prototype]] for a new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants, but the concept failed, and after less than a decade of operation, the prototype restaurant closed in 2000.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===2000s===\nBy 2005, there were fewer than eight surviving restaurants. A combination of no vision, no reinvestment of capital, aging restaurants, a stale menu, lack of marketing or new ideas, and competition from other chains had taken their toll; restaurants were closing their doors.<ref>{{cite news\n| author                = Clarke Canfield\n| date                  = May 14, 2005\n| year                  = \n| title                 = HoJo restaurants fading fast\n|trans-title=| url                   = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7864772/ns/business/t/hojo-restaurants-fading-fast/ <!--\n| url1                  = http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/may/16/howard-johnsons-restaurant-chain-slowly-melting-aw/\n| url2                  = http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050514/news_1b14hojo.html\n| url3                  = http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2005/05/16/in_chains_twilight_a_few_hojos_hang_on/ -->\n| department            = \n| newspaper             = \n| type                  = \n| series                = \n| language              = \n| volume                = \n| issue                 = \n| others                = \n| edition               = \n| location              = Bangor, Maine\n| publisher             = \n| publication-date      = \n| agency                = Associated Press\n| page                  = \n| pages                 = \n| accessdate            = \n| via                   = \n| registration          = \n| subscription          = \n| layurl                = \n| laysource             = \n| laydate               = \n| quote                 = \n| separator             = \n| postscript            = \n| ref                   = \n}}</ref> FAI ceased operations in 2005, the same year that the [[Springfield, Vermont]], location and the last [[New York City]] restaurant in the chain closed.\n\nCendant acquired the rights to operate and maintain the remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants.

Versions for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] were also released. The player assumes control of the Granvia, a submarine tasked with overthrowing the Dark Anarchy Society before they activate their doomsday device. Gameplay involves shooting enemies, collecting power-up items, and avoiding collision with projectiles. It ran on the [[Irem M-92]] hardware.\n\nThe game was conceived by Kazuma Kujo, and designed by the same group of people that later went on to found [[Nazca Corporation]], the creators of the ''[[Metal Slug]]'' series. Kujo was inspired to create a water-based shooter, with player-dependent scrolling and simultaneous multiplayer being its main focus. The overall concept of submarine warfare was inspired by Kujo's leisure with a water fountain. ''In the Hunt'' was met with mixed reception from critics since its initial release, specifically the home conversions; common complaints were towards the lack of innovation and slowdown, although it was praised for its detailed graphics and gameplay.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC In the Hunt (Kaitei Daisens\u014d).png|thumb|left|The Granvia fighting Cave Man, the game's first boss (arcade version).]]\n''In the Hunt'' is an underwater-themed scrolling shoot 'em up game similar to ''[[R-Type]]'' where players assume the role of pilots Rei Takahara (1P) and Jin Takahara (2P) taking control of the Granvia submarines through six increasingly difficult stages in an effort to destroy the doomsday device \"Yugusuky\u016bre\" and overthrow the reigning D.A.S organization as the main objective.<ref name=\"C+20\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=6891&album=oui|title=Arcade \u2013 In the Hunt|magazine=[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]|issue=20|publisher=[[:fr: M.E.R.7|M.E.R.7]]|date=May 1993|pages=152\u2013153|lang=fr|access-date=2020-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822113034/http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=6891&album=oui|archive-date=2018-08-22|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ITHPSmanual\">''In the Hunt'' manual (PlayStation, US)</ref><ref name=\"ITHSSATmanual\">''In the Hunt'' manual (Sega Saturn, US)</ref><ref name=\"ITHhg101\">{{cite web|last=Gazza|first=Brian|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/irem/irem.htm|title=Irem Post-Apocalyptic Arcade Games - In The Hunt / Kaitei Daisensou|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=26 May 2006|access-date=2020-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719020212/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/irem/irem.htm|archive-date=2009-07-19|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GCkd\"/> As far as scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard; Players control their craft over the background and the scenery never stops until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] is reached.

Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's firepower to its original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine. Unlike previous shoot 'em ups titles at the time, there are no additional loops after completing the last stage. There are also multiple endings by meeting certain conditions during gameplay.<ref name=\"KDshmup0\">{{cite web|author=blackoak|url=http://shmuplations.com/rtypefinal/|title=2003 R-Type Final Interview|website=shmuplations.com|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot summary of ''In the Hunt'' is explained further through supplementary materials.<ref name=\"ITHPSmanual\"/><ref name=\"ITHSSATmanual\"/><ref name=\"GCkd\">{{cite book|last=Natsumoto|first=Masato|title=\u6d77\u5e95\u5927\u6226\u4e89|work=[[Gamest|Gamest Comics]]|volume=38|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=25 March 1995|pages=1\u2013244|language=ja|isbn=978-4881991541}}</ref> An organization known as the D.A.S. (Dark Anarchy Society) uses magnetic doomsday machines to melt the polar ice caps and thus desolate the world. Although the entire world is flooded, a few societies survive to build over the highest structures they can find and continue living. In this post-apocalyptic scenario, the D.A.S., who were prepared for this catastrophe, reign supreme over the survivors with martial law and military weapons of extraordinary power. Upon learning of a new D.A.S. superweapon being developed, \"Yugusuky\u016bre\", the remaining survivors who are terrorized by D.A.S. secretly organize a rebellion force using a newly developed submarine known as the Granvia piloted by Rei and Jin Takahara.

The controls are sluggish but mostly accurate. This sub floats above other PlayStation shooters like ''[[RayForce|Galactic Attack]]'' [sic - ''Galactic Attack'' was released for the Saturn, not the PlayStation] and ''[[Jupiter Strike]]''.\"<ref name=\"GProPSith\"/> ''Maximum'' expressed enthusiasm for \"little innovations\" like the mine powerups and the King Canute boss, but nonetheless concluded the game to be \"an all-too familiar mission.\" They also criticized that the game is too easy, short, and lacking in replay value,<ref name=\"MaximumPSith\"/> all criticisms that were shared by one of EGM's reviewers.<ref name=\"EGMPSith\"/> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' actually praised the game for having some mild slowdown, saying that it reflects the phenomenally high level of action going on. However, he generally panned the game for the slow movement of the player's submarine, and concluded that \"while very young gamers might enjoy the lightshow, the lethargic tempo and lack of originality are sure to put anyone over the age of 10 to sleep.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSith\"/>\n\n''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' described the game as unoriginal and outdated, but enjoyable, with a strong sense of tongue-in-cheek humor and ingeniously designed boss fights. They concluded, \"Nothing particularly new or exciting here, but ''In the Hunt'' is good fun to play, featuring loads of exciting battles and explosions.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSATith\"/> Scary Larry of ''GamePro'' found the Saturn version does not hold up well to either the PlayStation version or recent Saturn shooters such as ''[[Panzer Dragoon II]]'' and ''[[Darius Gaiden]]'', particularly due to its frequent slowdown. He nonetheless concluded it to be \"a great rental\" and \"a good buy if you're feeling nostalgic.\"<ref name=\"GProSSATith\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8184 ''In the Hunt''] at [[Killer List of Videogames]]\n\n{{Portal bar|1990s|Japan|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:In The Hunt}}\n[[Category:1993 video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Cooperative video games]]\n[[Category:Imagineer games]]\n[[Category:Irem games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Post-apocalyptic video games]]\n[[Category:Scrolling shooters]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:SIMS games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female protagonists]]\n[[Category:Video games with alternate endings]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title         = In the Hunt\n|image         = In the Hunt arcade flyer.jpg\n|caption       = North American Arcade flyer\n|developer     = [[Irem]]\n|publisher     = Irem\n|designer      = Kazuma Kujo \n|platforms     = [[Arcade game|Arcade]]\n|released      = {{vgrelease|WW|April [[1993 in video gaming|1993]]}}\n|genre         = [[Scrolling shooter]]\n|modes         = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n|cabinet       = Upright\n|arcade system = [[Irem M-92]]\n}}\n\n'''''In the Hunt'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Undersea War'''''|\u6d77\u5e95\u5927\u6226\u4e89|''Kaitei Daisens\u014d''||lead=yes}}}} is a [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] [[shoot'em up|horizontal-scrolling shooter]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Irem]]. Versions for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] were also released. The player assumes control of the Granvia, a submarine tasked with overthrowing the Dark Anarchy Society before they activate their doomsday device. Gameplay involves shooting enemies, collecting power-up items, and avoiding collision with projectiles. It ran on the [[Irem M-92]] hardware.\n\nThe game was conceived by Kazuma Kujo, and designed by the same group of people that later went on to found [[Nazca Corporation]], the creators of the ''[[Metal Slug]]'' series. Kujo was inspired to create a water-based shooter, with player-dependent scrolling and simultaneous multiplayer being its main focus. The overall concept of submarine warfare was inspired by Kujo's leisure with a water fountain. ''In the Hunt'' was met with mixed reception from critics since its initial release, specifically the home conversions; common complaints were towards the lack of innovation and slowdown, although it was praised for its detailed graphics and gameplay.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC In the Hunt (Kaitei Daisens\u014d).png|thumb|left|The Granvia fighting Cave Man, the game's first boss (arcade version).]]\n''In the Hunt'' is an underwater-themed scrolling shoot 'em up game similar to ''[[R-Type]]'' where players assume the role of pilots Rei Takahara (1P) and Jin Takahara (2P) taking control of the Granvia submarines through six increasingly difficult stages in an effort to destroy the doomsday device \"Yugusuky\u016bre\" and overthrow the reigning D.A.S organization as the main objective.<ref name=\"C+20\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=6891&album=oui|title=Arcade \u2013 In the Hunt|magazine=[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]|issue=20|publisher=[[:fr: M.E.R.7|M.E.R.7]]|date=May 1993|pages=152\u2013153|lang=fr|access-date=2020-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822113034/http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=6891&album=oui|archive-date=2018-08-22|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ITHPSmanual\">''In the Hunt'' manual (PlayStation, US)</ref><ref name=\"ITHSSATmanual\">''In the Hunt'' manual (Sega Saturn, US)</ref><ref name=\"ITHhg101\">{{cite web|last=Gazza|first=Brian|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/irem/irem.htm|title=Irem Post-Apocalyptic Arcade Games - In The Hunt / Kaitei Daisensou|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=26 May 2006|access-date=2020-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719020212/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/irem/irem.htm|archive-date=2009-07-19|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GCkd\"/> As far as scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard; Players control their craft over the background and the scenery never stops until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] is reached. Players also have only three weapons at their disposal: torpedoes and missiles that travels a max distance of the screen's length, as well as naval mines capable of obliterating any enemy caught within their blast radius.<ref name=\"ITHPSmanual\"/><ref name=\"ITHSSATmanual\"/>\n\nA notable gameplay feature is the progression system, as players move throughout the stages at their own pace instead of being forced to do so.<ref name=\"ITHhg101\"/> Other notable features is the scenery not being harmful for players to come in direct contact and the ability to counterattack certain enemy projectiles.<ref name=\"ITHhg101\"/> Players strengthen the Granvia's abilities via [[power-up]]s for both frontal and upward guns.<ref name=\"ITHhg101\"/><ref name=\"ITHPSmanual\"/><ref name=\"ITHSSATmanual\"/> There are multiple scoring methods for reaching high-scores to obtain [[Life (gaming)#Extra lives|extra lives]] in the game apart from destroying enemies and [[setpiece]]s such as collecting red star-shaped orbs scattered across stages.<ref name=\"ITHPSmanual\"/><ref name=\"ITHSSATmanual\"/>\n\nThe game employs a [[respawn]] system where in which a downed single player will start off immediately at the location they died at. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's firepower to its original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine. Unlike previous shoot 'em ups titles at the time, there are no additional loops after completing the last stage. There are also multiple endings by meeting certain conditions during gameplay.<ref name=\"KDshmup0\">{{cite web|author=blackoak|url=http://shmuplations.com/rtypefinal/|title=2003 R-Type Final Interview|website=shmuplations.com|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot summary of ''In the Hunt'' is explained further through supplementary materials.<ref name=\"ITHPSmanual\"/><ref name=\"ITHSSATmanual\"/><ref name=\"GCkd\">{{cite book|last=Natsumoto|first=Masato|title=\u6d77\u5e95\u5927\u6226\u4e89|work=[[Gamest|Gamest Comics]]|volume=38|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=25 March 1995|pages=1\u2013244|language=ja|isbn=978-4881991541}}</ref> An organization known as the D.A.S. (Dark Anarchy Society) uses magnetic doomsday machines to melt the polar ice caps and thus desolate the world. Although the entire world is flooded, a few societies survive to build over the highest structures they can find and continue living. In this post-apocalyptic scenario, the D.A.S., who were prepared for this catastrophe, reign supreme over the survivors with martial law and military weapons of extraordinary power. Upon learning of a new D.A.S. superweapon being developed, \"Yugusuky\u016bre\", the remaining survivors who are terrorized by D.A.S. secretly organize a rebellion force using a newly developed submarine known as the Granvia piloted by Rei and Jin Takahara.

The controls are sluggish but mostly accurate. This sub floats above other PlayStation shooters like ''[[RayForce|Galactic Attack]]'' [sic - ''Galactic Attack'' was released for the Saturn, not the PlayStation] and ''[[Jupiter Strike]]''.\"<ref name=\"GProPSith\"/> ''Maximum'' expressed enthusiasm for \"little innovations\" like the mine powerups and the King Canute boss, but nonetheless concluded the game to be \"an all-too familiar mission.\" They also criticized that the game is too easy, short, and lacking in replay value,<ref name=\"MaximumPSith\"/> all criticisms that were shared by one of EGM's reviewers.<ref name=\"EGMPSith\"/> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' actually praised the game for having some mild slowdown, saying that it reflects the phenomenally high level of action going on. However, he generally panned the game for the slow movement of the player's submarine, and concluded that \"while very young gamers might enjoy the lightshow, the lethargic tempo and lack of originality are sure to put anyone over the age of 10 to sleep.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSith\"/>\n\n''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' described the game as unoriginal and outdated, but enjoyable, with a strong sense of tongue-in-cheek humor and ingeniously designed boss fights. They concluded, \"Nothing particularly new or exciting here, but ''In the Hunt'' is good fun to play, featuring loads of exciting battles and explosions.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSATith\"/> Scary Larry of ''GamePro'' found the Saturn version does not hold up well to either the PlayStation version or recent Saturn shooters such as ''[[Panzer Dragoon II]]'' and ''[[Darius Gaiden]]'', particularly due to its frequent slowdown. He nonetheless concluded it to be \"a great rental\" and \"a good buy if you're feeling nostalgic.\"<ref name=\"GProSSATith\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8184 ''In the Hunt''] at [[Killer List of Videogames]]\n\n{{Portal bar|1990s|Japan|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:In The Hunt}}\n[[Category:1993 video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Cooperative video games]]\n[[Category:Imagineer games]]\n[[Category:Irem games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Post-apocalyptic video games]]\n[[Category:Scrolling shooters]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:SIMS games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female protagonists]]\n[[Category:Video games with alternate endings]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDevelopment and release", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Hunt"}
